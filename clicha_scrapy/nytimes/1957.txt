57-> Screen: Genuinely Reverent Report; 'Albert Schweitzer' Shown at Guild Documentary Reveals Extraordinary Life Evolution of a Saint
THE life of Dr. Albert Schweitzer has been such an extraordinary one that we could hardly expect all facets of it to be revealed in an eighty-minute documentary film. But certainly the over-all pattern of human service and Christian example in the career of this great scholar, musician and physician is warmly illuminated in the color film, "Albert Schweitzer," which opened last night at the Guild.Proceeds from the première and all profits from the film's exhibition will be for the benefit of the famous hospital that Dr. Schweitzer operates in French Equatorial Africa.The venerable doctor himself is a participant in much of the film, which was photographed by Erica Anderson under the direction of Jerome Hill. Particularly is he in evidence in the latter half, given over to a fine account of a day at the Schweitzer hospital in the jungle village of Lambaréné.A touching pictorial report is given of a visit by the aging doctor to the Alsatian village of Gunsbach, where he was reared as a boy, and a subsequent documentary flashback on the formative influences on the growth of the youth and the man. The film then takes up a detailed description of the jungle hospital, its physical layout and its African patients. This is the heart of it.For it is in the candid views of Dr. Schweitzer and his small staff of dedicated Europeans working patiently with ailing natives—the piteous lepers, the aged and infirm—that the magnitude of his simple motto, "reverence for life," is most movingly conveyed.Contrary to the general impression, Dr. Schweitzer's hospital is not a handsome, modern institution but a cluster of small buildings and primitive huts, crowded with nondescript patients in a fashion that appears indifferent to hygiene. This state is explained as consistent with the necessity of maintaining routines as near to the normal ways of life to the natives as is medically feasible. But vividly manifest is "the brotherhood of those who bear the mark of Cain." The gentle presence of the quiet old doctor among these people bespeaks his belief: "There are claims on his heart."In the earlier phases of the picture, Mr. Hill and Miss Anderson, who made an excellent short about Grandma Moses a couple of years ago, reconstruct the early life of Dr. Schweitzer in the familiar documentary way of showing the buildings and places that were significant, while narration conveys the line of thought.They have also used Dr. Schweitzer's grandson and his sister to re-enact little episodes of particular importance in which Dr. Schweitzer, as a boy, and his mother were involved. And in the opening sequences of Dr. Schweitzer's return to his old home, they have him playing Bach's Prelude in D major on the organ of the village church.There is in these phases of the picture a reflective, poetic quality that prepares the viewer to appreciate the contrast that occurred in Dr. Schweitzer's career when he forsook the atmosphere of the study for the hard realities of his jungle hospital. The deeper psychological motivation of the humanitarian may not be clear, but the force of his philosophical convictions is potently put across in this film.The personal narrative, written by Dr. Schweitzer himself, is spoken earnestly and beautifully by Fredric March. The commentary, written by Thomas Bruce Morgan, is spoken by Burgess Meredith. The musical score by Alec Wilder is tasteful and eloquent.While the color tends to be uneven—a peril in filming a picture such as this—it betokens the spontaneity, simplicity and sincerity of a genuinely reverent report. ALBERT SCHWEITZER, a biographical documentary feature produced and directed by Jerome Hill and filmed by Erica Anderson at Gunsbach, France, and Lambarene.

At the Guild Theatre.Albert Schweitzer as a boy . . . . . Phillip EckartAlbert Schweitzer's mother . . . . . Mrs. Adele Woytt"MARGARET OF CORTONA" traces the evolution of a saint, a young thirteenth-century commoner whose virtue overcame fiendish human opposition. Produced by Scalera-Secolo Films in Italy, with a large cast and a lavish array of costumes and sets, this Crown Pictures release arrived Saturday at the Cameo.It is a plodding, old-fashioned movie pageant, crammed with enough cloak-and-dagger intrigue and mayhem to fill out four such projects. The colorful, spacious period riggings are perfectly complemented by the florid conventionality of the music. Directed by Mario Bonnard and generally acted in like fashion, the picture gallops ponderously to a lofty conclusion as the heroine enters a nunnery.What sticks in the viewer's mind, and sustains the film's spiritual sincerity, is the exquisite, haunting face of Maria Frau in the title role. Small wonder that her dignified goodness in a mare's nest of villainy and persecution later drew a canonization.Beginning with her stepmother, her father and his cuckold, Signorina Frau, as a household slavey, is shamelessly abused. Soon a small army of persecutors, royal and peasant, hounds her across Italy, until her healing powers still a plague-ridden lynch mob. And the mounting crescendo of the shrill, fantastic charges against her—greed, adultery, murder and witchcraft—is enough to make anyone's blood run cold.Signorina Frau is entirely innocent, and one look at her should have been sufficient evidence. Indirectly, the picture is a chilling treatise on human self-deception and an awful reminder that man belongs to the animal kingdom.As her protective (and murdered) fiancé, and someone who does take a good look, Aldo Nicodemi is a relief from the rest of the tormenting pursuers. But the best and most fluent performance comes from Isa Pola, as, oddly enough, her stepmother, the chief intigator of Signorina Frau's misery. Now here is a real artist.This old-fashioned, cumbersome and erratic tribute to saintly innocence can't hold a candle to the professionalism of Hollywood's "The Song of Bernadette." But Signorina Frau's countenance, with its aura of purity, is certainly one to remember.

132-> Screen: 'The Great Man'
JOSE FERRER and Al Morgan have derived from the latter's book, "The Great Man," a smashingly brutal and generally absorbing expose of a piece of deception and hypocrisy within the radio industry. Written by them and directed and played by Mr. Ferrer, it is the New Year's first flash of cynicism. It opened at the Sutton yesterday.Maybe you have some recollection of Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane." Well, this will remind you of it, especially as it begins. With a witheringly sharp-focus camera and a hard-boiled-reporter approach, cued by a personal narration that is laced with sophisticated slang, Mr. Ferrer, as a radio talker, takes out to "find the story behind" a phenomenally popular air artist, just killed in an accident. The information, gathered from "loved ones," associates and fans, is to be used to develop a mammoth, one-hour, nationwide memorial program.This, you can see, is very similar to the beginning of "Citizen Kane." And so are initial developments, as the reporter detects that the deceased was not a saint. From the dead man's press agent, business manager, employer and ex-girl friend, he discovers that this nationally worshiped "idol" of the airwaves was strictly a heel. This verbally imparted exposition leaves our man mildly amazed.But the thing that really disturbs him is the accumulating indication that his radio sponsors are cold-bloodedly determined to perpetuate the tawdry myth of the "great man." Knowing, as he does, the dark truth, they still mean to go ahead—and even fake a great deal—with a monstrously mawkish memorial program.Here this picture parts company from "Citizen Kane."Whereas the latter was strictly concerned with the life of the deceased—a study made with numerous flash-backs upon the activities of the man—this one is actually concerned with the shrewd finagling of those who are alive. It becomes a study of the reporter's personal conflict with a gang of mercenary hypocrites.As such, it is wickedly reflective of a commercial and social attitude that is sometimes held by cynics to be typical of "Madison Avenue." The principal exponent of it is the ex-manager of the "great man," an operator trying to get back into business. He is stingingly played by Keenan Wynn.There is no let-up in the scheming and ruthlessness of this man. Mr. Wynn makes him a rascal without feeling, honesty or shame. He is almost unendurable in his brazen treachery. He is the key conniver, the reflection and extenuation of the "great man."But Dean Jagger as the head of a broadcasting company is also a fine specimen of a cold fish, and Jim Backus, Russ Morgan and Vicki Dugan are good as assorted underlings. Mr. Ferrer is passive, for the most part, as the tired reporter through whom the information sifts, but Joanne Gilbert is pert and flip as his Girl Friday and Julie London is fine as the dead man's ex-girl friend.Excellent, too, in a brief role is that grand old comedian, Ed Wynn. He is human and droll as the Babbitty owner of a small radio station who gave the deceased his first job.Unfortunately, the climax of the whole thing is unlikely and illogical. It blunts the sharp point of the searching survey. But that sometimes happens with these movie exposes.The production by Universal has a lean, realistic quality. The CastTHE GREAT MAN, screen play by Al Morgan and Jose Ferrer, from the novel by Mr. Morgan; directed by Mr. Ferrer and produced by Aaron Rosenberg for Universal-International.

491-> Sergeant Friday Plays a Drill Instructor
JACK WEBB, best known as Sergeant Friday on television's "Dragnet," is the star, director and producer of "The D. I.," all about a tough, dedicated and extremely loud Marine drill instructor on Parris Island. The picture has Mr. Webb every minute of the way, his fans will be delighted to know. And as the most earsplitting entertainment at the Paramount since that historical rock 'n' roll stage revue, it also has volume. Some spectators will cringe. Nobody will nap.As penned by James Lee Barrett for Mr. Webb's enterprising Mark VII unit, this Warners release bears no relation to the controversial "death march" of recent headlines. Against a colorfully detailed background of mercilessly thorough regimentation, the slender plot shows how an apparently soulless top-kick scaldingly molds a confused recruit into a crack Marine. As final proof that the sergeant's bark is worse than his bite, our hero (the sarge) also seals a sideline romance with a nice shop girl.The handful of basic relationships examined here are certainly familiar, even with such telling lines as "there must be a man underneath that baby powder." Nevertheless, Mr. Webb has staged a pounding, graphic tribute to the Marine training method, from sun-up to sundown, from the barracks into the field. The tempo and drive of these scenes, some of which may chill civilian blood, is further enhanced by excellent photography (Edward Colman) and a lashing, if rather conventional, musical score (David Buttolph).Furthermore, as was the case in Mr. Webb's two previous features, the supporting players are dandy, when given a chance. In addition to authentic bits by a whole slew of actual Marines, notably Cpl. John R. Brown, there are Don Dubbins, as the problem youngster; Jackie Loughery, as the attractive sympathizer of the sergeant; Lin McCarthy, as his commanding officer, and Virginia Gregg, as a visiting mother.However, with the stage thus set for an interesting off-beat drama, the star takes over and confines it to a rather one-dimensional close-up of a fairly monotonous fellow. As the sergeant, Mr. Webb struts around, squinting blandly, growling and, most of the time, bellowing at the top of his lungs. One viewer, risking the wrath of the actor's fans, still wishes Mr. Webb had never ventured beyond his strictly secondary excellence as the paraplegic in "The Men" or as Bill Holden's pal in "Sunset Boulevard."The Marines landed yesterday at the Paramount. But the star of "The D. I." landed well ahead of them, and he deafeningly refused to budge. The CastTHE D. I., screen play by James Lee Barrett; directed and produced by Jack Webb for Mark VII Productions; presented by Warner Brothers. At the Paramount.T/Sgt. Jim Moore . . . . .

862-> Screen: Smuggling Saga; Flight to Hong Kong' Opens at Central
ONE thing is to be said for "Flight to Hong Kong," an otherwise routine little smuggling melodrama that opened yesterday at the Central Theatre. It steps on the gas.Somebody has planked a determined foot on the accelerator of this United Artists vehicle, featuring Rory Calhoun, Dolores Donlon and Barbara Rush and some corking good Oriental backgrounds. Actually, the vehicle is an old one, and as full of holes as a Tin Lizzie. And also, on about the same scale, just as colorful.Credit for this speed and flying scenery and color must go primarily to the scenarists, Leo Townsend and Edward G. O'Callaghan. In describing how a young kingpin of an international diamond-snatching syndicate outwits some double-crossing colleagues, they dispatch Mr. Calhoun over a large portion of the globe. And Mr. Calhoun outruns everybody, excluding two panting, smitten ladies.As directed (with little imagination) and produced by Joseph M. Newman, however, the picture is a disturbingly shaky demonstration that crime doesn't pay. Taken into custody at the fade-out, Mr. Calhoun shrugs and grins — and small wonder.As the favored scout and liaison operator for a fantastically organized syndicate, he breezily mingles with some Occidentals whose appearance, lingo and offices seem more like Wall Street. He is also tugged over by his nice, rather dumb, mistress, as played by Miss Donlon, and an anything-but-dumb novelist, Miss Rush. And for some reason, this bland, spoiled aggressor is mothered by an interesting Chinese lady, Soo Yong.Most of the time, fortunately, some familiar skulduggery within the ranks keeps them all on the move. If the action often becomes absurd, the flying scenery, ranging from San Francisco to Hong Kong and back, is a joy. Most of it looks real, too.One sequence, which really takes the cake, has Mr. Calhoun single-handedly churning through a whole fleet of attacking sampans, demolishing them one by one. Where the devil were the police? Or is that why our hero keeps grinning? The CastFLIGHT TO HONG KONG, scenario by Leo Townsend and Edward G. O'Callaghan, adapted from a story by Gustave Field and Mr. O'Callaghan; directed and produced by Joseph M. Newman and released through United Artists. At the Central.Tony Dumont . . . . .
