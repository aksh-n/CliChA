To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: In your issue of the 4th inst., your Albany Correspondent, in his report of the proceedings before the New-York Delegation does me great injustice. The facts, as they existed in regard to myself, are these:

338-> LATEST REPORTS.
FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT AT LIVERPOOL. A dispatch from Vienna on the 20th--not dated from Bucharest--says that the Russians have taken seven Turkish ships. (Doubtful.) The Russians are bombarding Rutschuck from Guirgevo. (This last is believed to be authentic.)

344-> Havana Markets.
SUGARS-Have been in steady demand since our last report of 26th ult., and we can hardly point out any change in prices. The demand, as already noted in our previous numbers, has principally been for Cucuruchos and Browns and for Florete Yellows, leaving other sorts almost neglected. Supplies from the interior are on the decrease and being exceeded by Exports, our Stock is gradually diminishing.

345-> LONG-ISLAND.
MEETING OF THE EXEMPT FIREMEN.--An adjourned mecting of the Exempt Firemen's Association of Brooklyn was held on Friday evening in the City Hall. DANIEL VOORHIES, Esq., presided, and THOMAS R.

--------
346-> Mr. Ullmann's Birthplace.
We have received a great number of communications concerning the vexed question of Mr. ULLMANN's birthplace. We must decline publishing them, partly because none of them throw any light whatever on the subject, and partly because we probably fail to appreciate at its true value the importance of this great question as an issue in the pending canvass. It is true

NIBLO'S GARDEN.--The "BATEMAN Children" are still here, but we are sorry to say they do not attract the audiences their merit's deserve. Last evening a new drama in three acts, called "Young America," was repeated for the second time. It is founded on the Hague street incident--..

Isaac Wherter Smith vs. Nahum Allen, et al.--In this case the Jury brought in their verdict, at the opening of Court this morning, in favor of the defendants. 
--------
350-> Rev. Doctor Wolff.
There are some people who maintain the Wandering Jew to be a myth--I believe the contrary--that he exists among us, and that he is known to men as Dr. WOLFF. I hope Hon. Mrs. NORTON will make a note of this. It is a fact of which she ought to be aware, as should Dr. CROLY, and especially DUMAS, otherwise his wondrous tale will be incomplete.

351-> Etiquette versus Humanity--The Wounded on the Battle-field.
In the WELLINGTON dispatches are frequent complaints of the indifferent manner in which, during the Peninsular War of 1808-14, the British Government provided surgical assistance for the troops who were engaged in contest with the forces of NAPOLEON.

352-> Rooms Wanted in the New City Hall.
To night again the special order before the Councilmen is the report of the Committee on the New City Hall and the plan by them submitted.

To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: SIR: In your issue of to-day, a suggestion is made by F. L. O., that the steam whistle should be employed on ocean steamers in thick weather, not only to give warning of their approach, but also of the course they are steering.

356-> The ?? Duets.
A London correspondent refers to the re cent duels of SOULE, father and son, in Spain, in the following terms: You have perhaps been informed through a different channel of the duel which has taken place at Madrid, between the Marquis de TURGOT, the French Ambassador, and Mr. SOULE, the American Minister to the Spanish Court.

357-> KANSAS.; Jomney to Kansas--The Scenery of the Missouri River--Bad Management of the Emigrant Aid Society--Prospects of Slavery there.
To a man familliar with the scenery of the Eastern States, that of the Missouri River is the most dismal possible. The entire length, from the mouth to the line of Kansas Territory, is bordered with low sandy shores, thinly covered with a young growth of cottonwood; varied occasionally by bluffs on one side, but never on loth tides at the same point.

358-> GENERAL DANIEL MORGAN.; His Personal Traits and Dwelling-place.
To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: In the valley of the Shenandoah, not far from the little village of Millwood, and within an hour's ride of that Greenway Court lately discoursed of, stands an old Revolutionary edifice, which attracts the attention of all who pass by it. A road winding pleasantly over little hillocks, and crossing a lucid stream which meanders through a grassy meadow, leads you to the old building.

From the Danube we hear once more of the appearance of the Allies on Wallachian territory; but this is a story as often told as of the Austrian "active interference," which is yet to happen. We are to have now Bashi-Bozouks fighting with the English for pay, and under English officers.

To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: A national vanity, founded on just and adequate claims, may be entitled to indulgence, but the startling assertions contained in your article entitled "Great Country," and "Men of America," naturally lead us to contrast the notables of America with those of the Old World.
