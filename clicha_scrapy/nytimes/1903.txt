D., Director of the School of Commerce and Professor of Economic History and Theory in the University of Wisconsin. Pp. 381.
The study of the history of finance would seem to demand a highly cultivated and specialized imagination.

There recently appeared in London a volume entitled "The Failure of Lord Curzon," by an author who signs himself " Twenty-Eight Years in India,'' and bearing the imprint of Fisher Unwin. It is a small book, but it has created a great deal of comment abroad for the simple reason that the title which promises so much to English politicians ends with a promise. 
--------
108-> THREATENING LETTERS.
Just now this community seems to be suffering from an epidemic of attempted blackmail through the medium of threatening letters.

--------
113-> LEO XIII.; The Encyclical Letters of the Late Pontiff and a New Life of the Pope by Dr. R.H. Clarke.*
IT IS WELL to distinguish in Leo XIII. between the man and the Pontiff, ana in the latter further between the ecclesiastic and the statesman.

A RECENT NOVELIST, intent upon adding to the terrors of the civil war time, asserts that during its progress a book with a "Foreword" was published.

To the Editor of The New York Times: Is not the article in THE NEW YORK TIMES, issue of Monday, touching the statistics of church attendance in the Central Park region, somewhat misleading?

--------
141-> NOW FOR YACHT RACING.
The conclusion of the latest series of races for the America's Cup was lame and impotent, as well as foregone. Nevertheless it is hailed by everybody concerned as a relief.

173-> RUSSIFYING FINLAND.

--------
212-> TAMMANY ASSAILS FUSION.
A bad cause poorly served, will be the comment of pretty much every sincere and intelligent voter upon the speeches made by Mr. McCLELLAN and Mr. GROUT in Tammany Hall on Wednesday evening. Both of them attacked the administration of Mr. Low. Mr. GROUT knows very well and has publicly declared that it has been a good administration.

--------
218-> COLOMBIA DEMANDS $25,000,000.
In a private transaction the demand now made upon us by Colombia that we pay her $25,000,000 for the right to build the Panama Canal would be characterized in terms unseemly for use in international communications. It is sufficient to say that this new phase of the canal negotiation imposes upon the President the duty of protecting not only the National interests but the National dignity.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 -- Washington is the Lakewood of the coming McClellan administration.

The meeting at Saratoga this week interests many of the fashionable set, and there have been within the past week quite a number of departures from Newport and other resorts.

--------
233-> THE DANISH WEST INDIES.
The report of the Danish commission sent out to inquire into the condition of the Danish West Indies is held in Denmark, it seems, to justify the rejection by the Legislature of our offer for those dependencies.

471-> IN THE FOOTBALL WORLD; Games Scheduled for To-day by the Principal Elevens. Columbia's First Good Test Will Come with the Williams Game -- Princeton Goes to Providence.
More interesting and less one-sided football contests than those which have taken place so far this season should result from those scheduled for this afternoon.

473-> About the Tender Passion.; LITTLE JOAN.
Women like to write about girls like little Joan, and, if a mere man may judge, women also like to read about such girls.

477-> Notes of the Magazines.
The beautifully colored reproductions of Stokes's wonderful antarctic views would alone make the August Century a memorable number. But in other respects it is an exceedingly interesting magazine.

HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Aug. 27 -- John Raynor, a bay man of this town, is theoretically wanted by the police for wife desertion, but there is considerable doubt in the lay mind whether the police are half so sure they really desire Raynor's company as might appear from a perusal of the warrant against him.

To the Editor of The New York Times: The result of the election in this city, interesting as it is to students of sociology, is even more interesting to the inhabitants of the city as a matter of immediate policy.

--------
502-> OVERHEAD TROLLEYS.
Mr. McDOUGALL HAWKES, to whom as Dock Commissioner the Metropolitan Railway has applied for permission to employ the overhead trolley along West Street, is abundantly justified in refusing even to entertain the application until he is furnished with a technical report, presumably to be submitted to his own expert advisers, setting forth in detail the causes which render operation of an underground trolley along that thoroughfare impracticable, as the corporation alleges it to be.

745-> THE INTERNATIONAL BANK.; It Had a Model Charter -- Power to Do Anything Lawful "Whatsoever, Wheresoever, Whensoever."
The failure a fortnight ago of the International Bank and Trust Company of America, with headquarters here and a chain of nine banks in Mexico, has called to general attention the question of corporation laws in the several States making a specialty of such legislation, and in particular to the case of Delaware, proud mother of a goodly family of promotion offspring, of which the institution mentioned is the one most famous. 
--------
746-> CHURCH OF THE PRESIDENTS.; One Hundredth Anniversary of Famous Washington Society Soon to be Celebrated.

Mr. GROUT'S "friend" who "went to the trouble of looking up the files of the newspapers of the Fall of 1890" in order to write the story of Mr. THEODORE W.

--------
765-> CONNECTING THE BRIDGES.
It will not be denied that such a comprehensive plan for treating the traffic across the East River as Commissioner LINDENTHAL has submitted to the Mayor, and as the Mayor has submitted to the Rapid Transit Commissioners, is very much needed. Hitherto the work of connection has been done piecemeal, every bridge being considered with sole reference to itself and to the particular real estate interests that were importunate for its construction. 
--------
766-> Business Men Whose Offices Serve Also as Their Homes; Twice-Around-the-Clock Tenants Whose Economy Enables Them to Present a Good Front to the World -- Few of Them Thoroughly Enjoy the Experience.
THE man who has his office in his hat has been presented to the public in print repeatedly, but the man who never takes his hat outside of his office is another proposition.

Acting on strictly business principles, race goers at the Sheepshead Bay track yesterday bet through six races, and finished with all the worst of the afternoon's speculation, for only one post favorite managed to get to the winning post first, and that one, Frank Farrell's Nameoki, in the Pansy Stakes, was at a price too short to make amends for the other five choices that were not first.

787-> " ABUSE" OF MR. JEROME.
To the Editor of The New York Times: One of the surprising revelations of the campaign that is hardly as yet begun is that of Mr. Jerome as a whimperer.

--------
796-> HIS BIG NEWS "BEAT"
NEWSPAPER reporters have so many narrow shaves that they learn to love danger. What other men style "heroism" is to them a mere matter-of-fact monotony of drudgery. It is regarded as unprofessional to dodge an assignment, no matter what its difficulties or perils.

The sympathy felt and expressed for the miners in their great struggle in the anthracite region last year to improve their condition, and wherever they have made an effort for higher wages, is not likely to be manifested again very soon in view of their attitude in placing as many obstacles as possible in the way of a full production of coal.

Wall Street has a point of view which is all its own, and also a vocabulary of its own to express it. That vocabulary is a source of continual trouble to the outsider.

Mr. GROUT is the most audacious turncoat that ever troubled the councils of reform politics in this city. Deserters we have had. Causes have been betrayed.

866-> FEW BOATS FOLLOW RACE; Weather and Fear of Seasickness Kept Crowd Away. Practically No Work for the Patrol Fleet -- Cornelius Vanderbilt's Mirage Prominent as Dispatch Boat.
It was a sorry but sympathetic fleet which followed in the wake of the revenue cutter Gresham at the yacht race yesterday.

--------
871-> DOMESTICITY (LIMITED.)
The movement lately started in London by Col. KENNY-HERBERT for the simplification of domestic problems for those who live in apartments has taken a new development.

--------
875-> The Co-operative Infant.; THE MIS-RULE OF THREE.
If three impecunious bachelors suddenly found themselves in possession of an infant under two years old, and the mother of the infant did not within a very brief space rescue the child from their clumsy mercies, we may take it that things would go hard with the young one. In this story an unidentified intant gets into the luggage of three young gentlemen returning from a holiday among the Channel Islands.

--------
881-> THE FULLER ARBITRATION PLAN.
The plan proposed by the George A.

--------
882-> " OCEAN" YACHT RACING.

--------
886-> BLACKMAIL IN TWO ASPECTS.

--------
888-> A HOPELESS DEGENERATE.

Loebenstein of the Cedar Cliff Silk Company, which has offices at 722 Broadway and mills at Paterson, N.J. 
--------
890-> THE SECOND RACE.
The aspiration so commonly expressed that Sir THOMAS LIPTON should win one race is a natural enough desire, in view of the Irish knight's sportsmanlike behavior, and especially his display of the qualities of a cheerful loser, which is in so gratifying contrast to the behavior of his immediate predecessor as a challenger. 
--------

--------
897-> THE BOLL WEEVIL.
The Louisiana convention to discuss the boll weevil and take steps for its immediate control and ultimate suppression in that State seems to have been purposeful and practical. In this respect it compares more than favorably with the convention recently held in Texas for the same purpose. 
--------

ALBANY, N.Y., Nov. 10. -- The Court of Appeals to-day handed down a decision which will seriously affect the business of those who loan money without security upon notes of salaried persons at rates of interest above the legal rate of 6 per cent.

905-> IN SIBERIA.; A Narrative of a Search for Gold Mines in Russian Territory.
It was but natural to suppose, from geological analogies, that the deposits of gold found on the Alaskan Coast would be continuous and passing under the sea, turn up on the Siberian littorai.

918-> MR. CANNON WAS RIGHT.
When Representative JOSEPH G. CANNON said some months ago that there would be no currency legislation there was a general outcry that he ought to be muzzled.

Has the grizzly bear deserved his Latin name "Ursus horribills"? Mr. Allen Kelly is right when he says that the grizzly has been maligned and "that every man's hand has been against him, but seldom has his paw been raised against man except in self-defense." We get a false idea of Ursus when we imagine that he is always to be found "raging through the forest with slavering jaws seeking whom he may devour." 
--------
926-> CAVALRY REMOUNTS.
We were betrayed the other day, by what turned out to be an entirely baseless story of a trooper's ride from Omaghas to West Point, into making some general observations upon cavalry remounts, which we trust were not as unfounded as the fable that served for their text.

--------
948-> NO CURRENCY LEGISLATION.
We suppose that the dictum of the venerable Senator ALLISON of Iowa must be taken as conclusive of the intention of the majority in the Senate to permit no steps toward the improvement of the currency. He sums up the programme practically as it must have been reached by the sub-committee of which he is a member and which has been "studying" the subject during the Summer.

Locomotive company officials are credited with the statsment that orders on hand will keep the works actively engaged for many months to come.

966-> UNSAFE TRAFFIC IN NEW YORK STREETS; Deputy Piper's Views on Past and Present Conditions. Says Police, Cowed Under the Devery System, Were Afraid to Act -- London Methods Needed Here.
A prime reason why street traffic in this city is unsafe is that our police have been cowed.

--------
1253-> MUSIC AND MUSICIANS; MR. GRASSES CONCERT. An Exacting Programme Played by an Artist Entirely Blind.
A concert was given in Carnegie, Hall last evening by Mr. Edwin Grasse that exhibited an altogether remarkable musical talent in a fashion to secure the instant enthusiasm of a very large audience.

Practically the entire list of curb securities traded in yesterday showed net declines for the day, though the declines were only fractional, except in one case. Interborough Rapid Transit declined 3 points on the sale of 200 shares, thus making a total loss for the week of 9 points.

--------
1255-> PUBLIC EXTRAVAGANCES.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I do not feel that I am a" croaker " or a " pessimist," and I imagine that I have plenty of 'company who know that, as individuals and as business corporations, we have been going "too fast," and that vast numbers are now being "brought up with a round turn" because they would not " put on the brakes."

--------
1257-> NO HEARING FOR HIS PLAYS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: An article in your Sunday edition some weeks ago by your dramatic critic to the effect that theatrical managers were bewailing the lack of good plays recalls an experience the writer has had that will either convince your critic that he was grossly misinformed as to the true facts or that theatrical managers as a class are willful perverters of the plain truth.

1258-> FIGHT ON AT COLUMBUS.; Zimmerman and Johnson Contest for Gubernatorial Nomination.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 24. -- The contest between Mayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland and John L. Zimmerman of Springfield for the Democratic Gubernatorial nomination before the State Convention to be held here Wednesday is to-night as much in dispute as over. 
--------
1259-> ART NOTES.
The study of Millet, Rousseau, and Corot which Mr. John La Farge contributes to McClure's for October is particularly interesting because the writer, besides being himself an eminent painter, has a natural sympathy with the phase of modern French art which these three masters represented, and may even be said to have originated.

--------
1271-> THE WEEK'S STERLING MARKET.; A Limited Movement Due to a Balance of Important Influences.
While the net result of the week's operations in exchange shows a pronounced movement in neither direction, the market has nevertheless been subjected to the influence of a number of interesting developments which have been of such a nature as to neutralize one another in their effect on rates of exchange. 
--------
1272-> CHURCH AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
To the Editor of The York Times: The Rev. Dr. Geer's assault upon the public schools of the United States, followed by Cardinal Gibbons and other clerical along the same lines, but for the distinguished men lending the assault, would Lardly call for notice in this public school enlightened age, so ancient seem their ideas and utterly futile their arguments. 
--------
1273-> Article 10 -- No Title
LONDON, Sept. 17 -- Money was in good demand in the market to-day and supplies were restricted. Discounts were maintained.

--------
1276-> IN DEFENSE OF ANARCHY.
The Cooper Union meeting called to protest against the deportation of TURNER the Anarchist was in many ways curious and instructive. One glance into the faces of that audience should have taught the speakers that they were not addressing persons deeply interested in or loyal to American institutions. 
--------
1277-> A "FREE PRESS" IN NORTH CAROLINA.
The disposition of Prof. BASSETT'S case by the Trustees of his college, so creditable to that body, has a comic sequel much less creditable to the North Carolina Editorial Association.

--------
1278-> Mezzotints.
G.P. Putnam's Sons publish this week the first volume on "Mezzotints." (octavo.) in the Connoisseur's Library, edited by Cyril Davenport of the British Museum. This is No. 15 and is by the editor.

One of the newest leather bags is made after the style of the silk opera-glass bags, which are plaited full into metal frames and close with a clasp.

--------
1290-> THROUGH MOROCCO; The Experiences of Two Ladies in the Domain of the Sultan.*
WHY SHOULD Isabel Savory call her amblings through Morocco "In the Tail of the Peacock"? There is an old Arobic saying. "The earth is a peacock -- Morocco is the tail of it." The significance of this we fail to see.

--------
1292-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Thursday's thunder shower gave almost a dozen strong hints that the ancient custom of making flagstaffs out of wood should be abandoned, at least in cities like this one, where the masts used for the elevation of banners of one sort or another are for the most part placed on the roofs of buildings with steel frameworks. 
--------
1293-> Oldfield Beats Automobile Records.; English Cricketers Play Here To-day. Staten Island Tennis Tournament.

--------
1295-> FRENCH MUSIC; Mr. Hervey's Volume in the Series on "Music in the XlXth Centnry."*
MR. HERVEY has carried out in a satisfactory manner the evident purpose of these handbooks on nineteenth century music. He has perhaps not shown quite the ripeness of judgment and critical insight that Mr. Fuller Maitland brought to his treatment of English music, and Mr. Hervey's English style suffers somewhat from influences derived from the country of which he is writing. 
--------
1296-> BUILDING LOAN'S PLAN TO ESCAPE RECEIVER; Shareholders Are Asked to Release One-fifth of Their Claims. Would Be Transferred to Assets of the Banking Corporation Which Has Been Under Fire.

--------
1298-> MORAL VALUE OF PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The proposed appeal to the records of police courts, prisons, and reformatories for an estimate of the moral value of parochial as compared with secular education is obviously unfair to the Roman Church, and even more unfair as a test of the comparative merits of secular and religious education in general. 
--------
1299-> MEASURES SIGNED BY MAYOR.; Trolley Franchise Over Macomb's Dam Bridge and Appropriations for Many City Improvements.
According to The City Record, Mayor Low has affixed his signature to several measures recently passed by the Board of A'dermen which mean important improvements for the city.

1300-> THE WEEK'S TOPICS IN THE BRITISH CAPITAL; Legislators Will Soon Be Able to Leave London -- The Plan to Make India Help Pay for the South African Garrison -- A Brilliant "Cowes Week "-- the Death of Phil May.
LONDON, Aug. 8 -- Only one more week of work remains before Parliament adjourns, and everybody will be heartily glad when the session comes to an end and is followed by at least a partial truce to political warfare. I say partial, because, although Mr. Chamberlain's campaign does not open till the Autumn much irregular fighting by political guerrillas will precede the pitched battles between the protectionist and free trade Generals.

--------
1308-> THE NEWS OF NEWPORT.
NEWPORT, Aug. 20. -- The tennis tournament attracted only a small number of society people to-day, and as the weather promised rain there was not the elaborate display of gowns that had been made on the earlier days of the tournament. In the afternoon after luncheon there were the fox hunt and practice polo, which attracted a fair proportion of the Summer residents, but generally society was quiet. 
--------
1309-> THE FUSION CANDIDATES.
On reflection the Democrats of Mr. SHEEHAN'S organization will perceive, we think, that the matter of deepest concern in this municipal campaign is not the political fortune of an individual, but the success of a cause. They are disappoint- ed at the failure of the Fusion Conven- tion to renominate Mr. CANTOR for the office of President of Manhattan Borough. 
--------

1312-> GEORGE MOORE.; A Collection of Stories Dealing with the Present Condition of Ireland*
ONE can hardly believe that "The Untilled Field" is the work of that George Moore, who, but a few years (or was it months?) ago, joined, with the utmost enthusiasm, the movement to rescue the ancient Erse language from extinction, and was among the most confident that there in, in part at least, lay the hope of Ireland's redemption.

BERLIN, Oct. 6. -- An electric car on the Marlenfelde-Zossen experimental line reached a speed of 125 4-5 miles an hour to-day, or a kilometer more than the highest previous record.

--------
1317-> THIBET.
Thibet is really much more of a "hermit kingdom "than Korea is getting to be, more "out of the movement" than any country can be which has a seacoast and harbors. It is isolated by the mountain ranges which surround it, and of which the chief are the Himalaya, on the south and the Kuen-Lun range on the north. 
--------
1318-> MASS FOR FATHER O'GROWNEY.; His Body Taken on Board the Campania After Funeral Exercises in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

--------
1319-> PURPOSE OF MELODRAMA.
To the Editor of The New York Times: A play that has been crowing the Grand Opera House for the last few days has evoked from certain newspaper critics much sarcasm and derision, because its heroics and its sentiment were not up (or down) to their plane. 
--------
1320-> PLEADS FOR CONSERVATISM.; Marcus M. Marks Says Lack of Confidence Is Only Danger in Business Situation.
Manufacturers and employers of labor all over the country are pleading with the labor unions to go slowly and conservatively while the present scary feeling as to business conditions lasts.

--------
1321-> WITHSTOOD DEMANDS OF GRAFTERS
To the Editor of The New York Times: It is doubtful if it is worth while to give yet another instance of Tammany dishonest methods of government, for surely by now they are pretty well understood. Yet the experience of a dweller on Madison Avenue may be instructive.

With the introduction of moleskin, which is the fad of the season this year, there have been brought out two other low-priced furs of similar appearance, the musk mole and petit gris mole, making three practically new furs, which is a rare occurrence in one Winter.

--------
1324-> GROSS AND NET EARNINGS.; An Encouraging Alteration In the Relation Between Them.
The growing tendency to increase net earnings is more noticeable than ever in this week's reports for September, but the returns are not yet beginning to reflect that decrease in expenses which is expected within a few months.

--------
1325-> TAXATION IN WEST VIRGINIA.

It is proposed to abolish the State and school taxes on all real and personal property and to collect the necessary State revenues by the imposition of special taxes upon certain industries and professions. 
--------
1326-> SUGAR, CUBA, AND CONGRESS.
While the possibility exists that Congress may take such action as shall eventually lead to commercial relations with Cuba whereby something of a beneficial character will accrue to the American Sugar Refining Company, it is only natural to expect the stock of the latter to discount that something, whatever basis it may be calculated upon. 
--------
1327-> PLENTIFUL STOCK OF OYSTERS HERE; Quantity Not Only Larger than Ever, but Quality Greatly Improved.
EXPERT'S declare that the oyster season which was ushered in last week will be the most satisfactory one in several years. The stock is not only more plentiful, but the oysters are In finer condition and more delicious than has been the case for at least six years.

The estimated loss of currency by the local banks during the past week exceeds $15,000,000 and this amount so closely approximates the surplus reserves as shown by last Saturday's bank statement that the question is asked how far the loss in cash will wipe out the reserves held in excess of requirements. 
--------
1329-> New Harper Books.
Among the announcements of Harper  Brothers for their next publication day, Nov. 6, the most notable book in the field of pure literature is Henry James's "The Ambassador," but the list is an unusually long one, and includes also "The Making of a Journalist," the autobiographical account of the late Julian Ralph's life as an active newspaper man, including interesting stories of his experience as a war correspondent.

--------
1332-> MR. JEROME AND MAYOR LOW.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The District Attorney's letter, setting forth in detail the Mayor's alleged limitations, illustrates in a curious way the tendency toward sentimentalism in politics. What we the public -- like in a public mail is a picturesque personality! If, in addition, he happen to be endowed with solid abilities, then Heaven has certainly been very good to us! 
--------

--------
1336-> ANTHRACITE.
Newspaper correspondents in the anthracite mining districts have been industrious of late in predicting a restriction of mining on account of the congestion of the market for coal resulting from the, "current overproduction." Part of this is due to imagination; part of it reflects misinformation; all of it shows ignorance of the condition of the coal market and of the reasons which will account for such restriction of mining as may be seen. 
--------
1337-> Sir Leslie Stephen's Lectures.
Sir Leslie Stephen's Ford Lectures, delivered at Oxford, England, on "English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century," will appear in this country after the holidays.

--------
1338-> POSTMISTRESS TODD AND SENATOR ALLEE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Our imperialism seems to travel fast. In autocratic Russia eminent Finlanders are expelled their country for the crushing "reasons of State.'' but there is a semblance of regard for the arbitrary statute enacted regarding territory forming a more or less integral part of the empire. 
--------
1339-> CALL EX-PRIEST IMPOSTOR; Russian Church Authorities Denounce Father Ustvolsky. Styled Himself "Seraphim, Metropoli- tan of America," and Performed Rites of Baptism, Marriage, and Ordination.
Recent revelations concerning the practices of an ex-Russian priest, Father Stephen Ustvolsky, who, representing himself in New York and Canada as "Seraphim, Metropolitan of America," has ordained young men for the ministry and performed the ceremonies of baptism, confirmation, and marriage, led the Russian Church Government to send out yesterday a condemnation of the ex-priest, in which it is declared that his every act was invalid. 
--------
1340-> DO NOT WANT A RECEIVER.; Minority Stockholders of Compressed Air Co. Oppose Any Appointment.
Minority stockholders of the Compressed Air Company, through counsel, argued yesterday before Judge Lacombe in the United States Circuit Court on an application for a receiver for the company.

--------
1341-> A TURKISH TRAGEDY.; The Life, Work, and Death of Midhat Pasha.

To the Editor of The New York Times: Your correspondent, "W.," whose letter is published in this morning's issue of THE TIMES, certainly hits the nail on the head in regard to Mexican Central income bonds.

--------
1346-> SOME THEATRICAL OBSERVATIONS
GREASE paint and crepe hair, Rouge pots and hare's feet! "These might well be the oaths of the actor if it may be imagined that the players adopt the "sentimental swearing" or the "oath referential" of Bob Acres's militia Major and used with memorable effect by Bob himself. 
--------
1347-> MAYOR LOW'S CANDIDACY.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The question as to the renomination of Mayor Low is being debated by the press of all shades of opinion lately, as it is proper that it should be; and not only the press, but citizens of every shade of politics, wherever they assemble, have something to say on the subject. 
--------
1348-> COURT PUNISHES A UNION; Chicago Press Feeders Fined $1,000 for Violence in Strike. Judge Holdom Points Out That Few Unions Are Incorporated -- Refuses to Impose Nominal Fine.
CHICAGO, Dec. 12.-- For illegal acts as a corporate body $1,000 fine was imposed upon Franklin Union No. 4, Press Feeders, by Judge Holdom to-day.

--------
1352-> BAD MANNERS IN THE TROLLEY CARS
To the Editor of The New York Times: Your indignant correspondent "Belle Shea" made one little mistake in her letter of Aug. 3, which related that recently on a Fort George trolley ear, having got in at Eighteenth Street, she gave her seat at Twenty-eighth Street to a cripple, three men in the same sent not offering either of theirs. 
--------

--------
1355-> POWERS' SUPINENESS BLAMED.; Correspondent of London Times Thinks a Balkan War Will Break Out -- New Austro-Russian Note.
LONDON, Sept. 15. -- The situation has grown distinctly worse, says the Sofia correspondent of The Times. The powers are apparently pursuing the same course as they adopted before the Greco-Turkish war, and the result will probably be the same. They have allowed matters to drift, and now endeavor to find a remedy in useless and irritating admonitions to the Bulgarian Government. 
--------
1356-> WHEN A MAN IS REALLY POOR.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I was interested in an editorial in your issue of Sept. 18 on the question "When Is a Man Rich?" and which seemed to invite correspondence on the subject. No doubt there is as much difference of opinion on this question as there is difference of men- tal development and tastes and material environment among mankind. 
--------
1357-> CREDIT MEN PLAN WORK; Preparing to Move on Congress and Legislatures. Want Postal Laws to Cover False Statements Sent Through the Mails to Secure Credit -- Uniform Exemptions for Debtors.

He absolutely declined to indicate in any way when he will return to the city, and the information obtained last night was that he intends to sail with his family for Australia. 
--------
1359-> RADIUM AND HELIUM.
The announcement of Prof. Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY, in his lecture before the London. Institution, that the element radium is capable of transmutation by the processes of radiation into the element helium, would be the most sensational of recent scientific statements if the facts upon which it appears to be based were not already familiar in the speculations of the chemists and physicists who have studied the fascinating and perplexing phenomena of radio-activity. 
--------
1360-> THE TURNER MASS MEETING.; A Socialist's Defense of Opinions Expressed by Sympathizers with the British "Philosophic Anarchist."
To the Editor of the New York Times: I read in THE TIMES of Saturday last an editorial on the meeting which was held at Cooper Union to protest against the intended deportation of Mr. John Turner. Knowing that you are never averse to the expression of a difference of opinion, and feeling that the other side should also have their innings, I beg your editorial leave to say a word for them. 
--------
1361-> CEREMONIES IN THE VATICAN.; Gorgeous Scene When Cardinal Sarto Assumed the Papal Throne -- Del Val Receives His Red Cap.
ROME, Aug. 4. -- When the newly elected Pope accepted the office and signified his intention to assume the title of Pius X., the Cardinals removed their baldachins, so that Sarto was the only one remaining, thus marking him as their supreme head. The passing supremacy of the Cardinals was gone and was now concentrated in one person. 
--------
1362-> THE FINANCIAL MARKET.; Stocks dull and firm. Call money nominal, 2 1/2 per cent.
Yesterday was a half holiday, preceding a holiday in London on Monday, and Election day here, Tuesday. As the market had been in a deadlock on Friday, there was every reason for expecting a continuance of its comatose condition unless something happened to arouse it, and nothing of that sort occurred. 
--------
1363-> Article 4 -- No Title
LONDON, Aug. 24. -- Money was cheap in the market to-day and discounts were easy. 
--------
1364-> THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DI- RECTORS.
A number of abortive attempts within recent years to hold the Directors of railroad and other public corporations to criminal liability for fatal accidents occurring in the operation of the properties which they manage show that the courts are of opinion that the real nature of the responsibilities of Directors is somewhat different from that fixed by traditional common law and ancient statutes. 
--------
1365-> Milton MS. to be Sold.
Early in March the only extant portion of the original manuscript of John Milton's "Paradise Lost," eighteen pages, small quarto, comprising ,the First Book of the ode, will be sold at auction at Sotheby's, in London. It is not in Milton's autograph, of course, for when "Paradise Lost" was published the poet was blind. 
--------
1366-> BOSTON STOCK MARKET.
BOSTON, Oct. 31. -- The money market is harder than it was even a week ago. The local banks were liberal shippers of currency during the week, but they were well prepared.

--------
1370-> Stories of Newfoundland.; THE WAY OF THE SEA.
This collection of short stories of life as it is regarded and as it is lived by the men and women of the outports of Newfoundland is as instructive as it is interesting. Apart from the annual reports of the Deep Sea Medical Mission little has been given to the world concerning the simple joys and stern sorrows of a people more or less primitive. 
--------
1371-> KENT BOWLERS EFFECTIVE.; Philadelphia Cricketers Disposed of for Low Score in First Inning.

1372-> TRIUMPH FOR THE ARTILLERY; Branch of the Service Which It Has Been Customary to Decry Comes to Its Own at Last -- Duties of the Artillery Officer of To-Day.
FORT PREBLE, Me., Aug. 15. -- Whichever way the joint army and navy manoeuvres result as between the army and navy they will be a distinct triumph for the artillery branch of the service. It has been for time out of mind the general custom to decry this defensive arm and to refer to the artillerymen contemptuously as "red-legged dough boys." 
--------
1373-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
This afternoon will be quite a festive occasion in Westchester County, where, at the Empire City track, the Horse Show will take place. It will bring together at the Westchester people, and many from Long Island and adjacent sections. Col. William Jay and Reginald Rives will be among the judges. 
--------
1374-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.(2)
-- Mr. BRYAN, taking luncheon in the British capital with great lords and statesmen and diplomats, if he has any sense of humor -- which it's doubtful if he has -- must meditate with quiet mirthfulness on the number of the roads to international eminence, and the extreme queerness of the zigzags by which certain of the roads lead there.

--------
1377-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
Stocks higher. Call money easier, 3@5 per cent. Yesterday's stock market upon its surface was the reverse of Thursday's in tone. That is to say, the advance on Friday was not far from the fall on Thursday. But looking below the surface the market is seen to be of the same contracted, professional sort, with the only two rises worth mentioning in the stocks notoriously oversold. 
--------
1378-> NEW TRUNK LINE, PERHAPS; Contractors for Morristown Road Say It Will Reach Chicago. Possibility That the Wabash System Will Use the New Jersey Line to Get to New York.
MONTCLAIR, N. J., Aug. 4. -- The statement was made here to-day by the builders of the railroad now being constucted between Morristown and Caldwell that this road would become part of a "new trunk line between New York and Chicago."

1381-> THE HAZING AT ANNAPOLIS.; Cowardly Cruelty Exhibited by the Upper Classmen Toward the "Plebes."
ANNAPOLIS, Oct. 17 -- "Don't you look at me! Put your eyes somewhere else!" was the sharp command of an indignant officer at the Naval Academy a few days since, in examining an upper classman in relation to the late "running" of the "plebes," giving the midshipman a cup of his own brewing, which he had so often required the fourth classman to drink of. 
--------

--------
1385-> PHILADELPHIA PRICES.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 18. -- Considerable strength was developed in some of the local specialties to-day, because of the report that prominent politico-financial interests who recently had had peaceable relations among them re-established would to-morrow take a yachting trip together. This was taken to mean that some important financial development would result from the trip, but this has been denied, those interested ascribing the trip as a purely social affair. 
--------
1386-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; WALL STREET TOPICS.
Stocks heavy. Call-money nominal, 5@6 per cent. Saturday markets this Fall have been little more than debating societies upon the bank statement, with a price movement contrary to the weight of argument. Yesterday's business was no exception. 
--------
1387-> Article 4 -- No Title
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 27 -- The prolongation of the Russo-Japanese negotiations at Tokio, which have been delayed by Viceroy Alexieff's return to St. Petersburg, is due to the inability to reach an understanding regarding Korea. 
--------
1388-> HARMONY IN BOWLING RANKS.; Western Players Selecting a Committee to Confer with the East on Peace Plans -- Good Results Looked For.
For the first time since the split between the Eastern and Western bowlers at Buffalo two years ago the interests behind the American Bowling Congress in the West have made earnest efforts to harmonize with the Eastern section.

--------
1391-> THE BANK STATEMENT.
The bank statement did not fully reflect the large loss of cash to the interior reported on Friday. The decrease in reserve held was $8,694,800, or about $6,000,000 less than the estimate of the currency movement indicated. A part of the discrepancy is due to the average system, and there was probably a considerable gain in cash from local sources. 
--------

LONDON, Oct. 29. -- An oracular official telegram from Constantinople, says the Vienna correspondent of The Times, announces that Turkey has suspended the demobilization of her troops, but will probably resume it again before long. It is supposed in Vienna that the Sultan, filled with loathing for the Austro-Russian scheme of control, wishes to promote the belief that he will fight rather than yield. 
--------
1400-> Identity of Marston.
The New York Times Saturday Review of Books: On the identity of Marston hinges the question whether Marston was a myth, and the book. "The Memoirs of a Statesman," an incomparable masterpiece of fiction, an historical novel outclassing "Ivanhoe," "Kenilworth," or "The Last of the Burons," or should the identity of Marston be ascertained the book becomes the autubiography of a great statesman and is therefore a most valuable contribution to history.

--------
1444-> ATTACK MAJOR WOODBURY; Merchants Tell Court of the Commissioner's Unkept Promises. Complain Against His Methods in Suit to Compel Him to Remove Ashes from Their Stores.

1449-> LUTHERAN SYNOD'S RESOLUTIONS
To the Editor of The New York Times: I was under the impression that cold, straight-laced Puritanism was dead and that charity and broadmindedness were the ruling influences of to-day.

--------
1450-> THE LONDON MARKET.
LONDON, Nov. 6 -- Money was fairly plentiful in the market to-day, though the considerable amount which was repaid to the Bank of England caused a hardening of rates. Discounts were firmer, owing to the fall in the rate of New York exchange.

--------
1455-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS(2)
Exchange yesterday provides further encouragement for those whose judgment of securities is governed by this factor. Upon the other hand, there was ample proof that the prevailing moments of strength were artificial, and the recurring weakness as well. In other words, the market continues professional, not reflecting independent or settled opinion in either direction. 
--------
1456-> TOPICS OF THE WEEK IN THE BRITISH CAPITAL; Conditions in the Balkans Similar to Those Before the Russo-Turkish War, and It Is Feared a Calamity Is Impending -- Bad Outlook for Chamberlain's Policy -- The Boer War Commission's Revelations.

To the Editor of The New York Times: While it is true that Christmas to thousands in our favored land and time is a season filled to the brim with joy and brightness, yet it is equally true that, unless some early and practical help is brought to many, it will be a season clouded with sorrow and distress. 
--------
1460-> Alexander and Roxana.; ISKANDER. A Romance of the Court of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.
Harking back beyond the velvet-coated heroes of a hundred years ago, beyond the mail-clad knights of the age of chivalry, beyond the lurid days when the Roman Caesars burned Christians for torches, leaving Cleopatro and Antony to futureward, yot not, like Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. Rider Haggard, laying hand upon Homer's Ulysses and his Helen, Mr. Kirkman has found the material for his take in the first of the conquerors of the Western World.

--------
1464-> MAGAZINE NOTES
"An Indictment of the British Monarchy," by an "Anglo-American," In the current number of The North American Review, has the merit of being a readable article. It involves a very good account of the surface facts of modern English life, and its accusations of incompetence against the royal family will anger nobody who reads it. 
--------
1465-> THE PRESIDENT'S STYLE.
As Mr. Roosevelt is the only President of the United States who, before his accession to office, belonged to the guild of professional authors, it is permissible to a review of books to consider how far his literary training and experience have influenced the style of his official productions. 
--------
1466-> FLOATING DELEGATE CAPTURES SHIP'S CREW; Seven Ablebodied Seamen Compelled to Leave Schooner. Vessel Boarded While Lying Off Eliza- bethport -- Twelve Men Assisted in the Kidnapping -- Prosecution Threatened.

Emerson's essay on "Nature" has come forth in a neat volume from a private press up the Hudson. The folios are uncut and the text is on one side of each book-sheet. Although it may have been necessary to extend the work in this way in order to make a volume of respectable thickness, it cannot be denied that it also gives the printer a freer play of pressure. 
--------
1468-> WALL STREET TOPICS.
Character of Market. -- Business on the StocK Exchange yesterday lagged about as much as it had on the earlier days of the week. The exception of course was Steel preferred, but even with the very heavy sales of this stock the total for the day was not greatly in excess of those of Wednesday and Thursday. 
--------
1469-> BELIEVES IN CORNELL CREWS
To the Editor of The New York Times: In answer to the article by "Justitia" in your Issue of June 30, I think some one should tell him that he must not write such things without knowing more about his subject, for he made a very snobbish statement or else is greatly misinformed regarding Cornell boys. 
--------
1470-> HERBERT SPENCER'S PHILOSOPHY.
To the Editor of The New York Times: If in asserting in your article on Herbert Spencer that his philosophy has survived attack you mean only that it has retained its vogue, notwithstanding such attacks as have been considered by those who still adhere to their belief in it, the fact is too nearly self-evident to admit of question. 
--------
1471-> Article 1 -- No Title
LONDON, Aug. 5. -- The London papers this morning comment on the conclave' choice as a wise and excellent one, and say that although the new Pope is less brilliant as a scholar than his predecessor, there will be ample compensation for this in his moderation and single-mindedness on the question of the relations of the Vatican to England. 
--------
1472-> A LITERARY SACRIFICE.; A Philadelphia Printing Company is the Loser by $500,000 in Fire Which Burns Books.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 2. -- The loss of the Avil Printing Company, the establishment of which was destroyed by fire last night, will closely approach $500,000. Investigation to-day showed that the establishment had been completely gutted. 
--------
1473-> MR. LOW TO THE CITY.
We publish for the second time this morning the letter of Mayor Low accepting the Fusion nomination for reelection. It is printed in clear and legible type, that it may easily be read by all. We believe that no citizen of New York can vote intelligently, with a correct notion of how his vote will affect the lasting interests of the city, without having carefully studied this letter. 
--------
1474-> MAGAZINE NOTES.
The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs does not compete with other monthlies. It never tries to be "first in the field." In fact, the November number has just been distributed in this country. But this periodical is worth waiting for. In this number an article on an exhibition of eighteenth century English portraits in Birmingham is illustrated with nine reproductions of paintings by Gainsborough, Hoppner, Raeburn, Reynolds, and Romney. 
--------
1475-> ILL HOTEL GUEST REMOVED.; Appendicitis Patient Leaves Ocean House at Far Rockaway, Despite Her Physician's Protest.

--------
1477-> THE NOISE NUISANCE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: If that excellent, practical man whom Mr. Low was fortunate enough to secure for Secretary should succeed in lessening the volume of needless noise in our city he will have done more lasting good than many of his own and than some of his Honor's predecessors. 
--------
1478-> WORK OF CHILD LABOR LAW.; Big Decrease in Number of Certificates Issued to Children.
ALBANY, Dec. 27. -- Results of the first month's operation of the new child labor law show a decline from 831 to 595, a reduction of 30 per cent. in the number of employment certificates issued to children. The falling off, which is chiefly in New York City, is largely due to the stricter educational requirements now in force. 
--------
1479-> THE PUBLISHERS.; Plans of Some of Them -- Forthcoming New Books.
INQUIRY at D. Appleton  Co.'s has brought forth the fact that Herbert Spencer's autobiography will not appear until late Spring, possibly not until next September. The late philosopher took the same pains in setting right the story of his life that he did in revising his "system." 
--------
1480-> AFTER CANADIAN TRADE; Fur Manufacturers Watching Development in the Northwest. Immense Trade in Fur Coats in Prospect -- An Article of Necessity in the Canadian Climate -- American Trade Statistics.
"The time is coming, and it is not so far off, either," said a large importer of furs the other day, "when our American manufacturers of furs will invade the Canadian market. Many men in the trade agree that this will happen eventually, but I think that it is coming much faster than many of them imagine. 
--------
1481-> PORT CHESTER RAILWAY FRAN- CHISE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The need of the immediate construction of the Port Chester Electrical Railroad was never more practically demonstrated than was shown by the destruction by fire of the power house of the Union Railway Company at New Rochelle last week. 
--------
1482-> PORT CHESTER ROAD PLAN; Aldermen Fail to Act, Although Told They Have the Power. Giant Franchise for Hudson and Man- hattan Tunnel -- To Spend $600 for New Year's Decorations.
