New Jersey shares with Massachusetts the honor of being the pioneer in the good-roads movement in this country.

457-> SOME MOTOR ROUTES IN LAKE CHAMPLAIN SECTION; Good Roads Make Famous Resorts and Camps Around the Lake and in the Adirondacks Easily Accessible to Automobile Tourists.
As a touring section the region embracing Lake Champlain affords the triple attraction of its own beauties and those of the Green Mountains in Vermont on the east and the rugged Adirondacks in northern New York on the west. The proximity of this great lake and mountain region, famous for its hunting, fishing, and camping resorts, to New York City and Boston, only two days' drive by motor, accounts for its great popularity.

459-> NEGRO MUSICIANS HEARD.; Concert of the Music School Settlement for Colored People.
The Music School Settlement for Colored People came before the public last evening in a concert in Carnegie Hall intended to give some illustration of the work of the organization. The Music School Choral Society, the Music School Settlement Glee Club, the New Amsterdam Orchestra, and several soloists, vocal and instrumental, took part. After the first part of the program Charles W. Anderson, the colored ex-Collector of Internal Revenue in one of the New York districts, made a speech in which he described the aims and objects of the Settlement as being, through music, to contribute toward better citizenship, to give the idea of the dignity of service, and to uplift the lives of the people who come under its influence.The most ambitious number of the program was "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast," from S. Coleridge Taylor's cantata of "Hiawatha." This composition the Music Committee permitted the students to undertake on account of their great wish to study an important work by one whom they consider—and whom others consider—to be the greatest musician of their race, even though it might be beyond their present proficiency to master fully. It was also explained that the orchestra which was to play at the concert was unable to do so, and at the last moment another orchestra had to be formed and rehearsed by J. Rosamond Johnson.There were numerous other compositions by negro and white composers heard: negro spirituals, a chorus with solo. "Exhortation," by Will Marion Cook; "Listen to the Lambs," by R. Nathaniel Dett, awarded second prize in last year's competition; "Southland," by Mr. Johnson; songs by Harry T. Burleigh, Coleridge Taylor, J. Rosamond Johnson. Miss Ethel Richardson played Liszt's eighth Hungarian Rhapsody. Under the circumstances, the results were often such as to deserve commendation and encouragement, even though there were defects, and sometimes serious ones. The audience was ready to give the commendation and encouragement freely and to overlook the defects. There was, indeed, much that was striking and suggestive of the significance and possibilities of the Colored Settlement's work.The Famous Players film, "The Eternal City," which the motion picture world has been awaiting with interest for some time, was shown publicly for the first time in New York in the Astor Theatre last night. The anticipation was due to the fact that more than the usual care was taken to secure the proper atmosphere, a company of American players having been sent abroad more than a year ago that Hall Caine's story might be photographed with the scenes described by him in his novel for a background.

WHEN one considers how little of Professor Dewey's "Schools of Tomorrow" could have been written twenty, even ten, years ago, one realizes that the much-talked-of and long-heralded transition period of our educational history is as good as over. Ten years ago only the merest guesswork could have picked with any certainty the new shift in the educational stream which obviously is now to become the main current.

The motor highway running south from Atlantic Highlands along the New Jersey coast might be used to advantage by a larger number of city motorists than at present appear to be aware of its attractions. Possibly the accounts of damage to the New Jersey Summer resorts that resulted from last Winter's storm gave rise to a mistaken impression that the roadway had also suffered.

466-> MR. BIGELOW AGAIN.; He Defends "Simplicissimus" and Praises Mr. Thayer.
When I wrote my simple letter to you pointing out the curious incapacity of the true Prussian to control his temper in political discussion, I little thought that so conspicuous a propagandist as Herr Dernburg would be the first to call me names, and thus illustrate most aptly the point I desired to make.

With such tangible proof of our extraordinarily strong position in foreign trade as is supplied by the February statement, showing the record-breaking excess of exports of $173,600,000 for that short month, it is relatively easy to become enthusiastic over the effect which the war is exerting upon the demand for American products and to see how this enthusiasm is finding expression in the stock market.

Signs of preparation for a new attempt to invade Central Park are plain enough to justify a speedy mobilization of the forces of righteousness.

480-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Nobody who was in or near New York's main artery of travel and traffic Thursday evening or Friday morning would have hesitated to say that a considerable fraction of the town's citizens were engaged in "celebrating" something, but a thoughtful consideration of the word used -- such as it didn't then receive, presumably, from any of the celebrants -- would make the correctness of its employment at least a little dubious.

681-> Therefore, They Should Endure It and Share the World with Men.
It seems to me that both the "antis" and suffragists fail entirely of the mark in regard to woman's place in the home. Women are born women, and must endure it, however much they may desire to "change their spots"; and, so long as they are women, their place must be in the home if we are to continue to be either men or women. There must, of course, be exceptions to this rule.

The head of a pig on the medallion of a badge designed for use in the convention of Christian Endeavorers in Chicago next Summer was designed, of course, as a symbol of Chicago's industry, but we agree with Chicago's judgment that the designer was at fault.
