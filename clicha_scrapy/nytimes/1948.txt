30-> ' Summer Holiday,' the New Bill at State, Is Film Version of Eugene O'Neill Play
Eugene O'Neill's "Ah, Wilderness!" which was made thirteen years ago into a very appealing movie, has been dug out to serve again as the book for a Metro musical entitled "Summer Holiday." And this, in turn, has been stripped down to a vehicle for Mickey Rooney's use—all of which sounds, for Mr. O'Neill's drama, like a fate somewhat worse than death.In a sense it is, too, for this musical, which came to Loew's State yesterday, is plainly lacking the poignance and the delicate charm of the original. Where Mr. O'Neill's reminiscence of adolescent youth back in the days of peg-top trousers, of the Rubaiyat craze and the five-cent schooner of beer was a subtle and sensitive understanding, this picture is largely a big lark. And where the youngster in the play was a human, he is simply Mr. Rooney, in this film.As the lad whose first expansive ventures along the path of love confuse not only his own life but that of his whole family, Mr. Rooney is given to clowning in his familiarly broad and impish way. He makes puppy love with burlesque shyness, he wears his clothes in exaggerated style and he acts the big cheese in his household, exactly as Andy Hardy does. With little regard for illumination, he sacrifices character for laughs—which may make for round-house entertainment, but does not make for a sensitive, balanced scan.But then neither does the transference of Mr. O'Neill's nostalgic play into the form of a bouncing musical enhance its subtleties. The frequent and jingling expression of certain sentiments and ideas in song plainly reduces the humor to obviousness and sheer display.No doubt, the questing producers had in the backs of their minds the image of "Meet Me in St. Louis" when they undertook this film. And no doubt a worthy repetition might have been achieved, if the music had more distinction and if Mr. Rooney had been sat on a few times. Rouben Mamoulian's direction especially of the musical passages, indicates that he studiously sought for the lilt and sparkle of that previous show.And once or twice he has managed intriguing sequences. For instance, the whole encounter of the adolescent boy with a down-at-heel lady of the evening is a finely staged musical interlude. Pictorial and melodious, as Marilyn Maxwell as the girl sings a barrel-house ballad, "I Think You're the Sweetest Kid I've Ever Known," and assumes a bedazzling appearance, it has humor and sensual quality.But most of the music is routine, and one number, the "Stanley Steamer" song is a dead and direct imitation of the "Trolley Song" in that St. Louis film.However, this must be admitted: there are plenty of bright spots in this show and a few flavorsome reflections of small-town life in the sweet long-ago. Also, despite Mr. Rooney's inclination to steal every scene, he has severe competition in an eminently able cast. Walter Huston is magnificently sapient and adroit as the kindly father and Frank Morgan is leisurely and funny as the inevitable family souse. Selena Royle is nice as the mother, Agnes Moorehead is prissy as the aunt and Gloria De Haven is crisply prim and pretty as the pedestaled girl. Even little Butch Jenkins is spry as the family brat. And it all looks attractive in color. So it may do for casual summer fun. SUMMER HOLIDAY; Adapted by Irving Brecher and Jean Holloway from the Screen play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, based upon the Eugene O'Neill play "Ah. Wilderness!"; directed by Rouben Mamoulian; produced by Arthur Freed for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. At Loew's State.Richard Miller . . . . . Mickey RooneyMuriel . . . . .

191-> At the Elysee
An unusual film package—unusual, that is, for a commercial, midtown showcase—is "What's on Your Mind?" an hour-and-a-half long screened psychiatry seminar, which began its term at the Elysee on Christmas Day. For, while this compilation of four educational short subjects, produced here, in Canada and in England, probes with professional accuracy, its lectures are more often austerely matter-of-fact than dramatically compelling. These primers on emotional problems, are, in brief, interesting if not precisely new in approach, pertinent and necessary, albeit artistically uninspired."The Feeling of Inferiority," a re-enactment made here, is, in this corner's opinion, the best of the collection. For, in this story of how a high school teacher delves into the background of a maladjusted student to help her find latent talents and friendships, is a yarn couched in sturdy dramatic terms. It is also an inquiry which manages to bring the viewer into genuine rapport with both the problems and the persons involved.Although such impact is missing from "The Feeling of Rejection," produced by the National Film Board of Canada, and "Problems of Sleep," the English-made entry, both, in sum, are pointed depictions of the physical and emotional disturbances that may stem from unconscious but improper parent-child relationships. The opening, short, "What's on Your Mind?" also the product of the National Film Board of Canada, is a somewhat inconclusive and disjointed dissertation on psychiatric practices. A revival of a Robert Benchley short, "Sex Life of the Polyp," also is included on the program. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?, an educational film program presented by Oxford Films and composed of "What's On Your Mind?", produced by the National Film Board of Canada under the supervision of the Allan Memorial Institute of Psychiatry; "The Feeling of Rejection," produced and directed by Robert Anderson from a script by Bruce Ruddick, M.D., for the National Film Board of Canada; "Problems of Sleep," directed by Jane Massey for the Realist Film Unit of London and "The Feeling of Inferiority" (The Case of Ada Adams), directed by Maurice Goldberg from a script by Theodore B.

219-> THE SCREEN; Hold That Tiger!
Those who read Jim Corbett's book, "Man-Eaters of Kumaon," a thrilling report on tiger-hunting in the hills of India, will note very little resemblance in the film that has been made under the same title, lacking the plural, and which came to the Winter Garden yesterday. For the film is a standard, grade B, studio-made jungle yarn in which the action is as stiff and synthetic as that in a weary horror film.To be sure, the title performer is a bona fide tiger, all right, and it does indulge in one fast fracas with a crocodile in a pool. But, for the most part, this hobbled feline has a conspiciously woebegone air as it wanders through artificial bushes, looking for people to consume. Equally woebegone, however, is Wendell Corey, who plays a beaten gent out looking for tigers to shoot at for want of something better to do. Finally, Mr. Corey and the tiger do meet face to face, after the tiger—or a reasonable facsimile — has mauled Joanne Page, Sabu's wife. And appropriately the picture ends with a wrestling match between Mr. Corey and the tiger, in which both fall over dead.Frankly, the most terrifying thing about this exhibition is the noise made by a cardboard tiger on the front of the theatre. Hold That Tiger! MAN-EATER OF KUMAON, screen play by Jeanne Bartlett and Lewis Meltzer; adaptation by Richard G. Hubler and Alden Nash, based on the book by Jim Corbett; directed by Byron Haskin; produced by Monty Shaff and Frank P. Rosenberg and released by Universal-International Pictures.

And, if the Gotham's cash customers don't happen to see much difference between this tale of dirty deeds and cowhand chivalry in the City of the Angels, circa 1848, and the many other sagebrush sagas turned out by Republic in the recent past, it's because the customer is always right.At any rate, the studio has mounted this horse opera handsomely, the Pacific terrain lives up to the Chamber of Commerce blurbs and the odds against our hero, William Elliott, are properly stupendous.Aligned against Elliott, a grim Missouri marshal out to get the dastard who killed his brother, is Joseph Schildkraut, an old hand at being simultaneously suave and villainous. As his scalawag sidekicks, who are helping him rid the range of harmless haciendados and corner practically all the acreage in southern California, are John Carroll, as charming a badman as ever galloped before a camera, Sheriff Grant Withers and sundry other Hollywood renegades.Lest it should come as too great a surprise, let it be noted that they all get their come-uppance while Elliott wins the hand of Catherine McLeod, a Government agent who has been masquerading as a suspect, saloon singer all along. If it proves anything, "Old Los Angeles" is evidence that love and six shooters were staple commodities in L. A. long before the movies took over.

429-> Gary Cooper Plays 'Good Sam' in Leo McCarey's Production at Radio City Music Hall
Now that Leo McCarey has been piously patted on the head for making such sweet and hearty pictures as "The Bells of St. Mary's" and "Going My Way," this erstwhile Hollywood lampooner has apparently had an impish urge to stick out his tongue, rather slyly, at the nation of sanctimony. At least it appears that he has wriggled uncomfortably under the pats, fearful that someone might take him for a better little boy than he is. And the evidence of his embarrassment is his latest production, "Good Sam," a mischievous sort of satire, which came to the Music Hall yesterday.The principal danger in this picture is that people will take it seriously as a nobly intended tribute to the Good Samaritan type. And that is understandable, for the story is such a cliché that it may not be easily distinguished as an outright travesty. Furthermore, it is plainly apparent that the edge of the old McCarey knife is blunted just a little when it comes to the full satiric cut. Maybe, indeed, he wasn't certain, with the reputation he now has, that he should hack away at goodness as sharply as he might have liked.But if you'll realize at the outset that the hero of this comic tale is not supposed to be taken as a proper example at all but is really something of a lampoon—a spoof of a popular movie type—then you'll certainly get more pleasure out of the antics than if you don't. And if you'll agree that his goodness is something of a trial—as it is to his wife, to his pastor and, finally, to himself—you'll be on the track of pereceiving what Mr. McCarey is driving at.For this is the story of a fellow who is so good to everyone that he almost drives people crazy, especially his wife. He irritates bus drivers by compeling them to be polite, he baffles his boss by paying attention to the whims of customers, he puts his home in jeopardy by giving house room to stray tramps and he perils his own financial status by loaning to anyone. Finally, on the verge of catastrophe as a consequence of his good deeds, he takes to drink, which is standard, and is saved in an equally standard way.Perhaps the script which Ken Englund prepared for this impudent spoof is not as tightly written or as sharp as it might have been, but it sparkles with swift and clever dialogue, especially the tart retorts. And Mr. McCarey's direction of the give-and-take husband-wife scenes and the scenes of our hero with "the people" are bright, explosive—and absurd.In the role of the hero, Gary Cooper does a sublimely indifferent job of kidding every do-gooder that he has played since Mr. Deeds, plus a couple of memorable do-gooders that Jimmy Stewart has played. And, as his long suffering wife, Ann Sheridan gives a thoroughly amusing look at a woman who accepts her husband's bigness of heart with bitter and candid distaste. As a matter of fact, it is the lovely and willful sarcasm in her approach—the non-Pollyannaism—that keys the whole purpose of the film.As other local characters, Ray Collins is archly good as the pastor, Clinton Sundberg is saucy as a greedy putter-upon, and any number of ladies and gentlemen are cute in varied roles. Taken without looking closely for piety or grace, "Good Sam" makes agreeable entertainment and is good for a lot of laughs.On the stage at the Music Hall is a spectacle revue, "Musicana," featuring Gertrude Nagle, Brunhilda Roque, Paul Franke, the Lane Brothers, Jack Harwood, the Glee Club, Corps de Ballet and Rockettes. GOOD SAM, screen play by Ken Englund, from a story by Leo McCarey and John Klorer; directed and produced by Leo McCarey for Rainbow Productions, Inc., and released by RKO Radio Pictures.

454-> THE SCREEN; Film Version of Elmer Rice's 'Dream Girl' at Paramount -- Betty Hutton in Lead
According to our information, Paramount paid a lot of coin for the screen rights to Elmer Rice's "Dream Girl"—more than $200,000, in fact. But, according to our observation, it has kissed both coin and "Dream Girl" good-by—a hapless osculation which neither it nor the public can afford. For the picture based upon this stage play, which came to the Paramount yesterday, could have been a cute one—had every chance of being, indeed—but is as dreary a botch of a good thing as we have ever seen.The reasons are fairly obvious. In transferring Mr. Rice's play about a light-headed little cookie who spends half of her time in wild day-dreams, Paramount and Mitchell Leisen have done a couple of unforgivable things: they have "Hollywoodized" the whole idea and then have drowned it in a torrent of words.In Mr. Rice's concept, the girl was a modest little doll whose glittering mental fabrications were in sharp contrast to her meek and mundane life. So, when she fancied herself a sleek adventuress or a hot-shot on the stage, the elegances of her imaginings but indicated the pallor of her real world. However, in the picture, the boys have started her off as a millionaire's airy daughter who lives in supreme luxury and to whom a Spanish castle would be nothing sensational or remote.Consequently, there is slight contrast between the fantasies of this poor kid and the Hollywood razzle-dazzle amidst which she supposedly lives. And if anyone raises the issue that millionaires' daughters can dream, too, the answer is: "Sure, but there's small difference between Hollywood splash and fantasy." And that's one trouble with this picture: it all has the plushness of a dream.Then, too, Mr. Leisen has forgotten that motion pictures should move and not bog down in soggy stretches of back-and-forth he-and-she talk. No matter how bright the conversation—and some of Mr. Rice's lines are bright—too much sitting down and talking usually makes for a wearying film. In this case, the dialogue, while breezy, has a certain laboriousness which is meagerly compensated by a few chunks of burlesque fantasy.And, finally, it must be stated that Betty Hutton is a dud as the poor little millionaire's daughter who goes wandering in cuckoo-land. In those scenes when she tries to be poignant, she is drearily artificial. And in the slapdash performance of her day-dreams, her burlesque is too obvious and broad. Also her voice is disturbing. At one time, she'll talk like Betty Field, who played the original "Dream Girl"; the next minute, she'll sound for all the world like Ezra Stone as Henry Aldrich on the radio.In her support, however, Macdonald Carey does a pretty good job as a candid newspaper fellow who eventually cuts into her dreams, and Patric Knowles, Virginia Field, Walter Abel and Peggy Wood patly fill other roles. All of their mingled endeavors appear of little avail. It strikes us as highly significant that no writers claim credit for the script.On the stage at the Paramount are Phil Spitalny and his all-girl orchestra, plus Sibyl Bowan.

494-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Gino Cervi Quits for a Time a Boring Life in the Film '4 Steps in the Clouds'
Although the Italian film artisans have been garnering justifiable acclaim here for the biting realism of their topical portraits, kudos has not been the rule where other themes were concerned. So it is pleasant to report that "Four Steps in the Clouds" rates a round of applause for its sensitive treatment of a thoroughly unspectacular subject. For, though the importation, which began a stand at the Little Carnegie on Saturday, deals simply with the desperation of an unwed mother-to-be and the ordinary, little man who befriends her, it does so with wit, compassion and no little genuine comedy. It is not the perfect picture, but its flaws are not major ones and its sum total is a charming, cheerful and sometimes movingly human adventure.It is clearly the expansion of the barest of tales having to do with a traveling candy salesman, who, one morning, leaves his shrewish wife and their cluttered apartment on his dull rounds. On his journey he runs into an obviously confused and terrified girl, who not only reveals her secret to this kind stranger, but in her pressing anxiety asks him to pose as her husband for a single day so that she may avoid shame and banishment from her farm home. Wracked by indecision, he, nevertheless, goes on with the masquerade and when he is found out eloquently convinces the irate family of the virtues of forgiveness.Aside from the bones of essentials, which reveal none of the yarn's particular appeal, are truly comic scenes aboard a careening bus piloted by a driver who has just learned he has become a father, and a truly comic discussion between the distraught salesman and the girl's wine-bibbing grandfather. And, add also the sequence in which the salesman finally returns to his home.In this Gino Cervi turns in a beautifully wrought characterization as the tergiversant sweets seller, who, for a moment steps out of his mundane, harried existence to perform an act of Christian kindness and then reverts to a normal and boring life. Count also as finely etched the poignant performance of Adriana Venetti as the restrained but anguished unwed mother; Giacinto Molteni as her wryly humorous grandfather and Aldo Silvani as her stern parent.There is, of course, the obvious improbability that a practical and unadventurous man, such as depicted by Cervi, would be involved in the predicament pictured. But the improbability is outweighed by the performances of the cast and adeptness of direction, which makes "Four Steps in the Clouds" both believable and diverting. FOUR STEPS IN THE CLOUDS, screen play by Gluseppe Amato; from a story by Ceare Zavattini and Piero Tellini; an Italian-made Cines Production directed by Alessandro Blasetti and released here by Distinguished Films, Inc.

880-> THE SCREEN
There is something outrageously silly about the sight of two Hollywood stars, one a stalwart young fellow and the other a stalwart young girl, going through love's standard torments, complete with a nose-in-air quarrel, over the question of whether the fellow should continue to be a lobsterman. Somehow, the inclinations of two such characters to face this issue squarely seem filled with unutterable distate. And that's why the film, "Deep Water," which came to the Globe yesterday, is a basically silly picture, even though it was meant seriously.Perhaps if its humorless makers, Twentieth Century-Fox, had tackled the job with sincerity, the result would have been otherwise. For they had a pretty good story of people along the Maine coast—the novel, "Spoonhandle," by Ruth Moore—with which to work. Faithful characterization and a sustained realistic style might have turned this indigenous story into a fine and affecting film.But instead they threw away the novel, except for a few suggestive hints, and dreamed up some artificial people to perform in an artificial locale. Dreamed, did we say? That's an error. They are stock Hollywood characters and the things which they do are as standard as the parts for a sewing-machine. Jean Peters loves Dana Andrews but she cannot plight him her troth so long as he prefers lobster-fishing to a safe and sane job ashore. Nor can she permit Dean Stockwell, an orphan with a hankering for the sea, to go lobstering with Mr. Andrews so long as he's in her charge. However, when certain things happen to prove that she cannot buck fate she resigns the lad to Mr. Andrews and also surrenders herself.Actors cannot be censured for stock performances, and that's what these three—and several others—give under the direction of Henry King. Stiffly, conventionally romantic and mawkish to an extreme, they only do as directed in a hopelessly hackneyed script. As a light-hearted Portugee fisherman, Cesar Romero is silly, too, and Anne Revere is a straight West Coast concept of a rock-ribbed Down East dame. Even though some of the picture was shot along the Maine coast, it has much less flavor of that locale than it has of the studio tank. Missed the BoatDEEP WATERS, screen play by Richard Murphy, based on the novel "Spoonhandle" by Ruth Moore; directed by Henry King; produced by Samuel G. Engel for Twentieth Century-Fox pictures.

910-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; William Holden Plays Gangster in 'The Dark Past,' Columbia Film at Ambassador
Since the mating of Freud and the films is not particularly news at this point, it is pleasant to report that "The Dark Past," which arrived at the Ambassador yesterday, is one of the brighter results of that long association. For Columbia's unpretentious investigation of a specific criminal type is lucid, taut and adult melodrama which makes facile use of the labyrinthine ways of psychoanalysis without tripping over its terminology. And, though this case history was studied in 1939 by the studio in "Blind Alley", it is by no means dull or redundant since "The Dark Past" is a mental operation well worth watching again.It is, it may be recalled, the flashback reminiscence of a psychiatrist's calm but dramatic lifting of the veils shrouding a gangster-killer's tormented mind. The outlaw, Al Walker, is a renegade who has been having the same bad dreams over and over again. When he and his gang move in on the good doctor's country house to keep the medico, his family and guests captive, Dr. Andrew Collins, anxious but unfrightened by pointed guns, proceeds to probe into the gunman's psyche. And, though the banditti never make their getaway, their leader escapes from his harrowing, recurrent nightmares after learning their meanings in terms of his sordid past.It is gratifying to note also that the scenarists and Director Rudolph Mate have succeeded in blending into excitements such classroom tags as "censor band", "compulsion," "conscious" and "subconscious" and the constant threat of the gun-happy Walker tensely attempting to fight off his professionally persistent interrogator.William Holden is excellent as the dream-shackled gunman, who is at once ruthless, nervous and explosively dangerous but who grudgingly complies with the doctor's "screwball" tactics. As counterpoint is Lee J. Cobb's equally fine portrait of the unflustered scientist who is dedicated to "curing people not killing them." And, Nina Foch does a competently restrained job as the gangster's moll, who learns her man is suffering from an Oedipus complex. The doctor's house guests, including Steven Geray, Adele Jergens and Wilton Graff, and their captors, especially Berry Kroeger, give unobtrusive but neat characterizations. Neat, too, is the word for this small but well-made Christmas package. THE DARK PAST, screen play by Philip MacDonald, Michael Blankfort and Albert Duffy; adapted by Malvin Ward and Oscar Saul; based on the play, "Blind Alley" by James Warwick; directed by Rudolph Mate; produced by Buddy Adler for Columbia.

915-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Rita Hayworth Essays the Role of Carmen in Columbia's Film at the State
With all due regard for Rita Hayworth's abundant and evident charms, bestowed upon her by nature and the make-up department equally, it must be surmised that the lady simply hasn't got what it takes to play the role of Carmen, Prosper Merimée's classic gypsy vamp. For an emptier lot of posturing and posing, of slinging hips and general emoting of passion you're never likely to see than that indulged by Miss Hayworth in "The Loves of Carmen," which came to Loew's State yesterday.As Merimées fiery two-timer whose exploits are widely publicized via the music of Bizet's opera, which specifically is not used in the film, Miss Hayworth wears vivid Spanish costumes, has her tawny hair done in lush cascades and manifests the artful attentions of make-up people to her hands, face, eyes and lips—all of which make a peachy appearance in the Technicolor that is generously used by the ardent photographers of Charles Vidor, producer and director of the film. Likewise, Miss Hayworth's sparkling manner and her patly tempestuous moods suggest that she's had comparable grooming from director and dramatic coach.But the electric spark of personality that might give illumination to the role is missing in her performance, so that the slattern conceived by Merimée is a lacquered and lifeless creature in this stagey and stolid charade. Even a couple of dances and one song are pretty but dull. And the Don Jose of the novel, who was a contemptible stuffed-shirt, is here a mopish fall-guy in the performance of Glenn Ford. Victor Jory is adequately raffish as Carmen's bandit spouse and whips up the film's sole excitement in a slashing knife fight with Mr. Ford. But the rest of the cast are just fellows who swagger and leer in costumes.Inspired, one suspects, by the "Carmen" done in French a few years back with Viviane Romance, this much more costly Hollywood version can't hold a candle to it. THE LOVES OF CARMEN, screen play by Helen Deutsch, based on the story of Carmen," by Prosper Merimee; directed by Charles Vidor and produced by him for Columbia Pictures.

1308-> Film of Wyoming Territory at the Gotham
If, at this late date, moviegoers are still unaware that the West of the Eighteen Seventies was no place for a law-abiding citizen or a lad with a healthy scalp, then Republic's "The Plunderers" is here to prove that point once again. For the sagebrush saga, which clattered into the Gotham on Saturday, too brightly tinted in Trucolor, is recounting a yarn about the Wyoming Territory, where renegades rode with reckless abandon and where John Drum, a major in the overworked cavalry and now riding in cowhand mufti, is out to get outlaw Whit Lacey. The latter is no deep-dyed dastard (Trucolor notwithstanding) but a desperado with a heart of gold, and the major, to say nothing of audiences, must naturally heave a sigh of relief when the Sioux, not the Army, send Lacey to his Maker.The boys, let it be known, do not chase each other over new trails. It's a well-worn path strewn with such staples as the posse hunt, fist fights, horse rustling and a climactic Sioux raid on the Army outpost with flaming arrows, whooping Redskins and, of course, the cavalry saving the day.Rod Cameron makes a grim pursuer and Forrest Tucker is an amiable outlaw, with Ilona Massey and Adrian Booth as their respective romantic partners. But despite the muscular and amorous goings-on and an occasional attempt at offhand humor, "The Plunderers" is old-fashioned and pallid fare handily worth all the fireworks.
