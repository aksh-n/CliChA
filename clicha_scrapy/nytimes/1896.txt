151-> TROTTERS ARRIVE AT FLEETWOOD.; Candidates for the Purses This Week Ready for the Word.
The harness racers had a rest yesterday at both the driving parks in this vicinity.

The members of the two clubs evidently realized the situation without leaving...

ANDOVER, Mass., Nov. 14 -- Andover grave Exeter a sound thrashing this afternoon, defeating her old rival by a score of 28 to 0.

--------
156-> INFECTED WATER.
When the milk-dealer who was responsible for a typhoid epidemic of 400 cases in the City of Stamford was arrested and prosecuted last year, we remarked that while this was the first prosecution of the kind -- and, for certain reasons, would probably come to nothing -- it would undoubtedly be followed by similar proceedings against other persons equally guilty of distributing the germs of typhoid in milk or in water. 
--------
157-> ALONG THE WATER FRONT.; A Few Particulars of the Extent of Commerce at This Port.
Along the water front, nowadays, are many busy places, and the loungers who while away the time on the stringpieces are obliged to change resting places frequently and get out of the way of trucks that are loaded with goods for the vessels alongside the piers. How long exactly veteran loungers can remain at any particular place without exhibiting signs of interest in the surroundings has never been determined. 
--------
158-> TO BE A "DRY" SUNDAY; THE LIQUOR TAX LAW TO BE ENFORCED STRICTLY. Chief Conlin Issues Instructions to Inspectors -- Corporation Counsel Scott Interprets the Law as to the Restaurant and Hotel Clauses -- No Intention to Interfere with Eating Meals -- A Little Latitude for Hotel Keepers.

Chief of Police Conlin summoned his one Inspector and his five Acting Inspectors into his office yesterday afternoon and read to them an opinion by Corporation Counsel Scott interpreting the restaurant and hotel clauses of the Raines law. 
--------
159-> FARMERS AND PRICES.
As long as you drive down the prices of farm products you make it impossible for the farmer to buy the products of the factories. People need clothing and other products of the factory. Why can't they buy them? Because when the farmer sells his crops in gold prices and pays his debts and taxes he has nothing left to spend at the store. 
--------
160-> GRAND ARMY MEN AROUSED.; The News of Maceo's Assassination Causes a Sensation.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Dec. 13. -- When the news of the reported assassination of Maceo, the Cuban leader, was bulletined at the offices of the United Associated Presses in Pittsburg yesterday evening, it was read by thousands, and Spain was denounced in the most vigorous language.

--------
162-> THE BOSTON MARKET.
BOSTON, April 4. -- Although to-day was a half holiday, the market, contrary to the expectations of the wise ones, showed unexpected strength, and while the dealings were a little more than normal, about everything on the list closed at better prices. Pioneer was unchanged at 8 3/5. Boston and Montana was a little more active than of late. 
--------
163-> THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW.
Very much to the surprise of some and the pleasure of all friends of civil service reform, the Sanger bill has been favorably reported to the Assembly. It is now thought to have a very good chance of passage. With those members of the Legislature who know what the reform is, what the law now proposed is, and how much can be done for good government under it, there is no need for argument.

--------
173-> The Ways of Former Children.

Foote, Jr. -- Action Is for Conversion, and Involves a Lot of Missives.
Discoveries of odd trading are made from time to time.

There came a quick-witted Italian, who knew that the stuff contained wealth. He made a fortune, and now there is a scramble for sorting over rubbish. 
--------
175-> PROVISIONS.
HOG PRODUCTS--While grain was advancing In the early part of the day, the hog products were just steady, and later, on the sharp decline for grain, there was general yielding for pork, laid, and bacon.

--------
176-> MR. CRISP'S WAY.
It is not impossible that Mr. CRISP of Georgia may get to the United States Senate as a free-silver man. It would be unfortunate for Georgia and not desirable for himself. He is an ambitious man, of much energy and considerable capacity, but his career will stop with his entrance to the Senate as a representative of free silver. 
--------
177-> THE ALBANY MARKET.
ALBANY, March 7. -- Aside from a few changes in prices there were no interesting features to the local security market during the week.

--------
195-> THE REAL ESTATE FIELD(2); A Better Showing Made at the End of the Week. MONEY FOR LOANS WAS THEN EASIER Negotiations Hanging Fire -- Sale of the Hamersley Property on Broad- way -- Efforts to Organize the Brokers.
There is no doubt that the end of the week just past was more favorable to real estate dealings than its beginning. The largest factor contributing to this result was unquestionably the authoritative prophecy that the forthcoming bond issue would be oversubscribed and the accompanying statement that the subscriptions could be paid in small installments. 
--------
196-> AN AUTHOR IN REVOLT(2); He Refuses to Send One of His Books to a Literary Society.
Pwilheli is a seaport town in Wales. Existing there is an institution called the Ala Road Literary Society, the Secretary of which recently wrote to an author.

To the Editor of The New-York Times: More than thirty years ago there were a lot of men in this country, who, preferring to be Americans to being partisans, voted, as well as fought, against what had been their party and earned the title of "War Democrats."

There will be virtually no contest over State issues this year in the State of New-York.

601-> MAYOR WURSTER'S SELECTIONS; Men Who Say They Are to be in His Cabinet -- W.C. Bryant Is to be Fire Commissioner.
While Mayor Wurster of Brooklyn has taken particular pains to withhold from the public any intimation as to whom he intended to appoint as members of his Cabinet, each person who has been notified that he will be appointed has taken means to see that the public knows it at once. Those sure of places, according to their Qwn statements, are:

Lewis G. Tewksbury, the Broadway banker, who owns Mascot, 2:04, and who barely missed making a metropolitan road mare of Alix, 2:03 3/4, a few months ago, has purchased from C.J. Hamlin the champion pacer Robert J., with a record of 2:01 1/2.

--------
620-> HORRORS OF MODERN PRISONS.; Their Very Improvements Are What Drive Convicts Mad.
The official belief is that there is little or no prison-made insanity. Prison doctors are keenly alive to the possibility of shamming, and they hesitate to admit that there is any flaw in the system for the administration of which they are so largely responsible. Still the fact remains that the ratio of insanity in prisons has exactly doubled since 1877.

--------
630-> SUFFRAGE AND REPRESENTATION.
It is reported that the "Republican managers" propose to press upon Congress at the coming session the contention that South Carolina is entitled to only three Representatives in the House instead of seven because the educational qualification for the suffrage in the new Constitution of the State "practically" restricts the right to vote to the whites.

--------
633-> THE ENGLISH "ONE MAN" COMPANY.
We have heard a great deal from English writers of the lack of protection under American law for those dealing with American corporations.

--------
636-> HE MUST HOWL.
We hear the suggestion made that BRYAN'S speech at the notification meeting this week will change the course of the campaign. The candidate will make it appear that he is a Democrat, not a Populist.

--------
641-> POLICE CONSOLIDATION.
Police Commissioner ANDREWS, who has given special study to the organization of police systems and the discipline of police forces, has submitted to the Consolidation Commission his views upon unifying the police of the Greater New York territory in a single department.

--------
644-> THE "POLITICS" OF THE CAMPAIGN.
BRYAN himself and the Chicago platform have been the only forces of visible influence and effect at work on the freesilver side in the campaign.

BULAWAYO, May 15. -- Old King Lobengula was called a cruel King because his way of settling an insurrection in any kraal was to kill the Induna, all his men, and the women and children.

It was extremely unfortunate for people who love racing for the sport there is in it that yesterday was such a gloomy day, with such miserable weather.

--------
657-> London Three Hundred Years Ago.
It is with difficulty that London life three hundred years ago can be imagined, and London itself has changed as much as the life of her people. In those days it was no exaggeration to speak of "silverfooted Thamesis." The river was a place for bathing, fishing, and boating. Hundreds of watermen plied between the city and the southern bank.

--------
667-> THE NEW WOMAN CRITICISED.; Is She Unsexing Herself and Losing Man's Respect?
To the Editor of The New York Times: In your issue of Sunday, April 5, appeared an extract from The Forum headed, "What Does She Want?" and I echo the inquiry.

1056-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
No doubt Corporation Counsel SCOTT is right in his opinion that the Commissioner of Public Works has no power to restrict or regulate traffic on any public street. If he means to imply, as has been hastily inferred, that the Board of Aldermen has no authority to restrict the use of certain streets by trucks or any particular class of vehicles because these streets are public highways, the position he takes is of doubtful soundness.

1073-> MINERS' WAGES.
D.M. HYMAN, an owner of mines in Colorado, tells one of our contemporaries that the mine workmen in that State have contributed to the Bryan campaign fund "by allowing their employers to withhold a certain percentage from their pay rolls."

1078-> THE MEASUREMENT OF VALUE.
It constantly appears in the ordinary conversation of these days that many intelligent and fairly educated men who believe in maintaining the gold standard, of value have no clear grasp of the elementary principle upon which their faith should rest.

To the Editor of The New York Times: What is the cause of the present degeneracy of our Congress?

Formerly, when speakers were announced, the chambers were jammed.

One has only to read about the election methods by which the "regular" Daughters of the Revolution strove to keep themselves in office and to keep the "independent" Daughters out of power, to be convinced that what politics needs is the gentle presence of women, and that, with it, polling places will become at once millennially gentle and full of sweetness and light. 
--------
1097-> THE ARKANSAS ELECTION.
We do not see the wisdom of evading or belittling the lesson of the Arkansas election, as some of the Northern and Eastern papers are inclined to. In its way it has as much meaning as the Vermont election, and it is unfortunately to a marked extent an offset to that. Both are agricultural States.

Goldsmith traveled all the way to Holland to teach the Dutchmen English, and did not discover until he reached the Netherlands the utter futility of his mission. He did not know a word of Dutch. For her self-appointed task, to "render into English" the Russian of Mme. Kovalevsky, the Baroness von Proschwitz is somewhat better equipped than Goldsmith was, but her English is often clumsy.

It is not at all to be wondered at that the House of Representatives should have shown signs of losing its patience with the Supervising Architect's office.

CHICAGO, Oct. 23 -- The wheat market opened with the excitement of yesterday considerably abated.

QUINCY, Ill., Oct. 24 -- This was a lazy, meandering day of campaigning for William J. Bryan. It is true that he traveled 300 miles through his native State, and spoke more than a dozen times, but his activity did not compare with his recent work. 
--------
1210-> Anthony Trollope A Portrait.
From "My Confidences." Locker-Lampson. Hirsute and taurine of aspect, he would glare at you from behind fierce spectacles.

--------
1212-> THE STATE OF TRADE.
Dun's Review will say to-morrow:It is highly suggestive that, with as little help as there is now from new business, markets are so nearly maintained. Summer is close at hand, and with new crops promising well and old stocks large, it is no wonder that the farm products are cheap. The factories and mills are still waiting for the rush of business seen last... 
--------
1213-> NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
The resignation of Col. Dowd of the Twelfth Regiment has been forwarded, and is now in the Adjutant General's office. It is likely that Adjt. Gen. McAlpin, appreciating the services of Col. Dowd, will place him on the supernumerary list, thus retaining a valuable officer, that can be called upon in an emergency, and one that can be relied upon. 
--------
1214-> PERSONAL.

--------
1226-> THE CZAR.
How much do we really know of the power held by the man who on Tuesday next will be crowned at Moscow? Very little. In the experience of men of American blood there is nothing, and even in the widest reading there is not much, that can give us any clear or complete notion of what that power is.

--------
1228-> GETTING READY FOR MORE TARIFF.(2)
If the Republican Party really desires and intends -- in fulfillment of promises recently made in Congress -- to increase the present tariff duties on iron and steel as soon as it shall have the power to do so, the managers of that organization should give a little restraining advice to the manufacturers without delay. 
--------

Louis Schmidt, Jr., a violinist whose face is familiar in local orchestras, has been giving this Winter a series of chamber music and song recitals in Chamber Music Hall.

Andrew D. White, formerly President of Cornell University, made an address last evening at Sherry's, before the Patria Club, on " The Problem of High Crime in the United States."

--------
1231-> PHILADELPHIA PRICES.

--------
1232-> MANY SUFFERERS FROM DROUGHT.; Many Farmers in the Southwest Without Supplies for the Winter.
The-Times-Democrat gave some time ago an account of the great drought, extending over a large part of North Louisiana and portions of Arkansas and Texas, but it has grown even worse than it was when we then wrote of it.

--------
1233-> TWO PLANKS IN READINESS; Indorsement of the Chicago Free-Silver Declaration -- A Demand for Direct Legislation.

--------
1235-> CZAR AND CZARINA.; How They Looked, Talked, and Acted in Paris.
From The London Truth. The President stood between Nicholas and Alexandra as they descended from the palace on wheels at Passy Railway to drive through Paris.

--------
1237-> "Not Too Far."
From The Saturday Review. When stopping at one of the huts on a river in Demerara I have spent many pleasant hours. Except that they know nothing of the value of time and give you trouble on that acount, they are very nice people. They will promise almost anything. You perhaps want to hire a "bateau" to go up a creek -- your own is too large for such shallow waters. 
--------
1238-> ORANGE, 6; CHICAGO, 3.; The Westerners Led in Batting, but Were Outfielded by Orange.
ORANGE, N.J., May 23. -- A very interesting and spirited game of baseball was played this afternoon at the Orange Oval, before 2000 persons, between the nines of the Orange Athletic Club and the Chicago University, the former winning by a margin of three runs, because of good base-running and a little better fielding. Brown, the visiting pitcher, was a little wild, and grave seven men their bases on balls. 
--------
1239-> SILVER AND M'KINLEYISM.

Sheehan of the West Forty-seventh Street Station, for failing to suppress policy shops in his precinct. Commissioner Grant, who brought up the charges, announced that he approved them. 
--------
1246-> A TIMID PATRIOT.
There is a basis of cowardice in the talk of the Bryanites about the "independence" of this country in matters of finance. Mr. BRYAN himself shows it, but not so plainly as some of his followers. For instance, here is a gentleman by the name of JOHN F. BIBLE of Michigan, from whom a letter is published in The Constitution-Democrat of Keokuk, Iowa. 
--------

That the most popular colorature soprano of the day should not have sung Violetta Valery in Verdi's "La Traviata" until last night is in itself a commentary on the state of musical taste in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. A dozen years ago it would hardly have been possible for a light soprano to have attained Mme. Melba's position without the inclusion of this role in her repertory. 
--------

--------
1262-> MAYBRICK CASE IN THE SENATE.; Senator Call Farthers the Policy of Senseless Interference.
WASHINGTON, April 10. -- The performance in the Senate to-day by Senator Call of Florida, in connection with the Maybrick case, should not lead anybody, at home or abroad, to imagine that the Senate is quite so destitute of sense as it has the reputation of being, for it is safe to say that there was an almost unanimous opinion that it was none of the business of the Senate to interfere in that matter. 
--------
1263-> NO COMPROMISE ON SOUND MONEY.; If Democratic Convention Is for Silver, Form a New Party.
From The New-York Staats-Zeitung, April 22. The twaddle in which Mr. William R. Morrison has indulged anent the currency problem is surprising only for the reason that the man had shown more character in the agitation for a better tariff. As for any intellectual greatness, Morrison never had any.

--------
1320-> THE BANK OF ENGLAND RATE.
The advance of the money rate by the Bank of England to 3 per cent, must dispose finally of the notion that seems to be rooted in the minds of some of the London financial writers, that the export of gold to the United States is "artificial," "stimulated," the result of the "patriotic prudence" of a "powerful syndicate."

To the Editor of The New-York Times: In Judge Gaynor's letter, so well answered in your editorial this morning, he assumes that gold has risen in value since 1873, an assumption entirely unwarranted by the facts.

It has not yet been shown satisfactorily why the Hovas of Madagascar, who had shown themselves a warlike race, allowed the French column to march unopposed from the coast to the capital.
