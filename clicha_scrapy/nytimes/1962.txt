157-> Screen: German Drama:15-Year-Old 'Wozzeck' at 55th St. Playhouse
IT seems to be the fate of "Wozzeck," the German drama of social injustice that was based on a series of sketches written by Georg Buchner in the early nineteenth century, that it should always have to go through a period of patient waiting in each of its incarnations before being heard in New York.As nearly as we can make out, it was never done here on the legitimate stage—unless it was done by some German-speaking company in the late nineteenth century. Alban Berg's opera, based upon it, which opened in Berlin in 1925, did not get to New York (the City Center) until 1952 and into the repertory of the Metropolitan until 1959. And now the motion picture of the drama (not the opera) that was made in Germany fifteen years ago just had its American première at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse yesterday.The reason for this procrastination is something we cannot explain, for the film would seem to have sufficient interest to justify its exhibition long ere this, despite the fact that it is heavily lugubrious and done in a somewhat old-fashioned German style. Its concept of a stolid Prussian soldier who is the miserable victim of fate, of military and economic enslavment, has proved a sympathetic theme since World War II.Indeed, there is much about "Wozzeck" that leads one to suppose it was, in its original stage translation, the inspiration for "The Captain From Koepenick" and perhaps for the later and more satiric "The Good Soldier Schweik." Though simpler and more fatalistic than either of those two more modern studies of the military misfit, it packs more passion and anguish than either of them.And, as staged with murky intimations of supernatural malevolence by Georg Klaren in this film, produced at the Defa studio in what is now East Germany, it also has a strangely eerie and almost maniacal quality.Wozzeck is a private soldier who is virtually the slave of a gaudy, bombastic captain and the secret guinea pig of an inhuman medical doctor who uses him for bladder experiments. His only happiness and comfort is a young woman who has borne him a child and is loving and faithful to him, until a dashing sergeant-major comes along. Then, when he knows he has been cuckolded and is taunted by the other men, he does the one thing you would imagine and goes fatalistically to his doom.Herr Klaren's moody direction comes to its most ironic strokes in scenes of the principals caught up in the phantasmagoria of a fair, buffeted by the whirling symbols of the grotesqueries of man. Here his intimations of the supernatural intrude and his title player, Kurt Meisel, shows his most poignant form. Herr Meisel makes a weirdly submissive and agonized whipping-boy, so that his later explosions of passion and violence become all the more wild.Helga Zulch as the woman who loves him, yet loosely two-times him, is interestingly expressive of compassion and lustiness combined, and Richard Haussler is crisply operatic as the mustachioed wolf. Arno Paulsen as the pompous captain, Paul Henkels as the medical man and Max Eckard as a sympathetic student are other good professionals in the cast.A vivid musical score by Herbert Trantow and English subtitles that translate the uncommonly guttural German dialogue help to clarify this dark and sobering film.A fine little mime by Marcel Marceau, "The Dinner Party," and a fifteen-minute short in color showing the hand-manufacture of modern furniture in Denmark complete the bill. The CastWOZZECK, screen play by Georg Klaren, based on the play by Georg Buchner; directed by Mr. Klaren; produced by Kurt Halme of Deutche Film, Berlin; released by Brandon Films.

181-> Screen: 'George Raft Story' Opens:Biographical Drama Stars Ray Danton 'Look in Any Window' Shares Double Bill
NICE guy, George Raft, according to "The George Raft Story." Misunderstood, too, claims this blithely glossy little biographical drama, which headed an Allied Artists double bill on the circuits yesterday. Bracketed with a dismally fascinating number called "Look in Any Window," the Raft picture co-stars Ray Danton, as the actor, and Jayne Mansfield.The criminal associations of Mr. Raft, before his tough, patent-leather personality made him famous in films, are known facts. Not long ago, the actor himself, who may be as nice a guy as they come, candidly filled in a brass-tacks account to a national magazine. So much for the record—his own.As for this picture, here is the tale of a young man from Hell's Kitchen, who energetically latches on to a crime syndicate and lands in pictures pretty much unscathed and with the best wishes of the mob. "Some things you just wouldn't do," reminds his former boss. Okay.Slickly, patly, with Mr. Danton amiably to the fore, the story establishes his early dancing talent in some random night-club scenes, casually pulling in Julie London, as a smitten singer: Barbara Nichols, as a raucous Texas Guinan, and Margo Moore, as a nice cigarette girl protected by the hero. Miss Mansfield appears later, briefly, as a spoiled movie queen, wiggling around like a high-school Mae West.One jazzed-up but interesting sequence shows Mr. Danton's natty re-creation of his prototype's famed coin-tossing death scene from "Scarface." In the film's most amusing and indicative scene, a friendly Al Capone (Neville Brand) tells him he liked the picture and blasts "the Hays Office for bumping me off."The actual intricacies of Hollywood competition are given short shrift indeed, although Mr. Raft's star is seen dimming from careless wastefulness and "high living." One sequence shows Mr. Danton—or Raft—briefly managing a casino in Havana, before being signed for a "comeback" in "Some Like It Hot."But the over-all tone of the film, stressed by the good performance of Herschel Bernardi, as the hero's warmhearted agent, is the loyalty and generosity of Mr. Danton, through thick, thin and career, to his former buddies in crime. Including, we might add, the subsequently murdered "Bugsy" Siegel. "A nice guy," insists Mr. Danton, and who knows?"Look in Any Window" is a broadly sensationalized little melodrama, centering on a suburban peeping-tom, played by the teen-aged singing star, Paul Anka, and two neurotic, mismated sets of parents, including his own. Ugly and even sickening as it becomes, this strange little film may grip some specators, like a grip some spectators, like a the antics of Ruth Roman, Alex Nicol, Carole Mathews and Jack Cassidy (good performers), it's a miracle that the psychotic young protagonist wasn't carrying on like Jack the Ripper instead.

271-> Seen: 'Majority of One':Film Version of Play Opens at Music Hall The Cast
ON the surface, "A Majority of One," which arrived at the Music Hall yesterday, is blatant fiction. But Leonard Spigelgass' adaptation of his hit play is the beneficiary of a small miracle in the casting of Rosalind Russell in the central role of the Jewish widow from Brooklyn whose homely wisdom proves to be as effective in Tokyo as it is on Nostrand Avenue.As a result, this comedy blend of specialized, local middle class mores and humor and Nipponese formality becomes a wholly acceptable, truly heartwarming and entertaining affair despite its exotic ingredients.Miss Russell's predecessor, Broadway theatregoers will recall, was Gertrude Berg, who, having the advantages of the accident of birth and the education of experience, gave a memorable performance as the Mrs. Jacoby of "Majority." Miss Russell is experienced, of course, but she certainly does not readily come to mind as the obvious choice for the role. But she does an amazingly fine job, which has to be seen to be believed and, chances are, her performance would even pass the test of the Borscht Belt cognoscenti.Mr. Spigelgass, as we were saying, wrote an extraordinary, if simple, comedy in which the virtues of clear, decent, common sense thinking were stressed. The film, as directed by Mervyn LeRoy (with the attribute of fine color camera work), is, in essence, the same as his play. It is the basically uncluttered saga of the forthright lady, proud of her daughter and son-in-law (an economist-dipplomat, junior grade), who is suddenly brought to Japan by them.The fact that she meets an important Japanese industrialist en route and that they get along as though he were a neighbor in Brooklyn is a mild headache to her correct, impatient son-in-law, who fears this will upset protocol and invite suspicion since the Nipponese tycoon is the top man in a forthcoming, all-important American-Japanese trade conference.Cutting diplomatic red tape is as easy for Mrs. Jacoby as the recipe for gefuellte fish. Her Japanese admirer, who has indicated, in stylized fashion, a romantic attachment for her, is cool to the conference because of her son-in-law's unintentional gaucherie. She eschews protocol when she visits Mr. Asano unannounced, and they have a happy meeting of minds that ends happily for all concerned.Despite such a rickety and improbable basis for a play, Mr. Spigelgass' efforts emerge as a truthful, satisfying work largely because the combination of funny and apt dialogue and the dedicated cast give it dignity."A Majority of One," it must be stated, is overlong and occasionally too loquacious. But Miss Russell, somewhat dowdy, if comfortable, in sensible clothes, or hilariously freakish in a kimono as Mr. Asano's guest, is a self-sufficient Brooklyn dowager to the life. More importantly, her speech inflections, except for lapses here and there, are convincing and effective. Miss Russell's Mrs. Jacoby could have been a caricature but she makes her a living doll.Unfortunately, Alec Guinness' portrayal of the seemingly austere Mr. Asano is disturbing. Mr. Guinness' delineation is as professional and restrained as might be expected from an expert of his caliber. Oddly enough, however, his Nipponese-flavored delivery and occasional Oriental attire do not mask his occidental manners. Clothes and speech in this case do not make the man, and Mr. Guinness still appears to be closer to London than to Tokyo.Madlyn Rhue and Ray Danton make an engaging and comely couple as Miss Russell's daughter and son-in-law, Mac Marno, as a hepcat Japanese houseboy, and Mae Questel, as Miss Russell's inquisitive Brooklyn neighbor, both of whom are repeating the roles they created on Broadway, lend moments of verve to the proceedings. It is not their fault, though, that they are not especially memorable. Mrs. Jacoby—we mean Miss Russell — overshadows them all. She makes voting with this "Majority" a pleasure.Featured on the stage of the Music Hall are Yves Tomas, Les Balladins des Champs-Elysées, Jean-Jacques Perry, the Rockettes and the Corps de Ballet.

752-> Screen: 'Satan in Heels':Meg Myles Is Star of New Film at Forum
NOBODY is likely to be corrupted by "Satan in High Heels." Yesterday's new film entry at the Forum demonstrates once again that vice can be dull.From the first glimpse of Meg Myles as a bumptious carnival entertainer wearing tights to bate the breaths of ogling males, it is clear that she is up to no good. First she inspires her ravaged husband to sell an article called "How I Become a Drug Addict" to a scandal magazine, and then she runs away with the proceeds.Boarding a jet for the big city, with a raincoat covering those skimpy tights, she promptly captivates a slimy agent and earns a singing audition at a local bistro. Soon she is being admired by the mannish proprietress, baited by a rival "singer" (impersonated by a British blonde called Sabrina) and propositioned by the suave politician who owns the place.Conflict arises when her act is caught by the politician's reckless son, a playboy who wins her affection by taking her for a nude swim in Long Island Sound. When her harried husband tracks her down, she talks him into disposing of her elderly admirer. If this sort of gutter drama were to be made effective, the title role would require, at the very least, a Brigitte Bardot. Miss Myles, alas, is not the type. Singing a couple of songs with sophisticated professionalism, she seems indisputably feminine but insufficiently fatale.Since this deprives the chronicle of its point, the filmmakers' objective emerges as nothing more than slick sensationalism. Inadequately motivated along their road to ruin, the males in the cast, Mike Keene, Bob Yuro and Earl Hammond, are blasé about the whole thing, but Jerald Intrator's emphatic direction dots every "i" in the script.

883-> Screen: 'Farewell, Doves:Russian Teen-Age Love Story at the Cameo
A SIMPLE story of teen-age love has been siphoned out ever so obliquely in an extremely pretentious and meandering Russian film called "Farewell, Doves."The complexities of adolescent emotions are nothing compared with the deliberately diffuse method used by scenarist-director Yakov Segel to convey a basically uncluttered and fragile little family tale. Yes, this is the same Mr. Segal who gave us the superb "The House I Live In" several seasons back, with simple, head-on brilliance. "Farewell, Doves" opened Saturday at the Cameo.We defy anybody to explain just what the film is getting at after watching the first thirty minutes. Mr. Segel takes his time, letting the camera waft in and out of an urban middle-class apartment neighborhood. In bits and pieces, too fragmentary even to be called vignettes, we eventually move in on the protagonists. These are young Alexei Loktov, assistant to a utilities worker; pretty blond Svetlana Savyolova, as a hospital worker, and the youngsters' parents, who warily watch the budding romance and eventually sanction it. The symbolical title refers to the young hero's roof dovecot, where the fledglings learn to wing away independently.Finally, when the story—or situation — clicks into place, a few scenes come across with meaningful clarity, such as the audience reaction to an amateur "Romeo and Juliet." Even more interesting than the youngsters' growing love — at least to us — was the gentle courtship of the boy's mother, Valentina Telegina (the magnificent matriarch of "The House I Live In") and Sergei Plotnikov as a tactful bachelor. The two young people are likable and sensitive-faced, but the older ones are excellent.The same applies to Miss Savyolova's parents (unidentified), especially in the film's best scene, when the young hero is grilled about his "intentions."The acting is superior, and the same must be said for the photography. The text, however slender, is lifelike and the over-all flavor is wholesome. But Mr. Segel has determinedly wasted time and precious footage on trifling episodes (such as a runaway motorcycle) and sideline characters. One sequence of a museum tour couldn't be more contrived.If only the instigator and pilot of this love story had let simplicity speak for itself. FAREWELL, DOVES, written and directed by Yakov Segel, produced by Yalta Film Studios and presented by Artkino. At the Cameo Theatre, Eighth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street. Running time: eighty-two minutes.Gena . . . . . Alexei LoktovTania . . . . . Svetlana SavyolovaValja . . . . . Valentina TeleginaSerge . . . . . Sergei Plotnikov

1108-> Laurence Harvey and Capucine Head Cast:'Satan Never Sleeps'
THAT cornball from cheap romantic fiction, the prostitute with a heart of gold, staggers through "Walk on the Wild Side," which came to the Criterion and the Murray Hill yesterday, and she has no more substantiality in this instance than she had in the works of the old dime novelists.Neither has the poor, but noble, fellow who loves her with a pure and generous love and finally takes her away from the bordello (with the help of another prostitute with a heart of gold).Everything in this sluggish picture, which Charles K. Feldman has produced from a novel by Nelson Algren (which it doesn't resemble in the least), smacks of sentimentality and social naïveté. It is incredible that anything as foolish would be made in this day and age. And the suggestions in advertisements and awesome press releases that there is something "adult" about it, that is a little too strong for the kids, are sheer, unadulterated eyewash. It's as naughty as a cornsilk cigarette.There is ever so slight a suggestion that the prostitute, portrayed by Capucine, is admired by the madame of the bordello, played by Barbara Stanwyck. But that this is any more than the admiration of an employer for a highly productive employe is a thing that only the most susceptible to press-agentry might suspect.No, all we see in this picture is a Texas vagabond gone to New Orleans looking for the goddess he once knew back on the farm. After a tedious lot of looking, he finds her living in a French Quarter house, which he thinks is a residence for artists (and it might be, from the way it looks), until suddenly — oh, horrors—he discovers she is one of those. He goes through the usual business of kicking himself for a spell, then returns, puts up a battle and eventually takes her away.As the heroine, the tall, thin actress who calls herself Capucine is as crystalline and icy as her elegant mononym. Laurence Harvey is barely one-dimensional as the dimwitted Texas tramp and Miss Stanwyck is like something out of moth balls as the madame known as Jo. As a girl guttersnipe, Jane Fonda is elaborately saucy and shrill (a poor exposure for a highly touted talent), and Anne Baxter is wasted in a weak role.Edward Dmytryk's direction makes you wonder whether he read the script before he started shooting. If he did, he should have yelled. WALK ON THE WILD SIDE, screen play by John Fante and Edmund Morris, based on the novel by Nelson Algren; directed by Edward Dmytryk; produced by Charles K. Feldman and released by Columbia Pictures. At the Criterion Theatre, Broadway and Forty-fifth Street, and the Murray Hill Theatre, Thirty-fourth Street east of Lexington Avenue. Running time: 114 minutes.Dove Linkhorn . . . . . Laurence HarveyHallie . . . . . CapucineKitty Twist . . . . . Jane FondaTeresina Vidaverri . . . . . Anne BaxterJo Courtney . . . . .

John AndersonFrank Bonito . . . . . Ken LynchLieut. Omar Stroud . . . . . Todd ArmstrongPRODUCER-DIRECTOR Leo McCarey, who found a bright spot in the screen sun by creating "Going My Way" in 1944 apparently has too much faith in the durability of good works. "Satan Never Sleeps," which is disturbingly reminiscent of "Going My Way" is a lackluster imitation of that gem. The dedicated priests and Communists who clash in the drama that arrived at the Paramount and Seventy-second Street Playhouse yesterday, illustrate that "Satan" can be a strong hand at inducing sleep.Based on a novel by none other than Pearl S. Buck and filmed in color in England and Wales, the script, fashioned by Mr. McCarey and Claude Binyon, slowly and obviously spins the saga of a young priest, adored by a winsome Chinese maid, who is to take over the mission of the retiring pastor, an aging but still undaunted cleric. Remember the youthful, modern Bing Crosby and the senescent, bumbling Barry Fitzgerald in "Going My "Way?" Anyway, the Reds are a burgeoning force in 1949 and they overrun this peaceful sanctuary. The nubile Chinese heroine is raped by the Communist colonel, who once aspired to the priesthood, and the elderly cleric's life's work is seemingly ruined. But the strength of true faith and love triumph, as, inferentially, do the Communists.But Mr. McCarey's direction, as well as the acting of the principals, is decidedly less than inspired. The depiction of both the invading Communists, including a representative from Moscow, and the beleaguered missionaries and their charges, is simply one-dimensional. One may assume that most citizens, relating normally to these parlous times, could not accept these characterizations as being little better than exotic or, perhaps, caricatures of people they are supposed to represent.France Nuyen, several times removed from the prostitute she played on stage in "The World of Suzie Wong," is truly charming as the simple elfin Chinese waif who offers her heart to the embarrassed William Holden as the young priest of "Satan Never Sleeps." Mr. Holden is merely harried-looking in the role. Clifton Webb, as the indomitable old priest, is unusual only in that he is not wearing his usual mustache. Otherwise, he is as austere and correct as a social leader. Although his cassock and collar become him, he seems out of place in clerical garb speaking religious lines. And, Weaver Lee, as the Communist colonel who sees the light and finally does right by the girl he has wronged, gives a mechanical rendition of his role.There is no doubt that the hearts of Mr. McCarey and company are in the right places but "Satan Never Sleeps" has little heart in it. This "Satan" is a direct descendant of "Madama Butterfly" and soap opera. SATAN NEVER SLEEPS; screen play Claude Binyon and Leo McCarey; based on a novel by Pearl S. Buck; directed and produced by Mr. McCarey and presented by Twentieth Century-Fox. At the Paramount, Broadway and Forty-third Street, and the Seventy-second Street Playhouse, east of Second Avenue.

1398-> Screen: 'Sergeants 3' Opens at Capitol:Sinatra and Some of the Clan in Western Film Called a Version of 1939 'Gunga Din' The Cast
IN 1939, when seeing made believing easy, "Gunga Din," Hollywood's version of Kipling's poetic paean to Victorian military derring-do in India, made a smashing, captivating adventure. No fanatical Thug stood a chance against Her Majesty's three tough, comic soldiers who, virtually singlehandedly, made the Raj safe from surly insurgents.Now, Frank Sinatra, as producer and star of "Sergeants 3," which bivouacked at the Capitol on Saturday, has transported "Gunga Din," with nary an official nod toward Kipling, to our Wild West of the Eighteen Seventies and seeing, this time, is not believing.A dispassionate viewer must admit, however, that "Sergeants 3" should be spellbinding stuff to every red-blooded American boy. Adults, on the other hand, may find the film's ever-changing accents confusing. Mr. Sinatra and his loyal coterie switch from slapstick to slaughter and back again with reckless abandon. They may have found a "home" in this peculiar kind of an "Army" but their antics may be enough to give a discerning observer the megrims.Mr. Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jr. and Joey Bishop who joined forces, if not all their talents, to rob all the money of a modern Nevada gambling town in "Oceans 11," give the strange impression in "Sergeants 3" of having never left a Las Vegas night club. It should be noted that some of their old buddies of "Oceans 11," including Hank Henry, Buddy Lester, as well as three of Bing Crosby's sons, Phillip, Dennis and Lindsay, also are in the saddle in pursuit of those marauding redskins. To their credit, it must be noted that they appear to be either bored or bewildered. Henry Silva, another hold-over from "Oceans 11," is simply serious throughout as the chief of the rabid braves.John Sturges, the director, who knows his way around the Old West ("Bad Day at Black Rock"), must be credited with not depending entirely on W. R. Burnett's sparse, pithy and often contemporary dialogue. He has kept his color cameras and his cast on the move, almost constantly. A fight scene staged in a combination saloon and bagnio has the speed, comedy and improbability of a Mack Sennett set-to. Everything is thrown but pies. The same may be said of the Indian attack on our beleaguered heroes who stand them off with firecrackers, fists, bows and arrows and dynamite.In order to save Medicine Bend, their fort and their honor, the company took every scenic advantage of the rugged and multi-colored mountainous beauty of Bryce National Park. The wide-sweeping Panavision cameras have captured startling, eye-filling vistas of brightly hued gorges and plains. This is especially impressive in the climactic action between hundreds of mounted Indians charging the surrounded cavalry. The carnage, noise and movement may not make much sense but they certainly keep one awake.Mr. Sturges does not seem to have had as much effect on his principals. Mr. Sinatra, as the top-kick and brains of the outfit, is, except for brief spells of animation, casual in the extreme, as is Peter Lawford, the suave and educated member of the trio. As the zany sergeant, Dean Martin is relaxed, most of the way, to the point of lethargy. Sammy Davis Jr., as a freed slave, who adoringly attaches himself to these "Sergeants 3," is spirited, if not entirely convincing. Ruta Lee, as Mr. Lawford's fiancée, is merely decorative. And, Joey Bishop, as a straight-laced sergeant major, is, except for a mildly comic drinking bout, as stony-faced as any Sioux."They went thataway" once had meaning, but in running off "every whichaway," this "Sergeants 3" generates action, but little else.
