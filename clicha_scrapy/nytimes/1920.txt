--------
223-> THE SCREEN
"The Penalty," an altogether incredible melodrama that, by its excesses, mocks even the friendliest spectator's love of life as it is often fictitiously created on the screen, is at the Capitol this week. It is from a story by Gouverneur Morris, which, if it is anything like its motion picture version, must have taxed the author's rampant imagination, and also sent him, now and then, when original ideas failed, to the reserve cabinet of familiar devices from which a novelist may render first aid to a plot in difficulty.If its plot, then, were everything in "The Penalty," its adherents would probably be few. As it is, however, it will undoubtedly win the active interest, and even the regard, of many—because of Lon Chaney in the principal rôle, and the direction of Wallace Worsley. In the midst of a purely mechanistic arrangement of incidents, and surrounded chiefly by puppets. Chaney creates a character. The repellant "Frog" of "The Miracle Man," the villainous Ricardo of "Victory," and the likable hero of "Nomads of the North," has another vivid impersonation to his credit.When they saw "The Miracle Man" some were struck at first by Chaney's ability to make himself seem a hopeless cripple, but before the picture was finished they forgot his stunt as such and their interest was all in the person he seemed to be. Likewise, when Chaney appears in "The Penalty" with both of his legs apparently sawed off above the knees, some will exclaim, "How in the world can be do that?", but after they have followed his acting a while, and felt the force of his presence on the screen, they will take it as just a part of his rôle that his legs are missing. And, as a matter of fact, his physical appearance is one of the least persuasive things about his performance, because, in several side views, the outline of his legs strapped up behind him is evident. But in all that he does, the man he is supposed to be is present.This man is Blizzard, a ruler of San Francisco's underworld, who uses his extraordinary mind and personality in entirely evil pursuits. He exercises autocratic power in his sphere and builds a gigantic plan to loot the city, and, incidentally, to take revenge against the surgeon who had needlessly amputated his legs years before. He is also obsessed with the idea of obtaining a pair of new legs by grafting, and it is when he submits to an anesthetic for this operation that the doctor, who knows that he has suffered an injury to his brain, operates on his head instead and restores his mental balance. Upon recovering, his reformation is complete, but this turn in the story is saved from utter banality when Blizzard pays the penalty for his past life, dying by the hand of one of his former followers.It is through all of this unreality that Mr. Chaney takes a real character, largely by his own efforts, but aided by the director, and even by the story itself at times, as, for example, in the scenes in which he plays the piano and is momentarily transformed by its music. One forgets the nature of the melodrama when the vicious Blizzard cannot kill a girl whom he knows to be a government spy because she works so well the pedals his stumps of legs cannot reach.Director Worsley has set his production effectively, and the cast without being able to do anything distinctive, is nevertheless adequate for the story.Also on the Capitol program is a Hy Mayer Travelaugh, "In the Land of Fancy."The version of "Kismet," at the Strand this week, is not the "Kismet" of the stage. The sound and color that made the latter are missing. Not even as much of it has been reproduced as might have been brought to the screen by the magic of lighting, setting and costuming which some directors have at their command. Although Louis J. Gasnier has staged his production lavishly, he has not succeeded in putting into the film the tones and shades and variety that "Kismet" ought to have. Much more colorful pictures, much less pretentiously advanced, have been seen on Broadway. Many of the scenes of the photoplay at the Strand, despite the richness they probably had in the studio, are flat.The presence of Otis Skinner in his stage part, however, does much to redeem the production. Mr. Skinner ??? same tempestuous character he made him on the stage, and although his voice is not heard, his appearance and manner carry him far. His performance is worth seeing. Also some of the others in the cast add life to the picture, and in several scenes the illusion of Bagdad one thousand years ago is attained.Taken in comparison with the average program photoplay. "Kismet" has value. It is different its story is pleasantly fantastic, in spite of its murders; it is a relief from the regular run of unreality parading itself as true to life. But when one considers what might have been done with this spectacle, even without the aid of natural colors on the screen, he is bound to be disappointed. And, incidentally, "Kismet" is a photoplay that cries for the perfection of color photography.George Fitzmaurice's latest production, "Idols of Clay," with Mae Murray and David Powell in the ??? come to the Criterion, while "Conrad in Quest of His Youth," with Thomas Meighan, has moved from the Rialto to the Rivoli, and "Always Audacious," with Wallace Reid, from the Rivoli to the Rialto.

921-> THE SCREEN
The fruits of Doris Keane's recent journey over the water are to be observed at the Strand Theatre this week in the motion picture version of Mr. Sheldon's play, "Romance." Miss Keane, having acted Rita Cavillini for more than two years over here and nearly three in London, has now transferred that celebrated actress to the screen—all of her, that is, except the Italian dialect. She has the assistance of her husband, Basil Sydney, in the dual rôle of the bishop and his nephew, and Norman Trevore in the rôle which was once A. E. Anson's.The film, although it is not without its social lapses, is uncommonly interesting, as is Miss Keane in the stellar rôle. The picture follows the play with exceeding closeness, and accordingly is chiefly distinguished for its several scenes of impassioned lovemaking. One of these, in particular, is quite sufficient to insure a goodly life for the picture.The Strand program is put together without a comedy film this week, nor is the lack appreciably felt. The topical review, an interesting Burton Holmes scenic film, and the musical numbers round out the program.At the Capitol the feature film is the "Shore Acres" of James A. Herne—a piece which gave the actor the opportunity to hand his name down to posterity, but a play which is all but unknown to this generation. In one form or another, however, the films have been using the story this many years, for it is a simple tale of justice battling injustice, and emerging triumphant.Just as it derived its greatest appeal as a play from the performance of its leading character, so the film version suffers a bit by not having an actor of the calibre of Mr. Herne in the leading rôle. Indeed, Uncle Nat Berry is hardly the star rôle any more; it is the name of Alice Lake which appears in heavy type on the program, and whom it is plainly intended to feature. Edward Connelly has the Herne rôle, and Frank Brownlee plays the brother. The film, while in no way remarkable, is always interesting.Mrs. Sidney Drew, with John Cumberland heading her company, appears in a short comedy. "The Emotional Miss Vaughn," by Julian Street, and the operatic number of the week is the third act of "Lohengrin."The Rivoli offers Jack London's story of "The Sea Wolf," pictured anew with certain departures from the original story. At the Rialto the principal feature is "A Lady in Love," with Ethel Clayton in the stellar rôle, and the Criterion enters its fourth week with "Why Change Your Wife?" Rex Beach's story. "The Silver Horde," seen last week at the Capitol, was placed on view yesterday at the Broadway.

1146-> THE SCREEN
"While New York Sleeps," a melodrama, or, rather, three melodramas that might correspond to one-act plays on the same bill, followed "If I Were King" into the Lyric Theatre on Sunday. It is a Fox presentation.The three photoplaylets have no connection except that their principal parts are acted by the same persons, and they were all directed by Charles J. Barbin. Also, they deal with three different levels of metropolitan life, as it is seen through the red eye of the motion picture camera.The last of the three stories is the best. It is called "A Tragedy of the East Side," and its interest is largely in the performance of Marc MacDermott, as an old paralytic who can see and hear, but cannot speak or move any of his limbs. In the shabby little tenement in which he lives his son is killed by a gangster who has won the affections of the son's wife. The two throw the dead man through a trap door into a drain, and proceed to occupy the room together. The body is found in the river and detectives, suspecting nothing, come to notify the wife. By the use of his eyes and facial expressions the old paralytic arouses their suspicions and finally succeeds in giving them the clue by which they learn the truth. In a pistol battle that follows the gangster and the girl are killed.It's all rampant melodrama, but it has the substance of an idea and Mr. MacDermott carries out his part so effectively that the spectator's interest is held. He is also the principal player in the other two stories, "Out of the Night," in which a wife with two husbands alive, a desirable and an undesirable, is saved by the opportune appearance of a burglar, and "The Great White Way," in which the familiar "badger game" is worked on a detective, to the misfortune of the crooks.Estelle Taylor, Harry Sothern, Earl Metcalf and William Locke are the others in the casts of the three pictures and, following the broad and exaggerated style of melodramatic acting, acquit themselves satisfactorily. There is nothing subtle in any of the stories, nothing genuine. They are simply "thrillers."
