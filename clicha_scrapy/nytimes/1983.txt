3-> PLAYS; MORGAN BREAKS OUT WITH KEY HOMER
J oe Morgan of the Philadelphia Phillies has been through some slumps in his career, but none as deep as his recent one. Before Tuesday night's game with the Houston Astros, Morgan, a .274 hitter during his career, had gone 0 for 35 and was hitting .188. His last hit had been a single June 28 against the Montreal Expos. ''But I'm not in a slump,'' Morgan said by telephone yesterday. ''I'm just not getting hits. There's a difference. A slump is when you're not hitting the ball and striking out. I've been hitting the ball; they've just been making some great catches.'' The Phillies' president, Bill Giles, however, called it a slump. With Philadelphia in the thick of a pennant race, Giles said he would replace Morgan, who has has been slowed by pulled thigh muscles and hamstrings in both legs, if he doesn't begin producing. ''We're going to play him for seven straight games to see if his legs can hold up,'' he said. ''After that, we'll make a decision.'' The Phillies have a good second-base prospect in Juan Samuel, who was hitting .338 for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League going into Tuesday night's game. Giles was in Oregon yesterday. Morgan, who will turn 40 in September, is apparently ready for the challenge. Batting third in the lineup despite the slump, he grounded out in his first time at bat against the Astros Tuesday. Then, with two out in the fourth inning, he hit a Nolan Ryan curveball 360 feet down the right-field line for the game-winning run as the Phillies won, 1-0. It was his seventh homer of the season. ''What's interesting,'' Morgan said, ''is that of all the pitchers I've hit home runs off over the years - Koufax, Marichal, Gibson, Seaver - I'd never hit one off of Ryan. He throws so hard that unless he gets the ball in the middle of the plate, I can't pull it. And for me to hit a home run off him, I'd have to pull it. ''I told someone before the game that maybe I'd break out against Ryan, since I'd never hit him that well. ''Maybe now I'm ready to go on a rampage.''

7-> PROFESSIONAL GARDENERS' ADVICE
''I haven't had time yet to grow the table lamp,'' said Jack Hamilton, who has just retired after 37 years as Longwood's topiary gardener. He was referring to a topiary easy chair with a side table and a glass of Scotch growing out of it, all begun seven years ago. For a new topiary, he makes a rough sketch that is then reproduced by an artist, but frequently, he said, the shape of the bush will indicate a possible form. Most of the topiary at Longwood is in yew, either Taxus baccata or Taxus X media. At Green Animals, George Mendonca, who is the late Jose Carreiro's son-in-law, uses California privet (Ligustrum ovalifolium) almost exclusively, although some interesting effects, like ''light globes'' on lampposts, are achieved with golden privet (Ligustrum vulgare aureo-marginatum). He began a unicorn two years ago, selecting one five-foot-tall privet for each leg and forming the body by bending and crisscrossing the branches like basket weaving. The head is formed from the topmost branches, and two or three branches make the tail. At Ladew, in addition to Japanese and Hicks yew (Taxus cuspidata and Taxus media hicksi) topiary is formed of privet, hemlock, boxwood and cotoneaster. ''When it snows at Ladew,'' said Eugene T. Krach Jr., the topiary gardener, ''we use brushes on long poles to brush the snow off flat surfaces.'' Wind and snow are what cause the greatest damage to topiary. At Longwood, the gardeners round off the edges so snow and ice will roll off. ''In general,'' says Dave Thompson, Jack Hamilton's successor at Longwood, ''it is best to cut topiary at a slight angle out, not in, so that sunlight will not be impeded from reaching lower branches.'' During the growing season the topiary at Longwood is pruned the last week of June with the help of 8 to 10 gardeners; sometimes a second pruning is required in September. ''When we want to fill in a certain spot, though,'' said Mr. Thompson, ''we clip all the time as pruning stimulates growth.'' At Ladew when Mr. Krach begins shearing the fronts and backs of the 14-foot hedges, he has the help of a staff of four, using 12-foot orchard ladders. ''Straight lines are the hardest to do,'' Mr. Krach said. Since Ladew is in a more southern climate, the gardeners prune three or four times before plant growth slows down in late summer. Since the Green Animals' privet is trimmed about seven times a summer, Mr. Mendonca hires two students for the season to help out his usual staff of two. All blossoms are trimmed, because they sap the plant's strength, and careful trimming of new branches stimulates bushy growth. For fertilizing his privet animals, Mr. Mendonca bores 12-inch-deep holes, 4 feet from each animal leg, and uses a 5-10-10 fertilizer in mid-April. For the yew at Longwood, a 10-6-4 fertilizer is used in November of alternate years. ''If you're the type of person who discourages very easily,'' Mr. Mendonca said, ''don't start topiary. You need patience as it does what you don't want it to do.''

8-> G.O.P. BUDGET TALK BRINGS NO ACCORD
An attempt to unify Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee on a Congressional budget resolution for 1984 failed today in a meeting between the Senators and senior White House officials. Senate aides said that in a 90-minute meeting, punctuated by heated exchanges, three conservative Republicans refused to support any of the tax increases proposed by President Reagan and supported by some Republicans as a way to shrink future budget deficits. Mr. Reagan was reported ready to accept smaller increases in the military budget than he has proposed. The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said he would try to find a committee majority for a budget resolution by Friday, and he implied that he would compromise with the Democrats if that was the only way he could send a resolution to the Senate floor. The House has adopted a budget resolution for the 1984 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. The Senate Budget Committee has been stalled since last Thursday, when it deadlocked on taxes. ''It may be that we will have to pass out a resolution that satisfied no one entirely and allow the full Senate to debate next week,'' Senator Domenici said in a statement. They Confer in Baker Office It was issued after a meeting of the committee's 12 Republicans and senior White House officials, including James A. Baker 3d, the chief of staff, Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to the President, and David A. Stockman, the budget director. The meeting was held in the office of the Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee. ''It is obvious we have three sides in the tax debate,'' Senator Domenici said. ''Many of us support the President on taxes, others want much more in new taxes and some want to allow the deficits to continue to rise towards $200 billion.'' The ''some'' in the last named group meant three Republicans, Senators William L. Armstrong of Colorado, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Steven D. Symms of Idaho. They and four other committee Republicans voted last week for no tax increases for the next five fiscal years, opposing a Domenici proposal that contemplated minor increases in 1984 and 85 and larger revenue gains thereafter. Senate aides reported that at the Republican meeting there initially appeared to be an accord based on an upward revision of the committee's earlier military budget and some cuts in nonmilitary spending. But Senators Armstrong, Hatch and Symms, to the reported consternation of other Senators, said they would not support revenue increases of $2.7 billion in 1984, $5.4 billion in 1985 and $52.5 billion in 1986. They have contended that raising taxes to shrink budget deficits is self-defeating. A worksheet distributed at the meeting proposed $15.9 billion more for military spending in 1984-85-86 than the committee had approved. Nonmilitary spending was to be reduced $35.2 billion over the three years. When the three Senators argued that raising taxes conflicted with the 1980 Republican party platform, Mr. Baker, the White House staff chief, reportedly replied, ''We have to govern this country,'' stressing the word ''govern.'' Mr. Meese reportedly said: ''We don't like taxes better than anybody. These are only contingencies for outyears,'' or fiscal years after 1984. Flexibility on Military Seen In another budget development, Kenneth M. Duberstein, the White House chief of Congressional liaison, told an audience at the United States Chamber of Commerce that Mr. Reagan would agree to a step-up in the military budget that starts with 7.5 percent, after inflation, in 1984 and diminished gradually to 5 percent in 1988. Mr. Reagan's public position has been for a 10 percent increase after inflation. Later, Larry Speakes, press spokesmanat the White House, said of the Duberstein figures: ''That has been a subject of discussion with the committee. There has been no firm decision on our part or the committee's part. The President has not signed off on any figures.'' Unofficial calculations showed that a 7.5 percent rise, after making u for inflation, would imply appropriations, or military budget authority, of $272.6 billion, as against the $280.5 billion requested by Mr. Reagan. The Senate committee approved $267 billion. The House-passed budget resolution, written entirely by the Democrats, provided for $263.85 billion. Unofficial calculations based on the Duberstein formula pointed to military budget authority for 1988 of $414.6 billion as against Mr. Reagan's proposed $432.7 billion and the Senate panel's $410.4 billion. The House resolution budgeted for only three years; its 1986 military budget authority figure was $317.5 billion, as against $334.8 billion approved by the Senate panel and $364.8 billion proposed by Mr. Reagan.

12-> AROUND THE NATION; College Integration Plans Approved for 3 States
The Department of Education has approved amended college desegregation plans submitted by Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia. Harry Singleton, director of the department's office for civil rights, has sent letters to the Governors of the states about the approval, which was announced Friday. The Reagan Administration was under a Federal district judge's order to accept the updated desegregation plans or begin enforcement proceedings against the states. Earlier, Mr. Singleton approved plans submitted by Florida and the North Carolina community college system. All five states, like other Southern and border states, once segregated their college students by law. In 1978 they won approval from the Carter Administration for plans they submitted to upgrade their black institutions and recruit more black students and teachers to white campuses. In March, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. won an order by Judge John Pratt to the Government to ask the states for new plans. Mr. Singleton said the new agreement extended through the fall of 1985 the states' plans for eliminating discrimination from their colleges.

13-> Five Metals Producers Post Losses in Quarter
Armco Inc., continuing to show large losses from its carbon steel production because of weak demand, reported yesterday that it had a deficit of $128.4 million in the first quarter of 1983. This contrasted with earnings of $17.7 million, or 26 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Armco, the nation's sixth-largest steelmaker, said that sales in the latest three months plunged 40.1 percent, to $987.7 million, from $1.65 billion. ''We expect Armco to report a loss, although smaller, again in the second quarter,'' said Michelle Galanter Applebaum, a steel analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ''There has been some improvement in volume and in prices, but not enough to make them profitable. Assuming continued improvement in demand and prices in the second half, we would expect their carbon steel operations to be profitable in the fourth quarter. Armco, based in Middletown, Ohio, said that its largest losses continued to be in carbon steel, its basic metals business. In the first quarter, the aerospace, specialty steel and strategic materials lines had pretax operating profits but the company's oilfield equipment and fabricated products operations registered operating losses. Armco said that its financial services group had a loss. Armco produced 1.280 million tons of steel in the latest quarter, up 22.3 percent from the 1.047 million tons produced in the first quarter of 1982. The company shipped 931,000 tons in the first quarter, down 6.3 percent from the 994,000 tons shipped the preceding year. Inco Ltd. Inco Ltd., the largest nickel producer, with about 32 percent of the non-Communist world market, said that its loss in the first quarter widened to $76.9 million, from $37.2 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The Toronto-based Inco, which cited much lower nickel prices and $61 million in costs related to discontinued operations, said sales in the latest quarter plunged 29.4 percent, to $276 million, from $391 million. Inland Steel The Inland Steel Company, the country's seventh-largest steelmaker, said that its loss in the first quarter of this year widened to $19.987 million, from $18.966 million in the corresponding quarter of last year. Sales shrank by 8.9 percent, to $695.5 million, from $763.4 million. The Chicago-based company said it produced 1.434 million tons in the first quarter, up 5.4 percent from 1.361 million tons in the first quarter of 1982. Steel shipped fell 1.6 percent, to 1.074 million tons, from 1.092 million tons. Phelps Dodge The Phelps Dodge Corporation, citing cost reductions and some improvement in copper prices, said it narrowed its loss in the first quarter to $3.9 million, from $19.1 million in the first quarter a year earlier. Revenues slipped 9.3 percent, to $253.7 million, from $279.7 million. The company is the largest independent domestic copper producer. Phelps Dodge's primary metal operations, which include its copper production, and its manufacturing operations reported small operating profits in the first quarter, compared with losses in the 1982 quarter. Falconbridge Ltd. Falconbridge Ltd. reported a first-quarter loss of $22.1 million compared with a deficit of $12.9 million in the preceding year's first quarter. Revenue figures were not available. William James, chairman of the second-largest nickel producer after Inco Ltd., said that in the latest quarter all income tax credits for Falconbridge and Falconbridge Dominicana have been exhausted, ''resulting in pretax and after-tax losses being the same.''

14-> REAGAN SAYS MX VOTES WILL AID ARMS TALKS
President Reagan said today that favorable action by Congress Tuesday night on a plan to produce and deploy the MX missile had increased the possibilities of making progress in disarmament negotiations. The President praised both the House and the Senate as demonstrating ''bipartisan unity'' on the MX issue in the face of intense pressure from opponents of the missile. But he warned that the oportunity for progress would be lost if the unity was not maintained in the future. ''Thanks to this bipartisan support,'' the President said in a statement issued by the White House about the strategic arms reduction talks, ''we are now in a stronger position to continue making progress at the Start negotiations. If we can maintain our stable, bipartisan, consistent approach here at home, we have a great opportunity to achieve what we all want - lasting stability in the nuclear balance and significant reducitons of nuclear arsenals on both sides.'' The latest votes on the MX came in consideration of bills that set forth overall Defense Department spending plans for the fiscal year 1984. This fall Congress will consider whether to appropriate funds for those plans, including the MX missile, a decision almost certain to be heavily debated. The Senate vote Tuesday night on its bill was 85 to 13. But that was not the key tally. That came earlier in the day when the Senate voted, 58 to 41, to leave the MX plan in the bill. Last spring the Senate voted, 59 to 39, to put up funds for MX flight testing. In the House, Tuesday night's vote on the military measure was 305 to 114. But, again, that was not the key vote. That occurred last week, when the House voted, 220 to 207, to retain the missile plan in its bill. The House vote on flight testing last spring was 239 to 186, a much more comfortable margin for missile proponents than the latest vote. In the Senate plan, 27 MX missiles are to be produced and deployed by 1986 at a cost of $4.6 billion. The House plan calls for production and deployment of 21 missiles. Eventually the Pentagon hopes to deploy 100 missiles at a cost of $20 billion. Differences in the two bills, which propose almost $190 billion in military spending next year, must now be worked out in a conference. The main problem, besides the MX, probably will be a Senate provision calling for the resumption of nerve gas production. The House bill suggests maintaining a 14-year-old manufacturing moritorium. In calling for approval of the MX, for ''missile experimental,'' Mr. Reagan has argued that it would modernize and strengthen the United States arsenal and thereby force the Soviet Union to take disarmament negotiations more seriously. Opponents of the weapon contend that it is not needed and would only complicate arms negotiations.

16-> FREEZE KILLING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN SOUTH
A late freeze yesterday devastated fruit and vegetable crops from the Carolinas to Arkansas. For the third straight day, temperatures plunged to record lows in at least two dozen cities from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. Millions of young peaches and apples were left frozen on the trees in the Deep South, where many cities were colder than Anchorage, Alaska, which had a low of 32. Snow fell for a second day from Maryland across eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and eastern New York, leaving as much as 18 inches. Not all the weather news was bad, however. In Thistle, Utah, a huge mud slide that created a lake two miles long and more than 100 feet deep in Spanish Fork Canyon appeared unlikely to collapse and flood the downstream town of Spanish Fork, officials said. Both the Utah County Sheriff's office and the Utah Highway Patrol said the natural dam was building up at the rate of three-and-a-half feet an hour as more earth slid down the steep wall of the canyon. The lake, fed by the Spanish Fork River, was rising about three inches an hour yesterday. In Georgia, where temperatures dipped as low as 12 degrees in the northern part of the state, Gov. Joe Frank Harris asked state and Federal officials to survey the damage to peach and apple orchards as the first step in seeking Federal crop disaster relief. Tim Mercier, of Blue Ridge, Ga., chairman of the Georgia Apple Commodity Commission, said about 75 percent of the north Georgia apple crop appeared to be lost. Butch Ferree, head of the Georgia Cooperative Extension Service's horticulture department, said about 25 percent of the state's peaches were grown in the northern third of the state. ''We probably won't pick a peck of peaches above Interstate 20,'' Mr. Ferree said. As for the consumer, Mr. Ferree said, ''If summer ever comes, you'll find peaches, but at a slightly higher price.'' An extension service spokesman estimated that 75 percent of Georgia's peach crop, valued at $20 million to $22 million a year, was sold out of state. Roy Rom, a horticulturalist with the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, said snow and cold might have damaged as much as 90 percent of the apple and peach crops in northwest Arkansas. In North Carolina, Bobby Fryar of McLeansville, a peach grower, tried to save the 2,000 trees in his orchard by spraying water to form a protective coating of ice. But he said it did not work because temperatures did not rise enough to melt the ice. ---- Drainage Plan Studied THISTLE, Utah, April 20 (UPI) - Officials decided today to drain the lake in Spanish Fork Canyon created by the mud slide, but they still must figure out who will pay for the work. Bruce Kaliser, a state geologist, said geologists believed they could safely drill new shafts around the slide to draw down the lake. The water, building up behind the slide, would be siphoned off downstream through an old tunnel. Tim St. Claire, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation, said, ''The problem we have now is deciding who is going to pay for it.''

17-> SCOUTING; U.S.F.L. in City: 1985 Is the Plan
If a United States Football League team plays in New York it will not be until the 1985 season, Chet Simmons, the commissioner, said yesterday. John Bassett, the Tampa Bay owner who heads the league's expansion committee, has held several meetings recently with Simmons to discuss that possibility. ''A team in New York would be a new franchise, rather than one of the original 12 teams,'' Simmons said. ''We have had contact with at least three people representing groups who have an interest in operating a team in New York. They all believe it is healthy territory. We must understand that the New Jersey Generals have territorial rights to the New York metropolitan area. There would have to be an indemnity payment if the Generals opened the territory.'' Bassett said that J. Walter Duncan, the owner of the Generals, had agreed to accept a team in New York for an indemnity figure that has been ''established, but is not being given out.'' In a statement, Duncan said: ''We will not put a number on it. We would discuss it with the principal or principals at the appropriate time.'' Bassett said he had talked ''for two minutes'' to Fred Wilpon, the president of the Mets, about the availability of Shea Stadium during the U.S.F.L. season, which runs from March until July, when the Mets play baseball games. The Mets have a restrictive lease with the city in regard to sharing Shea Stadium with other teams. ''He was less than thrilled,'' said Bassett. ''He wouldn't want his grass fouled up.'' George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, said from Tampa that ''no one has approached us'' about the possible availability of Yankee Stadium for a new U.S.F.L. team.

18-> AROUND THE WORLD; French Hold Armenians In Orly Airport Bombing
The French police have arrested six Armenians here and a seventh in Marseilles on suspicion that they were involved in the July bombing that killed eight people at Orly Airport, police sources said today. The Armenian in Marseilles was seized as he got off a train from Paris today. The sources said he was believed to be the one who made the bomb out of gas bottles packed into a suitcase. (The police identified him as Nayir Soner, 22 years old, Reuters said.) The police said the six others were arrested here Thursday and Friday. Responsibility for the July 15 attack at the Turkish Airlines counter at Orly was claimed by the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, a terrorist group. Two days after the attack, the police arrested Varadjian Garbidjian, 29, an Armenian who admitted being the person who had placed the bomb.

He'll explain how Wall Street is affected by its Dutch past, how buildings such as Fraunces Tav- GOG Jump ern were saved from demolition and why the old Custom House is as functional as any modern buildings going up. The cost is $8, and no reservations are required. The meeting place is in front of the Old Custom House on Bowling Green. Information: 935-3969. FUTURISTIC CONVENTION Science-fiction and comic-book fans can indulge themselves at the Sheraton Centre Hotel, Seventh Avenue at 52d Street, Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. at the New York Science Fiction Multimedia Convention. Dealers will offer merchandise for sale and trade, vintage films will be shown and new ones previewed, and there will be auctions, slide shows and contests. Guests will speak both days, among them the author Harlan Ellison, the actress Bibi Besch and Ray Harryhausen, master of special effects, who will show excerpts of his films and explain how they were done. Tickets each day are $10. A 'VILLAGE' BLOCKS PARTY Every year, in a picturesque quarter of Greenwich Village, residents of Bedford, Barrow and Commerce Streets give a bountiful party outdoors. They call it ''Ye Old Village Fair,'' and it spills onto Seventh Avenue and Christopher and Hudson Streets. This year's event - on Saturday or, if it rains, Sunday, from noon to 10:30 P.M. or so - will bring together about 250 vendors of crafts, antiques, bargains and ethnic foods. There will be a cafe near the Cherry Lane Theater serving draft beer, wine and soft drinks. Bluegrass, big-band and classical music will be played, and dancing in the streets will be encouraged. Profits will help rebuild St. Luke's in the Fields, the historic church on Hudson Street damaged by fire. Sunday BROOKLYN ZANY PARADE Nestled beside and under the Brooklyn Bridge on Brooklyn's Dock Street is a two-acre expanse of lawn and shrubs called the Empire-Fulton State Park. It has a waterfront boardwalk with splendid views of the East River, Lower Manhattan and the harbor, and a stage area for performances. Sunday at 2 P.M., the Bond Street Theater will be there with a free show. It will consist of a parade of zany and mythical characters in costumes and masks and a ''mini-circus,'' with clowns, acrobats, jugglers, stilt walkers, fire twirlers, a magician and unicyclists. Directions: 977-8240. BOOKS BY THE POUND The Brooklyn Public Library conducts a weighty affair now and then to raise funds for new books. It sells used books for 50 cents a pound. Some 10,000 books, mostly in hard covers, will be on hand, as will magazines, for 10 cents each, on Sunday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. in the parking area of the central library on Flatbush Avenue near Grand Army Plaza. Admission is free. And, for those with some heavy reading in store, complimentary library shopping bags will be provided. Clowns and a brass band will entertain. The rain date is next Sunday. BIRDS IN THE GARDEN Experts will help you spot birds or wildflowers, photograph nature or find food to survive if you're lost in the wilderness during a series of walks presented by the Audubon Society on Sunday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. at the New York Botanical Garden. The main attraction on the bird walks will be warblers, just in for spring. As many as 20 varieties are in town, but they are hard to distinguish because they are all small (4 to 6 inches), they dart quickly and they have similar coloring: most are yellow, although some are red, orange and blue. Tickets are $8 ($4 for children) and include all walks and a guided visit to the Conservatory. A picnic lunch is suggested. The rain date is June 5. Information: 691-7483. SHEEP IN STAMFORD The process of obtaining wool and making things with it will be explored on Sheep-to-Shawl Day at the Stamford (Conn.) Museum and Nature Center on Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M. Experts will shear sheep, wash a sheep, talk about cleaning, sorting and dyeing wool, demonstrate spinning wheels and weave a shawl. In addition, Simon, a sheepdog, will demonstrate his work. Admission to the museum is $2 ($1 for under-16's and over-65's, $6 maximum for a carfull). The site is three-quarters of a mile north of Exit 35 on the Merritt Parkway at the junction of Scofieldtown and High Ridge Roads. Information: (203) 322-1646.

20-> HELP FOR WORKERS LACKING CONTRACTS
For the more than 70 percent of American workers who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement or an individual employment contract, dismissal is an ever-present possibility. The nation's courts have traditionally ruled that such employees can be dismissed at any time - for any reason or for no reason - a status known as ''employment at will.'' That status is becoming a thing of the past, though, as more and more courts around the country are taking steps to help protect workers, either by finding in the working arrangement an implied contract or implied guarantee of fair dealing, or by going even further and finding that unjust dismissal was a civil offense for which the employer should pay punitive damages. In New York and several other states, courts have found implied contracts, and therefore legal protection against dismissal, in the statements of company policy found in employee handbooks. ''Employment-at-will has become an issue that is a real worry to many companies,'' said William Isaacson, a New York lawyer who represents employers. ''All kinds of employers are beginning to talk about how to protect themselves from lawsuits by employees that have been discharged.'' '' Much of the worry, at least in New York, stems from a November decision from the state's highest court, ruling that Walton Lewis Weiner, who was dismissed by McGraw-Hill Inc. in 1977, could sue for breach of an implied contract. ''I was very surprised by the firing,'' Mr. Weiner said recently. ''I worked there for seven years and I didn't think they could just call me in and do that. They have an active program of informing people of the McGraw-Hill code of ethics, a part of which is that people would be dismissed only after all other possible steps for curing the problem have been exhausted. I didn't even get any warning.'' The court agreed with Mr. Wein-er, based on a statement in the McGraw-Hill manual that employees would be dismissed ''for just and sufficient cause only, and only after all practical steps toward rehabilitation have been taken and failed.'' According to Peter Panken, a New York labor lawyer who represents employers, statements in the manual specifically referring to dismissal are ''not the only things to worry about.'' ''If the manual says there's a probationary period after which the worker becomes a permanent employee, or even if the application form says there's a probationary period, that, too, could create an implied contract,'' he said. ''Any employer in New York who hasn't taken a good hard look at his application and manual since the Weiner case is setting himself up for problems. I'm telling our clients that they should add some language to the effect of, 'If hired, I understand I can leave at any time or can be fired at any time.' '' Judith Vladeck, a New York lawyer who represents workers, says such disclaimers can cause their own problems: ''If you begin your relationship with an employee by saying, 'we owe you nothing,' you know what kind of people you're going to have working for you? They're going to have absolutely no institutional loyalty.'' A Popular Response Nonetheless, disclaimers seem to be a popular response to the increasing erosion of employment-at-will across the nation. While the Weiner case was a breakthrough in New York, it was only following the trend of similar cases elsewhere, especially California, where courts have for several years been sympathetic to employees' claims that they were wrongly dismissed. Some recent cases have even found an implied contract where there is no handbook or other document supplied by the employer. A few states, including Massachusetts and New Hampshire, take a different legal approach, ruling that every employment agreement carries with it an implied guarantee of fair dealing. And a few state courts have gone even further, ruling that wrongful discharge, even where there is no contract, is a civil offense for which companies may have to pay huge punitive damages. New York's highest court rejected these arguments March 29, in a case involving the dismissal of an assistant treasurer at the American Home Products Corporation. ''Those jurisdictions that have modified the traditional at-will rule appear to have been motivated by conclusions that individual employees in the modern work force do not have the bargaining power to negotiate security for the jobs on which they have grown to rely, and that the rule yields harsh results for those employees who do not enjoy the benefits of express contractual limitations on the power of dismissal,'' the New York State Court of Appeals decision said. State Legislatures Involved But, the court said, if the employment-at-will arrangement is to be altered, it should be up to the state legislature to do so. In some states, the legislatures are beginning to take an interest in protecting employee's rights, with several, including New York, now considering legislation that would in some way limit employers' powers to dismiss at will. ''Even in the old mills and mines, people got a gold watch and a handshake, but now, vice presidents who have spent 20 years at a company are told, 'Clean out your desk tomorrow; here's your severance pay','' Mrs. Vladeck said. ''Most of the people who come to me about unfair discharges are middle managers. If employers had the sense to deal civilly with their managers, much of this bitterness would not be engendered. I think what's happening is very important, because for the first time, there is an effort to provide fairness for non-represented workers. '' Mr. Panken says the tremendous rise in the number of lawsuits challenging dismissal is due in large part to the high unemployment rate. ''In the old days, when there was 5 or 6 percent unemployment, most people who were fired got new jobs and concentrated their attention on them,'' he said. ''Now, it takes much longer to find a job, so people have more time to think about the unfairness of it all, and to sue.'' Mr. Weiner himself is a perfect example. Dismissed in 1977, the 57-year-old copywriter has had a hard time getting work. ''I am doing some freelance work now,'' he said. ''I had a staff job for a while, but then there were layoffs, and since I was the last one hired, I was the first to go.''

23-> SCOUTING; Trying to Track A Record in Flux
For 56 years, Walter Johnson held the major league career strikeout record. Then Nolan Ryan broke it. Then Steve Carlton broke Ryan's record. Then Ryan tied Carlton. Then Carlton retook the record. Now Ryan, with 7 strikeouts Wednesday night, has moved ahead, 3,548 to 3,545. But wait: Carlton pitches against the Mets at Shea Stadium tonight. ''To be continued,'' said Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports Bureau, which handles major league baseball's statistics. Hirdt said that no new editions of the record book were planned until after the season. In the meantime, he said, the bureau has kept the running score and supplied an updated count to all stadiums each time one of the strikeout artists is pitching. ''I can't remember another situation where two active players are breaking a major record depending on which one pitched last,'' said Hirdt. ''The amazing thing about it is that after Ryan broke Johnson's record, he got hurt and was out just long enough to let Carlton catch up. Then he came back at just the right time.'' Johnson's record was not the oldest on the books. In fact, there is a record that dates from the first season of the National League, in 1876. George Washington Bradley, pitching for St. Louis, threw 16 shutouts that year, a record tied by Grover Cleveland Alexander of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1916. ''You've obviously got to be named for a President to have that record,'' Hirdt said. ''I suppose there's some 3-year-old kid named Richard Milhous Smith out there throwing a ball against a wall.''

24-> AROUND THE WORLD; Soviet, Silent on Prize, Again Assails Walesa
The Soviet newspaper Izvestia described Lech Walesa today as a money-grubbing, foul-mouthed demagogue, without mentioning his Nobel Peace Prize. The portrait of Mr. Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, echoed previous Soviet descriptions depicting him as a paid Western agent. Under the headline ''Dollars That Smell Nasty,'' Izvestia reported on a recent broadcast on Polish television that replayed an tape said to be of a conversation between Mr. Walesa and his brother. The tape showed Mr. Walesa trying to persuade his brother, Stanislaw, to emigrate to the West to manage his finances. ''In front of the viewers, the real Walesa presented himself without mask and without the rhetoric of the demagogue,'' Izvestia said. ''The West paid Walesa generously for sowing hatred and anarchy in Poland. Not just 30 pieces of silver. He has become the owner of more than a million dollars of property.''

27-> RED TAPE BLOCKS BAYSIDE STREET REPAIR
There is a stretch of Bell Boulevard in Bayside, Queens, that is a country-like road, a narrow street lined with graceful trees, comfortable homes and broad expanses of lawn. It is the kind of street that seems more suitable to a suburb than to one of the five boroughs. It is also a street that has become local legend - Bell Boulevard, from 26th to 35th Avenue, is cracked, rippled, pockmarked and potholed. Isabelle Brusselars, who has lived on the street since 1942, says it has got so bad that she and her husband go around the block to avoid it. Leonard Caruso, a neighborhood painter and paperhanger, even has a theory. ''I figure they left Bell that way to keep the speed down,'' he said. Prodded by Developers Bell Boulevard is in a severe state of disintegration, and that is not all that unusual for city streets. What sets Bell Boulevard apart is that city officials have no immediate plans to repair it, in part because of financial constraints, but mostly because of a mistake that the city made more than a decade ago. The story of Bell Boulevard dates to the late-1960's, when northern Bayside, a quiet area dotted with one-family homes and acres of pheasant-laden woods, was on the brink of major development. The Bay Terrace Shopping Center had been built and so had some six-story apartment complexes; the city, prodded by the developers, decided it needed to widen Bell Boulevard - then just one lane in each direction. Engineering studies were completed and plans were drawn up, and what was regarded as a minor problem was seemingly resolved. The street was to be widened from 35 feet to 49 by adding five feet from the west side of the street and nine from the east. Most of that was owned by people who lived along Bell Boulevard; they had to be paid for their land, and they were. Records in the County Clerk's office show that the city paid $292,789 for title to 143 parcels of land for the widening from 35th Avenue to the Cross Island Parkway - 1.5 miles. By the early 70's, the improvement was ready to get under way. Opposition From the Community Except for one detail. The city had neglected to consult the community. Community boards were not as powerful as they are now, nor were they a formal part of the planning process. The city was not officially required to take planning issues before community boards until the Charter revision of 1975. But the Lindsay administration decided to bring the matter to the people of Bayside. In November 1973, the local board met in the Methodist Church of Bayside at 38-20 Bell Boulevard. The meeting was well attended, and the people were angry, Bernard Haber, chairman of the board, recalled. The community said that it did not want the roadway from 26th to 35th Avenues any broader than it was. The neighborhood was concerned about changing the quiet street into a main thoroughfare and about the number of tall, graceful trees that would have to be chopped down. The vote was no. The board played only an advisory role, but the opposition was so strong that the city halted its plans. There were no objections to improving the northern stretch of Bell Boulevard, from 26th Avenue to the Cross Island Parkway. It was only partly developed, so it could easily accommodate a wider street, Mr. Haber said, and that part of the road was eventually improved. 'No Man's Land' For the other few blocks, the Community Board opted for a simple resurfacing instead. But the city, although willing to respect the opposition to a wider Bell Boulevard, said the situation was more complex. ''The city acquired the land,'' Henry C. Sloan, Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Transportation, said, referring to the parcels bought for the widening. ''It paid property owners for that land. Now the city wants to go back to the original width. But legally those two strips on either side of Bell are a no man's land.'' Mr. Sloan insisted that the problem was more than a legal technicality and that it would have to be corrected formally, either by the Board of Estimate or the City Planning Commission. ''The city could always sell that land to someone who decided to build, say, a dog run,'' he said. ''That would always be hanging over the homeowners' heads. Besides, the city paid out the money.'' Most of the $292,789 went to people living along the area of Bell Boulevard that was never widened, and that money could not be forgiven, Mr. Sloan said. ''The city doesn't work that way.'' Nor is it likely that the homeowners - some of whom have moved away from the neighborhood - would voluntarily return the money they were paid. The Community Board and the Borough President's office are working on proposals. Mr. Haber, who is an engineer, has drawn up a comprehensive plan for improving Bell Boulevard, and his idea has received initial city approval. But the financial issue still has to be resolved before repairs can be made.

30-> FOOTLOOSE IN THE HAREM
To the Editor: Howard Chua-Eoan's letter (July 14) about Manchu women in the harems of the emperors not having bound feet is essentially correct, and I never denied it. In fact I corrected a guide in the Summer Palace who said that the Dowager Empress Tsu-Hsi had bound feet by pointing out that one could see in her photographs that this was not so.ut I still insist that bound feet were generally considered erotic in upper-class imperial China, and I quote from Marina Warner's life of the Empress: ''Manchu women often longed to adopt the erotic and status-giving deformation, and intermittent imperial edicts had to remind them that foot-binding was strictly against Manchu laws and customs.''

31-> LIBYA, IRKED AT BONN, HOLDS GERMANS
Libya has arrested eight West Germans and charged them with espionage and other crimes in what officials here say is a reprisal for the trial of two Libyans accused of torturing other Libyans at a diplomatic residence. Trying to ease the situation, West Germany sent a Foreign Ministry State Secretary, Jurgen Mollemann, to Tripoli last weekend to seek the release of the eight, who are employees of oil companies and other private concerns. One official said Mr. Mollemann had a long conversation with Maj. Abdel Salam Jalloud, the second man in the Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and explored the possibility of freeing a Libyan who is serving a life sentence in West Germany for assassinating an enemy of Colonel Qaddafi three years ago in Bonn. West Germany's seeming willingness to compromise reflects the dense network of ties between Bonn and Tripoli. Some 3,000 West Germans work in Libya, Libya is West Germany's second largest oil supplier and West German exports to Libya totaled $1.1 billion last year. The trial of the two Libyans in Bonn grew out of the complaint of Libyan students last November of having been mistreated by representatives of the Libyan Embassy. Charges were brought against Mustapha Zaidi, a 31-year-old medical doctor who had been connected to the Bonn University Clinic, and Salem Yahia, a 30-year-old student. On April 7, as the trial date neared, a demonstration took place before the West German Embassy in Tripoli. The Libyan press agency said the protest was against the ''premeditated attempt to belittle the scientific rank and the humanitarin mission of doctors.'' The opposition in Libya has accused Dr. Zaidi of being responsible for the deaths of students in Benghazi. Testimony About Torture When the trial opened here Monday, El-Hadj el-Gariani, a 31-yearold student, testified that Dr. Zaidi and Mr. Yahia had held him and another student overnight in the ambassador's residence and tortured them and threatened to kill them. Mr. Gariani said he was beaten with clubs and wire cable and lighted cigarettes were poked in his eyes to try to make him provide the names of other Libyans opposed to the Qaddafi Government. The student is reported to have belonged to a fundamentalist Islamic group. ''We screamed out, but most of the time we were gagged,'' the student testified Tuesday, adding that Dr. Zaidi was a close friend of Colonel Qaddafi and a leading figure in Libya's revolutionary committees. The choice of Mr. Mollemann, a prominent figure in the small Free Democratic Party, to intervene was appropriate. The State Secretary is the head of the private German-Arab Society and has had wellpublicized meetings with Colonel Qaddafi and Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Two years ago, Mr. Mollemann invited Colonel Qaddafi to a symposium of the German-Arab Society for what would have been a semiofficial visit to West Germany. But Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor at the time, scotched the idea. A Qaddafi Campaign According to an official privy to the State Secretary's conversations in Tripoli, Mr. Mollemann told Major Jalloud that West Germany felt strongly about acts of violence committed by Libyans here. The official said Bonn was considering freeing Bashir Ehmida, a 29-year-old Libyan who in 1980 shot another Libyan dead in the center of Bonn. The killing was a strand in a campaign proclaimed by Colonel Qaddafi to ''liquidate'' his opponents abroad. Mr. Ehmida was sentenced to life in prison. The Libyan case is the second of its kind this year to pit West German demands for justice against diplomacy. On Jan. 8, Sadegh Tabatabai, an Iranian and confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was seized at Dusseldorf airport with nearly four pounds of raw opium. He claimed diplomatic immunity as the Ayatollah's special envoy. For weeks, the Foreign Ministry, which was disposed to recognize his immunity, wrestled with the Interior Ministry, which was not. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was known to be concerned about the fate of West Germans living in Iran. Finally, on March 10, four days after the West German election, Mr. Tabatabai was allowed to leave the country as a court condemned him to three years in prison. He was declared persona non grata.

32-> MORE HARM THAN HELP
To the Editor: President Reagan's statement that the U.S. is simply trying to interdict the flow of arms from Nicaragua (news story April 15) insults the intelligence of the American people. It flies in the face of testimony given by many anti-Sandinist guerrillas we are backing and who seek the overthrow of the Managua Government. But even without this testimony, the President's argument is spurious. Honduras is friendly. With enough information to make interdiction possible, its military and police, happy to cooperate, could stop the shipments in Honduran territory. Few Americans have any sympathy for the radical Sandinist commanders, but most have the good sense to perceive that a ''secret'' war is not an effective way to address the problem. Besides its dubious legality, it probably helps the Sandinists more than it harms them. WAYNE S. SMITH, Washington, April 15, 1983

Newark International Airport will receive a $4 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its facilities for noncommercial aircraft, Governor Kean announced today. The Governor, citing an increase in noncommercial activity at the airport, said the money would be used to extend three taxiways to the noncommercial, or general aviation, section at the southwest area of the airport. According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, noncommercial takeoffs and landings increased from 29,920 in 1981 to 33,906 last year and this year are running more than 5 percent ahead of 1982 figures. The total cost of the project, which is being overseen by the Port Authority, will exceed $6 million. Construction will begin next month and is to be completed in two years.

35-> MAJOR SOVIET-LED DRIVE IS REPORTED IN AFGHAN WAR
A Western diplomat said Tuesday that a major Soviet-led offensive was reportedly under way in northwest Afghanistan against rebel positions. Heavy casualties were reported in the fighting, which was said to be continuing on the outskirts of Herat, near the Iranian border. The informant quoted a diplomatic report from Kabul, the Afghan capital, as saying Soviet and Afghan Government troops opened the assault after making heavy air attacks on Herat areas suspected of sheltering Moslem guerrillas opposed to the Government of President Babrak Karmal. The drive, which apparently began some time this month, reportedly followed several major rebel attacks on Soviet and Afghan forces. The offensive came amid preparations in Kabul for observances of the fourth anniversary of the military coup of April 27, 1978, which placed the first of three pro-Soviet Marxist Governments in power in Kabul. Heavy fighting was also reported this month between Soviet troops and insurgents around the southern cities of Kandahar and Ghazni and at Mazar-i-Sharif, near the Afghan-Soviet frontier. A major insurgent victory was reported from the northern Panjshir Valley, through which the main highway connecting Kabul with the Soviet Union runs. There three rival Afghan rebel factions were said to have united for an ambush on April 1 of a large Soviet-Afghan military convoy. Many soldiers were reported killed and many others captured. Rival Rebels Said to Unite The three rebel groups involved in what the diplomat said was a rare display of unity were identified as the Hezbe-i-Islami, the Jamat-i-Islami and the Harakat-i-Islami. The diplomat said Ahmed Masoud, the chief guerrilla leader in the valley, did not participate. Mr. Masoud is regarded as a hero in some parts of Afghanistan for the manner in which he and his bands have thrown back several invasions of their strategic valley by Soviet and Afghan soldiers. On April 2, guerrillas reportedly overran a military post in southern Kabul, killing or capturing all the troops. The insurgents were said to have been aided by an Afghan soldier at the post. The diplomatic report said Kabul had been relatively quiet for the last week. On April 3, however, a noisy and violent demonstration reportedly erupted in the center of the capital after a Soviet soldier shot and killed a young Afghan student after a brief quarrel. Hundreds of Kabul residents were said to have shouted anti-Soviet slogans and hurled rocks at the Russian soldier and his vehicle after the shooting. Order was restored when Afghan troops arrived, disarmed the Russian and took him away. Tuesday's diplomatic report also told of rebel attacks on a Government center in Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city. In one assault, the report said, insurgants attacked the secret police headquarters and killed six policemen.

36-> Larry Gains, Fighter Who Held Two Titles
Larry Gains, a Canadian-born heavyweight boxer who defeated Max Schmeling and Primo Carnera but never got a chance for the world title that they later won, died Tuesday while visiting relatives in Cologne. He was 83 years old. Gains, who lived in London and became the British Empire champion, knocked out Schmeling in Cologne in 1925, and seven years later in London, outpointed Carnera. Thirteen months later, Carnera won the world championship from Jack Sharkey. Gains, who was black, was the Canadian champion from 1927 to 1930, but was prevented from becoming champion of his adopted Britain. The explanation, which virtually ruled out black fighters of the day, was that a boxer qualified for the British championship only if both his parents had been born in Europe. Instead, the British Empire title was invented, more or less just for him. Race also played a role in Gains's lack of opportunity for the world title. No black got a chance to fight for the championship from 1915, when Jack Johnson lost the title to Jess Willard, to 1937, when Joe Louis won it from Jim Braddock. ''For me, the world title was always the impossible dream, the unreachable star,'' Gains said shortly before his death. ''The politics of the day was against it. But I have no bitterness or regrets.''

37-> 3 SEIZED IN BRONX SHOOTOUT IN POLICE RUSE TO BUY ARMS
A man and woman were shot yesterday during a gun battle in a Bronx motel parking lot after members of a joint F.B.I.-police antiterrorist unit surrounded a van transporting stolen guns and other weapons, the authorities said. The wounded pair and another man who was in the van were captured. Seventeen pistols, 17 rifles and shotguns, 20 knives and a canister of Chemical Mace were in the van, according to the officials. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Joseph Valiquette, said the people in the van had intended to sell the weapons to terrorists, but ended up dealing with F.B.I. agents posing as terrorists. The exchange of gunfire, involving shotguns and handguns, left the parking lot of the Capri Whitestone Motel, near the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, littered with spent shells. Police Vehicle Rammed One investigator said the F.B.I. agents and city detectives had fired seven rounds from shotguns and 19 rounds from handguns after an occupant of the van, sitting in the passenger's seat, had opened fire with a Derringer. Two loaded automatic weapons were found at his feet. The driver of the van, a 25-year-old woman, rammed a police vehicle in a vain attempt to escape. Kenneth Walton, deputy assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.'s New York office, said members of the law-enforcement group had staked out the parking lot, waiting for a blue van that was taking a cache of weapons from Florida to sell in New York. Asked who the three were supposed to have met at the motel, Mr. Walton said, ''They were supposed to meet us, only they did not know it.'' 'No Way' to Escape Mr. Valiquette said that members of the F.B.I.-police force had been in contact with the group during the weekend and, pretending to be terrorists who wanted to buy guns, had arranged to make the purchase at the motel. Mr. Valiquette did not say how the initial contact had been made. When the van, a Chevrolet with Florida license plates, pulled into the lot at 555 Hutchinson River Parkway at about 11 A.M., it was surrounded by members of the force. A police helicopter hovered. ''There was just no way they were going to escape,'' a detective said. Ignoring orders to surrender, one of the passengers, tentatively identified as John D. Schwerin of Jackson, Mo., 20 years old, fired twice, the authorities said. They said it was not clear whether anyone else in the van also fired. Five detectives and three Federal agents returned the fire. Mr. Schwerin was struck near the left eye and in the neck and left leg. He was taken to Jacobi Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition. The driver, Linda Carbonetti, for whom no address was given, was wounded in the lower back and was in good condition at Jacobi. The other passenger, Robert Boitnott, 24, of Key West, Fla., was not hurt. No one in the police force was hurt. The F.B.I. said the three people would probably be charged with assault on a Federal officer, interstate transportation of stolen firearms and possession of a sawed-off shotgun.

40-> Poland Again In Debt Talks
Representatives of leading Western creditor banks began a new round of discussions today on rescheduling Poland's debts falling due in 1983, an official of Bank Handlowy, the Polish foreign trade bank, said today. But the aide declined to give details. Poland's debts to Western commercial banks due this year are estimated by the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies at $1.2 billion. Another $1.7 billion of credits granted directly by Western governments or guaranteed by them also mature in 1983. Total interest payments due in 1983 amount to $3.1 billion, the institute said. Poland's total outstanding hard-currency debt at the end of last year was $25 billion, Polish officials have said. Diplomatic sources said the current talks, expected to last a few days, were unlikely to be conclusive.

Japan plans to raise its import quotas for beef, oranges and fruit juices by up to 30 percent for three years, the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported. The report said the actions were designed to reduce trade friction with the United States. The newspaper said the import quota for high-quality beef would be increased about 30 percent; for oranges, about 10 percent, and for orange and grapefruit juices, a ''considerable margin.''

43-> TV MAILBAG
OPINIONS DIFFER ON EFFECT OF TV VIOLENCE To the Editor: As one of the authors of the NBC-sponsored study ''Television and Aggression,'' I would like to respond to some of the more obvious misconceptions in John Corry's essay ''The Networks Shrug Off Violence'' (July 31). Contrary to Mr. Corry's suggestion that the networks fired the opening salvo, the early ''rumblings'' about the National Institute of Mental Health report came from the Justice Department, which commissioned the National Academy of Sciences to review the N.I.M.H. report for possible policy implications of the report's claim that television causes aggression. The National Academy of Sciences - the recognized agency for evaluating research in this country - commissioned Prof. Thomas Cook to evaluate the N.I.M.H. report. Dr. Cook questioned virtually all of that report's conclusions and his position was essentially accepted by the Academy's conference addressing the issue. His evaluation of the N.I.M.H. report was recently published in the Public Opinion Quarterly. In his evaluation, Dr. Cook calls our study ''exemplary.'' In fact, he devotes to our study 8 out of the 15 pages of his paper that deal with the violence issue. He points out that it has the kind of design called for by the 1972 Surgeon General's committee, because it allows causal inferences. Dr. Cook states: ''It is widely agreed that the best method for studying television effects involves longitudinal panel studies.'' Further, although he does not agree with all our conclusions, he calls our method of data analysis ''state-of-the-art.'' This totally contradicts Mr. Corry's unfounded assertion that the methods used in our research were designed to make it ''unlikely'' that television effects could be shown. The claim that NBC ''shrugs off'' violence also is unfounded. Our abiding concern with this subject is documented by our involvement with the Surgeon General's investigation in the early 70's, by our efforts to conduct a major study on this issue and offer it for public evaluation, and by our constant vigilance over how it is depicted in our programs. Finally, Mr. Corry is wrong in asserting that the study will be used to justify increases in the amount of violence in NBC's programs. We have stated explicitly that our policy regarding the depiction of violence will not change and this study will not be used as a pretext to relax our standards. WILLIAM S. RUBENS Vice President, Research, NBC

44-> 6 ARAB STATES SET OIL PRICE MEETING
Oil ministers from six Persian Gulf exporting countries are to meet Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a common strategy on oil prices, Saudi Arabia announced today. In addition, Algeria today called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to head off a price war that, it said, could cost the 13-member organization $30 billion in lost revenues this year. The Riyadh meeting, to be conducted by Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, will bring together the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which, in addition to Saudi Arabia, includes Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman. All except Bahrain and Oman are OPEC members. Account for Half of OPEC's Oil The six nations, which formed the council in 1980 to provide a sense of security against two often threatening neighbors, Iraq and Iran, account for about half of OPEC's total exports and own more than a third of all the world's oil reserves. Foreign ministers from the six countries concluded two days of talks on Sunday in Riyadh at which the oil crisis was extensively discussed. And today, a leading Saudi paper reported that the council's members were considering price cuts of between $5.50 and $7 a barrel. But officials here say the foreign ministers are leaving it to the oil ministers to decide what strategy the members should follow. Reinforcing fears of an imminent collapse of oil prices, prices of crude oil fell sharply on the Amsterdam spot oil market today. British North Sea crude slumped nearly $1 for a 42-gallon barrel, to $28.10, its lowest level of the year. Saudi Light, the price-setting OPEC crude, dropped 65 cents, to $28.75 a barrel, although its official price is still $34 a barrel. The specter of an oil-price war was raised on Saturday, when Nigeria, an OPEC member, unilaterally reduced its oil price by $5.50, to $30 a barrel, saying it could no longer sell enough oil at the official OPEC price to meet its revenue needs. The Nigerian move came after two big non-OPEC oil producers, Britain and Norway, had proposed a cut in their prices of $3, to $30.50 a barrel, because of falling demand, although in the past they have aligned prices with OPEC levels. Further Reductions Threatened The Nigerians also made clear they would cut their price further if anyone tried to undersell them. This could lead to oil prices spiraling downward and possibly to the dissolution of OPEC. The group quadrupled oil prices in 1974 and has kept them moving higher ever since. The current round of price cutting was spurred by OPEC's failure to agree at a Geneva meeting last month on new production ceilings and price ratios proposed by the Gulf states. Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies argued then that OPEC's price structure, based on a $34 a barrel base price for Saudi Light with premiums for better grades, could only be preserved by production cutbacks in the face of an international oversupply caused by the recession and increased conservation. But Nigeria, Iran and other poorer members said they could not afford to reduce their share of the market and called on the rich Gulf states to bear a larger portion of the reduction in output. At the time, Sheik Yamani warned that if he did not get its way, Saudi Arabia might begin a price war with its OPEC partners. He indicated then that the Gulf countries, with their huge financial resources and small populations, would suffer less from falling oil prices than other poorer and more densely populated OPEC members who would then agree to stabilize prices again by reducing output. A Time for Action Diplomats and analysts here say that Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners must decide soon whether to carry out their threats. But a price cut as large as $7 a barrel would also be a direct challenge to Nigeria to lower its price again, these experts said. Cuts of this magnitude, observers here say, would price Saudi crude at $27 a barrel, or $3 below Nigeria's new level. This would reestablish the traditional premium that Nigerian crude has commanded over Saudi oil in the past because of its high quality and the country's proximity to Western markets. Diplomats and oil industry analysts here speculate that the press report about a reduction might be a warning signal from Saudi Arabia that it is indeed prepared to take tough action to hold OPEC together. But several doubted that, in the end, the conservative Saudi leadership would agree to strong-armed tactics of this kind, which might do irreparable damage to OPEC. A less drastic strategy, according to these sources, would be for the Gulf states to cut their prices by about $4 a barrel, to $30, or roughly in line with Nigeria. This would reduce Nigeria's price advantage over the rest of OPEC and encourage all members of the organization to work out a new pricing structure and respect the output ceilings needed to defend it.

45-> SCHOOL VOTING: A LONG COUNT BEGINS
In many ways, it seemed like a throwback to the old days - paper ballots, cardboard ballot boxes, candidates and their aides closely watching tally clerks spill the ballots from the boxes and start counting. The scene was the Junior High School 143 gymnasium at 515 West 182d Street yesterday and the occasion, the start of the complicated proportional representation count of the May 3 school board election results. The count of some 200,000 ballots for 288 seats in 32 school districts throughout the city is likely to take up to a week. The counters will work weekends. The count was delayed nine days to permit the arrival of absentee ballots. The tally in District 6 in Washington Heights, Inwood and Harlem north of 135th Street was particularly significant because of a strong effort by a slate of candidates affiliated with Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. to win representation on the local school board in an area where many leaders of the movement live. The group, once the U.S. Labor Party, is now called the National Democratic Policy Conference. Vote Total Increases The LaRouche effort and an opposition campaign by local politicians, parent groups and unions raised the vote in District 6 from 8,361 in 1980 to about 13,000 this year. The count began when Gerald Dienel, director of the vote count for District 6, solemnly unsealed the first of 124 ballot boxes. He dumped 38 ballots on a table, then lifted and partly dismantled the box so that about 30 observers could see it was empty. The remaining ballot boxes lined the gym floor behind a handwritten sign: ''Do Not Cross This Line.'' Mr. Dienel warned the onlookers that another problem already discovered was that adjacent District 5 ballots had been used in some parts of District 6 and that voters had crossed out the District 5 names and substituted the names of District 6 candidates. He said these ballots would be counted. There were 34 candidates for the nine board seats in District 6. Mr. Dienel, a biochemist, is being paid $750 for his services. He is directing a staff that includes an assistant director, who is paid $450, an accountant at $350, eight supervisors at $200 each and 25 tally clerks, $3.35 an hour. That is typical of the work force for a school district. Many workers are recommended by local political clubs. Adding to the cost is a 24-hour police guard during the count and transportation of the ballot boxes. In contrast, voting machine results are counted on one day merely by checking an automatic counter at the rear of the machine. Paper ballots are necessary under proportional representation because voters rank candidates by number. The system is intended to provide representation for candidates from minority groups by allowing excess votes for candidates to be transferred to other candidates. The system could allow the LaRouche group to win some seats. The faction has failed to win recent municipal and state elections in which an outright majority was necessary. Councilman Stanley E. Michels of Manhattan, who had been a leader of the anti-LaRouche effort and was an observer yesterday, said he opposed proportional representation because ''it lends itself to abuse by political factions.'' Another observer, Betty Dolen, executive director of the Board of Elections, said she opposed the system because a candidate should be required to ''get a true majority without going next door to borrow somebody's leftovers,'' a reference to the vote transfers from candidate to candidate. A school board member seeking re-election, Carmen I. Rodriguez, said she preferred voting machines for quick counts. Even a LaRouche-affiliated candidate, Dianne Oliver, said she opposed the system because of its ''circus'' atmosphere at the polls and during the count.

46-> IN THE NATION; 2 DANGEROUS DOCTRINES
President Reagan has now proclaimed and presumably bases his policy upon two dangerous doctrines: * The Soviet Union is ''the focus of evil in the modern world'' and ''an evil empire,'' while Americans are ''enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus Christ to oppose ... with all our might'' the ''sin and evil in the world.'' * ''If guerrilla violence succeeds'' in El Salvador, that country ''will join Cuba and Nicaragua as a base for spreading fresh violence to Guatemala, Honduras, even Costa Rica. The killing will increase, and so will the threat to Panama, the Canal and ultimately Mexico.'' So what's ''at stake in the Caribbean and Central America ... is the United States national security.'' A Communist takeover reaching north to the Rio Grande would certainly threaten the United States. But in thus propounding a Central American domino theory, Mr. Reagan is inviting exactly the repetition of the Vietnam experience that he insists he will avoid. The President pledged again in his speech to the National Association of Manufacturers that he would not send combat troops to El Salvador, that he would not ''Americanize'' the war with combat advisers - that all he wanted was to send a few more non-combat ''trainers'' and more military assistance money to help the Salvadoran Army halt ''guerrilla violence.'' It's not cynicism, a Vietnam reflex or a slur on Mr. Reagan's sincerity to point out that John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson said all those things, too, about Vietnam in the early 60's. They also sought support for assisting South Vietnam by calling it a matter of protecting U.S. national security, which would be endangered, they said, if South Vietnam became the first falling domino in a line stretching through Southeast Asia all the way to the Philippines. Having so defined the situation, when American economic assistance, military training, weapons and supplies all failed to create a South Vietnamese Army capable of handling ''guerrilla violence'' and North Vietnamese intervention, Mr. Johnson felt he had no choice but to ''Americanize'' the war with 500,000 ground troops and fleets of bombers. Had he not himself preached that U.S. ''national security'' was at stake? That's the trap Mr. Reagan is now setting for himself, or his successor: If U.S. national security is endangered in El Salvador, but if all the non-combat training and assistance the U.S. can provide fails to halt ''guerrilla violence'' - which, the record suggests, is altogether likely - can the President stand by and see El Salvador become the first domino in a string reaching to the Rio Grande? Or will he not then be forced by his own words to stronger action? Staking the national security on a weak, rightist-tending Government of dubious popular acceptance is a substantial risk, in any case, for a U.S. widely regarded in Latin America as interventionist and self-interested. President Eisenhower well understood that kind of risk nearly 30 years ago, when he wisely refused to intervene to help the French in Indochina: ''Any nation that intervenes in a civil war can scarcely expect to win unless the side in whose favor it intervenes possesses a high morale based upon a war purpose or cause in which it believes,'' he wrote. No such ''high morale'' is visible in the Salvadoran Army. Later on, Eisenhower also concluded, ''The presence of ever more numbers of white men in uniform probably would have aggravated rather than assuaged Asiatic resentments.'' The Eisenhower model of 1954, in short, has a good deal more than the Johnson model of 1964 to offer Ronald Reagan in 1983. As the President himself told the N.A.M., ''Bullets are no answer to economic inequities, social tensions or political disagreements.'' In the long run, however, the greater danger lies in Mr. Reagan's vision of the superpower relationship as Good versus Evil, and his near-proclamation of holy war against ''an evil empire.'' Most of what I know about the Soviet regime I find repellent. But if the President of the United States proclaims to the world the view that this country's relationship with the Soviet Union is a death struggle with Evil, then his own words inevitably suggest that there can be no real compromise with that Evil -not on arms control or anything else. Knowing that, why should those proclaimed as ''the focus of evil'' believe in the possibility of real compromise with a U.S. dedicated to their destruction? The holy war mentality on either side tends to evoke it on the other; and holy wars are both the hardest to avoid and the least likely to be settled short of one side's annihilation. Perhaps even more dangerous, Mr. Reagan's smug view, if further inculcated in Americans, will preclude self-examination, humility, a willingness to concede error. Are we so clearly a God-directed, chosen people that we have no need to question our virtue, or the evil of our rivals? If Mr. Reagan really thinks so, he has shaken off the strongest restraints on human conduct - doubt and fear.

48-> ABOUT EDUCATION; COLLEGES CALLED MAJOR CULPRITS IN THESIS DELAY
EVERY year, academic careers are stalled and millions of dollars are wasted as thousands of graduate students fail to complete their dissertations and undergraduates default on last-minute requirements for commencement. It would appear that the students are sabotaging themselves. But, according to Dr. Adam Munz, much of the fault lies with collusion by universities, faculty members, students' colleagues, friends, spouses and therapists. The heaviest burden of guilt, Dr. Munz says, falls on the universities, which by constantly bending their rules ''infantilize'' their students, like parents who threaten penalties but fail to impose them. Dr. Munz, an associate clinical professor of medical psychology in psychiatry and a clinical psychologist at the Columbia University Health Service, has made a specialty of providing therapy to students who suffer from ''dissertation block.'' Last week he conducted a special workshop for faculty advisers. ''I speak from the vantage point of the insider,'' said Dr. Munz, who is also director of psychological services at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Dr. Munz says that he himself suffered from a 10-year bout of procrastination. It ended abruptly when his wife, who had completed her Ph.D. in record time, threatened to divorce him unless he sat down and got his thesis finished. Under that ultimatum, he accomplished what he had put off for so long. Dr. Munz enumerated with soft-spoken determination the many ways in which those who should spur students on actually keep them from doing their work. The unwitting colluding culprits include these: - Colleges that establish bad habits by tolerating excessive delays in completing assignments during the undergraduate years. - Universities that legalize procrastination every time they fail to enforce rules governing the time allowed to complete dissertations. - Therapists who spend most of their time analyzing the student's past without coming to grips with the real problem of postponing their work. This, Dr. Munz said, is like studying the causes of arson instead of putting out the fire. He said he thought psychiatrists, because they are medical doctors, have never had to cope with dissertations and that many psychologists have themselves failed to complete their dissertations. - Faculty members who tolerate repeated postponements or cancellations of conferences. Often, Dr. Munz suggested, they may subconsciously want to keep students, especially the bright ones, who are their valued assistants. He likened it to the parent who tries to prolong a teen-ager's move away into independence. - Colleagues who are readily available to commiserate and to help rationalize the student's inability to get to work. - Friends or spouses who say, ''Let's go to the movies or take off time for jogging,'' when they should know that they are interfering with the meeting of a deadline. But Dr. Munz also cited the case of a brilliant young woman who was unable to write the final chapter of an excellent dissertation. On probing, he found that the student's husband was having difficulty getting started on his dissertation. Dr. Munz told the young woman that she would not be able to finish her task until she could proclaim her independence from her husband's failure. Dr. Munz suspects that universities and faculty members may not be all that averse to having students pay their annual registration fees year after year, even if they have already completed their course work. In some instances, moreover, faculty members do not spend enough time advising their students and dealing with work in progress. In extreme but by no means unusual cases, students may find themselves caught in the scholarly infighting between two professors. He cited the case of a graduate student who regularly had her work praised by one professor and torn to shreds by another. In such cases, Dr. Munz said, the department or the university administration has a responsibility to protect students. But, he added, some students have a masochistic knack for selecting the wrong professors. Others are so obsessed with writing the definitive work that they cannot force themselves to complete their research and settle for writing what is required. In addition, Dr. Munz insisted, there is a need to ''demystify'' rumors about the difficulty of requirements and to dispel the widespread belief among students that dissertation committees ''are out to trick you.'' Faculties, he admitted, often promulgate those myths because they seem to make them and the degrees seem all the more potent. ''The difficulty of the dissertation has been blown out of all proportion,'' he said. ''It's just a task to be completed. What has been created is a self-inflicted misery by a commiserating society.'' Many students fail to complete their work, Dr. Munz explained, not because they are incapable but because they suffer from ''fear of success.'' They are approaching a milestone, and they suddenly complain of not being able to concentrate. ''The fact is, they concentrate perfectly well on nonacademic subjects,'' Dr. Munz said. They look for the safety of the womb, he said, adding ''the department is such a womb.'' Turning to the student advisers, he said, ''You have to do something drastic to deliver the baby.'' He urged them to be firm but not unkind, ''not punitively firm.'' There are, he said, instances in which delay may be justified, but he warned them against letting students move from excuse to excuse. He cited the long-delinquent student who asked for an interruption of several months in his therapy sessions so that he could put his finances in order. Dr. Munz refused to grant the hiatus and rejected the student's accusations of heartless rigidity. In the end, having lost his plea for one more delay, the student completed his dissertation on time. ''Many students who have difficulty completing their papers have general difficulty in dealing with authorities,'' Dr. Munz said. ''They must be told that they are cutting off their own noses to spite the authority.'' Universities, he told the advisers, should set a time range that is reasonable for students of different capacities and circumstances, but they should not permit those limits to lapse by nonenforcement. This, he explained, is what he calls ''the infantilizing atmosphere that prevails in the universities'' in which ''the threat of penalty is only a threat, not likely to be carried out.'' ''Is the university a degree-granting institution or a therapist?'' he asked. ''In the real world, you must complete your work. Somewhere out there is the harsh reality that deadlines have to be met.''

49-> CRUCIAL STAGE IN SALVADOR; News Analysis
The resignation under fire of Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia as El Salvador's Defense Minister this week was a symbolic end to an era that began when a group of reform-minded officers overthrew the Government of Carlos Humberto Romero in 1979. General Garcia was one of the last members of the Government formed after the coup to remain in office. His departure after weeks of criticism by Salvadoran and and American officials over his handling of the leftist insurgency is only one of many developments that indicate the military and political situation in El Salvador has changed greatly since 1979. The American presence has become much more visible and intense, as demonstrated by the sharp increase in aid and the proposal to send a special envoy to monitor the move toward presidential elections in December. Left Aims at Total Victory Behind this increased involvement is the Reagan Administration's belief that the war has taken on geopolitical ramifications that include the national security of the United States. The Salvadoran Government, which immediately after the coup represented a broad political spectrum, has become more conservative. The left, meanwhile, has become stronger and more determined than ever to win nothing less than total victory. These new realities raise the question whether the United States can guide the Salvadorans through military victories against the left and strengthen the Government without creating a nationalist backlash. Moreover, some political analysts believe the Government's wish for military progress could give rise to repression and human rights abuses that might provoke the United States Congress into suspending aid. U.S. Presence at Issue These themes are unfolding as the country's political parties prepare for elections in which the American presence, the war and the country's social progress are likely to be the main issues. American policy in El Salvador is to hold the guerrillas at a stalemate and strengthen the country's democracy while encouraging the leftists to participate in elections. In the months after the March 1982 elections for a Constituent Assembly, American policy focused on creating a democracy and establishing the land redistribution program to draw support away from the guerrillas. At the time the far right was seen as the main problem because of its efforts to take control of the Government and suspend the social and economic changes. But in recent months, as the guerrillas have proved to be a potent military force, American concerns have shifted to the military situation. It is now believed that El Salvador needs to make some military advances that would either strengthen the Government's hand in any negotiations or convince the leftists to participate in the democratic process. Their participation, however, seems less likely as the war intensifies. Training Is Accelerated Ambassador Deane R. Hinton supports the need for more training and military successes. ''A political solution would become more likely, not less likely, if the Government had some victories,'' he said in an interview today. As the military situation has come to be viewed as critical, training has been speeded up and an American-backed civic and military action plan has been approved. The new Defense Minister is expected to make sweeping changes in the military command. Despite the stepped-up American presence, some Salvadoran and United States officials believe that Congress lacks the patience to see this country through a prolonged civil war. ''Americans like their wars quick, dirty and violent,'' a military source said. The United States' handprint is seen everywhere here. Presidential elections were moved up three months at the request of the Reagan Administration; pressed by American advisers the armed forces are planning a major sweep to clear two provinces of guerrillas and then set up a civic program to win over the people, and General Garcia resigned only after the United States qualified its support of him. Resentment Is Intensifying So far there is little visible indication of resentment of the American presence. But Salvadoran officials agree that it is intensifying and could become a problem, especially if the American initiatives do not bring results. ''There is a deep seated resentment on the part of all Salvadorans,'' Mr. Hinton said. ''They don't like being so dependent on Americans and having Americans tell them what to do. They also recognize that they have to listen within limits, but they make the decisions and the smart ones recognize how dependent we are on them.'' The most crucial example of resistence to American guidance is in the country's military strategy. For years, American advisers have sought to persuade the Salvadoran military to use counterinsurgency tactics against the guerrillas, but most commanders have yet to employ them. At the his final news conference as Defense Minister, General Garcia repeated several times that this is the year El Salvador will win the war. While this is considered optimistic in most circles, American officials here fear that if this country does not make substantial gains it will be the year the Americans give up on El Salvador or the year the Salvadorans give up on the United States.

50-> CREDIT MARKETS; RATES RISE A BIT IN QUIET DAY
Interest rates on Treasury securities rose slightly in quiet trading yesterday. Analysts said there was no change in the economic or financial outlook to account for the negligible rise in rates. By late in the day, rates for Treasury bills ranged from unchanged to higher by four basis points in the case of one-year bills. Their rate rose to 9.47 percent from 9.43 percent. Among recently sold Treasury notes and bonds, prices fell no more than a quarter of a point, with most issues falling an eighth of a point or less. The 12 percent bonds due in 2013, for example, fell 2/32 and were offered at 102 14/32 to yield 11.69 percent. In advance of the Sept. 14 auction of $8 billion of new two-year Treasury notes, dealers offered the yet-to-be- auctioned issue with a yield of 10.93 percent. The 11 7/8 percent Treasury notes due in 1993 - an issue closely followed by corporate treasurers because it would be a benchmark for corporate issues of similar maturity - were offered at 101 2/32 to yield 11.59 percent. Profit Taking Is Noted Market participants said the day's price declines reflected selling by some speculators who wanted to lock in profits earned during the previous three sessions when bond prices rose about two points. Even though forecasters now call for modest money supply growth and an easing of monetary policy, many traders and investors remain skeptical and expect the Federal Reserve to follow a stable policy. Morgan Stark, executive vice president at the Chemical Bank, said the credit markets continue to vacillate between unrealistic fears of Fed tightening and unrealistic fears of Fed easing. ''The hopes of easing are irrational and illogical now,'' he said, just as market participants were overly fearful of Fed tightening earlier in the summer. Amid the uncertain outlook for Federal Reserve policy and the behavior of the economy, some market participants are guided by technical analysis that is based on the recent pattern of price changes and historical data indicating that such patterns are usually followed by higher prices. Sizing Up Market Prospects ''There is a good chance that the market has seen the bottom,'' said Jeffrey Parker, president of the Technical Data Corporation in Boston. It may not again approach the levels of early August when 12 percent bonds traded below par and yielded more than 12 percent, he said. If a small increase in the nation's money supply is announced today, ''the market could be on the verge of a very sharp rally,'' Mr. Parker added. If the M-1 money supply measure is not favorable enough to prompt an immediate rally, he said, the rally might not begin for a few more days. Prices in the tax-exempt market rose slightly yesterday in quiet secondary market activity, brokers said. During the last week, prices of tax-exempt issues have increased enough to reduce yields by eight basis points, to 9.67 percent from 9.75 percent, for a sample of 20-year general obligation bonds included in the Bond Buyer's 20-bond index. For long-term revenue bonds, prices rose enough to reduce the Bond Buyer index to 10.31 percent from 10.37 percent. Connecticut Issue All Sold Among new issues that were well received by investors earlier this week, a $125 million issue of Aa-rated Connecticut Housing Finance Authority bonds was all sold, with yields ranging from 5.5 percent in 1984 to 9.75 percent in 2001, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. Sales were also strong for a $43.4 million bond issue of the Missouri Board of Public Buildings. The AA- rated bonds were offered through underwriters led by Prudential-Bache Securities with yields ranging from 6 percent for bonds due in 1985 to 7.4 percent in 1988 and 8.6 percent in 1993. Although the State of Missouri is rated triple-A, the Board of Public Buildings has a lower rating because ''the state's rental payment bonds do not have the same strong legal support as do the state's general obligations,'' according to a research report by Sylvan G. Feldstein, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

51-> DISSIDENT WRITER TO GET SOVIET VISA
Georgi N. Vladimov, a dissident writer, said today that he was to appear at the visa office Tuesday to receive documents allowing him, his wife, Natalya, and his mother-in-law, Yelena Y. Dombrovskaya, to leave for West Germany. The notification came three months after Mr. Vladimov wrote to Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader, asking to emigrate rather than face police harassment and possible imprisonment, Mr. Vladimov, known in the West for his novel ''Faithful Ruslan,'' an story about a labor camp dog, said he was leaving reluctantly. In his letter to Mr. Andropov, he suggested that quitting the Soviet Union would be ''less detrimental to our national prestige'' than imprisonment or internal exile, possibilities that he considered implicit in threats made against him and his wife during interrogations in January. Reporters Invited to His Home ''I was hoping they would turn us down, but it doesn't matter, we will have to take our look at the world,'' Mr. Vladimov told Western reporters at his Moscow apartment today. ''We are very sorry to be leaving Russia.'' Mr. Vladimov, who is 51 years old, had suggested in his letter to Mr. Andropov that his departure be for one year, but his remarks today suggested it might be a more permanent step. Abroad, he will join other emigre writers, inclduing Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Maximov, Andrei Sinyavsky, Vladimir Voinovich, Vasily Aksyonov and Lev Kopelev. One of the possible pretexts for leaving that Mr. Vladimov suggested in his letter to Mr. Andropov, an invitation to teach in West Germany, will be the official ground for his departure. To Lecture in Cologne He said he would be going to Cologne University to lecture on Russian literature and the visa he will be issued will be valid for return within a year. Similar visas have been issued to other departing writers, but most lost their citizenship once abroad. Mr. Vladimov's first major novel, ''Big Ore,'' was officially aclaimed in 1961, and the writer, then 30 years old, was ushered into the Writers' Union and its world of generous stipends, special stores and country houses. But his next work, ''Three Minutes of Silence,'' depicting the despondency of fishermen in the northern seas, struck a disillusioned tone that caused the establishment to shun him. What followed was ''Faithful Ruslan.'' told from the viewpoint of a guard dog left to roam after a labor camp is closed. The dog turns on a trainload of workers, mistaking them for camp inmates. After the manuscript was rejected in the Soviet Union, Mr. Vladimov sent it abroad and it was published in the United States in 1979.

52-> Tots Aloft
To the Editor: Recently my wife and I stopped smoking and now fly in the nonsmoking section of the aircraft. This is where most of the young chil dren sit, and we find they become cranky and cry, whine, yell and scream - and as a rule are poorly controlled. Since there has been a separation of smokers and nonsmokers, I feel strongly there should also be a separate area for people traveling with young children. I can find nothing wrong with allowing families with young children to board the aircraft first and all be placed in the same sections and allowing the rest of us who have, fortunately, passed through this stage in life, to travel in a more calm and relaxed manner.

53-> REDSKINS ROUT LIONS, 31-7; RAIDERS DEFEAT BROWNS
Alvin Garrett might have been the only member of the Washington Redskins who expressed some concern today after the National Conference's No.1 team overwhelmed the Detroit Lions, 31-7, in a first-round game of the National Football League playoffs. ''I'm going to get talked about at practice tomorrow because I didn't block today,'' the 5-foot-7-inch, 178-pound Garrett said after starring in place of Art Monk, who suffered a broken foot last Sunday. ''They're going to say I'm getting soft because I'm a wide receiver.'' Whatever his teammates say when they needle him, though, they will also readily acknowledge that Garrett was the key player today who helped them advance to the second round of the N.F.L. playoffs next weekend. Garrett, usually a special-teams player, caught three touchdown passes from Joe Theismann in a performance that might catch the attention of the New York Giants, who released him after the 11th game of the 1981 season. Garrett, a third-year pro, was about the only surprise produced in this game that most people had conceded to the Redskins before it began. It was no surprise that the Redskins, who allowed a league-low 128 points this season, limited the Lions to a third-quarter touchdown on a 15-yard pass from Eric Hipple to David Hill. It was no surprise that the Redskins also limited the Lions to 95 yards rushing, shutting down Billy Sims so that he gained only 19 yards on six carries. Sims, in fact, fumbled two of those six times, losing the ball at Washington's 19-yard line in the first quarter and the Redskins' 5 in the second. Hipple also fumbled the ball away when he was sacked by Vernon Dean in the first quarter - three plays after Jeris White intercepted his pass intended for Sims and sped 77 yards for the game's first score. White intercepted another Hipple pass in the end zone in the fourth quarter. It was Garrett, though, who put on the best end-zone show, catching a pair of 21-yard scoring passes from Theismann in the second quarter and a 27-yarder early in the third - all on third-down plays. After catching only one pass all season, Garrett snared six today, gaining 110 yards and frustrating a pair of rookie cornerbacks, Bruce McNorton and Bobby Watkins. He beat McNorton on the left side for the first two touchdowns and Watkins on the right side for the third. ''It's not that they're rookies,'' Garrett said. ''They were covering me man to man. When they line up like that, all you have to do is beat the cornerback. I did my job and Joe threw excellent passes.'' Theismann, who gave Garrett the nickname Smurf during training camp, said he wasn't surprised at all that his new receiver should have played so well. ''With our style of offense, we don't have just 11 offensive players,'' said the hoarse quarterback, who completed 14 of 19 passes for 210 yards. ''We have 15 to 18 offensive players. They all get time during practice during the week. Today I wasn't looking for him. We take what the defense dictates. He made some great catches and he made some great moves to get open.'' As a member of the Giants for nearly two seasons, Garrett evidently did not make all the right moves. They placed him on waivers after a loss to the Redskins last season and Washington claimed him. ''They thought I should have made a tackle on a punt return in overtime,'' Garrett recalled. High Score in Playoffs Today, Garrett helped the Redskins score the most points they ever have scored in a postseason game. More importantly, the victory was their first in the playoffs since they won the N.F.C. title in 1972. Since then, they had lost three first-round games, the last in 1976. If the Lions were to have any chance at all in their first postseason game since 1970, Hipple and Sims were going to have to find a way to ignite the team's offense. They are still looking. Sims, the Lions' leading rusher and pass receiver during the abbreviated season, abruptly ended Detroit's two most promising drives in the first half by losing the ball on fumbles. Hipple contributed to the Lions' ineffectiveness, too, with his fumble and first intercepted pass. Interception in Stride Midway through the first quarter, Hipple threw a pass toward Sims. But as Sims stood near the Washington 20-yard line with his hands outstretched, White, the left cornerback, darted in front of him and picked off the pass. White bobbled the ball momentarily but never broke stride as he grabbed it a second time and raced 77 yards down the left side. ''I'm supposed to make it look like I'm going with the wide receiver,'' White explained later. ''Then I fall off. I don't think Hipple saw me. He threw it just as I made my move. I didn't think I was going to get it. I thought I would just knock it down. But I tipped it in the air and was able to get it.'' Mark Moseley, the Redskins' record-breaking place-kicker, was able to get only one of the two field goals he tried. Several times this season, the Redskins needed Moseley's field goals to win games. This was not one of those times. This time the Redskins had Garrett, Theismann's lovable Smurf.

54-> Koestler Is Said to Have Left $600,000 for Psychic Studies
The writer Arthur Koestler, who was found dead with his wife on March 3 in an apparent double suicide, left about $600,000 to promote university study of psychic phenomena, The Sunday Telegraph reported. It said that Mr. Koestler, 77 years old at the time of his death, hoped the bequest would be enough to start a university department. The Koestlers are believed to have died by taking an overdose of tranquilizers because the Hungarian-born novelist was suffering from leukemia and Parkinson's disease. Cynthia Koestler was not known to be ill.

55-> SCIENCE WATCH; The Instrumented Potato
An electronic gadget the size and shape of a potato has been developed by agricultural engineers at Pennsylvania State University to help farmers and processors prevent damage to crops. Placed in a bin of potatoes and treated just like them, the device senses and broadcasts signals of stress for analysis by researchers. Inside its skin of silicon rubber, the ersatz potato has sensors that tell whether storage or rough processing might unnecessarily bruise or crack the vegetable. The potato project is funded by the National Science Foundation. Tests of the electric potato against its real-life cousins have already shown that it does a good job at mimicking the vulnerabilities of the tuber. Engineers will eventually use the information to redesign equipment for potato processing.

57-> A DANCER ADDS WORDS TO THE SOLO TRADITIONN
The solo dance recital is one of the riskiest forms of entertainment for the performer. To succeed, it requires a stage presence strong enough to captivate - or at least interest - an audience throughout an entire evening. Despite the hazards, evenings of solo dance have been surprisingly popular with modern dancers from Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham on. Following in that tradition, on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week, will be Bertram Ross, for nearly 20 years a principal dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company. Mr. Ross, who left Miss Graham in 1973, will present a program of five solo dance ''portraits'' at the Theater of the Riverside Church. Mr. Ross's portraits are idiosyncratic hybrids of speech and dance, a form he feels he invented himself. He recites a text while performing dances of his own invention. Sometimes there is music, sometimes not. ''I admit that it sounds peculiar,'' says the dancer-choreographer. ''No one else I know dances and recites simultaneously. But all the better. It could be the beginning of a whole new art form!'' The characters that Mr. Ross will portray include the biblical figure Noah; Raymond Duncan, the eccentric, toga-wearing brother of Isadora; Ted Shawn, the husband of Ruth St. Denis, and one of the founders of modern dance; Gordon Craig, the son of actress Ellen Terry and father of Isadora Duncan's first daughter; and Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. ''I created these portraits because I was very drawn to these characters as men,'' says Mr. Ross, who punctuates his explanations by waving his arms and hopping enthusiastically about the room. Although Mr. Ross has performed three of his portraits before, the Noah work and the Ted Shawn piece are premieres. The first is based on the play ''Noah'' by the French author Andre Obey. The Ted Shawn work is based on lectures that Mr. Shawn gave in the 1940's about the 19th-century French author and actor Francois Delsarte. Mr. Shawn felt and Mr. Ross agrees that Delsarte's writings had a lot to do with modern dance. ''As a modern dancer I had never heard about Delsarte,'' says Mr. Ross. ''until I began doing research for the portrait of Ted Shawn. But as it turns out, the entire modern dance movement originated with him. Although he was an actor and not a dancer, his discoveries about the body inspired people like Ted Shawn, through whom they filtered down to dance. For Delsarte every gesture had meaning. That's one of the reasons I'm interested in him. Dance nowadays is becoming too automatic. The emphasis is on facility, not expression.'' Expression is the very thing the critics have always singled out in Mr. Ross's dancing and choreography. As a principal dancer with Martha Graham he created some of her most dramatic and demanding roles, including those of Agamemnon and Orestes in ''Clytemnestra'' and Hippolytus in ''Phaedra.'' For several years, he was also co-director of the company. In 1973, however, he set off on his own. Since then he has taught dance at institutions such as the Alvin Ailey Dance Center and New York University and has choreographed about 30 ballets. From time to time over the last 10 years he has even formed his own dance companies, but their lives have been evanescent. ''I don't have the kind of administrative zeal that it takes to sustain a dance company,'' says Mr. Ross, ''the kind of drive that George Balanchine had or Martha Graham has. When there's money, and my choreographic ideas seem to require it, I put together a group. Right now, however, I like doing one-man shows. It's so much more portable. The only person I have to lug around is me.'' Mr. Ross, who's been lugging himself around the dance floor for more than 30 years, got a late start for a dancer. ''I didn't even think about dancing until after I got out of the Army,'' he says. ''I always meant to be a painter, and I studied at the Art Students League. But all the while I was in a constant state of quiet desperation. Something was very wrong with my life, so I turned to an analyst for help.'' With the analyst's help it gradually became apparent that what Mr. Ross really wanted to do was dance. He still hesitated to confront his destiny full on, however. ''I just had some kind of block about being a dancer,'' he recalls. ''Something to do with my father, who like many people at the time didn't think it an appropriate occupation for a man. But I had seen some performances of Graham ballets in New York and knew sooner or later that that was going to be my life. Finally I mustered up the courage to call the Graham School. I was so frightened that I hung up the phone a dozen times before finally getting the nerve to ask about taking a class. I spoke to Erick Hawkins, who said to come right over. That was 1953.'' Despite Mr. Ross's difficulties in getting himself into the dance world, once there he progressed with alacrity. Within a year he was dancing solos with the company on tour, and shortly thereafter he became Miss Graham's partner. Today, although still interested in what he calls ''pure dance,'' Mr. Ross says that he has become intrigued with a kind of speech/dance. ''I began taking singing lessons in 1973,'' says Mr. Ross, ''and this form evolved partly, I think, because I wanted to put my voice to use. I also like to do these works because I'm intrigued by the lives of interesting people. Unfortunately there aren't enough individuals anymore.'' Also in short supply these days, according to Mr. Ross, is the kind of dancing that was done by the Martha Graham troupe of earlier days. ''When today's dancers do the early modern works they don't seem to give the parts any weight, or sense of volume,'' he said. ''Dancers today all try to be weightless. Ballet teaches you that. I saw a performance of Jose Lim on's 'The Moor's Pavane,' done recently by some very good dancers, and it was laughable. It had nothing to do with the original. The stage was filled with zephyrs hovering in space, which I venture to say was not Lim on's original intention. The kind of voluminous, weighty dancing that we did three decades ago, and which I feel is the essence of modern dance, is, I'm sorry to say, disappearing.'' Bertram Ross will soon be 63, an age when most dancers would at least entertain the idea of retirement. He says, however, that it's the farthest thing from his mind. ''Why should I stop dancing?'' he exclaims with an air of surprise. ''Technically, I actually do some things even better now than I did 30 years ago! It all has to do with ease of expression. I spend my life searching for an ease of expression and technique. If you find that, you can keep going a long time. And I intend to.''

58-> U.S. SAYS SOVIET HASN'T RULED OUT REAGAN PROPOSALS AT ARMS TALKS
A senior State Department official said today that Soviet negotiators in Geneva ''have not formally rejected'' President Reagan's recent proposals to reduce medium- range nuclear missiles in Europe. Speaking at a news conference after a meeting of the Special Consultative Group, a NATO body that meets regularly to coordinate Western policy in the Geneva arms talks, the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, Richard Burt, said United States and Soviet negotiators were ''in fact discussing these proposals'' in the current round of talks. Mr. Burt, the group's chairman, said the Russians ''have certainly taken a very negative position.'' But he said they ''have not formally rejected the proposals in the Geneva talks.'' ''They are now in the process of working through each proposal in detail,'' he said. Will Continue Negotiations Addressing the United Nations last month, Mr. Reagan outlined several arms control concessions, including willingness to forgo deployment of some of the nuclear missiles that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans to begin deploying in December, and to discuss a possible ceiling on medium-range bombers that carry nuclear weapons. Soviet leaders have dismissed the proposals in public statements as ''lopsided'' and a ''deception'' to play for time to start the deployment of the new missiles in December. Mr. Burt said the group agreed that, if deployment had to begin because of failure in Geneva, ''we will remain at the negotiating table thereafter.'' The group was evidently addressing itself to widespread concern that the Soviet Union will follow through with a threat to walk out of Geneva if deployment begins later this year. NATO Reaffirms Deployment The United States chief negotiator in Geneva, Paul H. Nitze, speaking to the North Atlantic Assembly, a group of legislators from NATO countries, in The Hague today, said deployment in December ''would not help'' the talks. But he said he was uncertain whether the Soviet Union would walk out. Mr. Nitze said the Soviet demand that French and British nuclear weapons be included in arms reduction talks was a ''tactical negotiating ploy'' to achieve an ''unequal outcome'' in Geneva. The Assembly, in a vote that was purely consultative, agreed by a wide majority to adhere to NATO's 1979 decision to counter the existence of Soviet medium-range missiles trained on Europe by deploying 108 Pershing 2 and 464 cruise missiles later this year, if the Geneva talks, which have been dragging on for 18 months, reach no settlement. NATO's Special Consultative Group, which met in Bonn, has representatives of all 16 NATO countries. It met 10 times this year, and three times since the current round of Geneva talks began last month. Concern About Protests The meetings are not usually publicized or accompanied by news conferences, indicating a certain level of concern about possible protests in Europe if the missiles are deployed this year. Underlining Washington's willingness to reach an agreement, a United States official at the meeting said, ''It should not be assumed that this was the President's last proposal.'' The group, in a statement read by Mr. Burt, said Mr. Reagan's recent proposals meant that ''all the components for a fair and equitable agreement'' were on the table in Geneva. ''If the Soviet Union is willing,'' the statement said, ''we can reach an agreement before the end of the year.'' They accused the Soviet Union of waging a ''campaign of fear'' to influence Western public opinion. If failure to reach a settlement meant that deployment would begin in December, they said, ''we will remain at the negotiating table thereafter.''

59-> 20 LOST IN CHANNEL AS COPTER CRASHES
A British Airways helicopter shuttling passengers to the Scilly Isles crashed in the English Channel today, and 20 of the 26 people aboard are missing, officials said. Six people were rescued, one with serious injuries, from the waters off England's southwest coast, they said. Thick fog was hampering rescue operations. Lifeboats and two Royal Navy helicopters and a team of divers went to the crash scene two miles off St. Mary's, the largest of the five main islands. The navy rescue center first reported that seven survivors had been picked up but later corrected this to six. Regular Shuttle Flight The Sikorsky 61 helicopter was on a scheduled commercial flight between Penzance on the Cornish peninsula to the Scilly Isles, 25 miles to the southwest, the spokesman said. The Scilly Isles are at the entrance to the English Channel and are a popular vacation resort and horticultural center. The helicopter, carrying 23 passengers and a crew of 3, lost radio contact near the islands, the airline spokesman said. ''It is a routine shuttle service which goes several times a day at this time of year,'' the spokesman said. ''We lost radio contact just about two miles off the island.'' A Ministry of Transport spokesman said the helicopter sank and had been found. Lieut. Cmdr. Andrew Lockett, rescue coordinator at the Royal Navy Air Station at Culdrose, said the helicopter broke up and the main fuselage was believed to be at the bottom of the channel, about 200 feet deep. ''This makes it a very difficult diving operation,'' a Falmouth Coast Guard spokesman said, because the depth gives divers only five minutes to work on the wreckage before they have to come to the surface.

60-> 11 ARRESTED IN WASHINGTON SQUARE
Eleven people were arrested and two police officers were slightly hurt in a melee in Washington Square Park yesterday afternoon, the police reported. They said six West German bicyclists were giving a soccer demonstration at around 1:30 P.M. when Police Officer William Barcene told them they were blocking access to the park and asked them to move, which they did. One man in the crowd of about 150 onlookers who had gathered heckled Officer Barcene, who arrested the man and called for reinforcements. According to Chief Michael J. McNulty, commanding officer of Manhattan South, some of those in the crowd pelted the arriving officers with bottles, and over the next hour 10 more people were arrested before calm was restored. Chief McNulty said the charges were mostly disorderly conduct, and reported that four of those detained had filed civilian complaints of police misconduct. Officers Barcene and Timothy Kerr were treated for cuts and bruises at a hospital and released, Chief McNulty said.

65-> ON THE SLIPPERY SLOPES OF SUMMITRY
Ronald Reagan and Yuri V. Andropov are caught up in a diplomatic minuet that seems inevitably to be leading to a Soviet-American summit sometime in the next two years. Every American President since Franklin D. Roosevelt has had one or more meetings with a Soviet leader and there is no reason to suppose that Mr. Reagan will be any different. Indeed, if Leonid I. Brezhnev, who died in November, had been in better health, there probably would have been by now a Reagan-Brezhnev meeting in New York or Europe. Despite assertions by both sides from time to time that the importance of such meetings is exaggerated and that they have to be ''well-prepared,'' the simple fact is that Soviet-American summits are the Super Bowls of international diplomacy, and both sides love to play in them. As part of the preparatory rites, American and Soviet leaders sometimes profess disdain for the meetings. President Dwight D. Eisenhower said in 1953 that ''I would not go to a summit merely because of friendly words and plausible promises by the men in the Kremlin.'' Nevertheless, he was there in 1955 in Geneva. He invited Nikita S. Khrushchev to Washington in 1959, and would have gone to Moscow in 1960 except for the U-2 incident. Leonid I. Brezhnev resisted Richard M. Nixon's initial overtures because of the Vietnam war, and then (worried about Mr. Nixon's infatuation with Peking) embraced the idea so firmly that he and Nixon held consecutive meetings in 1972, 1973 and 1974. Yet, Mr. Brezhnev turned around in 1977 and rejected President Jimmy Carter's proposal for an early summit on the grounds that a new SALT agreement should be negotiated first. They eventually met in 1979 in Vienna. Just now, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Andropov are playing a bit hard to get.The Soviet leader, in response to a question from the Hearst newspapers, said recently that while the Kremlin had no problem with summitry in principle, ''good preparatory work is needed for the success of such a meeting.'' Mr. Reagan, who last year invited Mr. Brezhnev to New York for an ''informal'' discussion of world issues, told his news conference last week that he now wanted a ''planned'' summit. ''I don't think you just say let's get together, sit around a table and then say 'well, what'll we talk about,''' he said. And his spokesman the next day said Soviet behavior in such places as Afghanistan and Poland would have to improve first. Other Presidents and Soviet leaders have been less coy. John F. Kennedy rushed to Vienna to meet with Mr. Khrushchev within months of taking office. Lyndon B. Johnson virtually twisted Aleksei N. Kosygin's arm in 1967 to get him to meet him in Glassboro, N.J. One of Mr. Johnson's major regrets on leaving office was that the Sovietled invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 forced him to cancel a trip to Russia that October. For an incumbent American President, nothing guarantees more television exposure and diversions from difficult political problems at home than the drama of a face-to-face meeting with the leader of the Soviet Union. But it does not always help. Mr. Nixon insisted on a final journey to Moscow even though Watergate was to cause his resignation a month later. Mr. Carter's meeting with Mr. Brezhnev did not prevent a precipitous drop in the President's popularity that led to the firing of several of his top aides a few weeks later. For the Soviet leader, whether he be Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, or Andropov, the summit provides him easy access to the world's news media, and an aura of respectibiity in Western circles that temporarily eases the inferiority complex that permeates the Kremlin. Is Summitry Worthwhile? There have been voices of caution, to be sure, about summits. Gerard C. Smith, an arms control negotiator for Mr. Nixon, once wrote out 10 ''don'ts'' for any future President. The first was, ''Don't lust for a summit.'' It only leads to giving away negotiating points in the rush to have some agreements to announce at the meeting, he said. Despite the Olympian qualities of summits, it is questionable whether they really produce the results expected of them or indeed whether they are the best way to get results. Gerald R. Ford came away from Vladivostok in 1974 with guidelines for a new SALT agreement, but Henry A. Kissinger might have done just as well. Mr. Nixon and Mr. Brezhnev knew each other as well as any two leaders can hope to. Yet, in June 1973, when Mr. Brezhnev warned him in San Clemente that an explosion was likely in the Middle East later that year unless pressure was brought on Israel, Mr. Nixon paid no attention. The drawbacks notwithstanding, the preponderence of opinion right now seems to be in favor of the spectacle of another summit. Mr. Nixon has publicly called for an early Reagan-Andropov ''gettogether.'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was Mr. Carter's national security adviser, said last month that the two sides should agree on annual summits ahead of time, to give them a more routine quality that would lower expectations. If Mr. Andropov and Mr. Reagan were to meet anytime soon, it is improbable that any major agreements would emerge, although it would give each leader a better understanding of the other's personality. But there would likely be no spontaneity to the session; Mr. Reagan has struck some as shaky on international issues and Mr. Andropov, whose powers seem far from absolute in the Kremlin, might not be free to depart from a collective Soviet wisdom. Given those limitations, what seems more likely is a series of preliminary contacts, managed for the most part by Mr. Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko that could produce a summit late this year or early next, in time for any Reagan re-election campaign. By then, the probability of any arms control agreements would be easier to forecast. If there were to be any accords announced at the summit, they would most probably concern arms.

68-> Henry McLaughlin Dies at 90; Played 'Howdy Doody' Clown
Henry McLaughlin, a film and vaudeville veteran who played Clarabell the Clown for three years on television's ''Howdy Doody'' show, died of stroke complications Sunday. He was 90 years old. Mr. McLaughlin, who was born on May 2, 1893, in Hiawatha, Kan., moved with his family to Lincoln, Neb., when he was 4 years old. There, at the age of 10, he began singing with a local band. He joined the vaudeville circuit a decade later. He appeared in the movies ''Jumbo,'' and ''American Girl'' and on Broadway. He also performed as a singer, dancer and comic in nightclubs. Mr. McLaughlin appeared as Clarabell, the sidekick of Buffalo Bob, the ''Howdy Doody'' host, from 1954 to 1956, and was one of several actors who played Clarabell through the years. The Clarabell character carried a seltzer bottle and communicated by honking ''yes'' or ''no'' on a bicycle horn worn on his belt.

70-> ON LANGUAGE
Cap the Entitlement As the debate on Social Security heats up, or hottens up, a shadowy cliche slouches toward Washington: He is Cap the Entitlement. No, this is not Caspar (Cap the Knife) Weinberger, whose recent travels changed his sobriquet to ''Cap the Suitcase''; it is the amalgam of two opposing rallying words. Cap began as a noun in the early 1970's, drawing on the image of ''capping'' an oil well. The earliest citation anybody I know can find is in the files of Merriam-Webster: ''We have a somewhat ambiguous citation from The Wall Street Journal of May 22, 1972,'' reports Frederick Mish, editorial director, ''applying the term to a 'rule' (perhaps a Federal regulation) which limited the extent to which certain companies could raise their prices at that time.'' How well I remember those halcyon days at Camp David on the weekend of Aug. 13-15, 1971, when a band of us gleefully solved the raging inflation rate (4.8 percent) by imposing wage and price controls and flummoxing the economy for nearly a decade. I vaguely recall economists Herbert Stein and Arnold Weber talking about ''a cap on prices,'' which comes close to a citation, but close counts only in horseshoes: Merriam-Webster has the first, and the second and third: ''Our earliest clear-cut instance includes cap as a piece of jargon meaning the same thing as ceiling,'' writes Mr. Mish. It is from the July-August 1973 issue of The Mailhandler, a union publication; then comes Martin Mayer's use in his 1974 book ''The Bankers'': ''In 1972, when Chicago's Continental Illinois offered some big borrowers 'cap' loans (long-term credits with a fixed-interest ceiling) ... .'' As conservatism reared its cost-cutting head, cap turned into a verb: Politicians volunteered to cap everything from welfare to property taxes. But then the capping ran into the other side's word: entitlements. Nobody, said the benefit-minded, was going to cap entitlements. That word lay aborning in a law passed by the Congress in 1944: ''... it should be clearly provided that entitlement to pay and allowances is not to be terminated on the actual date of death ... .'' For a couple of decades, the word lay low, like Br'er Rabbit. In the late 1960's, as the Great Society came to an end, Congressional aides began using it to defend against attacks on ''welfare cheats.'' For many, the new word was a euphemism for welfare, which once was a euphemism for relief. Then, in the mid-1970's, it was adopted by middle-roaders who felt the pressure to do something about spending: ''He indicated a belief that something had to be done to hold down the growth of programs,'' wrote The New York Times about Representative Brock Adams, ''granting an automatic 'entitlement' to eligible individuals. Among these are food stamps, welfare and health-care financing.'' Cost cutters took up the cry of ''doing something about entitlements.'' To this day, people who believe in the redistribution of wealth (or compassion for the truly needy) resist the notion that entitlement is merely a euphemism for welfare: ''Entitlement includes both earned benefits and unearned benefits,'' says Ceil Frank at the Office of Family Assistance in Washington, ''Social Security and veterans' benefits are earned benefits, and unearned benefits are what welfare refers to.'' Liberals take care to divide funds transferred to people by the Government into public assistance - welfare -and entitlements, which carries the connotation ''earned, deserved.'' Conservatives tend to lump the two together and demand that a cap be placed on it. Ross Baker, political-science professor at Rutgers, puckishly defined entitlements as ''tenure for the underclass.'' Glacis The award for the best new politico-diplomatic usage of 1982 goes to Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan, Foreign Minister of Pakistan, who used a word I never heard before to describe the country that lies between the Soviet Union and the gateway to the Persian Gulf: ''Afghanistan might one day be intended by the Soviets to be a glacis.'' ''A what?'' asked a press corps eager to advance its erudition. Mr. Yaqub-Khan, who converses easily in Romance languages as well as Russian and Urdu, was puzzled at the lack of understanding by the American press: Glacis is an old, established English word with a modern figurative meaning. From the sentence context, I offered buffer as a synonym, which the Foreign Minister accepted. But glacis, pronounced GLAY-sis, is metaphorically much richer. Derived from the Old French glacier, ''to slip, slide,'' a glacis began in English more than three centuries ago, meaning a fortification that sloped gradually to ground level, permitting an unrestricted field of fire. Later, glacis plates were sloping armor plates on ships. Finally, the figurative use took over: East Germany was seen by The Times of London in 1955 ''as part of Russia's defensive glacis,'' and The Observer five years later agreed that the countries of Eastern Europe ''form the glacis between the Soviet Union and the West.'' A glacis state, then, is one that forms a defensive barrier between one power and its potential enemies. Because Canada is located between the United States and possible across-the-pole missile attack, it is a glacis state, much as Canadians would resent that role. How accurate a definition of Afghanistan, if the Soviets agree to withdraw and insist on leaving behind a Soviet-influenced Government. The phrase, with its defensive connotation, is much better than the in-between buffer state (from buff, or blow, meaning now a padding to absorb shocks), which means ''a state between two powers whose position lessens the chance of conflict.'' A buffer separates both; a glacis does that, too, but especially forms part of the defense of one. Kennedy Subjunctive Not everybody has been paying attention. The subjunctive mood, lucidly explained here last year, has been ignored everywhere from Capitol Hill to Madison Avenue. Now listen up; we will not go into this again. ''If I was to make a political decision,'' said Senator Edward Kennedy, withdrawing from the 1984 Presidential race, ''it would be a different announcement today.'' Wrong. (Not the decision, the mood.) When you are posing a hypothesis contrary to fact, you must use the subjunctive. That's the rule, and no horsing around is allowed. Senator Kennedy was saying that he was not making a ''political'' decision, but one based on family concerns; therefore (to take him at his word) making a ''political decision'' was a situation contrary to fact. He ought then to have said, ''If I were to make a political decision,'' followed with the parallel construction, ''I would be making a different announcement today.'' Got that? If you have would in the main clause, you must use were (the subjunctive) in the ''if'' clause. If I were to let this one go by, I would be derelict in my duty as self-appointed guardian of good grammar. And now to my friends at the Book-of-the-Month Club, an organization which has done much to spread literacy and culture into every nook and cranny of the land. In an advertisement for the seven-volume set of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' quarter-bound in genuine leather, the headline read: ''If it wasn't history, it would be the most spectacular novel ever written.'' Let's hear it from Prof. Michael Montgomery of the University of South Carolina: ''Gibbon's work is history, of course. The statement ''if it wasn't history'' is clearly contrary to fact; to be consistent with the subjunctive rule, you must use were. The advertisers probably thought that the use of 'was' made the ad sound more idiomatic. Nevertheless, it's wrong.'' Can you ever use ''If I was''? Of course, when you are examining a real possibility, or even a likelihood: ''If I was speeding, your Honor, I didn't realize it.'' Other examples: ''If I was scribbling, scribbling, scribbling, your Highness, it made possible your gracious acceptance of another damned thick book.'' Or, in the Senator's case, ''If I was thinking about stimulating a draft at the 1984 Democratic convention, I am not about to tell you that today.''

71-> JUSTICE OFFICIALS AGREE TO GIVE CAMPAIGN MATERIAL TO HOUSE PANEL
The Justice Department today agreed to turn over a large number of President Reagan's campaign documents to a House subcommittee investigating the conduct of the 1980 Presidential campaign. Additional papers, which are being used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its own inquiry into the matter, will not be given to the committee until later, officials said. The agreement marked the Administration's first implementation of repeated promises to cooperate with the House investigation, which seeks to determine how documents prepared for President Carter found their way into the Reagan camp and were used to prepare Mr. Reagan for a campaign debate with Mr. Carter. Committee aides were elated by today's agreement because it provided concrete evidence that someone was taking the investigation seriously. The inquiry is regarded with disdain by some House Democratic and Republican leaders who consider the allegations much ado about nothing. In addition, some Democrats fear that the investigation may divert attention from what they consider the fundamental flaws of the Reagan Presidency. Civil Service Subcommittee The House investigation is being conducted by the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. The subcommittee chairman, Representative Donald J. Albosta, a thirdterm Michigan Democrat, has yet to gain the confidence of some party leaders, who regard him as untested. Subcommittee aides worked out today's agreement at a meeting with Justice Department officials. ''We're going to get immediate access to a large group of documents and materials,'' said James Hamilton, special counsel to the subcommittee, after a meeting with D. Lowell Jensen, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division. Other material, including personal assessments by F.B.I. agents, is being retained. ''They're hesitant to release certain documents to us while the investigation is going on,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''It's just a matter of timing,'' said Thomas P. DeCair, a Justice Department spokesman. ''The integrity of the investigation requires that we pursue some things and not turn them over to the committee until later. I think it will work out just fine. I don't see any conflict or confrontation.'' White House Negotiations Mr. Hamilton said, ''I'd rather cooperate than fight.'' Micah Green, the subcommittee's staff director, added, ''We want to get it started, and get it moving.'' Mr. Hamilton also reported progress in negotiations with the White House to obtain access to campaign documents housed in the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, at Stanford University. ''We're pretty close there, too,'' said Mr. Hamilton, who added that the subcommittee had made a new proposal Tuesday evening. Last week Fred F. Fielding, the President's counsel, agreed to give the subcommittee total access to the documents, but only on the condition that the panel conduct a similar review of Mr. Carter's campaign documents. The subcommittee declined, on the grounds that there had been no allegations that Mr. Carter had used campaign documents prepared for Mr. Reagan. Alternatively, Mr. Fielding offered to turn over the fruits of the Justice Department investigation. The subcommittee again declined, on the grounds that it had the right to conduct its own investigation, and not be limited to the F.B.I. inquiry. ''I have every reason to believe that they're trying to do a good job, and that they are independent,'' Mr. Hamilton said of the Justice Department. ''But we may be looking at slightly different things than they are.''

74-> Noncompetitive Higher Education
In the July 17 issue I read another in what seems to be an unending series of articles on ''the bitter contest for students'' between private and public universities in Connecticut (''Colleges in Bitter Contest for Students''). It is true that as the number of college-age students diminishes, schools are searching for new programs, state assistance and ways in which they can meet the needs of the nontraditional adult student. These changing needs do not always pit university against university. One unique approach to resolving or avoiding conflicts between the public and private sector in education was the development of the Stamford/ Greenwich Center for Higher Education. The center is a division of the University of Bridgeport, working in cooperation with Fairfield University and Norwalk Community College. A two-story colonial building at 6 Riverside Avenue in Riverside, the Stamford/Greenwich Center for Higher Education has grown considerably since its inception in August 1978. The center schedules undergraduate, graduate and noncredit courses offered by the three participating institutions especially for their part- time students. The University of Bridgeport, Fairfield University and Norwalk Community College share the common facility, classrooms and student services without detracting from the uniqueness of each institution. The result is a regional, non competitive approach to satisfying the course interests of students in the Stamford/Greenwich and neighboring areas. The Stamford/Greenwich Center is a fine example of cooperation between the public and private sectors in higher education and could well have been included in the article as an appropriate counterpoint.

The results of a second round of dioxin testing in Times Beach, Mo., will not be made public until they can be verified and a Presidential committee decides what action should be taken, officials say. Lee Thomas, head of the committee, said the group was analyzing preliminary data from soil samples taken after the town was flooded in December. William Hedeman, head of the Environmental Protection Agency's program for cleaning up toxic waste, also said Friday in Washington that his agency had received ''raw data.'' Both officials declined to say whether the new results showed the town to be contaminated by dioxin, a highly toxic byproduct of herbicide production.

80-> Reins on the Fed
To the Business Editor: Donald A. Nichols's response to the question of ''Should the Fed be Tied Down?'' (Business Forum, Aug. 7) was very distressing. Mr. Nichols suggests that while Congress and the Administration cannot agree either on fiscal or monetary policy, Congress, the Administration and the Federal Reserve will be able to. Another erroneous assumption is that Congress and the Administration know the best long-range economic course to navigate. There is little evidence that such is the case. While Mr. Nichols argues from the classic side of democracy, he has failed to factor in the importance of today's political factions. The nation cannot allow critical, pressing economic decisions to be made through the increasingly popular system of political trade-offs. Ultimately, we need some one or some thing that will, after weighing the impacts on largely nonpolitical scales, make a rational decision. The Fed is in that position. Granted, they have enormous power for an appointed body, but who is left? Our elected officials have repeatedly shown they cannot handle the pressure. Finally, I believe the greatest flaw in Mr. Nichols's treatise is his assumption that in a Congressional-Executive Branch-Federal Reserve triumvirate, the Fed would be an equal party. It would not - not without changing the Constitution. Within such a framework the Federal Reserve would be relegated to the role of staffer, and the last resort for economic sanity would be shut off. I do not believe the Fed has been right all the time, but as a businessman with a stake in America's future, I sleep better knowing they are not now pawns of the Administration or the Congress.

84-> PERSONAL COMPUTERS; SOFTWARE WITH RELIGIOUS THEMES
BACK in my youth, when we read science fiction rather than lived it, I was deeply influenced by a short story called ''The Nine Billion Names of God,'' by Arthur C. Clarke. The tale, as I remember it, centered on an engineer who had been assigned to an operation in the high valleys of Tibet. Hired by lamas to operate a supercomputer from the West, the engineer was to make certain that the machine printed out all the possible combinations of letters forming names of God. The belief of the monks, according to the story, was that when every one of the estimated nine billion possible names of God had been listed, man's purpose in the universe would have been achieved. While I have never reread the story, I vividly remember its ending, with the engineer about to return to civilization. ''Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.'' What brought this story to mind was the recent deposit on my desk of stacks of religious software. I'd previously been aware of the use of computers in religious organizations. There's a program called The Word processor, for instance, the words processed therein being those of the King James version of the Bible. There is also the fact that the Mormon Church is probably well on the way toward building the world's largest data base, using computers in genealogy. A special computer chip called Hebrew Hardware ($225) is even available for the Apple II series of computers. Physically remove the character generator, the specialized microcir@cuit chip that normally prints the A B C's from the Apple, replace it with Hebrew Hardware, and your computer will display Hebrew characters instead of Roman. Do you want a bilingual computer? Then use the Hebrew Writer software ($75), a text editor that turns the Apple, assisted by a dot matrix printer of the Epson MX-80 type, into the equivalent of a Hebrew typewriter. But it wasn't until the Institute for Computers in Jewish Life (Chicago, Ill. 60611, telephone 800-621-8227) began filling my mailbox with software like ''Catch a Hamantash'' (named for the cake eaten on Purim), ''Bible Baseball,'' ''Dreidel Drama'' (named for the spinning toy used on Hanukkah) and ''All About Purim'' that I realized the extent to which computers really are beginning to enter into religious life itself. For Passover, there are programs such as ''How to Conduct a Seder'' ($30), ''All About Passover'' ($30) and ''Crumb Eater'' ($24.95), so named because of the practice of removing leavened bread from the home before Passover. ''CRUMB EATER,'' billed as ''the arcade action game for Passover,'' employs a Pac-Man-type character running back and forth gobbling up all the bread crumbs in the house, at 10 points per crumb. Hit a wall and you lose five points. Extra crumbs, each representing minus two points, appear whenever you don't gobble quickly enough. You have 60 seconds in which to complete the game. If you need more time to coordinate your fingers while running the maze, hit the escape key; the crumb eater will stop to give you a breather. But then you'll have to answer a question, such as whether Moses was descended from the tribe of A. (Reuben), B. (Dan) or C. (Levi). Make the right choice and you will gain five extra seconds on the game. Make a mistake and you'll be greeted with a rather pert, ''That's wrong.'' ''How to Conduct a Seder'' and the two-disk ''All About Passover'' suffer from rather graceless graphics and programming of somewhat irregular quality. The menu choices of the latter include Passover facts, practices, customs and history (which includes animation of the burning bush, the plague of frogs and the splitting of the Red Sea) as well as Seder Sayings and various quizzes. The quizzes, for both the basic and the advanced sections, are somewhat limited in scope, containing only 20 questions apiece. In ''How to Conduct a Seder,'' your Apple displays rhymed rubrics of the Seder ritual, accompanying them with traditional melodies. The program is meant to be used in conjunction with the Haggadah, the Passover text recited at a seder.

85-> Hotels
To the Editor: In reference to the ar ticle entitled ''Memo to Hotel Managers'' (Travel, July 10), I am just about to go off on another trip and I wonder how many hotel rooms will be furnished with clothes hooks. Fewer and fewer hotels provide hooks in the bathroom for a robe or in their closets. I have noticed (sign of the times?) an advertisement in a mail-order catalogue for hooks to suspend from the hanger bar. Let hotel managers be advised that some of us miss the old-fashioned clothes hooks. ELIZABETH S. HERMAN Los Angeles, Calif.

86-> NEW YORK; A WAKE FOR WESTWAY
There is no longer any way for the proponents of Westway, no matter how well-intentioned their beliefs about the proposed megadevelopment, to separate the scandal that keeps oozing out of the project from the merits of the plan itself. Last year, the people responsible for taking the 4.2 mile superhighway/ park/real estate development scheme through the Federal permit process shot themselves in both feet. Now they have inflicted a mortal wound. The latest disclosure of public malfeasance came last Thursday when the U.S. Attorney disclosed that the man in charge of the New York district office of the Corps of Engineers -that is, the man responsible for making Federal findings about this plan for Manhattan's Lower West Side shorefront and whether it should proceed -had sought employment, after his coming retirement from the Army, with the firm that serves as the main engineering consultant for Westway. To boil it down, Col. Walter M. Smith Jr. - an engineer in his 26th Army year who retires on June 27 - asked for a job at Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas, the overall engineers on Westway who have received to date $25 million in public funds and who stand to make scores of millions more if the project goes through. He sent his ''Dear Steve'' job-seeking letter to Seymour S. Greenfield, the top official of Parsons Brinckerhoff, on Oct. 13 of last year. This was at a time when he was deliberating whether to order new studies on the damage Westway would do to fish life in the Hudson - studies that conservationists say are crucial - or to reject the idea and speed the plan to final Federal approval. Soon after sending his letter, he decided against any new studies and later met - on Jan. 5 of this year - with Mr. Greenfield and two other senior executives of Parsons to discuss his job petition. Those who oppose Westway, meanwhile, had filed contempt motions in Federal court against the Corps of Engineers and the New York State Department of Transportation on the grounds that both had violated the court's orders of last spring. That series of rulings - by Judge Thomas P. Griesa - blocked all Westway work until the corps had completed a proper environmental review of the potential harm to fish life. Judge Griesa's rulings harshly criticized Federal and state officials and some state consultants (a powerful firm known as SYDEC) for violating Federal environmental laws through cover-up, distortion of data, false testimony and other chicanery. He also accused the state's lawyers, Beveridge & Diamond, of participating in some of the central deceptions. His findings were largely upheld by a Federal appeals court last month. One would think the earlier disclosures would have made all the participants extra sensitive to the letter of the law. But that was not the case. Colonel Smith's job search came to light while the U.S. Attorney's office was preparing him for a pre-trial deposition in the contempt case; the Federal lawyers said he volunteered the information. In revealing this before Judge Griesa last Thursday, U.S. Attorney John S. Martin Jr. said that ''in view of the appearance of a conflict of interest,'' the Army had ''vacated'' Colonel Smith's decision against further fishery studies and had ordered his successor to begin a new evaluation immediately. Colonel Smith was relieved of all Westway responsibilities and the matter was sent to the Inspector General of the Corps of Engineers for an investigation. Colonel Smith's explanation is at best bizarre. He said in an interview that while the three Parsons executives were ''personal and professional friends'' of his, he never knew - until he read it in newspapers last Friday - that the firm was the main engineering consultant on Westway. ''I knew they had some involvement, but I did not know what,'' he said. In the end, the Colonel insisted there was absolutely no conflict - ''I've got a clear conscience. I'll look anyone in the eye'' - even though Army regulations on ''Negotiating for Employment'' expressly forbid the very approach he made. This case cries out for a special prosecutor. As a practical matter -whether one supports the idea of Westway or opposes it, as I do, as a $4 billion luxury we cannot afford in a time of austerity - the mess is going to keep seeping out. And it's going to keep Westway in the courts for years. The project and its scandal are now one. Governor Cuomo has until now supported Westway as a jobs and development program. But the Governor calls himself a ''progressive pragmatist'' and he can honor pragmatism now by recognizing reality and killing the project once and for all. This will spare Westway a slow death and will save for the city the option of trading in the interstate highway project for a more modest road plus $1 billion in Federal funds for mass transit, which we clearly need more. The Governor also can, and should, appoint a special prosecutor. It's the only way the air can be cleared and the scandal laid to rest.

87-> U.S. CORN SOUGHT IN DROUGHT RELIEF
Devastated by a drought, ranchers and poultrymen across the South and West are bringing increasing pressure on the Reagan Administration to release stored grains that they contend are needed to save livestock from starvation or early slaughter. So far, the Government has refused, saying there is no way to provide surplus grain selectively to severely drought-plagued areas without providing the same aid to all ranchers. Texas agriculture officials maintain that 22.6 million bushels of surplus corn, enough to feed starving Texas cattle for 300 days, lies molding in a Government warehouse at a cost to taxpayers of $500,000 a month. ''That corn is going to hell when it ought to be going to West Texas,'' the state Agriculture Commissioner, Jim Hightower, said, Although the sharpest criticism of the Government's refusal to release stored grain comes from Texas, other drought-ridden states have also lodged pleas for release of the grain. States Pressing for Grain Among them are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. New Mexico has offered to join Texas in pressing for release of the grain. In Washington, meanwhile, both the House Agriculture Committee and the full Senate have approved legislation that would force emergency feed measures. By a vote of 28 to 9 on Wednesday, the House committee approved a measure that would require Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block to provide $500 million in feed assistance. The assistance would come either in the form of sales of grain from Government granaries like that at Plainview, Tex., where the 22.6 million bushels are stored, or in direct assistance to ranchers and poultrymen to maintain their herds and flocks. The action followed a similar emergency feed provision approved earlier by the Senate. That measure, an amendment to dairy and tobacco legislation offered by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, would compel the sale of 80 million bushels of poorer grade corn, not used for human consumption, at reduced prices to ranchers and poultry raisers in drought disaster areas. Fear Voiced on Problem Despite some sincere efforts, said Representative Ed Jones, Democrat of Tennessee who is chairman of the subcommittee that first considered the House feed bill, ''not nearly enough has been done or is going to be done.'' The Administration has also been prodded by the Southern Governors Conference, which met last month in Austin and adopted a resolution calling for release of the feed grain and greatly expanded Federal aid. However, the sharpest assault on the Government's refusal to release disaster relief feed corn came in the form of the assertion by Texas agriculture officials that it had misrepresented the quality of corn stored at Plainview. Texas officials said they had been told that the stored corn at Plainview was of good quality and therefore too valuable to release as livestock food. However, both Commissioner Hightower and Gov. Mark White maintained that corn growers themselves had said the corn was poor quality and should be released. According to its own analysis of 86 samples drawn from the storage bins, performed by an outside laboratory, Mr. Hightower reported that ''the corn not only is of low quality, but actually is in much worse shape that we had suspected.'' Analysis of Corn Cited He said the laboratory analysis had shown that, of the 22,660,215 bushels stored in one large warehouse, 77 percent had ''seriously deteriorated'' and that 53 percent was now below the quality deemed adequate for human consumption. ''A lot of it is much worse off than that,'' Mr. Hightower said in a statement. ''It's moldy, its musty, it's weevilly. A great deal of it is no longer even fit to feed to sheep or goats - the only thing it can still be used for is cattle feed, and some of it won't be fit to use as anything but filler by the time the winter's over.'' In a telephone interview from Washington, Richard Goldberg, the the Deputy Under Secretary of Agriculture responsible for the commodity program, said that the results of the state sampling conflicted with a similar one conducted by the storage warehouse operator, who stores the grain under Government contract. That sampling, also based on 86 batches, showed the stored corn to be of good quality, he said. ''But as far as we are concerned,'' he said, ''neither inspection was official.'' He said the Agriculture Department's own records indicated that the stored corn had not deteriorated. Mr. Goldberg also noted that when the corn was first stored in January 1981, as excess commodity, 732,000 of the bushels were shown as ''sample grade,'' the lowest quality grade, broken kernels, dust and foreign materials.

88-> THEATER: 'ON YOUR TOES,' A '36 RODGERS AND HART
THE biggest thrill offered by ''On Your Toes,'' the 1936 musical revived last night at the Virginia, is the poster outside the theater. There you will find three of the most illustrious names of Broadway history - Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and George Abbott - as well as a fourth name that transcends both Broadway and history, George Balanchine. It's sad that the show heralded by the poster has only a marginal relationship to the giant talents who share top billing. ''On Your Toes'' is one of the weakest endeavors ever to engage the concentration of these men, together or separately. It is a mystery why Mr. Abbott and some dedicated new collaborators - among them such ballet royalty as Natalia Makarova and Peter Martins - have devoted so much loving care and expense to resuscitating it now. The last Broadway revival of this musical, in 1954, was a failure, and that clearly was no fluke. Though ''On Your Toes'' is an undeniable historic artifact - what work created by these artists would not be? - it is of footnote caliber. Its few assets as entertainment are scattered like sweet and frail rose petals on a stagnant pond. In its original production, the show was cheered primarily because of its star, Ray Bolger, and because it contained the first ballet ever to be integrated into the plot of a musical, ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue.'' Given its mirthless, lengthy book and (by Rodgers and Hart standards) middling, brief score, ''On Your Toes'' needs a dynamic leading man of Mr. Bolger's stature to have even a prayer of flying today: the musical's hero - a hoofer-turned-music professor caught up with a Russian ballet company and the underworld - is at the center of nearly everything. At the Virginia, this role has unaccountably fallen to Lara Teeter, a standard Broadway chorus dancer with little discernible personality. He fails to carry the show and undermines its noble efforts to reproduce the past faithfully. Paired with Christine Andreas in two supreme duets, ''There's a Small Hotel'' and ''It's Got to Be Love,'' he provides insipid crooning that sends the normally vibrant Miss Andreas crashing to his level. Paired with Miss Makarova in ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue,'' he brings such leaden strain to its final passage that he deflates his partner's delightful contribution and mars the hard work done by Mr. Martins, who has fastidiously reconstructed the Balanchine choreography for this production. Even if Mr. Teeter were an airy and antic Bolgeresque dancer, however, it's not clear that the climactic ballet would be a sufficient payoff to the dull subplots and hoary gags that precede it. Though ''Slaughter'' has aged far better than most of its surroundings, this splash of gangster-motif jazziness is but a doodle next to ''Who Cares?,'' the Balanchine classic set to Gershwin tunes of the same period. Nor does ''Slaughter'' seem the stunning theatrical innovation that audiences found it in 1936. While the dance may be worked into the show's plot, that plot is so arbitrary and silly that the exercise is a pointless technical feat. It was really the Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration with Agnes de Mille in ''Oklahoma!'' seven years later that meaningfully wedded serious dance to the fabric of a Broadway musical. The other Balanchine dance of the evening, the Act I finale, is a gag that has outlived its time: a parody of Fokine's ballet ''Sheherazade.'' Because the satirical target is no longer a popular favorite, this extended cartoon plays to dead silence. Only Miss Makarova and her expert partner, a fellow American Ballet Theater alumnus, George de la Pena, get the joke. It says how much Mr. Balanchine has remade the face of dance in the decades since ''On Your Toes'' that he, not his Russian predecessors, is now a subject of parody in a current Broadway musical: ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue'' is ribbed mildly by Gower Champion in ''42d Street.'' ''On Your Toes'' also has a considerable amount of new, non-Balanchine choreography in the appropriate period vernacular, provided by Donald Saddler. The best of it can be found in the title number, which is rousingly conceived as a fantasy battle between ballet and tap dancers: it is graced by an all-too-brief appearance by another fine soloist, the lithe Starr Danias, but is also chilled by the all-black setting provided by the designer, Zack Brown. Like the dancing, the music is generally presented with admirable authenticity. The score is heard in mostly the original Hans Spialek orchestrations; a large band (shimmering twin pianos included) plays it to soaring effect under the exceptional direction of John Mauceri. The miking is minimal - it's a pleasure to find no credit for ''sound design'' in the Playbill. Unfortunately, most of the solo singers have trouble projecting their lyrics past the pit. Though we hear the routine Hart sentiments to the lovely Rodgers tune for the choral number ''Quiet Night,'' the more dexterous words to ''Small Hotel'' and ''Too Good for the Average Man'' tend to evaporate. As for Mr. Abbott's staging, it's the patented article - straightforward, uncampy, all-American in its foursquare ingenuousness. How one wishes he had chosen to apply his firm hand to a revival of a subsequent Rodgers-Hart-Abbott musical such as ''The Boys From Syracuse'' or ''Pal Joey'' instead. One also wishes that Mr. Abbott had given the show's book major instead of cosmetic surgery and that he had gotten more out of his cast: from Mr. Teeter and Miss Andreas through the ranks (which include George S. Irving and Dina Merrill), we get at most dogged professionalism. The surprising exception is Miss Makarova, all dolled up as a flirtatious blond ballerina. It's true that her comic displays of temperament are amateur, but it's equally true that great acting isn't required. What Miss Makarova brings to ''On Your Toes,'' in addition to her leggy mock-stripper's turn in ''Slaughter,'' is a sense of freshness and fun. She seems to be the only one who finds doing this show an invigorating novelty, rather than a rigorous academic exercise in historical preservation. And it's only when she's on stage that we feel we're at the theater, witnessing something alive and new, rather than at school, dutifully poring over the musty lesser sketches of the old masters.

89-> CURRNCY MARKETS; DOLLAR LOSES GROUND AS PRICE OF GOLD RISES
The dollar weakened in international currency trading yesterday and gold prices rose. Traders attributed the dollar's showing to short-covering in sterling, and the absence of a realignment of the European Monetary System. The realignment of the System, an arm of the Common Market, had been widely expected, given the wide differences in the economic performances of its member states. In European trading, the French franc was the biggest gainer against the dollar. It jumped 23 centimes, and analysts said the rise was aided by results of municipal elections Sunday in which the ruling Socialists gained. The Italian lira also gained strongly, aided by an $18.5 million sale by the Bank of Italy. Among major European currencies, only the Swiss franc was marginally lower. Here are late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday: 2.3895 West German marks, down from 2.3925; 2.0680 Swiss francs, up from 2.0650; 6.7650 French francs, down from 6.9900; 2.6435 Dutch guilders, down from 2.6485; 1,419.00 Italian lire, down from 1,429.50, and 1.22645 Canadian dollars, unchanged. Late dollar rates in New York on Monday compared with Friday were: 2.3726 West German marks, down from 2.3965; 6.6955 French francs, down from 6.9375; 2.0445 Swiss francs, down from 2.0660; 235.55 Japanese yen, down from 238.60, and 1.2232 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2293. The British pound cost $1.5230, up from $1.5025. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.5080, compared with $1.5075 late Friday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar had strengthened, closing at 238.60 yen, compared with 237.45 yen Friday. Later in London, the dollar slipped to 237.88 yen. Gold was aided by news that OPEC ministers meeting in London had reached a pricing and production accord, agreeing to a benchmark price of $29 a barrel for crude and a cap on daily output of 17.5 million barrels. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $436.70 an ounce, up $9.20 from Friday. In later United States trading, Republic National Bank quoted gold at $436, up from $428 on Friday. In London, gold finished at $428.25 a troy ounce, compared with $422 on Friday. In Zurich, Europe's largest gold market, the late rate was $427.50, up from $421 on Friday.

90-> MRS. DOLE STRESSES SAFE ROADS OVER BIG RIGS
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole has called unjustified the fears expressed by many states that the Federal Government will strong-arm them into accepting big trucks on unsafe highways. ''Where safety is a problem, we will de-designate the roads in our plan,'' Mrs. Dole said in an interview Friday. ''I want to address any problem that any state has, because we want safe roads.'' On April 5 the Federal Highway Administration unveiled a plan to permit wider use of Federal roads by double-trailer trucks. Some states in the Northeast, South and West protested that the agency had ignored state guidance on which roads to designate. Last week the Highway Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department, withdrew for reconsideration the designated roads in four states that sued the Government, and it indicated that it would also respond to complaints from other states uneasy with the plan. Safety Is Emphasized Mrs. Dole, who succeeded Drew Lewis on Feb. 1 as the eighth Transportation Secretary, said safety would be the hallmark of her tenure, whether addressing railroad movement, highway driving, air traffic control or boating. Several aspects of the trucking problem have occupied Mrs. Dole in her first weeks on the job. The action on the large trucks was one of the major provisions in legislation leading to the 5-cent increase in gasoline and diesel taxes, and the truckers have been lobbying to roll back special increases in taxes on heavy trucks. ''We are willing to work with the trucking industry to redress many grievances, but we are not prepared to change the tax,'' Mrs. Dole said, ''although we may talk about different ways to implement it.'' She added, ''Even when the new taxes are fully phased in, we calculate that the industry will be paying 25 percent less than their share of road upkeep.'' The trucking industry, with gains in efficiency from the use of larger trucks, can expect a $3.2 billion net increase in productivity after the payment of higher taxes, she said. Air Control System Recovering On other matters, Mrs. Dole made these points: - The air traffic control system is well on the way to full recovery, and she has no plan to reinstate substantial numbers of controllers who were dismissed after an illegal strike. ''The morale problem would be enormous if we took the fired controllers back,'' she said. - She stands firmly behind a previous commitment, made when the gasoline tax was enacted, to entertain applications for new mass transit rail starts and extensions. She prevailed in a dispute on the issue with David A. Stockman, the budget director. - Air-bag passenger restraint systems in cars will get thorough testing and public exposure through a plan to put them in 5,000 Government cars and possibly through the development of kits to put them on the driver's side in some vehicles, such as police cars. - The department is ''pleased'' at the constant improvement of Conrail's finances, raising hopes that the Government-owned, formerly bankrupt railroad can soon be sold in one piece to private operators. - With the new gas tax, money is flowing out of the Highway Trust Fund at a record pace. Since January $2.97 billion has been disbursed, raising hopes that $12 billion will be disbursed for work on roads and bridges by October. Mrs. Dole said that in the coming months the top priorities for the department would be to complete the sale of Conrail, develop a system of user fees to aid in supporting Coast Guard operations, and to improve and maintain morale at the Federal Aviation Administration.

91-> The Olympic Equestrian Team
I assume that P. S. Wood lists the United States Equestrian Team among the elitist interests of the former Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage, and that is why it gets no mention in his article ''Olympics '84: America Gets Set'' (July 3). The fact is that there will be some 350 horses and riders competing in the 1984 Olympics just 14 miles north of the Coliseum. Santa Anita Park, in Arcadia, Calif., is being adjusted to accommodate most of the events; the cross-country competition will take place at Fairbanks Country Club, in Del Mar. Equestrian events will be scheduled throughout the two weeks of the games. In addition to three-day eventing, there will be dressage, individual jumping and team show jumping. MARION W. COPELAND Pelham, Mass.

92-> UNITS OF 4 CITY AGENCIES TO BE MOVED TO QUEENS
Parts of four city agencies, involving at least 800 employees, will be moving their offices from Manhattan to Queens under an agreement announced yesterday by Mayor Koch and other city officials. The agreement resolves, for now, a long-running dispute over how the municipal government can better use its employees and the money it spends for office space to revitalize commercial areas outside Manhattan. For nearly a year, critics of the Koch administration blocked renewal of the leases of four other city agencies in a building in lower Manhattan until the Mayor acceded to their demands to move some agencies to other boroughs. In exchange for his willingness to move the offices and employees to unspecified sites in Jamaica, Queens, Mr. Koch got immediate Board of Estimate approval to renew the leases in the Manhattan building, at 40 Worth Street. The vote, 11 to 0, allows the city to spend $2.4 million a year for 203,000 square feet of space there. 'Something Symbolic' ''We had to do something symbolic to produce some movement on an issue that is very important for Queens,'' said Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President, as the agreement was announced. Asked if there was empty office space in Jamaica, Mr. Manes made a slight sneer and answered: ''We have empty buildings.'' He made his comments in Mr. Koch's City Hall office, where he and the Mayor were joined by Council President Carol Bellamy and Councilman Archie Spigner, Democrat of Queens. While the three visiting officials praised the Mayor for taking the advice he has given to private companies - to set up shop outside Manhattan - they also indicated that they were not fully satisfied. ''Other leases are going to have to be justified as they come up for renewal,'' Miss Bellamy warned. ''This is just the beginning.'' Mr. Manes declined to predict other specific agencies he would seek, saying that ''this is my day to be gracious.'' ''No,'' the Mayor said with a laugh. ''This is your day to be grateful .'' Annual Cost of $80 Million Over all, the city leases about 18 million square feet of space at an annual cost of about $80 million. Although only about one-third of that space is in Manhattan, the administration has long been accused of not using its largess to stabilize troubled neighborhoods in the other boroughs. The failure of the critics to get what they wanted from the administration led them to focus on the required Board of Estimate approval for the leases up for renewal at 40 Worth Street, which is just a few blocks from City Hall. Mayoral aides said that they had not settled on specific buildings in Jamaica but that they hoped the first moves could be made by the end of this year. The agency that will be most affected is the Human Resources Administration, with 500 of its employees in the Medicaid and hospital and long-term care units due to leave their offices at 330 West 34th Street in Manhattan. Others involved are the General Services Department's quality assurance laboratories, the new technical services unit of the Parks and Recreation Department and some employees of the Environmental Control Board. Altogether, city officials expect the agencies to rent about 100,000 square feet of space. The agencies now occupy about 75,000 square feet of rented space in Manhattan as well as some city- owned space. An additional 24,000 square feet of space in Jamaica will be rented by a unit of the Board of Elections, which is shifting some employees from its Long Island City section.

95-> CBS VIETNAM DOCUMENTARY FAULTED
''Inside Story,'' public television's weekly critique of broadcast and print journalism, contends in its program on WNET at 8 tonight that CBS News, in a documentary aired last year, failed to prove its contention that United States military officials deceived President Lyndon B. Johnson and the American people about enemy troop strength in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. The CBS report, ''The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,'' was a 90-minute documentary that sought to show that the United States military intelligence apparatus in Vietnam as well as the former commander of the American military forces there, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, deceived the President, Congress and the American people about aspects of the war. CBS said General Westmoreland consistently underreported enemy strength in the area to make it appear that his own forces were stronger and were winning the war. The CBS show has been controversial since it was broadcast. When General Westmoreland demanded 45 minutes of rebuttal time, CBS offered him 15 minutes. He refused it and sought $120 million from CBS News in a libel suit. The suit is still pending. CBS has stood by its story but it has admitted to some violations of the network's news-gathering guidelines. Van Gordon Sauter, CBS News president, acknowledged that there had not been enough interviews supporting General Westmoreland's views. Broadcast Jan. 23, 1982 The CBS report was broadcast on Jan. 23, 1982. It opened with this comment by Mike Wallace, its correspondent: ''Tonight we are going to present evidence of what we have come to believe was a conscious effort - indeed, a conspiracy - at the highest levels of American military intelligence to suppress and alter critical intelligence on the enemy in the year leading up to the Tet offensive.'' In the edition of ''Inside Story'' scheduled to be broadcast nationally tonight, its correspondent, Hodding Carter 3d, offered his own conclusion. ''History may yet decide that there was indeed a conspiracy in Saigon to fake the numbers,'' he said. ''But at this point the evidence is less compelling, the witnesses more contradictory and the possible conclusions less obvious than the documentary suggests.'' No Comment From CBS A spokesman for CBS News said the network would not comment on the ''Inside Story'' program until it had been broadcasat. Mr. Wallace was interviewed for three hours by ''Inside Story'' but declined to appear on the screen. In an interview, Mr. Carter said the two-month ''Inside Story'' investigation had not uncovered new information about the military operations in Vietnam, but did turn up ''a lot of old information that was not included in the documentary.'' He said that George Crile, a CBS producer, and his staff either did not talk to or did not include interviews with Gen. Philip Davidson, head of the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam; Gen. George Gooding, head of military intelligence in Vietnam, or with Walt W. Rostow, a special assistant to President Johnson. ''If you're going to make a case that there was a conspiracy at the highest levels of American intelligence,'' Mr. Carter said, ''then you have to go to the highest levels and allow the chief conspirators to talk.'' 'Seems Time Enough' Mr. Carter said during the program that CBS officials told him they ''couldn't reach'' General Davidson because he was ill. ''The show was 15 months in the making,'' Mr. Carter noted. ''That seems like time enough to reach almost anyone.'' General Davidson, reached by ''Inside Story,'' said he had gotten married during that period, had been ''playing lots of tennis'' and was accessible. CBS interviewed Mr. Rostow more than three hours but used none of it. Interviewed by ''Inside Story,'' Mr. Rostow scoffed at the conspiracy theory and said President Johnson knew about the varying figures.

96-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; A Skiing Dispute
Did Bill Koch ''steal'' the World Cup? That's what some of the coaches and administrators of the Scandinavian cross-country ski teams say about the American champion's performance last year. Koch made history when his season-long race results gave him the title of the best cross-country skier in the world. The problem is that the Scandinavians claim Koch skated rather than skied to his victories. Skating steps have been used in cross-country skiing for hundreds of years, but primarily to round corners and change direction, not as part of forward movement. The traditional technique, called the diagonal stride because the opposite arm and leg move in unison, is to push forward with skis parallel. Koch and some of his fellow American skiers and coaches decided that the traditional technique was too slow on flat, hard courses used for long races of 50 to 100 kilometers. They figured that by spreading their ski tips and pushing off the skis' edges in a skating step, they could make more speed on straight courses. One problem was that this technique takes much more energy and strength. Using roller skis on pavement for summer practice as well as special weight-training exercises, they developed added muscle strength as well as skill in skating. Then, last season, the United States' nordic team began edging higher in race results. Going into the final two races, a Swede, Thomas Wassberg, was in the lead. However, the courses for the last two races were perfect for Bill Koch's skating steps. He won the events and took the cup. But the Swedes and other Scandinavians cried foul. It was not aesthetically or functionally refined enough for the sport of crosscountry skiing. Besides, it ruined the racing tracks that are prepared for skis running parallel. Despite these objections, cross-country racers from other countries began using the skating step. Even Wassberg adapted it to his technique. The Scandinavians then tried to push a set of rules through the Federation Internationale de Ski governing body that would have banned skating in cross-country skiing. Their idea was to post judges along the course to disqualify any skiers who skated anywhere except at corners. That hasty rules maneuver failed, but on Sunday, a sub-group of the F.I.S. cross-country committee will meet to write proposed rules on skating for the full F.I.S. group to vote on. ''The idea of judges along the course is viewed by most coaches as unenforceable'' said Jim Page, the United States nordic ski team director. He feels the technique will be banned at the first 100 meters and the final 200 meters of the courses where the television cameras can pick it up.

99-> U.S. REMAINS QUIET ON BEGIN DECISION
Spokesmen for the White House and the State Department both said today that Prime Minister Menachem Begin's announcement that he intended to resign was ''an internal matter for the Israeli Government.'' But privately considerable uncertainty was expressed by officials both at the State Department and in Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is on vacation, on what to make of Mr. Begin's statement. Administration officials said they were just as much in the dark as the Israelis as to whether Mr. Begin genuinely wanted to retire or was simply floating a trial balloon to attract support for remaining in office. Those dealing with Israeli affairs are inclined to believe that Mr. Begin is tired of public office, and sincerely intends to quit, one State Department official said. ''But he has been very loyal to his closest supporters, and they might persuade him not to resign,'' the official added. U.S. Avoids Public Comment Because of this uncertainty, the Administration, in a series of phone calls between Washington and Santa Barbara, decided to avoid any public comment that might be seen as trying to influence Mr. Begin's decision. The possibility of Mr. Begin's resignation was regarded, however, as a major development, even if there was little said publicly. President Reagan was informed by James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, at 7 A.M. Pacific time. Mr. Baker, in turn, had been alerted to the development by the National Security Council staff. State Department officials were in phone contact with Ambassador Samuel W. Lewis in Tel Aviv, and William P. Clark, the national security adviser, spoke by phone with the special Middle East envoy, Robert C. McFarlane, who was in London. But senior Reagan Administration officials said that if Mr. Begin did resign, it would help American peace efforts in the Middle East. Last Sept. 1, Mr. Reagan delivered a Middle East initiative that was aimed at giving a ''fresh start,'' in his words, to peace efforts. It outlined approaches for reviving the negotiations on Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and held out the possibility of an eventual association between the West Bank and Jordan, which had control of the territory until it was captured by Israel in 1967. West Bank Policy Criticized The President also criticized the Israeli policy of building civilian settlements in the West Bank and called for a moratorium on new ones pending new negotiations in which Jordan and local Palestinians would join Egypt, Israel and the United States. The plan was bitterly assailed by Mr. Begin and his Government, but supported by the opposition Labor Party. After months of discussion, King Hussein of Jordan decided last April not to join the negotiations after he failed to win the support of the Palestine Liberation Organization. ''I can't tell you that if Begin is gone the Israelis will change their mind about the initiative,'' one State Department official said. ''But there is a chance that there may be some re- thinking in Israel with Begin gone.'' In the past year, Administration officials have made no secret of their view that if the Labor Party could win the elections and take over the government there would be increased flexibility on Israel's part. The Labor Party controlled Israel's Government from its inception in 1948 to 1977 when Mr. Begin won an upset victory.

101-> CREDIT MARKETS; INTEREST RATES DOWN SLIGHTLY
Interest rates fell slightly yesterday. Treasury market participants said there were no new developments pointing toward significantly higher or lower rates. Securities dealers said there was strong investor interest in the new two-year notes and long-term Treasury bonds but less activity in intermediate-term issues. At the regular monthly auction of two-year notes, the Treasury sold $7.75 billion of new 9 1/2 percent notes at an average yield of 9.61 percent, down from 9.66 percent in March. By late in the day, prices had strengthened enough for the new notes to be offered at a yield of 9.57 percent. In the long-term bond market, the 10 3/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2012 were as low as 98 5/8 about mid-day, but they closed at an offered price of 99 1/8 to yield 10.48 percent. ''With the recovery that is under way, we expect interest rates to fluctuate in a relatively narrow range,'' said Alfred A. Wagner, director of the fixed-income division at the Boston Company. He said he was keeping his portfolios fully invested, with emphasis on intermediate-term maturities of about 8 to 10 years. The Outlook for Inflation ''We do not see inflation as much of a problem, even if the recovery were at a more normal pace,'' Mr. Wagner said. But it's too soon to tell, he added, whether the decline of inflation will continue throughout this business cycle. The inflation rate in future years may depend largely on the degree to which the Federal Reserve stimulates the economy by encouraging faster growth of the nation's money supply. Mr. Wagner said that so far he was ''not distressed'' by the Fed's policy, which has promoted faster money supply growth since mid-1982. He said that ''we don't expect the Fed to continue to ease policy well into the recovery,'' as was done in 1975-76. The latest report on the gross national product, showing a real growth rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter, had little effect on the credit markets, though it was less than the growth rate of 4 percent or more that dealers had expected. Market participants say that a slow recovery will be more conducive to stable or lower interest rates. Slow economic growth is associated with less demand for money, which would make it easier for the Fed to achieve its money supply growth objectives. Currently the level and growth rate of the money supply is above the Fed's objectives. Statistics From Government Slower economic growth is also associated with less inflation. The Commerce Departement report showed that inflation (as shown by the implicit price deflator, which measures changes in prices and consumption) rose at a 5.8 percent rate in the first quarter, up from 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Inflation was less if gauged by the fixed-weighted index measuring only price changes, which rose at a 3.2 percent rate, less than the 4.9 percent of the fourth quarter. Commerce Department analysts said the implicit price deflator would have been only 2.7 percent if adjusted to remove increases caused by fluctuations in inventories, oil imports and purchases by the Commodity Credit Corporation. In the corporate bond market, securities firms found enough investor demand to announce several new issues for sale today. The largest financing was a $300 million issue of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company 11 1/2 percent debentures, offered at a price of 98 3/4 to yield 11.65 percent to maturity in 2023 through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. Today a Salomon Brothers group plans to offer $100 million of AAArated 10 5/8 percent mortgage-backed bonds of the Bowery Savings Bank at a price of 99.9 to yield 10.65 percent. The bonds are collateralized by mortgages but are obligations of the savings bank. A First Boston Corporation group yesterday offered a $100 million issue of Aa2-rated 10 1/2 percent notes of First Interstate Bancorp at a price of 99 1/2 to yield 10.63 percent. Following are results of yesterday's auction of new two-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price 99.805 verage Yield 9.61% Low Price High Yield 9.63% High Price 99.822 Low Yield Accepted at low 13% applied for $19,101,125 Accepted N.Y. applied for $16,284,070 .Y. accepted $6,705,555 ncompetitive The two-year notes mature April 30, 1985.

103-> Trading Light In Eurobonds
Fixed-interest dollar bonds fell in early trading today, but rose in the afternoon to close largely unchanged from late trading on Wednesday. Dealers said trading activity was very light. The market moved up after trading in New York opened narrowly mixed this afternoon amid signs thatthe recent weakness there may now be steadying. Dealers said trading was hesitant because some analysts expect the Federal Reserve report on the United States money supply may show an increase of as much as $7 billion. Among newer dollar straight issues, the European Economic Commission's 12 percent 1993 bond recovered some of this morning's losses, adding 1/4 point, to trade at 97 7/8 bid, 98 1/4 asked, while the Citicorp isssue rallied 1/8 point, to 96 5/8 bid, 97 1/4 asked. There was little change in United States convertibles, dealers said.

104-> A BUS TOUR THAT SHOWS HARLEM'S MANY SIDES
There once was a time, when Duke Ellington summoned the world to ''Take the A Train'' to Harlem, in which jazz musicians and poets, literati and cultural cognoscenti flocked to 125th Street. ''Harlem of the 1920's was presented as a great playground, America's answer to Paris,'' as the historian Gilbert Osofsky wrote. And 50 years before, the stately town houses of Sugar Hill, Striver's Row and Jumel Terrace were home to such wealthy New Yorkers as the Astors and the Baileys of Barnum & Bailey. In more recent times, however, Harlem, one of New York's most historic and culturally rich areas, has become virtually unknown to most of the city's dwellers. But there has been a notable change in atmosphere in Harlem in the last decade, according to Lucien Corcos, a 67-year-old Moroccan-born French Jew who has fallen in love with the somewhat faded capital of black America and has organized a series of bus tours of the community, which are given every weekend. ''People have heard such terrible things about Harlem,'' Mr. Corcos said. ''But after the tours, they say that they would certainly come back.'' Harlem, he stresses, has become less dangerous and antagonistic to the world below 110th Street. His company, Harlem Spirituals, is one of several focusing on the architecture, culture and history of the five-and- a-half square miles bounded by Central Park and 162d Street. Most Visitors From Europe According to Peggy Taylor, a guide for Harlem Spirituals, the majority of tourgoers now are Europeans because, she explained: ''New Yorkers are fearful or think they know everything about Harlem. People are surprised how vast Harlem is or how lovely the Sugar Hill area is. They think it's all blight.'' Tucked away between pockets of devastation and reminders of past dynamism and affluence are still other layers of Harlem's history. Founded in 1658 by the Dutch as Nieuwe Haarlem, the area was primarily farmland until New Yorkers of the late 18th century, like Roger Morris, the Hamiltons, Delanceys and Beekmans, built their summer homes north of 140th Street. After a post-1870 building boom left Harlem with some of the city's best housing stock, the migration of hundreds of thousands of poor Southern blacks in the early 20th century transformed the white suburb into the world's foremost black cultural center. The Apollo, the Cotton Club, the Top Club - the very names evoke the sadly far-off magic of a time when jazz was king, gin was bootlegged and Harlem was the place to be. Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois were among the many who made the ''Harlem Renaissance'' of the 1920's. Urban Decay Sets In But as the century progressed, the great black influx led to severe overcrowding. By the 1960's, Harlem had become a catchword for the urban decay of the black ghetto. Ravaged by crime, depopulation and chronic economic depression, the once-proud community languished. While the city has talked of revitalization and the Uptown Chamber of Commerce has recently begun a campaign to attract business and visitors, it may well be pioneers like Mr. Corcos who will help turn the tide for Harlem. Mr. Corcos, a veteran tour operator in Israel, France and New York, offers four-hour Sunday tours of Harlem beginning at 9 A.M. They show visitors the blighted neighborhoods as well as the architectural treasures of Sugar Hill, near Convent Avenue and 142d Street; Hamilton Grange, Alexander Hamilton's 1801 house at Convent and 141st; City College, which has been on Convent Avenue since 1903; Striver's Row, 131 homes built on 138th and 139th Streets by the architect Stanford White in 1891; Jumel Terrace, 160th to 162d Street, near Edgecombe Avenue, which includes Paul Robeson's home of more than 50 years, and the Morris-Jumel Mansion, Edgecombe and 160th. The tour stops at the mansion, which served as George Washington's New York headquarters during the American Revolution and which is also the oldest private residence in Manhattan. From there, the tour passes the site of the old Polo Grounds, near Edgecombe and 155th; the Abyssinian Baptist Church, at Lenox Avenue and 138th Street, where the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. once presided, the oldest black church in New York, founded on Worth Street in 1808, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, at Lenox and 135th. Near the Apollo on 125th Street is the Hotel Theresa, where Joe Louis celebrated his victories and Fidel Castro once met Nikita Khrushchev. A Rousing Church Service At 11 A.M., the tour arrives at the First Corinthian Baptist Church, a former movie palace at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 116th Street. There joyous gospel singing and a rousing service are led by the Rev. Thomas H. McKinzie, pastor of the church since its founding in 1933. There are also Friday and Saturday night bus tours, which leave midtown at 7:30 and offer visitors plenteous soul-food dinners at Sylvia's restaurant, 328 Lenox Avenue, at 126th Street. Sometimes, when the groups are large, they are taken either to the Peach Tree, 557 West 125th Street, or to Wilson's, Amsterdam Avenue and 158th Street. Spicy chicken, traditional Southern ribs, collard greens, sweet potatoes and beans are followed by samplings of desserts - the tastiest being a sweet potato pie. The next stop on the tour is Small's Paradise, 2294 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, at 135th Street, a 1920's- vintage nightclub. Under the new management of Carl Yearwood, Small's is offering high-quality jazz and blues in a comfortable setting. The number for tour reservations is 275-1408. Sunday tours cost $22, and evening tour prices, including dinner, cover charge and drinks, are $49. Tour buses depart from the Short Line office, 166 West 46th Street. Walking Tour Offered Also in the Harlem tour business is Penny Sightseeing, which has conducted tours for two decades. It offers three-hour tours on Saturdays at 11 A.M. for $10, and on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10 A.M. for $15, which include a stop for gospel music. The number for reservations is 247-2860. These bus tours start at the organization's offices on the fifth floor at 303 West 42d Street. A group called Harlem Your Way has started several sightseeing excursions, including weekend-evening champagne-jazz tours, ranging in price from $28 to $50, which also visit Small's Paradise and another club, the Baby Grand, at 319 West 125th Street. This group also offers Harlem brownstone walking tours, generally on the second Sunday of the month, for $35. The number for information is 866-6997. And, as a sign that the area's tour business is expected to grow, the Uptown Chamber of Commerce has received a Department of Labor grant to train 20 people in Harlem culture to place as guides.

So when a group of news people realized recently that they were in a bus in Ohio following a candidate to a dry town, they began to grumble and gripe, recalling the alcohol-free days of bivouac in Plains, Ga., the home of Jimmy Carter. The Ohio candidate was Senator John Glenn, on his way to his hometown of New Concord to announce his candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Responding to the drinkers, Mr. Glenn's advance man, Ted Rodgers, got on his feet and made a wet promise: When John Glenn becomes President, he will summer in Vail, Colo., and winter in Cocoa Beach, Fla.

110-> ADDENDUM TO A 'DOOMSDAY' BOOK: THERE IS HOPE
''They forget that Cassandra was right,'' said Aurelio Peccei, the amiable and optimistic man who founded and presides over the Club of Rome. Eleven years ago, the club's study, ''The Limits to Growth,'' cast a chill over the buoyantly producing, reproducing and consuming world by predicting that mankind faced catastrophe within a century unless it acted quickly to establish an equilibrium in which population growth, industrialization and the depletion of resources were halted. Since publication of the report, which was prepared by an international research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the club has sponsored a continuing series of more limited studies and international conferences that have elaborated on the same theme. Mr. Peccei recently returned to his elegant Rome apartment from a conference in Budapest devoted to the discouraging question of how by the end of ths century the world will manage to feed six billion mouths. He heard some gloomy papers, bearing particularly on a likelihood that the capacity of the United States to make up much of the rest of the world's food deficit is diminishing. The Power of Mankind ''Going as we are going now, the United States will produce less food in proportion to the increasing demand in the world, and so it can export less in percentage than now to a world that will need more,'' Mr. Peccei said, referring to a study presented by an American organization called Carrying Capacity. But Mr. Peccei, who at the age of 75 shows no sign of letting things take their course, believes scenarios tend to be extreme and mankind retains the power to prevent the worst. In his opening speech in Budapest, he said, ''If six billion need food, let us see to it that six billion be in a condition to partake in the effort to make it available to each one of them.'' ''I am a pessimist when I see how things are,'' Mr. Peccei said when asked about his state of mind. ''I am an optimist when I see that there are ways in which things can be changed.'' It was certainly a life-affirming act when the former top-level executive of both Fiat and Olivetti, giants of Italian industry, decided in 1968 to invite about 25 European scientists, industrialists and humanists to meet here to look at the world's predicament and what could be done to prevent the worst. 'Theological Battles' Recounted ''The first meeting was a total flop,'' Mr. Peccei recalled. ''Theological battles started over such things as whether the word 'syst eme' is the equal of the English 'system.' But a few of us did not understand it was such a flop, so we continued.'' He has been president since the beginning because, he said, the club had to be registered somewhere and have statutes. ''We were registered in Geneva, and the statutes, which are one page, say there has to be a president,'' he said. ''So I'm the president.'' Membership is limited to 100, and there is an international waiting list. Little has changed in the Club of Rome, which is Roman only because Mr. Peccei lives here and founded it here. Above all, he said, the guiding principle that the club has no budget and accepts money from no one is unchanged. The club's meetings are financed by or in the country that invites it, and there is a waiting list there, too. The next two successful applicants are Colombia and Finland. 'Teams Have Total Freedom' The club does, however, solicit money for research reports that it asks study teams to prepare. Money is accepted with the donors knowing that ''the teams have total freedom - intellectually, ideologically, scientifically - to examine a subject and report according to their understanding,'' Mr. Peccei said. The club's headquarters are in the office of an intergovernental bureau for information for which, in return, Mr. Peccei is a dollar-a-year consultant. Mr. Peccei said his interest in the global predicament arose from his past as an anti-Fascist who spent a year in prison for his activities in World War II and his many years of work in the developing world, in China before the war and in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa for Fiat. Club's Goals Unchanged The club has become a voice so much listened to that Mr. Peccei said it sometimes made him uneasy. ''They think that we are wiser than we are, more influential than we are, know more things than we actually do,'' he said. The club's goals have not changed since its founding, he said. ''Since then, every indicator in the world has worsened except for one: human awareness,'' he said. ''And that is fundamental. People now understand that we are in a mess, that sacrifices have to be made.'' To add to this awareness is the Club of Rome's mission. ''People should know that the situation is very serious looked at from any angle - environment, peace and war, unemployment, socially and in the sense of values,'' Mr. Peccei said. ''But we say, my goodness, we have all the means to put it straight.'' Mr. Peccei, relaxing at home at the end of a long day, added: ''Remember, we don't want to be Cassandra. She was right, but she was not believed.''

113-> RYAN STRIKES OUT 12 AND GETS 8TH VICTORY
The Mets may seldom put their names in the record books this season, but they are helping others to do so. Nolan Ryan struck out 12 Mets last night at Shea Stadium to regain the career lead in the major leagues at 3,573 as the Houston Astros' right-hander won his eighth game in nine decisions, 6-3. The last time the Mets played before their All-Star Game break, last Monday night in Philadelphia, Steve Carlton of the Phillies struck out nine Mets to take the lead from Ryan at 3,569. ''I didn't know if I needed eight, 12 or 15 strikeouts,'' said Ryan, who has pitched 148 games in his career with 10 or more strikeouts. ''I just knew that Carlton had passed me. But I'm not really concerned with the record. If it happens, fine ... if not, well, at least I had a shot at it.'' It was Ryan's third game this season in which he had 10 or more strikeouts. It also was his second 12-strikeout game of the season, both against the Mets. No National League pitcher has struck out more than 12 in a game this season. Carlton, Mario Soto of the Cincinnati Reds and Atlee Hammaker of the San Francisco Giants also have struck out 12 this season. Soto did it against the Mets on May 6. Ryan is 5-0 in his last seven starts, all after being sidelined for a month with a pulled hamstring. He suffered the injury in his first 12-strikeout performance against the Mets. It was a perfect night for baseball. It would also have been perfect for a late sail or dinner at an outdoor cafe or a double feature at a drive-in. And, after two-thirds of an inning, Mike Torrez, the starter for the Mets, was free to do any of the three. Torrez, now 5-9, faced only seven batters. The Astros teed of on Torrez for five runs on six hits, including two doubles, a triple and a homer. The short stint also boosted Torrez' earned average from 3.93 to 4.30. After consecutive doubles by Terry Puhl and Dickie Thon brought in the first run with one out, Phil Garner made it 2-0 with his pop single to center. After Jose Cruz singled and Garner was thrown out at third, Torrez appeared to have the inning ended with Ray Knight's deep fly to center. But the center fielder, Mookie Wilson, backpedaling to the warning track on Knight's shot, tripped and fell when the ball hit his glove. Knight was on third with a triple, and the lead was 3-0. Torrez, on his next and last pitch, watched Bill Doran screech a shot into the Mets' bullpen in right for a 5-0 lead. ''Mike had a rough outing,'' said Manager Frank Howard. ''When I pulled him, he said that he left too many pitches upstairs. That was his problem.'' Ryan struck out Hubie Brooks and Keith Hernandez in the first inning. He struck out three over the next three innings, four more in the sixth and seventh and three more around George Foster's double in the eighth. Hernandez, Darryl Strawberry, Ron Hodges and Brian Giles each struck out twice. The Mets lead the league with a total of 538 strikeouts. When it was suggested to Ryan that this had not been one of his sharper performances, he replied: ''Go ask the Mets. They may not agree with that. I struck out 12.'' Ryan admitted that his overall assortment of pitches was not up to his standard. ''I think I only threw two change-ups for strikes,'' he said. ''I didn't have command of all my pitches. And I was behind on the count a lot, walking five guys. I haven't allowed that many walks since my first win this season.'' Ryan pitched his first complete game without a walk June 12 against the Padres. A walk helped the Mets during their two-run third inning. After Brooks reached base on an infield single, Hernandez walked. George Foster doubled to left, scoring Brooks. Strawberry hit an infield grounder that brought in Hernandez to make the score 5-2. But that was it off of Ryan, who tired after eight innings and was relieved by Bill Dawley. The Astros, who were stifled through five innings on Tom Gorman's one-hit relief stint, boosted the lead to 6-2 off Walt Terrell in the eighth. Brian Giles's first home run of the season in the ninth, off Dawley, made it 6-3.

117-> MARINES MAY GET SAFER BEIRUT POST
Allied agencies reportedly have leads suggesting Iranian involvement in the bombings. Page A8. WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 - A senior Reagan Administration official indicated today that at least some marines in Lebanon would be redeployed from Beirut airport to safer places. The official, who is central to the policy-making process, said that the marines were in Lebanon to give confidence to the Government of President Amin Gemayel, but that this could be done from an ''expanded secure zone'' with more room for maneuver. He reiterated that the number of marines would not be increased nor their mission expanded. Concern over the American troops' exposed position at Beirut airport has redoubled since a truck bomb killed at least 219 marines on Sunday. 176 Marines Still Unidentified A Marine spokesmen said 176 servicemen remained unidentified, partly because many of them had been been asleep and had removed their dog tags. The Pentagon, while continuing to release the names of identified casualties, prepared today to make public the names of known survivors. (Page A9.) The senior official, speaking in a background briefing, said that President Reagan was urging Mr. Gemayel to form a government more representative of the diverse factions in Lebanon and more conscious of Syrian and Israeli interests. He said the success of the Gemayel Government hinged on its ability to be more credible in Syrian eyes and to satisfy Syrian interests. According to a number of officials, this will be the American strategy at Lebanese unity talks due to get under way in Geneva next Monday. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said earlier this week that the United States was seeking a broader role in the present Christian-dominated Lebanese Government for the Shiite Moslems and the Druse, as a way of dealing with Syrian concerns. The senior official said the main mission for the marines - as well as for French, Italian and British troops - was ''being there'' to establish stability and to provide time for the Lebanese Government to build its institutions. He insisted that progress was being made to these ends. He said the international force in Beirut would continue to play this role. He described it as practical and sensible to undertake a more mobile and flexible disposition of the marines. This could be done in a variety of ways, he said. He mentioned additional fortifications and redeployment to more secure areas along the coast. He specifically spoke of the possibility of putting marines in villages where they could help with construction and sanitation. In response to questions, the official did not say whether the multinational force was sufficient in size and mission to meet the goal of bringing about a stable Lebanon. Instead, he argued that withdrawal would make attainment of the goal impossible and that no Lebanese Government could be expected to have the necessary perseverance without it. His emphasis appeared to be on these forces' role as an adjunct to a diplomatic effort to accommodate Syrian interests. When asked what incentives could be offered to Syria to support a stable Lebanese Government, he said that Syria was interested in an Israeli withdrawal so that it would not have to face the Israelis on two fronts, in Lebanon and in the Golan Heights. He also said Syria had an important stake in a restored and strong Lebanese economy. He said that President Reagan believed that Syria had legitimate worries about its borders, and that the President would urge Mr. Gemayel to take these security interests into account. With regard to the existing Lebanese-Israeli agreement, opposed by Syria because it provides for Israeli withdrawal in return for Syrian withdrawal, the official said Syria could deal with its concerns ''in dialogue'' with the Lebanese Government.

121-> MONEY SUPPLY OFF $3 BILLION
The Federal Reserve System yesterday announced a $3 billion decline in the money supply for the week ended June 29, a development that eased concern for the moment that the Fed might tighten monetary policy against the wishes of the Reagan Administration. Rates on short-term Treasury securities fell as much as one-tenth of a percentage point in late trading after the announcement of the rise in the money supply. Earlier, rates rose and prices of longerterm issues declined because of nervousness that the Fed planned to restrict the flow of funds into the banking system, a move that could push up interest rates. Although the decline in the money supply for the latest reporting week was larger than the markets had expected, fears remained that rapid The President's chief economist, Martin S. Feldstein, said money supply growth had to be brought down to control inflation. Page 36. monetary growth since the beginning of the year would still lead the Fed to tighten credit and drive interest rates higher. ''The jury is still out on how the money supply is going to behave,'' said Wayne D. Lyski, vice president of the Alliance Capital Management Corporation. The decline reported yesterday was in M-1, the measure of money considered readily available for spending. It consists of currency in circulation and check-like deposits in banks and savings institutions. The drop in M-1 made it easier for the central bank to avoid tightening credit to limit money supply growth. The theory is that the economy will expand most efficiently, and without inflation, only if the money supply grows at a slow and steady pace over a long period of time. Although the Administration has vigorously supported such an approach, it exerted pressure on the Federal Reserve this week not to tighten monetary policy and risk slowing the economy's lively recovery. On Thursday, Larry Speakes, deputy White House press secretary, told reporters, ''Our view is that we would not like to see interest rates increased.'' Despite the latest decline in M-1, to a daily average of $508.3 billion, the level is far above the top of the Fed's target for June, which was $495.7 billion. According to Charles Lieberman, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, if the Fed were to meet its subsequent monthly targets for M-1, the money supply should not increase at all until November. Possible Effects on Economy The Administration fears that if the Fed were to seek to achieve that goal, it could severely jeopardize the economic recovery by restricting the amount of credit available, driving interest rates higher. Higher interest rates dampen investment and consumer buying. Thus, yesterday's announcement of the $3 billion decline was widely welcomed. In the bond market, prices rose and yields declined. According to Mr. Lieberman, the price of the Government's bellwether long-term bond, the 10 3/8 percent of 2012, rose more than threequarters of a point, to 91 13/32, from its low point earlier in the day. The earlier decline reflected the nervousness of the markets, when bond prices dropped at least partly as a result of rumors that the Fed would report a rise in the money supply. Most market participants expected M-1 to decline by between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. Following the money-supply announcement, short-term interest rates fell modestly, by about 5 to 10 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point). Three-month Treasury bill rates closed at 9.05 percent, down 11 basis points on the day, and six-month bills closed at 9.26 percent, down 6 basis points. ''These money supply numbers were long awaited,'' said Maria F. Ramirez, senior money market economist at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''This week's figures will at least hold the market at this level and keep bond prices from falling.'' ,Cengiz Israfil, vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, was more optimistic than most analysts. ''M-1 is beginning to behave in a more predictable manner,'' he said. ''The latest week's level was $1.1 billion below the May 18 level. The outlook for next week is for a money-supply number that doesn't look too bad.'' Mr. Israfil predicts that next week's increase will be held to about $4 billion. But all analysts expect a hefty rise in M-1 next week because the data will reflect conditions at the beginning of a month, a period when the money supply always rises sharply because Social Security payments enter the system then.

122-> U.S.F.L. VIDEO GAME
FROM the beginning, the United States Football League has projected the idea of a video game more than a pro football game. Something to watch on Sunday afternoon in the spring, no matter what the caliber of competition. And for the last week the sales pitch has been obvious. Slip your Herschel Walker cassette into your video recorder and watch him run. But yesterday, Herschel Walker didn't run that much, not even when the New Jersey Generals needed him to carry the ball in the final minutes of their 20-15 loss to the Los Angeles Express. If you divide three 18-game seasons into Herschel Walker's reported $5 million contract, he earns $92,592.59 a game. But yesterday, the 21-year-old running back didn't earn his money, didn't get a chance to earn it, really. On his 16 carries, he rushed for 65 yards, including a 5-yard sweep for the Generals' first touchdown. But when the Generals needed him the most on their last series, he carried the ball only two of the five running plays - for a 6-yard gain to the Express 25-yard line and a 1-yard loss that dropped the Generals back to the 13-yard line. After that 1-yard loss, Herschel Walker wasn't even a decoy. He wasn't even in the game. Asked about why Herschel Walker wasn't used more on that last series, Chuck Fairbanks, the Generals' coach who sends in every offensive play, stared straight ahead. ''Well, I don't know,'' the coach said. ''I really don't have an answer for that.'' Perhaps he'll have an answer by next Sunday's game in Philadelphia, but yesterday Chuck Fairbanks did not use his Herschel Walker cassette. In the second half, the rookie from Georgia had carried the ball only three times for 16 yards until the final series. Chuck Fairbanks explained that the Generals were in a ''catch-up position,'' trailing by 20-9 until the final minutes, and then by 20-15 until the Express gambled and lost by failing to get a first down in a fourth-and-1 situation at their own 31-yard line. ''We were being pressured with blitzes,'' Chuck Fairbanks said, ''and he hasn't had enough preparation to handle that.'' And so the U.S.F.L. opened its season with Herschel Walker in partial eclipse. He has to be wondering if he deserted a better team at Georgia, or at least an offense that was geared to let him run rather than let Bobby Scott, a backup quarterback with the New Orleans Saints for 10 years, try to pass while also trying to stay alive. Yes, the Generals-Express opener was competitive, but that's relative. To compare the U.S.F.L. to the American Football League's start in 1960 is simply a lesson in the arithmetic of dilution. Until the A.F.L. was formed, the National Football League consisted of only 12 teams with 33-man rosters - a total of about 400 players. With the merger of the A.F.L. and the N.F.L. as well as expansion, there were about 1,400 pro football players, until the U.S.F.L. hired nearly 500 more. In time, many other U.S.F.L. players in addition to Herschel Walker will prove they can play in anybody's league. But when the A.F.L. began, there was room for more teams and more players. But not now. But for all of the curiosity surrounding yesterday's opener that attracted 34,002 customers to the Coliseum here, the big question for the U.S.F.L. remains: Will it endure beyond next season, after its estimated $30 million TV contracts with the ABC and ESPN networks expire? The belief here is no. In trying to survive, the U.S.F.L. has altered the seasonal progression of American sports. Just as there is a change of seasons in nature, so there is a change of season in sports. In the spring, most sports spectators and TV viewers turn to thoughts of baseball, not football. Yesterday's opening of the U.S.F.L. season occurred only five weeks after Super Bowl XVII, meaning pro football now exists for 11 months. It's as if another baseball league was formed with a season that opened in December. Before and after the baseball season starts next month, the U.S.F.L. also must compete for the TV viewer against another part of the natural order of American sports - the N.C.A.A. basketall tournament, the National Basketball Association playoffs and, in some areas, the Stanley Cup hockey playoffs. In the end, its TV ratings won't determine the U.S.F.L.'s future. Its stadium attendance will. In its cities without major-league baseball, the U.S.F.L. might attract respectable stadium crowds - Washington (even though the Baltimore Orioles are only an hour's drive away), Birmingham, Tampa Bay, Denver and Phoenix. But in its cities with major-league baseball, the U.S.F.L. will be battling the tradition of going to see the Yankees or the Mets, the Phillies, the Red Sox, the Tigers, the Cubs or the White Sox, the Dodgers or the Angels, the A's or the Giants. ''For the league to make it,'' an ABC television network official says, ''you've got to have the excitement of people in the stands.'' That's why the National Football League has been such a success on television. Over all, its 28 teams normally draw nearly 95 percent of their stadium capacity despite cold weather in many of its cities late in the usual 16-game season. If the U.S.F.L. is to be a success, it can't be a TV studio game. And with its no-blackout rule, it will be trying to sell tickets at the box office while giving the game away free on TV, no matter how good or how bad the attraction. Regarding weather, when the U.S.F.L.'s 18-game season crawls into June and its playoffs into July, hot weather might be even more punishing to its players than the freezing weather of the N.F.L.'s late season and playoffs. Just as the N.F.L. forms its schedule to take advantage of warm-weather sites, the U.S.F.L. should seek coolweather sites. Because of the N.F.L.'s popularity, the ABC and ESPN networks combined to invent the U.S.F.L. more as television programming rather than pro football. But if it is to succeed, the U.S.F.L. must reverse the seasonal order of American sports that projects baseball and basketball playoffs at this time of year. Perhaps the U.S.F.L. would be better off playing its games in the Southern Hemisphere, where at least our spring is their fall.

124-> OPERA: 'NABUCCO' IN THE PARK
The New York Grand Opera began its 10th anniversary season of free summer performances Wednesday night with a concert presentation of Verdi's ''Nabucco'' at the Central Park Bandshell. ''Nabucco,'' composed in 1842, is Verdi's third opera and the work that made his reputation. As might be expected, one can detect the influence of Donizetti and Rossini - particularly in the extended ensembles - but ''Nabucco'' already has the sinuous intensity that is Verdi's alone. The libretto, by Temistocle Solera, deals with religious oppression and eventual liberation, telling the biblical tale of Nebuchadnezzer (Nabucco) and the Assyrian attack on Jerusalem. The strongest attribute of the New York Grand Opera's performance was the idiomatic and dramatically convincing conducting of Vincent La Selva, who built ''Nabucco'' from strength to strength. Although the sound system was inadequate - indeed, it often made the orchestra sound like an amplified theater organ - there was a compelling structural integrity to Mr. La Selva's conception. The soloists were a mixed bag. Theodore Lambrinos's portrayal of Nabucco proved that there is a place for refinement and elegance in the world of early Verdi. Ralph Bassett made a commanding but occasionally throaty Zaccaria. As Ismaele, Alberto Mizrakhi made good use of a light tenor voice. Marisa Galvany's portrayal of Abagaille, a fiendishly difficult part, was histrionically apt, if not inevitably vocally impeccable. Joan Campbell made a charming, freshvoiced Fenena, although she sang too closely into the microphone and had a tendency to blast. Other cast members included Marie Bogart, Stephen Dupont and Donald Westwood. The New York Grand Opera was supported by a good chorus, prepared by Constantine Kisopolous. Tim Page

125-> THE REGION; 6 Accused of Role In Gambling Ring
Government agents raided two hotel rooms at Caesars Boardwalk Regency Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City Thursday night and arrested six Pennsylvania residents who are accused of conducting a multimillion-dollar bookmaking operation, State Attorney General Irwin I. Kimmelman said today. Agents of the state police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the raid. Col. Clinton L. Pagano, the Superintendent of the state police, said the ring handled bets - including horse, numbers and sports wagers - from other gambling operations in California, Nevada, Florida and New York. Charged with promoting gambling were Augustine Ferrone, Robert S. Weitz and Donna Stagno, all of Pittsburgh, and Primo Y. Mollica, Sidney Mendlowitz and Andrew Kurto, all of Glassport.

126-> RACIAL-BALANCE PROBLEM SEEN IN SOEM CONNECTICUT SCHOOLS
Some Connecticut cities such as Hartford and New Haven face a ''near impossible'' task of complying with a law that requires them to balance their schools racially, a state education official told the State Board of Education this week. ''They've tried all kinds of efforts and have made gains,'' said the official, Robert J. Margolin, associate commissioner for elementary and secondary education for the State Department of Education. ''But every time they make a gain in a particular school, their overall minority population increases.'' In a report to the State Board of Education, the Hartford, New Haven and Stratford school systems are cited as failing to fulfill plans from 1980 to counter racial imbalance. 2 Towns Under U.S. Supervision Meriden, New Britain, Norwalk and Stamford - the only other towns ordered to put plans into effect - have complied. The report made no mention of Waterbury or Bridgeport, which are under Federal court supervision while they racially balance their schools. The law requires each school to reflect, within 25 percentage points, the percentage of minority students in the entire system. In Hartford, where 86 percent of the students are members of minority groups, a school must have a minority enrollment of at least 61 percent to be considered balanced. ''Simple math says you can't integrate,'' Mr. Margolin said last week. Hartford has five racially unbalanced schools, and New Haven has nine, the report says. Each city has two more years to comply with their plans. Stratford must comply by the end of this school year.

127-> PEDDIE GIFT NOT A BOON TO ALL
HIGHTSTOWN ALTHOUGH a $12 million gift to the Peddie School here last week was a major coup for the private preparatory school, a number of New Jersey educators are skeptical about whether it will have any spillover effect on public schools. It is with the public schools, they say, that the real problems of contemporary education - as cited by the National Commission on Excellence in Education - lie. One observer said that the absence of Dr. Saul Cooperman, Commissioner of the state's Department of Education, at the Peddie ceremony because of a ''scheduling conflict'' was symbolic of the irrelevance of the gift to public education. And Bonnie Gardner, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools, said that, although the gift from Walter Annenberg was ''very exciting news, the public schools are more in need of help than the independent ones, and I'm not sure it's going to help them very much.'' Mr. Annenberg, former Ambassador to Britain and founder of TV Guide, was graduated from Peddie in 1927 and voted by his classmates as the ''Most Likely to Succeed.'' His gift is said to be the largest ever made to an American secondary school. The money, part of a $20 million capital campaign, will be used principally to build a Fine Arts Center, expand the school's computer facilities, raise teacher salaries, which currently range from $9,200 to around $25,000 (plus room and board) and increase financial aid from $4,000 to $500,000 a year for Peddie's 210 students. Both public and private educators in New Jersey were astonished by the size of the donation. The largest gift previously reported to a secondary school in the United States was one of $6.5 million to Andover in 1980. Mr. Annenberg's pledge is also 40 percent greater than all corporate, foundation and individual contributions received last year by Rutgers, the State University. Terrell Bell, the United States Secretary of Education, attended last week's ceremony. He said he hoped that the gift would be a catalyst for future donations to public and private secondary schools. ''As the report from the National Commission on Excellence in Education recently affirmed, improving the quality of our schools is not only the responsibility of government,'' he said. ''It requires the cooperation and collaboration of every sector of society. ''Mr. Annenberg's pledge exemplies the significant role that individuals can play, and is a very encouraging response to a need that is national in scope.'' Governor Kean, who also was at the ceremony, said that ''positive competition'' between public and private schools kept all schools ''alert and vital.'' However, Dr. Edgar C. Thomas, Superintendent of the East Windsor School District, which encompases Hightstown, said he expected the $12 million to have ''no major impact'' on the schools he supervised, although ''it may attract more students from the area (to Peddie) if financial aid is increased.'' Peddie, which has a cordial relationship with East Windsor schools, currently draws 65 students away from the local high school. The largest monetary gift to the East Windsor district so far this year has been a $350 contribution from the Elks Club. ''That sort of thing,'' Dr. Thomas said, referring to the $12 million, ''doesn't really happen in public schools.'' Bernard Steinfelt, Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Finance in the state's Department of Education, agreed. Although a gift of any size or type may be given to a school district with the local school board's approval, he said, in his 21 years of auditing New Jersey public schools he has found that individual contributions usually have been limited to occasional parcels of land or small sums for books. According to Anne Decker, vice president of the Council for Financial Aid to Education, a nonprofit organization that tracks voluntary giving to private colleges and independent schools, public schools rarely get individual gifts because they lack a loyal alumni body and have no organized fund-raising. By contrast, independent schools have been stepping up their fund-raising with considerable success, Mrs. Decker said. Reported private donations to independent schools, which come principally from alumni and parents, have been growing steadily and now average more than $600,000 a year nationally, she said. Although there may be few personal contributions to public education, Mrs. Decker said, corporate backing has never been stronger. She said she was fielding a growing number of inquiries from corporations that would like to contribute to local systems. Money is usually not directly involved, but companies are increasingly lending personnel or donating equipment. For example, the Techne Corporation of Princeton gave computer equipment valued at $5,000 to Hightstown High School this year.

129-> PAST RE-CREATED IN DOG PORTRAITS
It was one of those things that seemed to work out exactly right. Nancy Stoddart Huang, an interior designer, was interested in forming a group of artists and artisans called ''The Nineteenth Century'' to make furnishings that would reflect the period style. Mrs. Huang is also a collector of 19th-century paintings of dogs, many of which were done by itinerants in exchange for room and board. ''I thought that maybe other people who also collect dog paintings might like to have a portrait done in a 19th-century style of their own dog,'' she said. ''That way it would fit right in with their other pictures.'' Jane Millett (below), an artist who works in a realistic style, was commissioned by Mrs. Huang to paint a portrait of her Jack Russell terrier, Petunia, lying, below left, in front of a Millet picture of a child. Mrs. Huang and Miss Millett did research to get the right period atmosphere for the backdrops. The perky portrait of Petunia, below center, shows her against a background of William Morris-style fabric typical of the late 19th century; the bulldog was born of the artist's imagination. Miss Millett commented: ''I love dogs, but not quite the way Nancy does.'' She has since embarked on a number of commissions, visiting people and their pets in their homes. She either borrows favorite photographs or takes her own as the basis for her work. Small paintings, measuring 14 by 10 inches, start at $500. Mrs. Huang and Miss Millett can be reached at 212-758-1324.

131-> POULTRY FARMS IN PENNSYLVANIA QUARANTINED
The Agriculture Department announced Friday it had placed parts of Berks, Dauphin, Lancaster and Lebanon counties in Pennsylvania under quarantine to stop the spread of an avian influenza outbreak in the state's chicken flocks. Bert Hawkins, administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the virus disease posed a serious threat to Pennsylvania's $400 million poultry industry. It does not affect humans. The State of Pennsylvania earlier in the week quarantined infected and suspected flocks, Mr. Hawkins said. The quarantine encompasses more than 1,500 square miles with at least a five-mile buffer zone from all premises where infection has been found, said King Lovinger, director of information for the inspection service. New York State, meanwhile, imposed a ban on poultry products from the four counties and two others, Chester and York counties, which were also affected by the disease. The New York embargo covers live birds, processed chickens and chicken parts, eggs, cages and other equipment from those counties. New York constitutes an important part of the market for Pennsylvania egg farmers and poultry growers, said John Nikoloff, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. Earlier Friday, the United States Agriculture Department said it had set up a task force in Harrisburg, Pa., to help stop the spread of the disease. Pennsylvania Products Boycotted When the flu was diagnosed in Lancaster County last April, the disease ''was not causing significant poultry losses,'' Mr. Hawkins said. But the situation changed dramatically by late last month, when losses of up to 30 percent were reported in newly infected flocks, he said. More than 40 percent of the state's poultry industry is concentrated in Lancaster County, where the outbreak is most severe. Poultry companies in other states have begun an unofficial boycott of products from Pennsylvania, said Andy Hanson, chairman of a task force of local poultry industry executives. ''We're getting eggs turned down, chicks turned down, broilers turned down,'' Mr. Hanson said. The cost of cleaning up the outbreak could reach $21 million, according to one estimate from the Department of Agriculture. ''It's a big problem for farmers, and it has the potential to devastate the poultry industry,'' said Mr. Nikoloff. The disease is not harmful to humans but it can be transmitted to birds by them, he said. Usually it lasts a few weeks and the birds display flu-like symptoms, such as breathing trouble and swollen glands. This time it developed a strain that killed up to 40 percent of some flocks and reduced egg production to zero, Mr. Nikoloff said. While only four farms now appear to have the deadly strain, the milder virus is spreading rapidly. Slaughter May Be Necessary ''The best approach to eradication of the disease appears to be depopulation,'' Dr. Max VanBuskirk, director of the state Bureau of Animal Industry, said Wednesday. However, he added that ''it appears that neither the state government nor the Federal Government has the funds available'' to reimburse farmers for their lost flocks. The quarantined farms have more than 2.5 million birds, he said. Dave Goodman of the Federal Deparment of Agriculture said officials would try to learn more about the contagious disease befor deciding next week whether to conduct a large-scale slaughter of the chickens, If the chickens were slaughtered, they would have to be incinerated or buried in a landfill, Mr. Nikoloff said. In addition, farmers could expect to lose feed and flats that held the chickens if they were suspected of contamination. Besides the quarantine, the state has halted sales of live poultry at livestock auctions, banned poultry shows in Pennsylvania and sent pamphlets to farmers telling them what they could do to protect their flocks.

132-> THE CITY; Daily News Plant Given Abatement
The Daily News received a $10.2 million tax abatement yesterday to expand its printing plant in Brooklyn. The City Industrial and Commercial Incentive Board granted the 20-year reduction after being told the expansion of the plant at 684 Pacific Street in the Atlantic Terminal neighborhood was part of a restoration program. The News embarked on a retrenchment program, including staff cutbacks, after it said it lost $12.6 million in 1981. The plans call for a shift of 70 percent of the newspaper's printing operations from its headquarters on East 42d Street in midtown by next October, according to the director of operations of The News, Larry Ingram.

133-> PIANO: DANIEL BLUMENTHAL
Daniel Blumenthal is completing work for a doctorate at the Juilliard School, but he is already an accomplished pianist, with several recordings to his credit and a series of awards. In Alice Tully Hall Wednesday night, he demonstrated his professionalism with polished performances, which at their best showed a strong technique and a feeling for incisive articulation, but which, at their weaker moments, did not succeed in creating coherent and imaginative musical statements. In Beethoven's Sonata in E flat (Op. 7) for example, the suddenness of Beethoven's gestures was not made understandable by Mr. Blumenthal, who emphasized the disjunct phrases without showing their sensible connections; the Largo, in particular, lacked shape and coloration. Similarly, Mozart's Six Variations in F on ''Salve tu, Domine'' (K. 389) were marred by precious rubatos or overly busy passage work. But this was, on the surface, very able playing, and toward the end of the program, in music more suited to his temperament, Mr. Blumenthal did quite well indeed. In Aaron Copland's ''Piano Variations,'' the pianist seemed thoroughly involved in the music's pungent harmonies, presenting an intelligent, strong-willed performance. And in Liszt's difficult ''Dante'' Sonata, though often sacrificing the subtlety of detail, Mr. Blumenthal created some exciting moments, demonstrating a clear idea of where the piece was going and what it was about.

134-> MUBARAK URGES REAGAN NOT TO AVENGE BOMBING
President Hosni Mubarak said today that the United States should not retaliate for the bombing attack that killed more than 200 marines in Beirut last Sunday. ''Any violence would lead to much more violence,'' the Egyptian leader said. ''It would put even America's closest friends in great difficulty.'' The President said in an interview that he had included this advice in a personal message that he sent today to President Reagan. The message, dealing with Lebanon, urged that the United States insist on an early timetable for complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and that it quickly revive President Reagan's proposal of Sept. 1, 1982, for talks on the future of the Palestinians. Mr. Mubarak said that he did not know who was responsible for the bombing, but that the attack had apparently been made by a ''faction that wanted more attention.'' Aide on Mission to Iraq His remarks seemed to be directed to a moment when the United States was reviewing its Middle East policy in the shock of the bombing attack and in the shadow of mounting tensions. The Reagan Administration has not used the word ''retaliate'' in speaking of its possible action. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said hours after the bombing attack that the United States intended ''to respond to this criminal act when the perpretators are identified.'' Besides sending the message to Mr. Reagan, President Mubarak sent his Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Kamal Hussein Ali, on a mission to Iraq to discuss the war with Iran, and then to Jordan to press for a renewal of negotiations with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The moves appeared to reflect a new Egyptian effort to regain a position of influence in the Arab world and to persuade the United States not to be so distracted by the crisis in Lebanon as to neglect the larger Middle East conflict. 'Israeli Invasion Is the Cause' In speaking of the Beirut bombing, Mr. Mubarak said at first: ''You shouldn't punish anyone unless you are definitely sure who did it. It would have a very bad reaction.'' But he then continued: ''The Israeli invasion is the cause. I don't advise the U.S., the biggest nation on earth and the No. 1 superpower, to act against any small country.'' He said it would hurt the United States everywhere and its friends as well. But he urged strongly that the marines remain in Lebanon until the Israelis had withdrawn and the crisis had eased. Mr. Mubarak said that an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon ''would be a big relief for the area'' and that the United States ''would gain a lot'' from such a developoment. He said he thought the problem of getting Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon could then be handled by the Arabs among themselves. But he did not suggest how. At another point, however, he said the Arabs must learn to ''live reality'' and fulfill their own decision, at Arab League meetings, to end their conflict with Israel in a peace settlement.

135-> PARENTS OF 'BABY DOE' CRITICIZE 'INTRUSTION' BY U.S.
The young Long Island parents of a severely deformed baby, who has become the focus of an intense legal battle, said yesterday that they were distraught over the prospect that the Federal Government might force the surgery they oppose for their daughter. The parents said in an interview yesterday that the Justice Department's unprecedented decision to enter a case they thought had been settled by the state's highest court was an unwarranted ''intrusion'' into their family's private life. Their decision not to approve surgery was upheld last week by the Court of Appeals. ''For someone to walk in and invite the rest of the country into our house is a terrible intrusion into our lives,'' said the girl's father, who is 30 years old. His 23-year-old wife, who occasionally seemed near tears, agreed. ''We feel the Federal Government is going against the state's highest courts and the doctors we have consulted,'' said the father, who is a building contractor. ''It's really intimidating.'' U.S. Asks for Medical Records The young parents, who will celebrate their first wedding anniversary this month, have requested anonymity since a legal battle began several days after their severely handicapped baby was born on Oct. 11. The infant has been referred to as ''Baby Jane Doe.'' They spoke with a reporter as they sat at their kitchen table in their brick- and-shingle ranch home on a country lane. They had recently added two rooms to their house in anticipation of the baby's birth. The Justice Department wants to see the infant's medical records to determine if she has been discriminated against because she is handicapped. In papers filed in Federal District Court on Friday, Edith S. Marshall, an attorney with the Civil Rights Division, said that the failure to have two operations performed on the infant must be reviewed to determine whether they fall under acceptable medical practices. The infant is suffering from spina bifida - a failure of the spinal cord to close properly - and hydrocephalus, or excess fluid on the brain. One operation would close her spine. The other would drain liquid from her brain. Parents Explain Their Decision Doctors have said that without surgery the child was likely to die within two years, and that with surgery she could survive into her 20's but would be severely retarded and bedridden. She is being fed and treated. The parents said they had decided against the operations after consultation with a battery of doctors, first at St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson, L.I., and then at the University Hospital at Stony Brook, L.I., where the baby was taken after she was born. The father said he had been present at the birth of his daughter and knew, from ''the sac on her back,'' that she had a spinal problem. His wife, who was awake during delivery, said she could not see anything. ''They told me I had a baby girl,'' she said. ''I started to cry. I wanted to hold her. That was what was supposed to happen. But they said no. And then they put me to sleep.'' The couple, who are Catholics, said they had not considered their religious beliefs in making their decision. The father said that during the first day of their daughter's life, when they were asked to make a decision on operating, long consultations with physicians disclosed that the child would be paralyzed from the waist down even if the surgery were performed. ''We were told she would have no control over her bladder or rectal functions,'' he said. ''And we were also told that she probably had brain malfunction. We were told by our doctors that the part of the brain that controls much of our awareness was either missing or not entirely formed.'' ''We are not talking about a spina bifida child,'' the mother said, ''one who could perhaps walk someday with braces. They are showing these kids on television when they discuss our case. She will be an epileptic. Her condition for future life is to be bedridden, and she would not have use of her hands.'' The couple visit their daughter in the nursery every day and hold her and feed her and love her, they say. ''Her legs are like dead fish,'' the mother said. ''She doesn't feel them.'' ''We also know,'' said the mother, ''that as she grew older, she would always be an infant. She would never know love. And while she might feel sorrow and joy, her overall condition would be pain.'' Litigation Stunned Parents Both parents have consented to a conservative course of medical treatment for their daughter, one that includes the use of antibiotics and food. They say they were stunned when a lawyer and right-to-life advocate named Lawrence Washburn went to State Supreme Court in Suffolk County to try to force the surgery upon the parents. ''Washburn is entitled to his views,'' the father said, ''but to push those views upon ourselves was unacceptable. We had the best professional help sitting in with us.'' With the intervention of the Federal Government, the couple said, ''We don't know when it will end.'' They say it is difficult to be in their home without their child. ''The crib and cradle were set up in our bedroom,'' the mother said. ''The clothes are in the drawers. We were just so psyched up to have this baby. Then this tragedy occurred. And there is all this pressure on us. We don't know what will happen to us. We were strong in the beginning, but we are less strong now. ''We have received letters from across the country, from couples who have done what we have done,'' she continued. ''They didn't have to go through what we have gone through. There should be a limit to how far the Government can go.''

138-> Soviet Weighs Joining Olympics
A Soviet official said today that his country had yet to decide if it would take part in the next summer's Olympics here. The official, Vladimir Mikoyan, press officer at the Soviet embassy in Washington, said that the security of Soviet athletes and the crime rate in Los Angeles, not deployment of United States missiles in Europe, would figure in the decision. Monique Berlioux, the executive director of the International Olympic Committee, said Wednesday that Juan Antonio Samaranch, the committee president and the former Spanish ambassador to Moscow, had learned that Eastern bloc countries might boycott the Games if NATO were to go ahead with scheduled deployment of Cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Western Europe. Mr. Mikoyan said: ''I don't know where these embarrassing questions originated. The word boycott never has appeared in Soviet press.''

139-> REP. DINGELL CITES DATA DAMAGING TO CITICORP
Representative John D. Dingell said today that Citicorp documents recently obtained by his staff had lent ''substantial additional weight'' to accusations that the bank and its lawyers failed to adequately disclose information about the legality of some currency transactions in the 1970's. Mr. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, is chairman of a House subcommittee that will hold hearings next week on Citicorp transactions. A memorandum from Mr. Dingell, which he sent to subcommittee members and made public today, said the documents included damaging opinions by European auditors and lawyers of some bank practices. The memo also said Citibank had refused to turn over these documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission during a threeyear investigation by the commission, which ended in 1981. He said the bank had ''strenuously resisted'' turning them over to his subcommittee. Mr. Dingell released the documents today to draw attention to a hearing that his Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will hold on the Citicorp matter on Tuesday. Walter B. Wriston, chairman of the bank holding company, is to testify. Citicorp, in a statement today, said the opinions ''were voluntarily given to the committee'' as soon as possible and that 12,000 documents ''have been provided to the committee voluntarily.'' The statement said that despite the investigations into the bank's currency transactions, ''no new facts have emerged.'' It said the bank would discuss ''all these questions'' at the hearing. Joseph T. McLaughlin, a partner in Shearman & Sterling, a New York law firm that prepared a report for Citicorp in 1978 on its currency practices, defended that report, saying it ''fairly and accurately'' described the legal advice provided by European counsel. He said the firms that provided that advice had affirmed to Shearman & Sterling that their opinions were accurately reflected. In 1981, the S.E.C. overruled the recommendation of its enforcement staff and declined to bring an action against Citicorp for inadequate disclosure of its currency trading practices. The staff had found that between 1973 and 1980, at least $46 million in profits from currency transactions had been improperly shifted, often through contrived transactions, from bank branches in Europe, where taxes were high, to other branches in the Bahamas, where taxes were much lower. In a statement after the S.E.C. ruling became known, Citicorp said that throughout the investigation, it had ''maintained, and we believe proven, that its foreign exchange trading practices and procedures were basically proper.'' It also disclosed early last year that it had paid some $11 million in back taxes and penalties to three European countries, including Switzerland, as a result of questions about the transactions. A crucial issue in the S.E.C.'s deliberations was the report by Shearman & Sterling, which had relied heavily on opinions solicited from various European lawyers. Even S.E.C. officials who favored not bringing an action against Citicorp thought the law firm's report was inadequate, according to commission documents. Report Summarized Opinions The report summarized the legal opinions, but the bank never made the opinions public, according to Mr. Dingell's memo. Nor were the underlying opinions, including those released today, provided to the S.E.C. Under threat of a subpoena, according to the Dingell statement, Citicorp gave the subcommittee legal opinions from 1977 and 1978, although the bank ''has adamantly refused to turn over'' related ''drafts, memoranda and correspondence.'' Citicorp, whose principal holding is Citibank, has contended that the documents are protected on the ground of attorney-client privilege. Most of the 1977 legal opinions, according to Mr. Dingell, ''clearly indicated'' that the transactions would ''constitute violations of various European countries' currency and/or tax laws.'' One opinion, for example, from Italian lawyers, concluded that shifting of foreign exchange positions outside Italy violated Italian law. However, a 1982 report by Italy's Ministry of Treasury, not mentioned by Mr. Dingell, found no such violations. Mr. McLaughlin said a 1978 opinion by an Italian lawyer concluded that the 1977 opinion was wrong. Neither the bank nor its lawyers disclosed a 1978 report to the Swiss National Bank by the auditing firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., according to Mr. Dingell. That report found that Citicorp had violated Swiss monetary policy in transactions involving $15 billion. Citicorp's failure to disclose that report was ''particularly serious,'' Mr. Dingell said. Mr. McLaughlin said his firm had not seen that report before it finished its report.

141-> ITALY IS SAID TO TELL SHULTZ IT WILL KEEP ITS FORCE IN LEBANON
American officials said today that Italy's Foreign Minister had conveyed to Secretary of State George P. Shultz his Government's willingness to remain in the international force in Lebanon. The officials said the communication today, by Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, came as Mr. Shultz opened a campaign here to build up allied backing for the new American tactics in Lebanon The officials added that Mr. Shultz would hold a lengthy session on Thursday morning with Mr. Andreotti, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Secretary, and Claude Cheysson, the French Foreign Minister, for a thorough review of the Lebanese situation. Italy, Britain and France are the other members of the international force But the reported reaffirmation by Italy of its intention to stay in the 6,000- man force, along with positive informal signs of the same intention from the others, has been welcomed by Mr. Shultz, an aide said tonight. Air Strikes Stirred Concern Secretary Schultz left Washington on Tuesday aware of concern in some capitals over the American air strikes against Syrian positions in Lebanon. But his aide said that Mr. Shultz was ''impressed'' by the determination to remain in Lebanon that was shown by the Atlantic allies here. Mr. Shultz is telling not only the countries with troops in the multinational force but also the other North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers here for their annual winter meeting, that the United States is convinced the best approach to follow in Lebanon is the two-track formula worked out in Washington last week with Israeli and Lebanese leaders, his aides said. The first approach is to keep up pressure on President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon to take political and military steps that will increase his standing in his own country and abroad. These include, they said, widening the base of his Government to include Shiite and Druse opposition leaders and expansion of the area of the country controlled by the Lebanese Army. The second element is to maintain firmness in the face of Syrian efforts to intimidate supporters of the Lebanese Government. This includes firing back at the Syrians, as the United States did last Sunday, the aides said. Despite some criticism of the United States in some European capitals, American officials insisted that Mr. Shultz had been given backing here for this approach . 'Potential for Movement' ''I think that the situation in Lebanon is one that we certainly intend to push on very hard,'' Mr. Shultz told reporters while on his way here. ''There is the potential for movement on national reconciliation. ''We in our discussions last week, especially with President Gemayel,'' he said, ''identified quite a number of concrete things we think will be helpful, that we want to work with him on, and I believe that the attitude of the Israelis is very positive toward trying to see the Lebanon situation come together in a more constructive way.'' Mr. Shultz said that ''while to a certain extent the turmoil in the situation is distressing, there are some other things in the wind, and we want to take advantage of them and push on them as hard as we can.'' As to the role of the multinational force, Mr. Shultz said, ''It helps keep the situation stable.'' When asked what timetable was being considered for withdrawal of the forces, he said, ''Our object is to think about how to help construct the kind of situation we would like to construct.'' He said the timing for withdrawal depended on bringing about stability in the country through a strong government and the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces. Italians Weigh Role ROME, Dec. 7 - Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's Socialist Party and its coalition partners held separate meetings of their leaderships today to define their policies on the Lebanese situation. Alone among the five, the Socialists said explicitly that the Italian unit should continue to form part of the four-nation force. But it stressed that ''in no case can the Italian contingent be implicated in warlike situations or be exposed to counterattacks for acts of war committed by others.'' The Liberal Party went further than its partners by stating explicitly that the situation had changed since the multinational force was dispatched and it called on the Government to take steps to prevent the forces' involvement ''in conflicts outside their real mandate.'' Italian political sources and diplomats consider the Liberals the group within the Government closest to demanding withdrawal of the Italian units.

144-> GARDENING; THE VICTORIANS AND THEIR LAWNS
''ASUBSTITUTE for mowing with the scythe has lately been introduced in the form of a mowing-machine,'' announced an 1841 English publication, ''Ladies' Companion to the Flower Garden.'' Possibly the ladies wondered at the ''excellent exercise to the body'' the invention was said to provide. But there is no doubt, said Gerald Allan Doell, that the machine was essential for the development of the ''single most important aspect of Victorian landscape - the lawn.'' Mr. Doell is the director of the 1890 House, a museum in Cortland, N.Y., that specializes in Victorian arts. For the last three years, he and his wife, Christine, who are both landscape architects, have ferreted out of private collections and libraries photographs of New York state gardens taken between 1860 and 1917. Some 70 pictures from their collection now constitute an exhibit entitled ''Gardens of the Gilded Age,'' at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. The display provides a fascinating study indeed. According to the Doells, as towns sprang up, the more affluent residents no longer needed herbs and vegetables from gardens. And, thanks to the mowing machine, a smooth lawn replaced the rough meadow cut by scythe or by sheep. It was this lawn that became the canvas upon which the Victorian gardener worked in two basic styles. One style was a naturalistic or romantic approach. It was inspired by the English, with antecedents in the Orient, and seemed well suited to the American landscape and to large estates. The style sought to use the existing terrain, with gently curving paths, irregular groupings of trees and shrubs, and rustic pavilions. The sweeping lawn helped civilize the wild vista beyond and provided a carpet for new outdoor activities such as croquet, lawn tennis and social gatherings. The other, more formal style, which proved useful for small or urban sites, was inspired by French or Italian gardeners. The open lawn, however tiny, was used for the display of individual plants along with garden ornaments - statues, vases or fountains - many of which were mass-produced copies of those found around European villas. Now, too, plant hunters were returning from foreign lands with their exotic trophies. The developing nursery industry offered these discoveries to a newly rich class seeking to present an impressive public image. It was not long before the appearance of the Victorian gardener's special pride - elaborate patterns of brilliant flowers dotting a closely- mown lawn. Such bedding plants, as these flowers were called, were arranged in an assortment of forms - crescents, stars, circles or ovals. Also popular were ''ribbon planting,'' rows of flowers resembling colorful ribbons, and ''carpet beddings,'' resembling Oriental rug patterns. An intricate array of geraniums, wax begonias, salvia, stock, coleus or dusty miller might be placed in designs that were evenly low at the edges and taller toward the middle. In the center might be the prize of the household - possibly a banana plant, palm, castor bean or cannas. Perennials such as hollyhocks, larkspur, hardy pinks or peonies outlined a walk, shrub border or wall, while vines were favored for use as bits of natural drapery. A porch, veranda, or garden pavilion seemed incomplete without a hanging of Dutchman's-pipe, trumpet vine, wisteria, honeysuckle or clematis. The Victorian gardener, the Doells say, was continually lectured by garden books and magazine articles on the importance of good taste. Yet there was a great diversity, Mr. Doell said, ''because it seemed people just did what they wanted anyway.'' Gardeners interested in the period might enjoy a book entitled ''Victorian Gardens'' written by Frank J. Scott. It was published in 1870 and recently reprinted by the Library of Victorian Culture of the American Life Foundation in Watkins Glen, N.Y. The paperback costs $12.95 and is available prepaid by check or credit card from Victorian Homes Magazine, Post Office Box 61, Millers Falls, Mass. 01349. The exhibition, ''Gardens of the Gilded Age,'' which is touring under the auspices of the Gallery Association of New York State, will remain at the Hudson River Museum until Jan. 1. Hours are Wednesday through Friday 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., Thursday until 9 P.M., Saturday and Sunday, noon to 5:30 P.M. The museum is at Trevor Park-on-Hudson, 511 Warburton Avenue, Yonkers, and there is no admission charge. The telephone number is 914-963-4550.

146-> FORMIDABLE FARM BLOC SHOWS SOME FRAILTY
The ability of this country's farmers to get nearly everything they want from the Government appears to be eroding rapidly, but it is equally evident that farmers are as effective as ever in killing what they do not want. Farmers' political influence is shrinking not only because there are fewer farmers than there used to be but also because of rising concern about budget deficits and because divisions have developed among the various agricultural interests and between those interests and the Reagan Administration. Nonetheless, the farmers remain one of the strongest lobbies in Washington. Major Reagan Objectives The Administration sought only two pieces of major farm legislation this year. One would have imposed a freeze on subsidy rates for grain and cotton farmers at 1983 levels. Under the Farm Act of 1981, the subsidies are scheduled to rise again next year, even though the Administration insists they are already so high they are encouraging overproduction. The other proposal would have reduced milk price supports and thwarted the plan of big milk producers to pay dairy farmers not to milk so many cows. Both Measures Failed The Administration was unable to get the freeze bill, opposed by grain farmers and their allies in Congress, before the Senate or the House for a vote. The milk amendment was beaten in the House by supporters of the big dairy organizations, and President Reagan reluctantly signed a measure that, for the first time, will pay dairy farmers not to produce milk. The dairy organizations have contributed more than $1.8 million in the last four years to the campaigns of members of the House. Many members of Congress who have few or no dairy farmers in their districts received campaign donations. Opposing consumer groups are seldom such generous givers. On the other hand, farmer pressure for legislation that nearly all farmers favor, including emergency credit, a moratorium on foreclosures, more emergency drought aid, and more stimulation of farm exports, has been unimpressive. Most of those measures remain stalled, faced with stubborn opposition from the Administration on one flank and from urban representatives on the other. Fate of Omnibus Farm Bills The pattern is illustrated by what happened in 1977 and 1981 to the omnibus farm bill, the legislation that defines agricultural policy every four years. In 1977 a coalition of members of Congress from farm and urban areas was formed. The farm states' members wanted quick passage of their favorite commodity programs and the city members wanted an expanded food stamp program. The coalition helped speed the Omnibus Farm Act of 1977 through Congress with a minimum of fuss, establishing basic farm and food policies for four years. Four years later, with Congress for the first time operating under new budget limitations and with President Reagan threatening to veto any bill exceeding these limits, the farm bloc itself was split along commodity lines and the forces opposed to food stamps had succeeded in separating food stamps from the omnibus bill. Thus the 1977 coalition collapsed and it took five months of dispute and compromise to pass an Omnibus Farm Act of 1981 that no faction really liked. Whole Thing Almost Lost In this process, urban representatives opposed to the bill's sections on sugar, tobacco and peanuts took advantage of the farm bloc split and came within one vote of defeating the whole measure. Students of the use of political influence attribute this slackening of rural power in Washington to several factors besides the decline in the farm population. First, there was the advent of President Reagan, Agriculture Secretary John R. Block and Budget Director David A. Stockman. Mr. Block and Mr. Stockman especially, with much more enthusiasm than many farmers expected or really wanted, have tried to fulfill Mr. Reagan's promise to get the Government off the farmers' backs. The President surprised the dairy lobby, which supported him strongly in 1980, by barring scheduled increases in milk price supports and advocating authority for Mr. Block to continue reducing those supports until a lower supply brought free market prices above support levels. Block Fought 2 Subsidies With the support of Mr. Stockman, Mr. Block has also attempted, so far without success, to eliminate subsidies on grain and cotton. He refused to use some of the special farm aid funds Congress appropriated two years ago until a Federal court ordered him to spend the money. In addition, he has resisted demands from farm organizations for large-scale export subsidies. Howard Ward, president of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers, says many farmers who voted for Mr. Reagan in 1980 believed he understood the Government could not abandon agriculture entirely. ''We didn't think he would fail to realize that a totally free market in agriculture just isn't the real world,'' Mr. Ward said recently. ''Certainly there were a lot of petty regulations and restraints we wanted removed, and the Administration has tried to do that. But it can't expect to break agriculture completely away from the Government.'' Second, the Reagan Administration has been cutting away at the Agriculture Department's long-established food assistance plans, such as food stamps and school lunch programs. These efforts have made it more difficult to make trade-offs to pass major farm bills and have thwarted recent attempts by farm state representatives to reassemble the 1977 coalition. Size of Pie Is Determined Third, the new Congressional budget procedures, which aim at holding spending within a Congressionally prescribed limit, establish the overall size of farm aid and research. This has often led the scores of commodity interest groups to fight with one another for a larger share of money. Senator Walter D. Huddleston of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, who has been in the middle of many such quarrels, says this competition among lobbyists reflects the growing specialization of farmers, many of whom now produce only one crop or one species of livestock. ''This makes farm issues that were once simple, when farming was more diversified, now more complex,'' he said recently. Finally, with Federal deficits soaring past $200 billion annually, farm commodity support costs of $18.8 billion plus $9.1 billion for special aid programs added up to a record-shattering amount of nearly $28 billion in 1983 and this has not even included paying for Mr. Block's program of giving grain to farmers in return for not producing, which may easily cost more than $12 billion. Urban Congressmen today have little empathy with farm state Congressmen who want to increase price supports or subsidize more farm credit at the expense of food and nutrition aid to their constituents. Dole Has Warned Farmers Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee and has been in many farm bill fights, has been warning farmers and Congressmen that they often ask too much. ''Farmers still have a surprising degree of muscle, considering their numbers,'' he said in a recent interview. ''But there are limitations. You just can't go on running up the tab. We're getting into that no-man's land where farm costs are so high that the city types are blowing the whistle on us.'' A longtime member of a House committee staff, who has also witnessed the growing difficulty in passing some farm bills, believes there has been a marked change in attitude toward farmers. ''There are elements in the House, for instance, that once never paid any attention to agricultural matters,'' he said. ''Now urban and suburban members are a lot more sophisticated about farm bills. They just don't blindly accept an Agriculture Committee recommendation anymore. The farm bloc still has some influence, and can often trade for votes with the city boys. But not like they used to.'' Yet there are no politicians in Washington and few in the areas where elections are fought who discount the political effect of the shrinking population of farmers, especially if they are angry. In addition to the farmers, it is estimated that in the larger agriculture states each farmer has at least 13 merchants depending on him for income. Helms Knows It Well Few members of Congress are more aware of all this than Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from the tobacco state of North Carolina who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Senator Helms is also head of the Congressional Club, a conservative fund-raising group that raised more than $10 million for 1980 and 1982 elections. In 1980 the Republicans, with club money, ran very well. Mr. Reagan carried the state and the Republicans took a Senate seat and one Representative away from the Democrats. But in 1982 Senator Helms and Senator John P. East, the Republican winner in 1980, shocked North Carolina by voting to increase the tobacco excise tax. Despite another big Congressional Club investment in seven Republican candidates, all of them lost, and so did the Republican elected in 1980. This was largely because farmers blamed their Senators for their votes, politicians in the state say. White House advisers acknowledged that fear of losing the farm vote in 1984 Senate races in milk and tobacco states as well as in Texas was the reason Mr. Reagan signed the dairy bill. This bill also included a tobacco section and special aid for Texas cattlemen. The 1980 census showed there were 5.6 million people living on farms in the United States, barely a sixth the number of 30 years ago, and today these farmers make up only 2.5 percent of the nation's population. Still the Largest Industry Yet agriculture remains the nation's largest industry. In each of the last three years farmers have grossed more than $140 billion and spent more than $100 billion for insecticides, fertilizer, machinery and equipment. In Nebraska, where expensive irrigation equipment is added to the other purchases, there are 52,000 heads of farm households and 780,000 of its 1.8 million people, by rough estimate, make or sell things farmers buy. In addition to the political attention all this money attracts, the farmers are assiduous voters. They maintain personal contact with Congressmen and are generous with campaign contributions. According to Common Cause, the private political watch group, political action committees with agriculture connections donated $3.9 million to candidates for Congress in the last election. A Republican county chairman in Iowa, where more than 13 percent of the state's population lives on farms, recently said, ''There aren't so many of them anymore, but they're sure strategically placed in the Congressional districts of many states.'' Pattern of Life Changes The pattern of life in the large agricultural areas has been rapidly changing in the last decade. Many farmers now live in the new subdivisions in the small towns near their land. They, and the farmers who still live in country, frequently drive to the supermarkets to buy food, just like city consumers. Today's farmers are better educated and much more widely traveled than their parents. Today, in Presidential and statewide elections, international and national economic issues often influence their voting more than disputes over farm policy. A recent Iowa Poll by The Des Moines Register, taken before the killing of the marines in Lebanon or the invasion of Grenada, showed the President's support had slipped among Iowa farmers. But their dissatisfaction was caused more by Mr. Reagan's handling of problems in the Middle East and in Central America than by the few agricultural issues with which they comnect him, according to the poll. There has been no definitive analysis polls showing how many farmers and small-town residents voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980. But post-election surveys by the privately owned Congressional Quarterly indicate Mr. Reagan ran exceptionally well in the Farm Belt. It is generally assumed by most politicians in Washington that if he seeks re-election Mr. Reagan will do well again among the farmers. Representative James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican who has frequently differed with the Administration on dairy policy, thinks Mr. Reagan, by personally staying out of most agricultural controversies, has shown great skill in turning most farmer grumbling back onto Mr. Block and Mr. Stockman. 'President Looks Solid' ''Actually, the President's biggest strength in the rural areas comes from hitting the mainstream of American thinking,'' Mr. Jeffords said recently. ''There could be a lot of upset farmers in my state if the Administration is blamed for trying to change the new milk price support bill or for what the weather next summer does to farm prices. But right now, the President looks very solid among the farmers in my region.'' Bob S. Bergland, who was Secretary of Agriculture in the Carter Administration and is soon to become executive director of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association in Washington, agrees that today Mr. Reagan would run well among the farmers. But he also insists that comparatively few farmers these days are tied closely to political parties. ''The farm vote is very volatile,'' he said in a recent interview. ''Farmers are the biggest ticket- splitters of any group I know.'' For the 1984 elections, the Democratic National Committee believes the farm vote could be a decisive factor in senatorial races in Iowa, Illinois and North Carolina, where, the committee's analysts say, Senators Roger W. Jepson, Charles H. Percy and Helms, Republican incumbents, are vulnerable. They also hope to gather enough farm votes in Tennessee and Texas, which have large rural populations, to win the Senate seats being vacated by Howard H. Baker Jr. and John Tower. Analysts for the nonpartisan American Farm Bureau Federation have identified 47 Congressional districts in Illinois, Texas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Carolina where there are enough farmers and farm-dependent small town merchants to affect the outcome of elections next year.

148-> ISRAELI POLICEMEN KILL 2 PALESTINIAN YOUTHS AFTER ROCK-THROWING
Israeli border policemen shot and killed two Palestinian youths today after a rock- throwing incident in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The shootings were the first such violent Palestinian deaths in the West Bank since the killing of three students at the Islamic College in Hebron last July by unknown masked assailants. Four other youths were wounded in the shooting today, which occurred near the city of Tulkarm, 21 miles northeast of Tel Aviv, according to the city's Mayor. Military officials said they imposed a curfew on the Tulkarm refugee camp next to the city to calm the atmosphere. The military command said it also arrested three youths in connection with the rock-throwing and was interrogating camp residents. It did not identify the suspects. The military command said the policemen opened fire on the youths after they refused to obey orders to stop running and after the policemen fired several warning shots into the air. It said the youths continued to throw rocks at the patrolmen before they were shot. Tulkarm's Mayor, Hilmi Hanoun, identified the two slain youths as Ibrahim Bisharah and Amer Hamad Salameh. He said the four wounded Arabs, whose names he did not know, were taken to the hospital. ''We have been unnable to get in touch with the camp because the army has put up roadblocks around it,'' he said. ''We have tried to get there but have not been allowed to enter.'' Account by the Military The command said border policemen arrived in Tulkarm after youths hurled rocks ''and heavy objects'' at passing Israeli vehicles and neighborhood shops. Five masked youths fled the area when the troops arrived, the command said. The military command said: ''The border policemen chased after the five, fired several warning shots into the air and ordered them to stop. The youths continued running and throwing stones at our forces and when they refused to obey orders to stop, several shots were fired at them and as a result two of the escapees were killed.'' In a separate case, Arab youths slightly injured two tourists when they threw stones at an Israeli bus just south of Nablus on the highway to Jerusalem, the command said. It said Arab youths also burned tires and erected stone barriers in the streets of Ramallah, north of Jerusalem. Palestinians said soldiers dispersed the protesters in Ramallah with tear gas. Elias Zananiri, a Palestinian journalist for an East Jerusalem news agency, said soldiers erected roadblocks to keep residents of the northern West Bank city of Nablus from leaving the area after stone-throwing demonstrators were dispersed with tear gas. The command said it had no information about the incident. The incidents followed a week of violence in the occupied areas during protests against the Syrian-backed siege of the Palestine Liberation Organization forces of Yasir Arafat in northern Lebanon. A 16-year-old Arab youth was wounded in the leg on Monday.

150-> IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES
New York's jazz clubs will host two notable reunions this Tuesday though next Sunday, when the Jazztet comes to Fat Tuesday's and the tenor saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Eddie ''Lockjaw'' Davis share the bandstand at the Blue Note. The original Jazztet convened in the early 1960's, after Mr. Golson left Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Its current lineup, which was first heard during the 1982 Kool Jazz Festival, features three of the sextet's founding members - Art Farmer on flugelhorn, Benny Golson on tenor saxophone and Curtis Fuller on trombone, with Mickey Tucker in the piano spot once held by McCoy Tyner. As in the 1960's, the Jazztet concentrates on Mr. Golson's pieces, such as ''Whisper Not'' and ''I Remember Clifford,'' which are both tuneful and harmonically challenging, and Mr. Golson's arrangments unify three very different horn players. Johnny Griffin and Eddie ''Lockjaw'' Davis traded solos during the 1950's, on records and in numerous club dates. Yet their styles hardly rubbed off on each other. Mr. Griffin, a veteran of groups led by Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk, is an astonishingly fleet player whose solos go cartwheeling through the trickiest tunes. Mr. Davis, who played with the Count Basie band, digs down into his low register for bluesy solos that are likely to erupt into honks and shouts. When the two players reunite for their first New York duets in two decades, sparks should fly.

151-> MUSIC VIEW; WHEN FAMILIAR WORKS TAKE ON RENEWED VIGOR
Critics may be jaded, as members of the public sometimes complain. But they have their reasons: the very nature of their job puts them in constant confrontation with the egregious - which can be amusing, in a grim sort of way - or, more commonly, with the merely mediocre. Thus no one is more happy than the critic who stumbles upon a performance that breathes fresh life into even the most weary of warhorses. Of course, there is no mystical dividing line between revelatory experiences and unutterable boredom. A too-frequently programmed standard played decently and honorably can still give pleasure, even to a jaded critic. But the revelations remain special, in part for the immediate experience they offer but also for their function as standard-setters for more conventional concert encounters. So far this season, there have been four performances that I recall with a special intensity - interpretations that took works of a seemingly hopeless familiarity and made them sound pristine: There was Bernard Haitink's performance with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam of Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique'' at Carnegie Hall; Carlo Maria Giulini's account of the Dvorak Eighth Symphony with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at home in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; the clarinetist Roger Salander in Brahms's Sonata in E flat (Op. 120, No. 2), and the Jean-Pierre Ponnelle production of Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' at the Houston Grand Opera. What did these performances share, other than their excellence? To start with, scrupulous attention to the score - both its letter and its spirit. A judicious blend of fidelity and interpretive individuality. And finally that intangible X-factor, ''musicality,'' the fuzziest of all positive words in any critic's vocabulary. Mr. Haitink's interpretation went against type, ''type'' being the American tradition in recent decades of treating the ''Fantastique'' as a showpiece for a powerhouse virtuoso orchestra. The Concertgebouw is certainly one of the great ensembles of the world, but its greatness lies in its contained sobriety, its homogeneity and sensitivity of tone, its organic impact. The performance did offer one textual variant to jog a jaded ear: the cornet part (in this case, doubled) in the ''Ball'' movement, which lends that music a wonderful carousel flavor. But mostly Mr. Haitink made his points by playing it straight: by attending to the phrasing and dynamic markings in the score, and by keeping the balances in chaste proportion, thus letting us hear something of how Berlioz's audiences, still attuned to Classical sonorities, perceived this strange and radical new work. This approach hardly vitiated the excitement. By allowing the music to build to the climax Berlioz intended, without inserting false hysteria earlier on, Mr. Haitink managed to make the final movement more thrilling than I had ever heard it before. Mr. Giulini's Dvorak Eighth was far more idiosyncratic, but no less persuasive. This was an interpretation in which lyricism superseded everything else. All of Dvorak's music sings in one sense or another, but here every note and chord was linked into a seamless legato line. Yet the effect was never mannered, but wonderfully heartfelt. This is a Brahms year, and we have already heard a good deal of his chamber music along with his more expansive scores, with more to come. The two Opus 120 sonatas, for clarinet or viola, are typical of Brahms's chamber music in that they can sound curiously thicktongued, with the composer's penchant for Germanic earnestness approaching the pedantic. Mr. Salander, an American based in Vienna, invested the E flat sonata with a rare fluency and liquidity of tone and line. His performance was fully idiomatic, as his residence might seem to assure. But it had a resilience that was individual and convincing, too, and like all great performances, it made the music sound better than one had previously believed it to be. Finally, Mr. Ponnelle's Houston ''Pagliacci.'' That very wording triggers dark suspicion from those who feel that modern stage directors, Mr. Ponnelle at the forefront, have usurped creative dominance of opera in our time. But this ''Pagliacci'' was truly a team effort, and it did justice to the composer's intentions. Opening night marked the first time Mr. Ponnelle had worked with Jon Vickers, the Canadian tenor who sang Canio - and very much acted the part, as well. It included a fine supporting cast and an excellent young conductor in Hal France. Above all, it showed Mr. Ponnelle at his best as both designer and director: sensitive to the score and capable of creative innovation within legitimate limits prescribed by the libretto. This hard, tough, sunbaked, raw and impassioned opera wasn't ''Mr. Ponnelle's 'Pagliacci' '' at all, really, but Leoncavallo's, scrubbed and fresh. In our contemporary musical culture, so centered as it is on the standard repertory of the past, it might seem worthwhile to wave these four performances like some hortatory banner, urging musicians ever onward and upward toward self-improvement. But that might also seem vague and presumptuous, and in any case things aren't quite so simple. Unless you believe, sweetly and innocently, that objective standards exist and any decently trained musician can pick out the best performances as they come along - which on one level, of course, is quite true - you are forced into a more relativistic position. Relative, but realistic, too. Great performances look great in part because of the very context against which they are perceived, and that context is the daily routine which becomes such an obvious target for protest. On most quantifiable levels, the general level of performances has improved in the course of this century - which might make great performances more difficult to notice because the backdrop is now brighter. There are more highly qualified, technically adept players, ensemble is more proficient in a larger number of orchestras, individual musicians can master more complex scores than they could a century ago, and so forth. Reading any trustworthy critic from years past leads one rapidly to the conclusion that there was plenty of dross in any ''golden age'' you care to feel nostalgic about - along with a good deal of indisputable excellence. Conversely, one hears frequent complaints that all this expertise has been purchased at the price of music's spirituality: that the cool efficiency of modern performances denies the music the life it needs to communicate beyond the printed page. The four performances I heard this fall do not resolve this age-old argument between those who think that things - in any field, at any time - are better than ever, and those who are convinced that we are in a period of vertiginous decline. But they do prove that it is still possible to make great music, and that sometimes, even in unexpected circumstances, a critic's smooth routine can be disrupted and elevated.

152-> IN THE NEW YORK REGION: PLANS ON HOLD
THOSE who ultimately make the decisions about public policy - the politicians who control the pursestrings - say they agree with the educational reformers that it is time to improve the schools. But in the three-state New York metropolitan area, that newly heightened political interest in education has yet to be translated into the kinds of sweeping changes already made in other states. That may be, as some public officials in the area contend, because New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are ahead of most other states, and those other states are just catching up. Or it may be that education achieved star status so suddenly that most public officials haven't caught up with the issue they have resolved to embrace. Earlier this year, Governor Kean of New Jersey proposed broad educational changes for his state, but they need legislative action. Most of the other elected officials in the tri-state area say they are still trying to determine what to do about education's newfound popularity, and how to pay for whatever they decide to do. So they are holding hearings, appointing committees, studying reports and analyzing proposals while less reticent educators are acting a little like children at a banquet: they are feasting, asking for all they can get, in the hope that today's sympathetic political climate will not evaporate. ''I think the timing has never been better to come forth with an educational package,'' said Gerald N. Tirozzi, Connecticut's Commissioner of Education. ''We should seize the moment, if you will. Once we get on with the Presidential election, we might be right back where we are.'' In that same spirit, the New York State Board of Regents has tentatively approved a series of changes that would, the State Education Department estimates, cost $2.9 billion over five years. And New York City's Schools Chancellor, Anthony J. Alvarado, would like to implement reforms that would add nearly $1 billion to the Board of Education's annual budget of $3.5 billion. And in Connecticut, Dr. Tirozzi is holding forums to discuss various recommendations made by various committees appointed by his department, including one recommendation centered on making teacher salaries more competitive. Just where the money would come from for all the reforms and changes is unclear. New York State education officials say they assume their plan would be financed by local, state and Federal funds, but they have not been specific. They have not said whether new local or state taxes would be necessary. Neither have officials in Connecticut or New Jersey. In New York, there is talk, as there is every year, about changing the state education formula to make it more equitable for districts with larger populations and needs, but there have been no precise proposals about that, either. There have already been some local initiatives - New York City's new all-day kindergarten program, for instance. But financing for that program will be taken over by the state next year. And in general, with the President opposed to large infusions of Federal funds for education and localities contending they are strapped for funds, most local educators in the tri-state area have tended to look to the state. NEW YORK : Earlier this fall, Governor Cuomo named an Educational Advisory Committee of 15 experts. The Governor, who calls education one of his ''major priorities,'' expects to put together his own education proposal after hearing from his committee, according to Henrik Dullea, Director of State Operations. Under consideration, said Dr. Dullea, are proposals to modify requirements for teacher certification, set a minimum salary statewide for starting teachers, and to make more computers and computer software available to schools in the state. The Speaker of the State Assembly, Stanley Fink, a Democrat of Brooklyn, is conducting 10 hearings around the state, asking local educators for advice. Mr. Fink has said he will make no legislative proposals until he analyzes his findings. Albert Shanker, president of the United Federation of Teachers and a member of Mr. Cuomo's committee, has no formal proposal, either. But at one of Mr. Fink's hearings, he made a number of recommendations - among them, improving early childhood programs and making teachers' starting salaries more competitive. The Regents are holding 10 conferences statewide, focusing on their proposal, known formally as an Action Plan. It would set tougher standards and requirements in math, science, social studies, the arts and foreign language, demand more exams, homework and computer instruction in elementary school and expand the school year by 10 days in the public schools for students and another 10 days for teacher training. Expanding the school year requires legislative approval; the other changes do not. The Regents have the authority to define academic standards, curriculum requirements and testing procedures for all the state's public and private schools. But there have been some criticisms of the Action Plan from educators. Many consider it unlikely that the Legislature and the Governor would appropriate enough money to implement the plan. To set stricter requirements in the absence of a large infusion of money would put poorer school districts at a greater disadvantage than they are already, say the critics. The Regents have already heard some of that criticism at their 10 hearings. NEW JERSEY : Governor Kean's plan would establish a teacher starting salary of $18,500, merit pay or a ''master teacher'' program, a statewide graduation test to replace basic-skills tests, and a new teacher-certification program designed to allow professionals in other fields to teach without having to take education courses. Before the State Legislature is a bill that would establish a commission to analyze that recommendation, which has drawn opposition from teacher representatives and some local education boards. Another bill would establish a minimum testing program for high school students, requiring them to pass in order to get a diploma. There are many other legislative proposals, and the State Board of Education is planning to complete its own recommendations on disruptive students and possible curriculum changes, according to the board's president, David Brandt. CONNECTICUT : Besides trying to raise teacher salaries and changing the method of teacher certification, Dr. Tirozzi said he would submit a number of recommendation to the State Board of Education. They include making school compulsory at 5 instead of 7 years of age; requiring 20 rather than 18 credits for high school graduation, and making four years of English and three years of math a requirement in high schools. There is now no statewide course requirement. Dr. Tirozzi emphasized that all those initiatives would require financing, a subject that has not had as much attention, he said, as the national reports and the studies: ''The reports make all those wonderful recommendations, but nobody wants to finance them,'' he said. ''Where is the money going to come from?''

153-> RESTAURANTS; Cantonese dining in a modish setting.
SINOPHILES can be forgiven if they do not recognize the starkly modish black-and-white setting of Auntie Yuan as a place to dine on Cantonese food. If it weren't for the chopsticks on the beige tablecloths set with Wedgwood drabware, the black Fitz & Floyd plates with pink flowers and the simulated bone-handled silverware, these stunning three-month-old premises might be mistaken for a restaurant serving nouvelle cuisine. The confusion is compounded by the fact that there are many more Caucasians than Orientals on the dining room staff and that the menu begins with a slightly pretentious wine list that has prices by the glass and by the taste - a glass of Chateau d'Yquem is $26. Clearly, this is not an ordinary Chinese restaurant. And clearly, this is not an ordinary kitchen. The four chefs are Taiwanese women, and to judge from the inconsistency of the food, each interprets the dishes according to her own idiosyncrasies. The results are sometimes excellent and sometimes disappointing, though overall there was a marked improvement in the quality of the food between the first two visits in June and two visits last week. There has been an equally significant improvement over the inept service of the first visit, but that may have been because we were recognized. Now it is professional and friendly, but forgetful: water, chopsticks and the food-stained mimeographed wine list with full-bottle prices had to be requested more than once. We also had to ask repeatedly that the food be served family style rather than piled on individual plates by the waiter. Despite these lapses, there are enough well-prepared, attractively presented Cantonese dishes -as well as a smattering of dishes from other provinces - to provide an enjoyable meal. In this elegant setting, beneath the pink glow of theatrical spotlights, everyone and everything is cast in a flattering light. The restaurant offers modified versions of a Chinese banquet: a choice of three dinners, each with 6 to 10 dishes, can be ordered by individual diners, and a fourth, Peking Duck, can be ordered by two. Unfortunately, such a selection requires taking the good with the bad, which can be avoided by ordering a la carte. As soon as you are seated, two small bowls are brought to the table, one containing batons of carrots and Chinese turnips in a spicy sesame-oil dressing; the other, shredded cabbage seasoned with ginger and coriander. The cabbage tastes different each time. When it has lots of coriander, it is habit forming. Among the appetizers, cold noodles and Ma La chicken are the top choices. On the more recent of two occasions, the fresh egg noodles were deftly seasoned with garlic, peanuts and sesame oil. Though the Ma La chicken was a trifle salty, the shreds of chicken were artfully spiced with Sichuan peppercorns and ginger. Fresh minced garlic was served on the side to be used to taste, as it is with several dishes. Other appetizers were flawed. Agar salad, with its wonderful firm gelatinous texture, seasoned with sesame oil, needed more flavoring. Scallion pancakes were consistently doughy and short on scallions; spring rolls, though crisp and greaseless, were bland; fried vegetable dumplings were tender-skinned, but they had a lackluster filling. Eggplant with garlic sauce, steamed crayfish and the Buddha's shreds (soy beans, bean sprouts and two kinds of mushrooms) were undistinguished. Orange beef was tough and chewy on three occasions. Both the wonton and beef-with-shiny-noodles soups lacked character, though the wontons were tender and flavorful. Steamed eggs with Smithfield ham were watery. Side orders of vegetables provided three of the most interesting dishes on the menu: one of them, mashed eggplant, perfectly blended with ground pork, garlic and sesame oil and a touch of chili oil, is probably the restaurant's piece de resistance. Poached spinach was perfectly cooked and a gorgeous green. Two orders of sauteed julienne potatoes bore little resemblance to each other at one dinner, though the flavor of both was delicious. The first order, swimming in oil, was seasoned with ginger; the second, though greasy, appeared to have been blotted. It had no ginger flavor, but had been seasoned with vinegar. Among the best entrees on the recent visits were plump, sweet mussels with emerald-green scallions, sauteed and seasoned with green chilies, garlic and coriander; a moist, fresh salmon steamed with black beans, green and red peppers and ginger, and a tender lobster, gently perfumed with lemon and fresh mushrooms - on one occasion, Black Forest; on another, shiitakes, with a subtle woodsy fragrance. On earlier visits, however, the mussels were not fresh, the lobster was tough and the mushrooms were overcooked. Although not unusual, both home-style chicken, with boneless, tender pieces and brilliant green spinach, and tender slices of beef with scallions were well cooked and flavorful. The crispy duck skin with pancakes, while considerably improved over earlier versions when the dish tasted fried, is still enveloped in a cloyingly sweet sauce. The accompanying dish, shredded duck meat, is nondescript. Beef with Hoisin sauce and Peking-style pork in pancakes were also overpowered by the sweetness of the sauce. Braised chicken with bean curd knots tasted musty; barbecued quail was stringy. The restaurant has had the great good sense to serve some excellent sorbets for dessert, made by Pierrot in Brooklyn Heights. Green apple and raspberry are exemplary. Prices for complete dinners are $18 to $28. A la Carte It has been called to our attention that some restaurants are now requesting that tips be paid in cash. According to one maitre d'hotel, the new tax law is responsible. In the past, waiters declared only their hourly wage for income taxes if they did not work in a unionized restaurant. Under the new law, they must declare their tips based on 8 percent of the restaurant's business. According to John Nagle of Carolina, the restaurant on West 46th Street, which gives customers a printed note requesting cash gratuities, this helps waiters ''to make out a little bit better, but not as good as they used to.'' Two restaurants specializing in the new American cooking are scheduled to open this fall.

154-> JAZZ: JAMES WILLIAMS ON PIANO AT ZINNO
During his four years with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and, currently, with the trumpeter Jon Faddis's new group, James Williams has been playing piano in settings that call for strong, percussive statements and a broad, relatively flamboyant style. This week, however, he is in a very different situation. He is playing at Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, with only the accompaniment of George Duvivier on bass, and he is performing before an audience that is primarily interested in eating. Under the circumstances, he has dropped the idiomatic jazz material that he might play with Mr. Blakey or Mr. Faddis and turned instead to a repertory of pop standards. But rather than the Gershwin-Porter-Berlin material that one might expect, Mr. Williams has a fondness for the kind of songs that either come from European operetta or are suggested by it - Franz Lehar's ''Yours Is My Heart Alone,'' for example, or the Arthur Schwartz-Howard Dietz song ''You and the Night and the Music.'' These are tunes that give him melodic scope that he uses to project some of the kind of color that Erroll Garner put into his performances. Mr. Williams is not as tightly stylized as Mr. Garner was but, like him, he is basically a happy, cheerful pianist. He likes bright tempos, bright sounds and big, ringing chords. Given a tune such as ''Undecided,'' which is inherently swinging, he fills it with lively shifts and variations. But when he tries to keep a very slow ballad afloat he is apt to get trapped in superficial fussiness.

155-> SPAT OVER NOBEL PRIZE EMBARASSES ACADEMY
It has been some time since the venerable Swedish Academy, founded in 1786 by King Gustav III, has been quite so embarrassed. The high point of the staid academy's yearly cycle - the solemn announcement of the Nobel Prize in Literature - was marred Thursday by a squabble over the merits of its own decision. As the afternoon newspaper Expressen tartly observed today, the dispute was ''unique in the entire history of the academy.'' The literary affray had the merit of diverting the attention of Swedes from a nasty political dispute sparked by the plans of Prime Minister Olof Palme's Government to give workers a hold over the stocks of private companies. Three days ago, thousands of businessmen marched through Stockholm's sun-dappled streets to protest the move. But the squabble in the academy showed to the world that the Nobel Prize is not exactly bestowed from the clouds by omniscient, infallible gods. ''After this, I don't know whether it will ever be the same,'' said one Stockholm editor. A Good-Humored Familiarity For all its global renown and import, the Nobel Prize in Literature - and the people who give it - are regarded by Swedes with good-humored familiarity and affection. They are alive to the little tics of the 18 cultural barons of the Swedish Academy - their likes and dislikes, the authors that some of them have translated into Swedish, then promoted for the prize, and other foibles. When October rolls around, even Stockholm taxi drivers weigh with an air of insight and discrimination the contending claims of rumored Nobel Prize candidates. This year there was a growing conviction that it was about time for another woman - the French writer Marguerite Yourcenar, the Rhodesian-born Doris Lessing or Nadine Gordimer of South Africa. Five of the 80 Nobel laureates have been women. For the man in the street, the academy's choice of William Golding, the 72-year-old British novelist, at least had the merit of not being esoteric. Within minutes of the ritual 1 P.M. announcement of the winner at the stock exchange, the better Stockholm bookstores were dusting off copies of ''Lord of the Flies'' for their show windows. Criticism by an Academician But for Artur Lundkvist, one of the most influential members of the academy and a headstrong Grand Old Man of Swedish letters, the choice of Golding was an affront. And, breaking a pledge of silence that the jury takes about its own deliberations, the 77-year-old poet and essayist did what has never been done before. He told reporters he didn't think Mr. Golding deserved the prize. And then he boycotted the academy's traditional Thursday lunch at the Gyllene Freden restaurant in the Old City. The restaurant's name means ''golden peace'' - something the academy longs for today. Since being appointed to the academy in 1968, the opinionated Mr. Lundkvist, an authority on Spanish, French and Italian writing, has translated his views into prizes. The Lundkvist hand is detectable in the naming of the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez last year, the aging Spanish surrealist poet Vicente Aleixandre in 1977 and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda in 1971. Mr. Lundkvist is also an intransigent opponent of a prize for the British novelist Graham Greene, a perennial contender in the street polls, but after the award to a Briton this year, apparently doomed to be ignored. The Swede, a radical proletarian novelist in his youth and a 1958 winner of the Lenin Peace Prize, has urged the jury toward bold, experimental and revolutionary writers. He has, hardly by coincidence, been this kind of writer himself - turning out lyrical and surrealist books with such titles as ''Bridges of the Night,'' ''Life as Grass,'' and ''Darunga, or the She- Wolf's Milk.'' Two years ago, he had a heart attack and was in a coma for four months; he is now writing an account of the vivid dreams he had while unconscious. The Lundkvist candidate this year was Claude Simon, a pioneer of the French nouveau roman who, so the Swede argued in committee, had exercised a profound ''Faulknerian'' influence over Latin American writers. On Sept. 29, he contended, the academy had split 7 to 5, Golding over Simon. Vote by a 'Great Majority ' Thursday, according to Lars Gyllensten, the academy's permanent secretary, the academy voted by a ''great majority'' for Golding at what he said was a tranquil meeting. ''Lundkvist took part and did not oppose the qualifications of Golding for the prize,'' said Mr. Gyllensten in an interview today. But when a journalist asked Mr. Lundkvist what he thought of the choice, he let fly with the biting judgment that Golding was a decent enough writer but hardly Nobel timber. Apparently piqued at being rebuffed over Simon, he told journalists in telephone interviews that the selection of Golding amounted to a ''coup'' against him. There has been no indication that the academy will reprimand Mr. Lundkvist. The Lundkvist tale underscores the erratic selection process that has characterized the Nobel Prize in Literature since it was first awarded to the Frenchman Sully Prudhomme, hardly an enduring talent, in 1901. Other choices that have arguably not met the test of time include Giosue Carducci, Rudolf Eucken, Jacinto Benavente, Grazia Deledda, Paul Heyse, Carl Spitteler, Ivan Bunin and Mikhail Sholokhov. A long list of 20th-century literary giants never recognized includes Joseph Conrad, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Henry James and Vladimir Nabokov. A number of obscure Scandivanians, including two members of the Swedish Academy, won the prize. Two seminal Scandinavians - August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen - did not.

156-> POLAND DEBT TALKS END
Western bank representatives and Polish officials ended two days of talks on how and when Poland will pay $25 billion it owes the banks and other governments. They agreed to meet again in Zurich in two weeks. The session was adjourned without any formal comment on Poland's request that it be allowed to repay all its debt over 20 years, with an eight-year grace period before any payment on principal. Polish negotiators said, however, that their Government would not necessarily insist on the 20-year package proposed Monday.

157-> NEW MONEY FOR THE NEW ROCKEFELLERS
AS legend has it, John D. Rockefeller, who turned an oil monopoly i nto one of the first great American family fortunes, used to give a way shiny new dimes in the depths of the Depression to those he p assed on the street. Some of his heirs may now be wishing that the p atriarch were still around to toss a little spare change their way. No, the Rockefellers aren't running out of money. But their wealth is beginning to look just a little bit less awesome as more and more relatives line up to dip into the family kitty. In 1937, John D. Rockefeller left his vast riches to a single son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., who in turn divided the fortune among his six children. Now the great pie is being sliced again -this time among 23 heirs, who themselves will have to provide for some 40 fifth-generation descendants. With such demands on their inheritance, the Rockefellers are moving quietly, but purposefully, to generate more earnings from one of their principal sources of income - Rockefeller Center Inc. R.C.I., which is owned by trusts benefiting the family members, is under pressure from the younger Rockefellers to invest in businesses that provide immediate dividend income and to sell off some of its more traditional real estate holdings, which offer only long-term gains. So strong is the Rockefeller commitment to this strategy that R.C.I. is taking steps that could lead to the sale of all or part of New York's famed Rockefeller Center, the company's main asset and now the family's most visible symbol of its past grandeur and wealth. It has recently offered to buy the land beneath the Center from its owner, Columbia University, in a move that real estate people say is almost necessary if the buildings are ever to be sold. To lead R.C.I. in its new profit-making endeavors, the family has replaced Alton Marshall, the company's president for 10 years, with Richard Voell, an acquisitions expert who helped transform Penn Central from a railroad into an energy, resources and real estate company. ''During my tenure, there was no big demand for return,'' said Mr. Marshall, who left R.C.I. in 1981. ''But with the increasing size of the family, the return will be just as important as it is for stockholders in the company - which is actually what they are.'' Adds Harry Helmsley, a powerful New York real estate executive: ''As the family gets bigger and bigger, some of them would like to have the money in their pockets.'' And R.C.I. is trying to put it there. In 1981, it joined forces with RCA, one of Rockefeller Center's biggest tenants, to start what many analysts say could be a highly profitable cable television network. And in 1980 it paid $28 million for a small but highly respected oil and natural gas exploring and production company. But real estate analysts, who have watched R.C.I. dispose of its stakes in the New York Hilton and the Manhattan headquarters of Celanese, Sperry and the Continental Corporation, say those investments are only the beginning now that David Rockefeller, one of the two surviving sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr., has taken over as R.C.I. chairman and hired Mr. Voell. Wherever the two men take R.C.I., the new emphasis on more profitable ventures is a major change for the Rockefellers. John D. Rockefeller Jr., who built Rockefeller Center during the Depression, spent much of his life giving away money to help rescue a family image that had been badly tarnished by his father's ruthless business practices. And any of the family's money-making endeavors were kept so quiet that most believed the Rockefellers had no need for additional wealth. Indeed, when there were only six Rockefellers, income was not an issue, and real estate seemed the perfect investment for R.C.I. David, Nelson, Winthrop, Laurance, John 3d and Abby, the children of John D. Rockefeller Jr., were content with the return on their investment coming mainly from long-term appreciation of real estate values. In fact, it was during this period that R.C.I. grew from a singleproperty real estate owner to one of the nation's largest development firms. It built new office space around Rockefeller Center and constructed the Wells Fargo headquarters in Los Angeles and two buildings in Detroit's Renaissance Center. But the paper profits of real estate deals are no longer enough for the cousins, those fourth-generation descendants who now control the majority of R.C.I. stock and who are not as concerned with their family's image. So far, Mr. Voell has not indicated how he will increase R.C.I's earnings or whether he plans any big acquisitions. But he is gearing up for major changes. He has reduced the size of the real estate development staff and expanded the strategic planning staff. In September, he hired Lorian L. Marlantes, who was Penn Central's top planning officer, as R.C.I.'s vice president for strategic planning and development. R.C.I. officials refuse to talk about their diversification plans, and Rockefeller family members are equally silent. ''We are engaged in major strategic planning now, and feel it would be inappropriate to comment on our plans,'' a spokesman said. But there seems no doubt that R.C.I. is prepared to expand its interests in the entertainment area. For the past few years it has been trying to make Radio City Music Hall more profitable by bringing in new types of entertainment. And in 1981, it joined with RCA to set up The Entertainment Channel. Arthur Taylor, the channel's president and the former president of CBS Inc., said that R.C.I. and RCA invested $100 million in the venture. R.C.I. looked at several options before getting into cable television, including the role of being a system operator, according to an Entertainment Channel official. ''They decided programming is where the money can be made,'' the executive said. Herbert S. Schlosser, an RCA executive vice president, believes that R.C.I. entered the business because ''it is the kind of business that, if it works, will have a very good cash return.'' Analysts concur and are quite optimistic about the venture, although they say it is a risky one. ''It has a long way to go,'' said John S. Reidy, an analyst at Drexel, Burnham, Lambert. The network has fewer than 100,000 subscribers and Mr. Reidy estimated that it would take 1.5 million subscribers to turn a profit. But it has a valuable niche. Unlike competitors, such HBO and the Movie Channel, it does not rely on Hollywood for its programming. The channel is showing broadway plays and has a 10-year contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation. J. Kendrick Noble Jr., an analyst at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, said The Entertainment Channel could enjoy a profit margin of 20 percent of revenues, the same as HBO. And both Mr. Reidy and Mr. Nobel say the channel could eventually sign up five million subscribers. In addition to entertainment, the Rockefellers seems to be returning to the business of oil with the purchase of the Wessely Energy Corporation, a Dallas-based oil and natural gas company. With assets of $65 million, Wessely is exploring in Central Oklahoma and East Texas. Industry sources say the company has recently received major ''Rockefeller injections'' of new investment capital. And a source close to R.C.I. expects it to continue to increase its presence in the oil business. R.C.I. also owns the New York-based Trinity Paper and Plastics Corporation, the second-largest producer of both grocery store bags and sacks, accounting for about 10 percent of sales in each market. Trinity is believed to be more profitable than other companies in the industry. Many analysts are not surprised that R.C.I. is moving away from being predominantly a real estate company. Rockefeller Center - built at a cost of $125 million Depression-era dollars -has not been a particularly profitable investment, according to Mr. Helmsley. He said the buildings would be more valuable to another investor, who could take advantage of fat depreciation tax breaks. The half-century-old Center has already used up its 40-year depreciation allowance, but a new purchaser could depreciate the cost of the Center over 12 years under current tax law. It is not known how much the Center's tenants pay in rent, but Mr. Helmsley says many long-term leases have a $20-per-square-foot rate that will rise to $40 to $45 when renewed. There are about 15 million square feet of office space in the Center, and R.C.I. occupies six million. Mr. Helmsley said there was ''no question'' that R.C.I.'s profits have suffered from the family's noneconomic goals. ''The Rockefellers are not really real estate people.'' The biggest obstacle in the way of R.C.I.'s move away from real estate is Columbia's ownership of the land beneath the Center's 14 original buildings. Institutions avoid purchasing buildings when they cannot own the land, and even lending institutions are reluctant to refinance buildings on land independently owned. According to a former official of the Greenwich Savings Bank (now part of the Metropolitan Savings Bank), R.C.I. asked the bank in the 1970's to make a loan against the buildings and was refused because Columbia owned the land. Mr. Marshall said he unsuccessfully negotiated to sell a major part of the Center. So did Mr. Voell in 1981, when he tried to arrange for a $400 million loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America. The Prudential was given an option that would have allowed it to convert the loan into a half-ownership position in the buildings on the Columbia property. Although the arrangement fell through in mid-November, some suggest that the Prudential deal could be in abeyance until R.C.I. can buy the land, for which its lease expires in 2069. R.C.I. has already made Columbia an offer. Although the amount is not known, the land is worth $400 million to $500 million, according to Mr. Helmsley, who has appraised the property for Columbia. But the university is not expected to accept any offer quickly and is reluctant to talk about it. ''We can't talk about something that's on the table,'' explained David B. Hertz, a member of Columbia's board of trustees. And Anthony D. Knirr, Columbia's top business officer, even denies the existence of the R.C.I. offer, although he disclosed for the first time in an interview that an R.C.I. offer was secretly made and rejected in 1970. But when everything is said and done, added Thomas D. Flynn, another trustee, ''What it's worth to Rockefeller Center may not be what Columbia considers a good deal.'' A LOTGOES A LONG WAY In 1880, almost all of the nation's oil was being refined by one man, John D. Rockefeller. The Standard Oil Company, which also controlled the transportation of the oil through the railroads, helped its creator accumulate fantastic wealth: an estimated $900 million by 1908. But John D. Rockefeller, who had a ruthless business reputation, came to believe that his riches were God-given and should be used to improve the world. He consistently gave 10 percent of his income to the Baptist Church. Before he died in 1937, he had given away $550 million, mostly to the Rockefeller Foundation, the General Education Board, the Rockefeller Institute and the University of Chicago. John D. Rockefeller Jr. received $465 million from his father and also devoted himself to philanthropy, in part to improve the family's image. All told, he gave away $552 million during his life, but still had $240 million left for his wife and six children when he died in 1960. Each of the children - Abby, John, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop and David - had also gotten a trust worth $40 million in 1934. While it was generally believed that the family's wealth from trusts, securities and other investments was between $5 billion and $10 billion, Nelson A. Rockefeller insisted - in testimony before the Senate at the time of his Vice Presidential nomination - that the family had total wealth of only $1.3 billion. The inheritances have varied, and will vary, widely. Winthrop Rockefeller had only one child; Abby had children; John and Laurance, four each; David, six, and Nelson, seven. The younger generation has vastly different financial needs. One of Laurance's four children, Marion French Rockefeller, has lived for years in a well-appointed caboose in California, raising her food and making do with about $700 a month.

158-> THE REGION; Bush Speaks To Jersey G.O.P.
Vice President Bush told 400 Republicans at a $500-a-plate luncheon today that the New Jersey legislative elections this fall would be viewed across the country as a referendum on the Reagan Administration's policies. Mr. Bush urged support for Governor Kean's efforts to wrest control of the Legislature from the Democrats, who control both houses. ''The outcome in this off-year election will be viewed as indicating how the general philosophy of the Republican Party is working,'' he said. ''I urge you to go that extra mile to show that good government for the state means good politics for the United States of America,'' he said.

BRITAIN'S LEADER VISITS FALKLANDS STANLEY, Falkland Islands, Jan. 8 (By The Associated Press) - Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arrived here today for an unannounced visit ''to pay tribute to those who liberated the islands'' that Britain recaptured from Argentina in fighting last year. It was the first visit by a British Prime Minister to this South Atlantic colony, and came nearly seven months after Argentine soldiers who had occupied the islands surrendered to British forces on June 14. In London, Mrs. Thatcher's office at 10 Downing Street said the Prime Minister was accompanied by her husband, Denis; Adm. Sir John Fieldhouse, the Chief of Naval Staff, and four aides. After a secret 23-hour flight from a Royal Air Force base near London, she was greeted at the Stanley airport by Sir Rex Hunt, the civil commissioner of this South Atlantic archipelago 8,000 miles from Britain and 300 miles off the Argentine coast. Briefing From Military Leaders Her arrival came five days after the 150th anniversary of Britain's settlement of the islands. Mrs. Thatcher told reporters at the airport that she was thrilled and excited to be here. ''I've come to talk to the people here, to support the armed forces and to pay tribute to those who liberated the islands,'' she said. Looking fresh despite the long flight, Mrs. Thatcher then entered Sir Rex's official car, an old London taxicab, for the ride to Government House, where she will stay. A Downing Street spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher would receive a full briefing from the Falkland military leaders over dinner. Although news of her arrival was broadcast over the local radio station only minutes after her plane arrived, most of Stanley's 900 civilians and many soldiers from the British garrison lined the streets to cheer her and shout, ''God bless you!'' Mrs. Thatcher left the car three times to shake hands with people in the crowd. Many were waving British flags and some were weeping. At the airport, the Prime Minister was asked if she did not believe that Argentina would consider her visit a provocation, and she replied: ''It would be very strange if I did not come to the Falkland Islands. Very strange indeed.'' She said she was ''very excited'' to be in the Falklands and added, ''We have come to talk to the people here.'' The Downing Street announcement gave no indication how long Mrs. Thatcher intended to stay in the Falklands, but said she would spend the next few days touring the islands to meet military personnel and local inhabitants. For security reasons, her trip had been kept secret until her plane landed at Stanley, Downing Street officials said. They said the Prime Minister left from the R.A.F. base at Brize Norton, 40 miles northwest of London, in an R.A.F. VC-10 bomber converted to transport service, and flew 10 hours to Ascension Island. 'A Gesture of Support' There she and her party transferred to an R.A.F. C-130 Hercules transport for the 13-hour haul to Stanley. The four-engine plane was refueled twice in flight, the officials said. A Government spokesman in London said that Mrs. Thatcher ''wanted to see the Falklands for herself.'' The spokesman added, ''She wanted to meet the islanders in their own communities as a gesture of support.'' The Prime Minister plans to visit the cemetery where most of the British dead from the conflict with Argentina are buried. After 17 years of fruitless negotiations with Britain over the islands, Argentine forces seized the archipelago April 2 and 3. Mrs. Thatcher responded by sending a naval task force to the South Atlantic and ordering a blockade of a 200-mile zone around the islands. The American Secretary of State at that time, Alexander M. Haig Jr., undertook to try to find a peaceful solution to the crisis by conducting talks in Buenos Aires and London, but that mission failed on April 19. Sinking of the General Belgrano On April 25 British commandos invaded South Georgia island, a dependency of the Falklands, and regained control of it after small resistance. On May 1 British warplanes attacked airfields at Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, and at Goose Green, and the next day a British submarine sank an Argentine cruiser, the General Belgrano, with the loss of 321 Argentine crewmen. The conflict, in which the United States backed Britain, ended when the occupying Argentine troops surrendered June 14 in a humiliating defeat that led to the resignation of Argentina's military Government. Britain reported its casualties in the Falkland War as 255 men killed and 777 wounded. Argentina listed 712 soldiers and sailors killed. Argentine Reaffirms Claim Caracas, Venezuela, Jan. 8 (Reuters)--Argentina's Foreign Minister, Juan Ramon Aguirre Lanari, today reaffirmed his country's claim to sovereignty over the Falklands Islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas. "Argentina firmly maintains its claim of sovereignty over the Malvinas in the expectation that the civilized international community will give its support," Mr. Aguirre said. He was speaking to reporters during a stopover at Caracas airport on his way from Buenos Aires to a meeting of the nations professing nonalignment in Managua, Nicaragua. He made no direct reference to Mrs. Thatcher's visit to the Falklands.

160-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Mariners Drop O'Brien
Dan O'Brien was dismissed as president and general manager of the Seattle Mariners yesterday and his protege, Hal Keller, the director of player development, was promoted to general manager. For the Mariners, whose 60-102 record was the worst in the major leagues this season, it was the second major executive change this year. In June, Rene Lachemann, who recently became the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, was dismissed as Seattle's manager and replaced by Del Crandall. O'Brien had come to the Mariners from the Texas Rangers in 1979 and had brought Keller with him.

161-> INITIATOR OF 'BABY DOE' CASE UNSHAKEN
Lawrence Washburn Jr., the lawyer who began the court fight to force surgery on a severely deformed Long Island infant, says that despite legal setbacks he still believes that the parents of the baby girl do not have the right to block the operations. Mr. Washburn, a 48-year-old municipal-bonds lawyer by profession, has for the past 13 years pressed ''right to life'' lawsuits in many states on behalf of unborn fetuses, handicapped minors and severely ill patients. Despite a ruling by the New York State's highest court upholding the right of the parents to withhold the surgery for ''Baby Jane Doe,'' as she is known in court papers, Mr. Washburn says of his effort that he would ''of course, do it again.'' In an interview from Vermont, where he lives, Mr. Washburn said: ''Strictly speaking, the parents don't have the right to refuse life-preserving surgery. What the Court of Appeals said was that this is not life-preserving surgery. I think they are wrong on the facts.'' Child Now a Month Old Mr. Washburn has never seen the child, now a month old and under care at University Hospital at Stony Brook. Nor has he met her parents. The child suffers from spina bifida, an opening in the spine; hydrocephaly, a build-up of fluid in the skull, and microcephaly, an abnormally small head. Her parents say physicians have told them that part of her cerebral cortex is missing, a condition that cannot be corrected. Without surgery, the infant may live from six weeks to two years. With it, she may survive until she is 20, but her doctors say she will be severely retarded, epileptic, bed-ridden and paralyzed from her waist down. Three days after the birth of Baby Jane Doe on Oct. 11, Mr. Washburn said, he received a confidential tip that she was being denied ''life preserving surgery.'' He sued, and a State Supreme Court justice ordered the surgery. The ruling was overturned by the Appellate Division in Brooklyn. 'Distressing and Offensive' The case reached the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, in two weeks, and on Oct. 28, the court said the young couple had the right to withhold surgery. In a unanimous opinion, the court called the suit ''distressing and offensive.'' The court said the parents should not have been subjected to the stress and expense of litigating the case, particularly since Mr. Washburn ''had no disclosed relationship with the child, her parents, her family or those treating her illnesses.' The court chastised both Mr. Washburn and the State Supreme Court justice, Melvyn Tannenbaum of Suffolk County, for failing to call in the state's Department of Social Services, which has jurisdiction over child-neglect cases. ''I accept their criticism,'' Mr. Washburn said in the interview. ''I used a procedure I thought they had accepted in the past. I have to do some soul-searching now. I could have handled it differently, with a bit more compassion for the parents.'' Religion Basis for Beliefs A Roman Catholic, Mr. Washburn said his religious beliefs had a strong bearing on his decision in 1970 to challenge a New York abortion law. This was the so-called friend of the fetus case, the first suit in which Mr. Washburn brought a suit on behalf of an unborn child. Since that time, Mr. Washburn, whose father, Arthur Lawrence Washburn Sr., was a well-known New York City physician, has been a dogged anti- abortionist lawyer, tracking cases across the country. For three years he led the fight, along with the America United for Life Legal Defense Fund, to defend the Hyde Amendment, which limited Federal funds for abortion for poor women. Mr. Washburn knows well the argument that he is without authority or standing to enter a case in which he suffers no direct harm. In the ''Baby Jane Doe'' case, he faced that issue and agreed to withdraw once a guardian was appointed to represent the infant's interests, he said. Court Fight Succeeds In the Hyde Amendment case, he represented a physician who said she was seeking to protect all the unborn in the nation. The Supreme Court upheld the Hyde Amendment in 1980. Mr. Washburn maintains that the decision by the parents of ''Baby Jane Doe'' to choose a conservative course of medical treatment is not valid. Along with Dr. C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General of the United States, who was instrumental in bringing a pending Federal suit for the infant's medical records, he says he believes that every life is sacred and that ''Baby Jane Doe'' should be saved. He said the risk in these types of cases is that parents will refuse surgery to corrct a physical defect because they do not want to raise a mentally retarded child. The parents of the infant, who are also Roman Catholic, said in an interview that Mr. Washburn was entitled to his views, ''but to push those views upon ourselves,'' the father said, ''was unacceptable.'' 'The Best Professional Help' ''We had the best professional help sitting in with us,'' the father continued. The parents said their daughter will not have any awareness of life. ''As for profoundly retarded children,'' Mr. Washburn said, ''well they are here to protect, they are also 'l'enfants bon Dieu,' the children of the good God, they are given to us because it is our call to heroism, to greatness, to have a child like this.'' Mr. Washburn is affiliated with general practice law firms in Albany and on Long Island. He is also associated with a ''pro-life public interest law firm'' in Huntington, L.I. Mostly, he said, he volunteers his services for cases involving individual children. In the big cases, he said, the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund in Chicago absorbs much of the cost. Meanwhile, the parents have run up $6,000 in legal fees. The father said yesterday that this fee was only for state court costs. ''And it continues to grow,'' he said, referring to the suit filed by the Federal Justice Department to get the infant's medical records. That suit is now on the trial level, but could go higher, said the father, a building contractor who described himself as ''lower-middle class.'' David D. Siegel, professor of law at Albany Law School and an expert in New York practice and procedure, said ''there is nothing clearly applicable in New York law'' that would allow the couple to recover legal fees in the state case. ''What parents in this situation need is some legislative help,'' he said. Mr. Washburn said the Federal case is ''taking too long.'' ''I lost a baby once because I stopped to type papers,'' he said. ''I am concerned that the law is not able to respond to life-threatening situations such as this.'' Consequently, he said he might be forced to enter the Long Island case again. ''I am considering an approach to the U.S. Supreme Court,'' he said.

162-> Dollar Bonds Slip in London
Fixed-interest dollar bonds were little changed this afternoon after declining early in the day by about 3/8 point, dealers said. Prices initially fell on concern over the possibility of firmer American interest rates. Trading activity was very quiet. The new $100 million Nippon Credit Bank 12 percent 1990 issue extended its early declines and was indicated at 97 3/8-98 1/8, down 5/8 point on the day. Japanese convertibles were firm on the strength of stock prices in Tokyo. United States bonds convertible to equity were firm in quiet trading, with market sentiment encouraged by the higher Wall Street opening, dealers said.

166-> THE CITY; Hospital Patient Killed by Gunman
A gunman slipped into a Bronx hospital at 3 A.M. yesterday and shot to death Jose Enrique, 44 years old, of 2267 Ellis Avenue, the Bronx, the police said. Mr. Enrique had been under treatment for a gunshot wound he received Sept. 14 in a car at 180th Street and Arthur Avenue in the East Tremont area. Yesterday, he was shot in a semiprivate room on the seventh floor of St. Barnabas Hospital, 4422 Third Avenue, at 183d Street, the police said. The other patient in the room was awakened by the shot, but, according to the police, did not see the gunman. No one else apparently heard the shot. Detectives said that they did not know the motive for either shooting, but that the victim was believed to have been associated with gamblers and narcotics dealers. The police said Mr. Enrique was paroled from prison Sept. 2 after serving time for possession of a loaded gun, and had earlier served nine months on a manslaughter conviction.

Traffic Wardens 'B ig Brother'' may indeed be watching by 1984. The Sanitation Department wants to mount cameras on its street sweepers to film illegally parked cars, and City Councilman Henry Stern had a similar suggestion this week for catching traffic violators on the move. Mr. Stern would create a volunteer traffic warden corps to spot and film cars running red lights or flouting other regulations. ''You see a car racing through a light; you see his plate; you know who it is; you wish you could tell on him in some officially approved way,'' he said. Persistent violators spotted by wardens could receive warning letters. Film of violations could be used as evidence for issuing summonses. ''It's an enormous deterrent if people feel they're being watched,'' the Councilman said. Such ''corner watchers'' could be drawn, he said, from the city's 65,000 Blockwatchers, civilians registered with the Police Department who observe and report neighborhood emergencies. But the Traffic Department is troubled by the possibility of corner watchers with bad eyesight or a grudge. ''The proposal is being examined very carefully because of the legal problems involved,'' said Victor Ross, a department spokesman.

170-> OPERA: 'ADVENTURES OF FRIAR TUCK'
We live in an age of revisionism, and many long-cherished myths have recently come up for re-evaluation. The latest to endure this contemporary acid test is the ever-green story of Robin Hood and his merry men. According to an engaging new opera, ''The Adventures of Friar Tuck,'' which received its world premiere at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center on Thursday night, this seminal, agrarian Socialist was little more than the creation of a Machiavellian monk. ''The Adventures of Friar Tuck,'' which features music by Glenn Paxton and a libretto by Allan Leicht, was presented under the auspices of the Lake George Opera Festival. It is in two acts and overlong and includes an oddly anticlimactic final scene. Still, the opera makes for an entertaining evening, and there was much to admire in Thursday's performance. Timothy Nolen's full-dimensional portrayal of the besotted, ambitious Tuck was the fulcrum. Mr. Nolen, who possesses a strong baritone voice and a visceral stage presence, brought Tuck to bristling life. He was supported by Garry Harger, who gave a blustering charm to the role of Robert Fitzooth, the star-struck, bumbling country boy who matures into the dashing Robin Hood, under the tutelage of Tuck, his personal Svengali. Sue Anne Gershenson was a fetching, impetuous Maid Marian, James Sergi made an appropriately sinister Sheriff of Nottingham and Cris Groenendaal brought an amusing touch of Hollywood flash to the role of the laid-back King Richard the Lionhearted. ''The Adventures of Friar Tuck'' is no masterpiece. The score is lightweight, falling somewhere between ''Man of La Mancha'' and ''A Chorus Line.'' But it is the work of craftsmen, there are some good show tunes and few pretensions impede the flow of the stage action. Mr. Leicht's script is often witty, as when Tuck debunks Robin's ethos: ''If you rob enough from the rich you make them poor; if you give the poor enough money you make them rich, and you're back where you started from.'' The opera ends about 20 minutes after it should; the dramatic climax is followed by a rather ponderous political digression. It is as if Mr. Leicht got tired of swashbuckling and decided to imitate Platonic dialogue instead. The Lake George Opera Festival's production was most satisfactory. Paulette Haupt-Nolen conducted with energy, Leon Major's direction was animated and Elizabeth Keen provided vivid choreography. Michael Anania's sets, while simple, were well-attuned to the stage action, giving ample, treelike poles for merry men and maidens to shinny up during joyous romps through Sherwood Forest.

173-> POLICE LACKING SUSPECT IN THEFT AT THE 92ND ST. Y
The theft over the weekend of religious objects from an exhibition and sale at the 92d Street Y may have been carried out by thieves who hid themselves in the building Friday evening, the police said yesterday. A detective assigned to the case called the tactic a ''likely possibility.'' There were no suspects, he said. The robbery took place between 6:30 P.M. Friday, after all sections of the Y except the residence hall closed in observance of the Jewish Sabbath, and 8:25 A.M. Saturday, the police said. The doors of the residence hall are locked at about 11:30. Those entering after that time must ring for a guard. The Y, a leading Manhattan cultural center, occupies the block between 91st and 92d Streets on Lexington Avenue, with the residence hall at the 91st Street end and the concert hall and art gallery at the 92d Street end. 6 Items Valued at $4,915 A police spokesman said investigators had not yet received a complete list of the items taken and what each was worth. He said the value of six of the items reported as stolen had been estimated at $4,915. Linda Greenberg, assistant director of performing arts for the Y, said about 18 items were missing. The stolen objects were part of an exhibition of about 100 traditional and contemporary works of Jewish religious art that opened on Thursday. The exhibition was mounted by a Manhattan gallery called In the Spirit. Messages left on a telephone answering machine at the gallery and at the residence of the gallery's owners were not returned. Among the objects reported missing were two menorahs, one of pewter and brass; a silver candlestick and three Torah pointers, two of silver and one of silver and ivory. On Saturday morning a security guard found an unlocked backstage exit leading from the concert hall to 92d Street. A security guard was on duty in the lobby during the robbery, according to Miss Greenberg. The objects were displayed in clear plastic cases mounted on panels attached to the walls. To reach the objects, the thieves cut holes in the cases or smashed them. Some of the cases, including one holding a silver menorah valued at $2,600, were left intact. The police bias unit, which responds to crimes against religious institutions, was also investigating the theft.

REAGAN OUTLINES POLICY ON TRIBES WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UPI) - President Reagan today outlined a policy to encourage self-government among Indian tribes and to create a ''favorable environment'' to make reservations more economically self-sufficient. The announcement came less than a week after Interior Secretary James G. Watt angered Indian leaders by calling Federal reservations ''an example of the failures of socialism.'' Mr. Reagan said the principle of self-government had been set forth in a 1975 law and was a ''good starting point,'' but since then, he said, ''there has been more rhetoric than action.'' ''Instead of fostering and encouraging self-government,'' the President said, ''Federal policies have by and large inhibited the political and economic development of the tribes.'' Spelling out a policy certain to be opposed by leaders of the 1.4 million Indians now living on reservations, Mr. Reagan proposed that the Federal Government move away from its ''surrogate role'' regarding Indian tribes and that the tribes reduce their dependence on Federal funds. The Indians, he said, would still be eligible for block grants for social services. Discusses Mineral Wealth The President also called for greater involvement of private industry in developing the economies of the Indian lands and said that both the country and the Indian tribes ''stand to gain from the prudent development and management of the vast coal, oil, gas, uranium and other resources found on Indian lands.'' However, he said his Administration would not expect change overnight and would ''pursue the policy of self-government for Indian tribes without threatening termination.'' A White House aide said the new policy statement was developed with recommendations from the Interior Department. Several Indian leaders from around the country called for Mr. Watt's resignation last week in response to a broadcast interview Jan. 20 in which the Interior Secretary said: ''If you want an example of the failures of socialism, don't go to Russia. Come to America, and see the American Indian reservations.'' Mr. Watt then said that some tribal leaders ''are interested in keeping this group of people assembled on a desert environment where there are no jobs, no agricultural potential, no water, because if Indians were allowed to be liberated, they'd go and get a job and that guy wouldn't have his handout as a paid government Indian official.'' Need for Self-Government In his statement today, Mr. Reagan said, ''This Administration intends to restore tribal governments to their rightful place among the governments of this nation and to enable tribal governments, along with state and local governments, to resume control over their own affairs.'' The policy statement reflected Mr. Reagan's philosophy that many responsibilities and resources now handled by the Federal Government should be under the jurisdiction of the state and local governments. ---- Opposition From Indians WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (AP) - Indian groups, who got a look at a draft of the Reagan Administration's policy earlier this month, had branded it as an empty gesture. ''The words sound lovely, but the real Indian policy of this Administration was set in the first budget the President sent to Congress, which proposed to cut one third of the total budget for Indians,'' said Suzan Harjo of the Native American Rights Fund, which represents Indian tribes before Congress.

Connors and Lendl Will Meet in Final ROSEMONT, Ill., Jan. 8 (AP) - Jimmy Connors, using service placement to maximum advantage, defeated John McEnroe, 6-1, 5-7, 6-2, tonight in the semifinals of the $250,000 Lite Challenge of Champions tournament. Connors will play Ivan Lendl for the $100,000 first prize in the final Sunday. Lendl swept past Bjorn Borg, 6-1, 7-5, in 66 minutes in the second semifinal match. In the opening match, McEnroe staved off 1 match point in the second set and had five aces to none for Connors, but he was unable to return Connors's service with authority. Connors, meanwhile, used his return of service effectively, keeping McEnroe on the baseline, then capitalizing when he came to the net.In the third set, Connors broke McEnroe in the fifth game for a 3-2 advantage. He then gave up just one point on his next service and score the last 4 points in the seventh game for the match. ---- Martina Navratilova Advances WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UPI) -Martina Navratilova used her strong serve-and-volley attack to rout Mary Lou Piatek, 6-1, 6-3, today and gain the final of the $150,000 Washington stop on the Virginia Slims tour. In the other semifinal, Sylvia Hanika of West Germany, trailing, 5-2, in the final set, won the last five games to defeat Andrea Jaeger of Lincolnshire, Ill., 6-7, 6-3, 7-5. The final is scheduled for Monday night at the Capital Centre in Landover, Md. Leading by 2-1 in the opening set, Miss Navratilova reeled off the next seven games. Miss Piatek, from Munster, Ind., cut the second-set deficit to 4-3, but Miss Navratilova took 8 of the next 9 points. ---- Gottfried Team in Final LONDON, Jan. 8 (UPI) - Brian Gottfried and Raul Ramirez upset the Wimbledon champions, Peter McNamara and Paul McNamee, 7-6, 7-5, 6-2, today and reached the final of the $200,000 World Doubles championship. Gottfried and Ramirez, who first established themselves as a team a decade ago, will try to win the event for the third time in Sunday's final at Royal Albert Hall. They will play Balazs Taroczy and Heinz Gunthardt, the defending champions, who beat Pavel Slozil and Tomas Smid, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. The first prize is $100,000. Although the Australians led by 4-1 in the opening set, Gottfried and Ramirez gradually came back. ''There was some incredible tennis in those early games,'' said Gottfried, ''and I sweated as much then as during the whole of any singles match.'' The Australians twice squandered set point in the opening set, and from then on, Gottfried and Ramirez were in control.

177-> SEABED? NO, BED OF NAILS
The Law of the Sea Treaty failed to achieve international consensus at Jamaica's Montego Bay. The United States and 46 other nations, together accounting for more than half the global gross domestic product, withheld their signatures. Twenty-two abstained, and 24 did not attend. Thus, the way is cleared to develop more promising arrangements. This is as it should be. For had the treaty been universally accepted, it would have undermined the future national and economic security of the United States and many of its allies. The treaty's main problems lay in its restrictions on deep seabed mining. The seabed contains vast quantities of such strategic minerals as manganese and cobalt, which are necessary to manufacture steel, jet engines and other vital products essential to our defense and industrial base. The United States and other countries must now rely heavily on imports to meet their strategic-mineral needs. Yet many foreign suppliers are not reliable, and in other cases highergrade ores are being depleted. The seabed's resources therefore represent an important future alternative. At present, all nations have the right to mine the seabed under the doctrine of ''freedom of the seas.'' According to international law, the resources of the ocean floor belong to no one. They are the legitimate property of whoever undertakes the expense and risks of bringing them to the surface. The Law of the Sea Treaty stands this principle on its head. It asserts that the seabed's minerals are ''the common heritage of mankind,'' meaning that they belong collectively to all nations. While the concept sounds noble, in practice it implies that no nation has the right to mine without permission from the ''body of --------------------------------------------------------------------- Edwin Meese 3d is counselor to President Reagan. the whole'' - effectively repealing ''freedom of the seas'' as it applies to ocean mining. The treaty would do this by creating an ''International Seabed Authority'' modeled loosely on the United Nations, to govern seabed mineral production. The authority's assembly, like its United Nations counterpart, would be dominated by the developing countries. These nations in the past have not only been hostile to the United States and free-world interests but in the United Nations have supported the Soviet position as much as 80 per cent of the time. The structure of the authority's executive council would help them succeed. Unlike the Security Council, the executive council would have no permanent members and no great-power veto - two provisions that have protected our interests in the United Nations. Thus, had America agreed to the treaty, we would have entrusted our own and our allies' access to the seabed's minerals to the goodwill of nations that have, for the most part, opposed our objectives. The authority's control over seabed mining would have been virtually complete. The authority would have its own mining company (the ''Enterprise''), which would enjoy preferential treatment and generous subsidies, financed primarily by its would-be competitors. Private or national companies wishing to mine would first have to apply for a license, which the authority would not be obliged to approve. If it were granted a license, a firm would be required to survey two mining sites, one of which the Enterprise would appropriate for its own use. The authority could compel competing firms to hand over their mining technology to the Enterprise or the developing countries, quite possibly choking off creation of needed technology in the first place. It could also limit the quantity of minerals that could be extracted. Even the most enthusiastic companies might well balk at accepting these terms on top of mining's inherent risk and expense. American mining firms, in particular, have already stated that they would not mine under the treaty's provisions. For this reason, the treaty poses a threat to both the industrialized countries as well as the developing nations, who will need strategic minerals as their own economies mature. For no one will benefit from the seabed's riches if the minerals remain on the ocean floor. Nor can these problems be solved, as some have argued, by the Law of the Sea's ''preparatory commission,'' which only sets the detailed rules for implementing the treaty and cannot change its substance. What is needed instead is an arrangment that will reaffirm customary international law. One of the Reagan Administration's first efforts has been to review how those areas of consensus and traditional law in the treaty, such as overflight and navigation rights, can be reinforced. Second, we need to develop alternative ways, outside the limiting framework of the treaty, to preserve all nations' access to the seabed's mineral resources. The United States will continue to work with other countries toward the creation of such arrangements.

178-> OIL STOCKS BATTERED IN A SELL-OFF
The prices of stocks of major oil companies declined sharply yesterday in response to news that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties had failed to reach agreement on oil production levels and prices. The sell-off of oil stocks, which left several major issues trading more than a dollar a share lower at the close of the session, was aggravated by the expectation of reduced fourth-quarter earnings for the largest American oil companies. The Exxon Corporation, the Mobil Corporation and several others are expected to report their earnings in the next two weeks. But analysts said the inconclusive OPEC meeting was the main reason for the rapid decline. Without an agreement on prices and production, they said, fears are mounting that oil prices will drop and the earnings of domestic oil companies will fall as a squeeze develops between the prices the companies can get for their oil and their costs in extracting it. 'The Realm of Emotionalism' ''We've entered the realm of emotionalism among investors and within OPEC itself,'' said William L. Randol of the First Boston Corporation, ''and that's what disturbs me the most.'' The announcement that the emergency consultative OPEC meeting had broken up without an agreement took Wall Street by surprise just before the start of trading. On Sunday, after a first round of negotiations, several oil ministers had reported that a tentative agreement on production quotas to maintain price levels had been reached. As a result of the failure of the OPEC meeting, Mr. Randol said, there is now ''better than a 50-50 chance'' that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, will lower its official oil price, now $34 a barrel, to retaliate against other OPEC nations that have refused to stop discounting prices. Some Hope for a Resolution Another analyst, Charles C. Cahn of Sanford C. Bernstein, said he expected OPEC to resolve its differences soon. But, he said, if no agreement is reached, oil shares will decline further. There seemed to be no pattern in yesterday's decline in stock prices to reflect which of the companies rely more on foreign oil supplies, and thus would be most immediately affected by OPEC's actions. Among the hardest hit were Standard Oil (Indiana), which closed at $40.75, down $4.125; Atlantic Richfield, $43.125, down $4; Standard Oil of California, $32.25, down $2.75, and Mobil, $25.75, down $1.375. Exxon closed at $29.75 and Texaco at $32, both down a dollar in active trading. Occidental Petroleum lost $1.125, to $19.75. Effect on Bank Stocks Some economists have argued that lower oil prices could hurt the world's banking system because it would deprive such major producers as Mexico and Nigeria of some of the revenues they need to repay huge foreign debts. In trading yesterday, shares of four big American banks with billions of dollars of foreign loans were lower, perhaps reflecting this concern, some analysts said. On the New York Stock Exchange, Chase Manhattan Bank fell 12 1/2 cents, to $48; Manufacturers Hanover Trust, 62 1/2 cents, to $38.25; Citicorp, $1.125, to $33.375, and Bankamerica, 37 1/2 cents, to $19.625.

179-> NAKASONE CALLS FOR MAJOR CHANGES IN JAPAN'S BASIC POLICY GUIDELINES
In an emotional speech to Parliament, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone called today for sweeping changes in Japanese political institutions but stopped short of urging amendment of the Constitution - a major issue between his conservative Government and opposition groups. ''Japan's postwar prosperity has flourished under our present Constitution,'' he said, ''but the stormy seas which plague the world also strike relentlessly at Japan, as seen in the increasingly harsh trade friction.'' ''In responding to this time of turmoil, we should review our basic institutions and arrangements anew with a fresh mind, holding nothing taboo,'' he said. In his carefully worded 35-minute policy address on the opening day of Parliament, Mr. Nakasone, who took office in late November, seemed to break slightly new ground with his calls for ''reform'' and ''review'' of the nation's institutions. But he refrained from directly proposing changing the Constitution, apparently to avoid provoking opposition parties increasingly alarmed by his tough stand on military matters. Conservatives Want Changes Conservatives would like to amend Article 9 of the charter, which renounces the right to make war, and the pacifist preamble, seeing these as a bar to rearmament. But liberal and centrist groups have defended the Constitution, which was adopted while the country was under American military occupation, as a guardian of the nation's post-1945 pacifist ideals. ''I feel strongly that Japan is today at a major turning point in its postwar history,'' Mr. Nakasone declared. ''Now more than ever,'' he said, according to an official translation, ''we should bequeath to future generations what parts we should alter and where we should be heading, and should set our guideposts for new progress.'' Ichio Asukata, chairman of the Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, attacked Mr. Nakasone' statement, declaring that it was ''the most shocking speech I ever heard made to Parliament.'' For the present the Government has agreed to hold military spending at less than 1 percent of the gross national product - a ceiling with a counterpart in no other country - but Mr. Nakasone has warned that the ceiling might be broken as early as 1984.

180-> ODYSSEY ENDS IN BRAZIL FOR CUBAN CIGAR MAKER
A search by one of Cuba's great cigar-making clans for a place with the characteristics suitable for re-creating their aromatic old Havanas has led to this small farming community in the backlands of Brazil's state of Bahia. Twenty-two years after being obliged to leave revolutionary Cuba, members of the Menendez family say that their odyssey, which included stops in Miami, the Canary Islands and Spain, has reached a successful end here. ''We've offered American and European buyers samples of our cigars and Montecristos with the labels taken off, and they often couldn't guess which was which,'' said Benjamin F. Menendez, 46 years old, the production director of Menendez Amerino S.A. With him in Brazil are two brothers, Alonso, 48, the sales director, and Felix, 38, the production manager. Growers Since 1860's Tobacco growers since the 1860's, the Menendezes used to make Montecristos in Cuba as co-partners in the Menendez Garcia company that occupied the same square as Havana's Capitol building and produced 26 million cigars a year. They also made H. Upmanns, another of the prestige Cuban brands. Among the many Montecristo smokers throughout the world was Winston Churchill, and Mr. Menendez said British agents used to come to the Havana factory during World War II and pick boxes destined for the Prime Minister at random as a precaution against poisoning attempts. On Sept. 15, 1960 - the three Menendez brothers remember the moment down to the hour, 6 P.M. - the visitors to the factory were Fidel Castro's militiamen. They bore word that the Government was taking over Menendez Garcia. Homecoming in Bahia Fifteen years passed before the exiled Menendezes found a place where they no longer felt like outlanders. The homecoming happened not in Cuba, but here in Bahia. ''The impression I had the first day I was here was that I was coming home,'' Benjamin Menendez remembered. ''The similarities were so great, the climate, the food, the black population, the friendliness, literally everything.'' Important for the family business were the similarities in soil, a sandy variety like that in the tobacco-growing areas of Cuba, and weather patterns, an annual period of heavy rains followed by dry months in which nutrients rise to the surface. The Menendezes started operations in Bahia in March 1976, in partnership with Mario Amerino Portugal, a Brazilian tobacco grower from whom they had been buying leaf for a decade for a business they had been running in the Canary Islands. Buying Cuban Seeds By 1978 they were marketing an all-Brazilian tobacco cigar called El Patio while banking on a more ambitious future by buying Cuban seeds that had been spirited off the island. Most labor involved in making a cigar is by hand, and townspeople had to be taught the skills, some of which are subtle and specialized. One, for instance, requires being able to differentiate between 72 shades of brown ranging from yellowish to ruddy. The development of tobacco plants takes 18 months, and only last year did the brothers have enough Cuban seed tobacco to meet their demands. They made 850,000 cigars, 300,000 of them for export, mainly to the United States. The total number was up from 692,000 in 1981, 575,000 in 1980 and 396,000 in 1979. The principal brands are El Patio, Alonso Menendez, a 100 percent Cuban tobacco cigar, and Amerino, a milder one using half Cuban leaf and half Brazilian. Short-Range Goal With the American smoker their main target, Alonso Menendez, the sales director, is being dispatched to Miami to live. He said the short-range goal was to increase United States sales to five million, or 2.5 percent of the estimated 200 million imported handmade cigars a year. Their strategy is to underprice their opposition by 10 to 15 cents to secure a market share. The long-term goal is to produce 30 million cigars a year. These world-beating plans are emerging from a modest one-story white building standing in the middle of a sheep pasture. Sao Gon,calo dos Campos, a town of 10,000 inhabitants, is 70 miles from the coastal capital city of Bahia, Salvador. Such a venture was far from any of the family members' minds when they left Havana for Miami. ''We were planning on going back. It was just a matter of time. Everyone knew about the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion,'' said Benjamin Menendez. ''After that we had to think in more permanent terms,'' said Benjamin Menendez. Though the family had only $150,000 in capital, they enjoyed a record of past performance that got them access to credit. Spanish Company Their father, Alonso, now dead, and Felix went to Spain and with the Garcia family partners began the Compania Insular Tabacalera with offices in Madrid and operations based in the Canary Islands. The new company bought Cuban tobacco from the United States, made cigars and shipped them back to America. But that idea ended abruptly when the United States imposed its embargo on trade with Cuba in February 1962. The Menendezes then turned to other sources of tobacco - the Dominican Republic, Brazil, the Cameroons, the Central African Republic and Connecticut - and worked on blends. They turned out cigars called Flamenco, Montecruz and Don Diego. Business Sold The business grew by 20 percent a year, and they couldn't keep up with demand. In 1972, Gulf and Western Industries Inc. bought out the Menendezes and Garcias for $5.1 million. Mr. Portugal and the Menendezes have established a laborious Cuban-modeled system of cigar-making here that involves transplanting seeds from special beds to open fields, careful periodic layered picking from the ground up, separate fermentation for different kinds of leaves, 50 days in drying sheds, aging in sackcloths for up to a year, blending in cedar bins, humidifying, pressing, banding, wrapping and finally freezing in the box to kill any larva. Alonso Menendez said that other Cuban exiles had planted Cuban seeds in Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. None of these operations approached the size of the undertaking here, however.

181-> Bridge: Negative Redouble Gives Point to a Nursery Rhyme
Some bridge players would do well to study the story of Simple Simon, who doggedly set out to catch a whale in his mother's pail. The moral, of course, is that if the enterprise you are considering is hopeless, something not quite hopeless should be attempted instead. In making such a decision, an opening leader is sometimes aided by a convention that has recently become popular in tournament play. It is not clear who deserves the credit for inventing it, but it was first described in print by Dr. George Rosenkranz of Mexico City. It is called a negative redouble, and occurs when an opponent has made an artificial double of an overcall. A redouble by the fourth player has no natural meaning and is used to show a top honor in the overcaller's suit. A Possible Benefit This can have a clear advantage in a negative way: The failure to redouble can serve as a warning if the overcaller becomes the opening leader. An example is the diagramed deal from the 1982 international team trials in Minneapolis. At three tables South played three no-trump. In one case, a spade was led and in another a heart, and South had no trouble. At the third table South opened one club, strong and artificial. West overcalled one spade, and North doubled; this was not a penalty double but an artificial double showing moderate strength. North's two clubs was a probing move, and Dr. Rosenkranz as West had to lead against three no-trump. He knew from his partner's failure to redouble that his opponents held both the ace and queen of spades. No Simple Simon, he did not choose to fish in a pail that would clearly produce no results. A diamond lead seemed to offer the best chance, and he came up with a whale in the shape of long, strong diamonds in his partner's hand. The diamond ace was removed, and South had to develop clubs. When he lost a trick to East, the defense continued diamonds and had five tricks for down one. NORTH (D) S 10 8 5 3 H K Q 7 3 D 9 6 C K 8 3 WEST EAST S K J 9 6 2 S 4 H 6 2 H J 9 8 4 D K 10 8 2 D Q J 5 4 3 C 6 2 C Q J 4 SOUTH S A Q 7 H A 10 5 D A 7 C A 10 9 7 5 North and South were vulnerable. The bidding: North East South West Pass Pass 1 C 1 S Dbl. Pass 1 N.T. Pass 2 C Pass 3 N.T. Pass Pass Pass West led the diamond two.

183-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Chief At Phoenix Mutual Life
The Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford changed its top management yesterday, in a scheduled move. John Gummere, 55, was named chief executive, suceeding Robert T. Jackson, 65, who is retiring after 43 years with the company. Mr. Gummere is no newcomer either. He joined Phoenix Mutual in 1949 in the actuarial department upon graduation from Yale. Phoenix Mutual Life, with $3.5 billion in assets, is the nation's 20th-largest life insurance company and has expanded into the financial service industry. The company has entered the casualty business with the purchase of New York Casualty, a company in Watertown, N.Y.; it has entered the casualty reinsurance business in New York, and it has purchased a New England regional brokerage and investment banking firm, Burgess & Leith. In addition, it has purchased some insurance agencies. Mr. Gummere said no further acquisitions were planned at this time. ''How we are going to assimilate all of this is the big question before the house,'' Mr. Gummere said.

185-> PROPOSED HALT TO DAILY BUS RUNS ALARMS DEPENDENT PEOPLE UPSTATE
The proposal by the Greyhound Bus Company to cancel its remaining two runs a day to this village on the Susquehanna River has aroused the protests of dozens of elderly people. ''I simply can't drive a car anymore; my health won't permit it,'' said Rollin Tuttle, who is 66 years old. ''If bus service were stopped, I would be dependent on someone else for transportation. It would just be another way of undercutting what little independence I have left.'' Ethia Parliman, who is 72, put it somewhat differently. ''I go to Oneonta and Albany once in a while to see the doctor or shop, but I really shouldn't drive these distances alone. The bus is of great benefit to people like me who don't want to be a burden to others.'' But it is not just the elderly who want to keep rural bus service in operation in the state. Interviews along the Greyhound route from Albany to Binghamton have found that young people whose physical impairments prohibit them from driving need bus service to get around. Rider Needs vs. Company Losses Others who are not members of two-car families take the buses from their rural homes to work in the larger communities. College students said they had no other way to travel, since they could not afford cars. To let the public be heard, the New York Department of Transportation is holding hearings on Greyhound's bid to end service to 34 small towns, such as Unadilla, Peru, Schenevus, Otego, Loon Lake, Boonville and Sidney. Henry Mitchell, the traffic director for Greyhound, told a Department of Transporation hearing in Albany early this month that his company was losing $1.1 million a year by providing service to the communities, which are mainly in the Adirondacks and central New York. Mr. Mitchell said revenues from the service were $129,000 a year, while it cost the company $1,235,000 a year to keep the buses running on the four different routes between Albany and Plattsburgh, Watertown and Utica, Binghamton and Albany, and Ithaca and Binghamton. Yet Pat Vogel, who runs the tiny bus station in Sidney, six miles west of here, insisted that the company was making money serving the 14 small towns between Albany and Binghamton. ''What I collect for tickets is classified,'' Mrs. Vogel said, ''but I can tell you it runs to four figures every month, and I know for sure that Greyhound isn't losing money by servicing this town.'' On one recent morning Mrs. Vogel sold seven tickets. Among the purchasers were Suzanne Furman, who was traveling to Binghamton to look for work; Cathy Walsh, a student who was going to visit friends in Rochester; Cheryl Benjamin, off to work at a modeling job in Binghamton, and Elizabeth Moseman, who suffers from congenital cataracts and was on her way to visit an eye specialist in Cooperstown. Two small packages also came and went out of Sidney on a bus, and such freight shipments, among them specialty bloods and medical samples for hospitals, are another feature of scheduled bus service to rural areas. The most vociferous opponent of the proposal to curtail service has been State Senator Warren M. Anderson, the Republican from nearby Binghamton, who also is Senate majority leader. Anderson Sees Hardships ''I consider this proposed elimination of service to be outrageous,'' Senator Anderson told a recent hearing. ''No one can deny that such a move would cause severe hardships for many people in rural areas who are already 'transportation disadvantaged' - that is the poor, the elderly and others who have no cars.'' The Department of Transportation has scheduled four more public hearings this month in Lowville, Keeseville, West Oneonta and Whitney Point to hear local comments. Meanwhile political and governmental groups, such as the Unadilla Village Board, are passing resolutions of protest to try to keep the buses running. But to Cecile Tuttle, who commutes from her home in a trailer park in Harpursville to Binghamton every day to work at the local Y.W.C.A., bus service is tantamount to a job. ''Take the bus away and I can't work, because I can't afford a car,'' she said. ''If I don't work, I'd have to ask for some kind of public assistance, and asking for handouts is the last thing in the world I want to do.''

188-> REAGAN EMPHASIZES 'GOOD NEWS' IN TALK ON ECONOMIC DATA
President Reagan said today that the sharp decline in unemployment in July, combined with other economic developments, indicate ''things are looking up for America.'' Mr. Reagaan, in a radio address from his retreat at Camp David, Md., discussed recent economic news, which included a 9.3 overall unemployment rate in July and a 9.5 civilian jobless rate. With inflation down to 2.6 percent on an annual basis, economic growth placed at 8.7 percent in the April-to- June quarter and the unemployment decline in July, he said, ''Things are looking up.'' ''This good news restores confidence in our economy and our currency,'' he declared. The President devoted his radio address to international trade. He said barriers to free trade increased international tensions. At the Williamsburg summit of the Western industrialized nations, he went on, America and its major partners pledged to continue working for a more open trading system. He did not mention hunger in America, the subject that House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, discussed in a Democratic response. Speaker O'Neill, in remarks taped in advance, said that if Mr. Reagan was serious about fighting hunger in America, he could begin by dropping his call for reductions in nutrition programs. ''The sad fact is that we have not been fair in providing food and shelter to those who need it,'' Mr. O'Neill said. On Tuesday, Mr. Reagan announced formation of a White House group to study hunger. The next day the Department of Agriculture announced plans to increase the amount of surplus cheese and other food the Government will distribute to the needy.

189-> NUMISMATICS; THE ANA IN SAN DIEGO
The 92nd anniversary convention of the American Numismatic Association opens Tuesday in San Diego. This will be the year's biggest coin show with attendance expected to exceed 10,000. The ANA convention has traditionally served as a numismatic weathervane, reflecting not only the current state of the coin market, but also its direction. Many collectors and dealers look forward to this show with special interest. They hope it will reinforce the market recovery now under way and possibly cause it to accelerate. Nearly 300 dealers will have tables at the San Diego bourse. The show will also feature dozens of exhibits, numerous meetings of specialized numismatic groups, an educational forum, special activities for junior collectors and a five-session auction with 4,800 lots. The auction will be conducted by Kagin's Numismatic Auctions of Des Moines, Iowa and will offer a wide variety of United States coins and currency plus smaller selections of world coins and currency. One of its most interesting and most valuable segments is a grouping that includes nearly 200 territorial gold pieces. Among them is a brilliant proof 1855 Kellogg & Co. $50 round, described by the catalogue as ''The King of Private Gold Coinage.'' Also of special interest is a choice uncirculated 1850 Baldwin & Company $10 gold piece, whose design depicts a ''vaquero'' or horseman. This is said to be the finest known example. The auction catalogue may become a collectible. Its cover carries a drawing by well-known artist Peter Max. Entitled ''Liberty Lady,'' the colored-pencil drawing is the artist's interpretation of the much-admired portrait of Miss Liberty on the Peace dollar. To obtain a copy of the catalogue plus a post-sale list of prices realized, send $15 to Kagin's Numismatic Auctions, 1000 Insurance Exchange Building, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. In keeping with long tradition, the ANA is issuing a convention medal. This year's medal was designed by William T. Fell, a member of the San Diego County Inter-Club Numismatic Council, host for the show. Its obverse portrays the California Tower and State Building which were erected for the 1935 San Diego-California-Pacific Exposition. Its reverse depicts the San Diego-Coronado Bridge with an aircraft carrier below. Sculptress Barbara Hyde prepared the plaster models using Mr. Fell's design. The medal was struck by Medallic Art Company of Danbury, Conn. It is available in bronze and silver versions. A 1 1/4-inch example in bronze has been incorporated into an official convention badge and is priced at $6.75. A two-medal set, including bronze and silver versions in the 1 1/4-inch size, is priced at $35. And a larger bronze example, 2 1/4 inches in diameter, is priced at $20. To obtain these by mail, send orders to the American Numismatic Association, P.O. Box 2366, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80901. Add $1 in postage and handling fees for the badge, $3 for the two-medal set and $2.50 for the larger bronze medal. The convention will take place at the Town & Country Hotel in San Diego. It is open to the public and admission is free. The bourse will be open from noon to 7 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and from noon to 5 P.M. Saturday. Souvenir Card The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing is offering a souvenir card in conjunction the American Numismatic Association convention. The card depicts the reverse of a Series 1915 $20 Federal Reserve Bank Note which highlights transportation modes of the pre-World War I era. The card was printed on a combination of one-color offset and one-color intaglio presses. Convention-goers can purchase the card for $4 at the BEP exhibit. Starting Tuesday, it also will be available by mail or over the counter at the BEP Visitor Center in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday, the U.S. Postal Service will set up a temporary post office at the visitor center and provide a special first-day cancellation. The card is priced at $5 by mail with a discount of 50 cents per card for bulk orders of 10 or more. The price is $4 at the visitor center, located at 14th and C Streets SW in Washington. The bureau will offer mail order customers a limited number of cards with a first-day cancellation for $5.50 each. Send orders to ANA '83, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. 20228. Include a check or money order payable to the BEP. Allow 90 days for delivery. Assay Office Sold The U.S. Assay Office building in Lower Manhattan has been sold to a New York real estate developer for approximately $27 million. The purchaser, HRO International Ltd., plans to erect a skyscraper on the site. The Assay Office, at 32 Old Slip near the Wall Street financial district, served as a repository for Federal stocks of gold. It also was the nation's last public gold refinery. The U.S. Mint closed it last year as part of an economy drive. HRO International acquired it in July at an auction conducted by the General Services Administration. Record Price A 1927-D Saint-Gaudens double eagle has been sold privately by Manfra, Tordella & Brookes Inc. of New York for $290,000. This is believed to be the highest price ever paid for this U.S. gold rarity, one of only 10 to 12 examples known. The company identified the purchaser as Dr. William Crawford, a prominent Midwestern collector. This particular '27-D double eagle is the same piece that changed hands last October at the New York public auction sale of the United States Gold Coin Collection. It brought $160,000 at that sale which encompassed the gold portion of the famous Louis Eliasberg Collection. Jewish Museum The Jewish Museum, a New York City institution operated under the auspices of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, has published a catalogue listing and illustrating highlights from its numismatic collection. Titled ''Coins Reveal,'' the catalogue is intended to serve as a guide to the permanent coin exhibit at the museum. The soft-cover 84-page volume contains high-quality photographs of 235 coins and medals along with descriptive notes. It also includes a text on the history of Jewish and Israeli coinage. The catalogue was prepared by Yaakov Meshorer, guest curator. The Jewish Museum is located at 1109 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It is open to the public from Sunday through Thursday, with a small admission fee required at most times. In addition to coins, its permanent collection includes numerous other items relating to Jewish history. ''Coins Reveal'' is intended as the first in a series of catalogues detailing all aspects of the collection. The catalogue is priced at $6.95, with an additional charge of $1.50 for mail orders to cover the costs of postage and handling. New York State residents should include sales tax. Send orders to The Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10028. Lincoln Cent Book Dr. Sol Taylor, a well-known numismatic researcher, lecturer and author, has written and published a new book called ''The Standard Guide to the Lincoln Cent.'' The 150-page volume contains a wealth of information on the strike characteristics, relative availability and other aspects of every Lincoln cent from 1909 to the present. It also provides insights, based on the author's research, that will be of interest and value to collectors as well as investors. The book is available in hardbound and soft-cover, priced at $15.95 and $9.95. Send orders to Sol Taylor, P.O. Box 5465, North Hollywood, Calif. 91616.

190-> SHAPING UP THE WATERFRONT COMMISSION
Thirty years ago this week, the Rev. John M. Corridan's ship finally came in. After his long crusade against corruption on the docks, President Eisenhower agreed to create the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. Father Corridan, the ''waterfront priest'' whose role was loosely chronicled in ''On the Waterfront,'' the movie starring Marlon Brando that graphically dramatized life on the piers, lives in a Rockland County retirement home now. When he visited some former colleagues in Manhattan last year, he recalled, current conditions on the docks were barely discussed. ''I'm sure if anything of consequence were going on,'' he said, ''somebody would have gotten in touch with me.'' In truth, there are those who wonder if the commission he fought for has outlived its usefulness. Is it plagued, like the waterfront itself, by a surplus of labor and, perhaps, a lack of business? Has it become a watchdog that goes through the motions of barking but has lost its will to bite? The commission was created after revelations that the piers were awash with union racketeering, pilferage and gangster leaders of ''pistol locals,'' who routinely extorted kickbacks from longshoremen in return for jobs. Over the past 30 years, the number of longshoremen employed on the docks of New York and New Jersey has declined from more than 40,000 to fewer than 10,000. In 1966, a guaranteed annual income for longshoremen combined with the reduced labor surplus brought job stability and virtually stripped union bosses of their power to award work to the rank and file. The commission employed 239 people that year and had a budget of $2.8 million. By last year, the payroll had shrunk to 171 but the budget more than doubled to $6.2 million. It is the commission's role as an employment supervisor, rather than its policing power, that has generated the most agitation for change. The agency is empowered to register and license longshoremen, cargo checkers, dock guards, pier superintendents, hiring agents and stevedore firms, to bar those with serious criminal convictions and to balance the supply and demand for labor by controlling the number of dockworkers. Since 700 longshoremen were added to fill vacancies in some locals in 1979, the register has been virtually closed. The commission's proposal to fill a shortage of checkers who take inventory on the docks with idle longshoremen was opposed both by union and management in what the agency termed ''a power play to coerce the commission into doing their bidding.'' ''Unions are never reluctant to increase their membership,'' said Nicholas Scoppetta, New York's commission member. ''But when you have one-third of the people unemployed on any day, it seemed to us more economical to put them to work instead of paying them for work not done.'' Today the commission operates four hiring halls where dockworkers perform a daily computerized ritual in sharp contrast with the violent shape- ups common before they were guaranteed an annual income - more than $29,000, regardless of whether they work - to protect them from automation. Of more than 2,800 who ''badged in'' one recent morning, only 99 were hired. Legislation that would allow longshoremen to badge in by telephone has languished in Albany. The commission says it wants to run any such system for one year to close whatever loopholes may exist; union and management say the agency really wants to preserve the jobs of its own employees. The commission's skepticism appears to be understandable, even though proven reports of abuse seem isolated. In recent years, for instance, it found that while they were ''badged in'' at local hiring halls, one longshoreman was working on the Florida docks and another was serving time in a Federal prison. Officials also recall that within the last five years more than 30 union leaders were convicted of labor racketeering and other crimes which, the commission concluded, ''could hardly demonstrate (the union's) fitness and responsibility'' to supervise hiring. ''The roll call of recent convictions of International Longshoremen's Association and management officials for waterfront corruption clearly demonstrates the need for the Waterfront Commission,'' said Leonard Newman, its executive director. But while the commission cooperated, it played only a bit part in the snaring of what Federal officials considered their prize catch: Anthony Scotto, the politically connected longshore leader who was found guilty of receiving more than $200,000 from waterfront firms to reduce worker compensation claims and get them business. The commission fined one of the firms involved $135,000 and, in effect, barred a director of the parent company from the docks. But the commission was red-faced when it was alleged that one of its special agents had asked Mr. Scotto, of all people, to help him win a promotion. The agent was later fired. Yet, says Nick N. Cretan, executive director of the Maritime Association, which represents shipping lines and labor, ''you don't have the 'Marlon Brando' situations happening any more.'' Indeed, some believe that dockworkers who were once routinely victimized by their union may now be overprotected by the annual income and other benefits. Officers in one depleted local were said to have returned to the rank and file to be eligible to collect the guaranteed checks. ''After 30 years,'' said Assemblyman Joseph Ferris of Brooklyn, ''the Waterfront Commission should begin to allow labor and management to conduct their own affairs.'' But Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell of the Bronx termed it ''indispensible.'' And Mr. Scoppetta said that because ''the Shipping Association ends up joining with the I.L.A,'' there is ''a continuing supervisory role'' for the agency Father Corridan helped found. There is general agreement, though, that as it marks its anniversary on Friday the commission presides over a port that is once more suffering, this time from a transportation price war and labor costs that threaten to make it even less competitive. Mr. Koppell's legislative committee plans to address these problems after hearings in the fall, and negotiators return to the bargaining table to resolve a contract expiring next month. While the Waterfront Commission may be able to patch the wounds, the cures for what now ails the Port of New York appear to lie elsewhere.

193-> The Comforting Cookie
One of the most famous cookies in Western literature is that mix of butter, flour, sugar and eggs memorialized by one Marcel Proust. Change the proportions, add a few chunks of chocolate and some chopped nuts and you also have the most famous cookie in American life. Invented in the heart of the Depression, the chocolate chip cookie was a cookie whose time had come. The nuts thrilled the teeth and tastebuds while the phenylethylamine in the chocolate delighted (some say) the psyche. The sugar hinted deliciously of sin, while the eggs and butter were a happy reminder of the farm. Though its discovery, in other words, was accidental, one could not have set out to design a more comforting cookie. How expandable is this market for solace? We are about to find out. Though Manhattan streets are already awash in chocolate chip cookies, a West Coast cookie chain is betting a lot of dough on New Yorkers' infinite need for its special brand of comfort. By spring it expects to have 20 stores in the area. Mr. Proust would have been pleased. ''An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses....'' he wrote. ''And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory.... I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy?'' It came, he told us 600 words later, from his cookie.

This information might lead those unfamiliar with the Hays Theater to believe that it was lying dormant and ill-used until the Nassau Repertory Theater came along, as evidenced by several statements in the article ''Nassau Rep Finds New Home'' (July 24). To the contrary, the Hays Theater has just completed another full year of presenting a diversified program in drama, dance, music and lecturers by distinguished professional companies, performers and accomplished faculty members with international status as artists. In addition to these programs open to the public, the theater hosted a full schedule of professional conferences related to many of our academic disciplines. We have also continued making the theater and its staff available for community productions throughout the year. It is unfortunate that Larry Egan was not aware of this extensive schedule when he understated past use of the Hays Theater. The Hays Theater was designed to accommodate a variety of flexible staging formats and has the capacity to comfortably seat 420 depending on the staging format. When the Nassau Rep is using the facility, it has called for the seating plan to accommodate 298. For college programs, the standard capacity last year was 370. For the coming year, the Hays Theater has another extensive program planned to encompass all the performing arts as well as to serve as a forum for relevant social issues that shall be addressed by key speakers as well as through our year-long film festival. As always, all events are open to the public and details are announced in the theater's monthly newsletter, which is mailed to patrons at no charge - all of this with or without the Nassau Repertory Theater on campus.

196-> DR. CLARK CALLED 'SELFLESS PIONEER'
Dr. Barney B. Clark, the artificial heart recipient, was eulogized before 1,300 mourners today as a seemingly ordinary man who became ''a selfless pioneer.'' ''To a world increasingly filled with hopelessness and despair, he stood quietly and resolutely for an entirely different view of life,'' Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Mormon Church's Council of the Twelve Apostles said of Dr. Clark. ''His impact was immense, greater then he could possibly know.'' The 62-year-old Dr. Clark died Wednesday, his 112th day of life as the first man with a permanent artificial heart. At his death, his doctors praised him as a ''hero and winner'' determined to prove the device would work in people. 'Did Extraordinary Things' Elder Maxwell said that while a funeral was a time to mourn, it was also a time celebrate the life of a special man. ''On the surface, Barney Clark may have seemed quite ordinary, but he did extraordinary things,'' he said. Dr. Clark's body, in a wooden coffin draped with yellow roses and carnations, was wheeled slowly into the chapel as the service began at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Federal Way Stake Center in this suburb about 20 miles south of Seattle. His wife, Una Loy, entered on the arm of her son Stephen and smiled and winked at a family friend. His daughter, Karen Shaffer, cried softly. Other family members, including another son, Gary, and five grandchildren, walked behind. Also following the coffin were some of the doctors from the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City who had treated Dr. Clark. They included Dr. Willem Kolff, director of the university's Division of Artificial Organs; Dr. William C. DeVries, the surgeon who implanted the polyurethane heart last Dec. 2; Dr. Lyle Joyce, an assisting surgeon, and Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, inventor of the air-driven heart. Nominee Represents President William D. Ruckelshaus of nearby Medina, the nominee to head the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, represented President Reagan at the funeral. C. Terry Graff, president of the Federal Way Stake, said the President had earlier told Mrs. Clark by telephone that ''Barney was a very courageous man,'' and added, ''Barney and you and your family have been in Nancy and my prayers.'' After the hour-long service, a funeral procession of about 150 cars wound its way to Washington Memorial Park in Federal Way, where Dr. Clark was entombed in a polished granite and concrete mausoleum. About 200 people attended the short ceremony at the cemetery. In Salt Lake City, John Dwan, a medical center spokesman, said hundreds of cards, letters and telegrams were arriving for the Clarks. The mood at the hospital, while still subdued, was returning to normal, Mr. Dwan said. ''The work of the hospital goes on,'' he said. ''The mood of the hospital is, 'We still have other patients to care for.'''

197-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; RATH'S NEW LEADER UP FROM THE RANKS
Lyle Taylor was elected president of the Rath Packing Company of Waterloo, Iowa, at its annual meeting last week. Unlike the prototypical chief executive officer, Mr. Taylor does not hold an M.B.A. degree from a prestigious business school - or from any other. Nor did he graduate from college. But he knows, from firsthand experience, virtually every aspect of his company's business. Mr. Taylor, 48 years old, came up through the ranks. He joined Rath in 1953. He worked as a butcher and in many other assignments. Mr. Taylor was also active in union affairs. In 1968 he became president of Local 46 of the United Food and Commercial Workers. In moving from vice president to president, Mr. Taylor replaces Herbert S. Epstein. Mr. Taylor faces a formidable task. In Rath's fiscal year ended last Oct. 31, the employee-owned company had a loss of $6.5 million on sales of $434.7 million. It is still operating in the red. According to William Foote Whyte, professor emeritus of industrial relations and sociology at Cornell University, who has studied Rath for several years, working capital is a major problem. The company has to pay for hogs in cash, but after processing and shipping it must wait 60 to 90 days before receiving payment from its customers. ''This has been a constant drain,'' Professor Whyte says, ''that has obliged the company to borrow at interest rates as high as 4 1/2 points over prime.'' Rath's workers voted last month, by a 4-to-1 ratio, to accept a $2.50 wage deferral for the rest of the year. ''No other company has a profit-sharing plan like ours,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''But part of it involves deferring wages, when necessary, to enable capital improvements that will yield profits to employees later on.'' Security analysts are not optimistic about Rath's prospects. ''They're losing money right and left,'' one of them said. In Waterloo, however, Mr. Taylor is known for helping save the company once before. He and a union colleague, Charles Mueller, engineered an employee stock ownership plan after an eight-year loss totaling $23 million. Beginning in June 1980, their plan shifted control of Rath to its 2,500 employees. Over a two-year period, payroll deductions of $20 a week provided them with 60 percent of the stock, some 1.8 million shares, purchased at $2 a share. The plan's key feature is a mechanism to keep control in the workers' hands. ''Our studies made clear,'' Professor Whyte said, ''that employees soon lose majority ownership with conventional ESOP plans.'' So Mr. Taylor persuaded two professors at Cornell's School of Industrial Labor Relations - Tove Hammer and Robert Stern - to help Rath's workers avoid this pitfall. Rath now has an employeeownership trust. Workers cannot easily sell their stock, and when they quit or retire the company has right of first refusal. ''I've been in training for the position for the past few years,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''There's no doubt that it will be a great challenge. But I'm not troubled by pessimism, which is what I heard in 1978 when we began working on the ESOP proposal. And we're still here. If I have my way, we'll be here a lot longer.''

198-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Borg's Tour Predictions
Now that Bjorn Borg has decided to call it quits, what looms ahead for 1983 on the men's tennis tour? Last week, Borg gave these assessments of the top players: John McEnroe - ''I think it's going to be McEnroe and Ivan Lendl at the top. John has a good chance to win Wimbledon. Last year he had a few problems, he had some injuries, didn't play for a while and maybe lost his confidence. I think maybe he felt a lot of pressure, too. He was ranked No. 1, and a lot of people expected a lot of things from him.'' Ivan Lendl - ''He's going to win at least one Grand Slam event this year. I would say the U.S. Open. If he plays well, he's got a good chance to win Roland Garros (the French Open) too.'' Jimmy Connors - ''He had an unbelievable year last year. This year, it depends on how much effort he wants to put into his game. He could win Wimbledon and the U.S. Open this year, but I don't think so.'' Guillermo Vilas - ''He had a good year last year. He's been very consistent for so many years. The tournaments for him to do well is the clay-court events. If he works hard, he can still win Roland Garros.'' Mats Wilander - ''I was very surprised he came through and won the French. He proved himself last year that he's a great player. But he still has to prove that he can play as good on a faster surface. He has time to improve, though.''

199-> COW MANURE FUELING POWER SYSTEM
A bitter north wind rattled the door of the large shed on, Robert Foster's farm, the largest dairy farm in the Champlain Valley. But inside, Mr. Foster's generator made the shed a virtual steambath. The fuel running the generator was methane gas, and the electricity it produced ran into the lines of the local power company, which pays Mr. Foster for the electricity he generates. The methane was a product of Mr. Foster's cows, or more precisely, the cows' manure. The Foster Brothers Farm has become one of a handful of operations employing a waste-management technique called ''methane digestion.'' The digester device transforms manure, the handling of which always has been a difficult farm chore, into a variety of useful components, only one of which is methane gas. Calls It 'Old Technology' ''It's not a new technology,'' said Mr. Foster. ''It's an old technology. We're just applying it.'' It takes nine families, including seven Foster families, to work this 1,900-acre, 600-cow farm. The Fosters have kept their operation abreast of the latest techniques in dairying, an occupation growing ever more tenuous in an era of huge national surpluses of dairy products and Federal efforts to reduce price supports. Robert Foster has grown accustomed to answering inquiries since last spring when he installed the methane digester, one of only several dozen commercial units in the nation, and most of the attention has focused on electrical generation. Federal and state laws oblige power companies to purchase electricity from small, alternative producers. The Foster farm's income from ''cow power,'' as the generation system has become known informally, has averaged about $100 a day. But electrical generation is only the most visible aspect of the methane digester. ''It's not just generating electricity and providing cash-flow,'' said Mr. Foster. ''It's a total waste-management system for the farm.'' Fertilizer Another Product The digester works much like an animal's own digestion system, breaking down its ''food'' into products the Fosters can use on the farm, methane gas, liquid fertilizer and solids. Microbes in the manure itself, which is processed without air, or anaerobically, are the catalyst in the decomposition. The liquid fertilizer is pumped into a small reservoir in the middle of the farm, to be sprayed later on the fields. Dairy farmers commonly spread untreated manure on their fields, a practice that can cause pollution problems because spring rains wash much of the matter into streams. Mr. Foster said he could fertilize his fields more efficiently with the liquid, which retains its nutritive value. ''If we can store and apply it at a time when the plants can most readily use it, we get better use of the fertilizer,'' he said. Moreover, as several neighbors said, the process almost eliminates the odor accompanying untreated manure. Mr. Foster uses the solids, which have the consistency of crumbly cake, as stall ''bedding'' for his cows. Traditional bedding material has been sawdust, an expensive commodity now in short supply because of the downturn in the lumber business. The methane gas, of course, powers the generator. And the engine produces excess heat. Mr. Foster said the obvious thing to do with the surplus heat was to warm a winter greenhouse and grow food yearround, just another way to boost the farm's overall efficiency, he said. ''The Fosters are truly pioneers,'' said Rod Martin, director of farming research and development at Agway Inc., a Syracuse-based farm-supply company that plans to market a digester of its own. But Mr. Martin said methane digesters were no panacea for most hardpressed dairy farmers, because the equipment was expensive and the technology was not mature. George Casler, professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University, which operates a digester on the university-owned farm, went further. ''It seems to me that the only thing that makes it feasible is the quirk in the law that says power companies have to buy the electricity,'' he said. Yet officials at Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, the utility that serves the Foster farm and buys the power, said they were pleased with the arrangement because the Foster operation represented local, reliable power supplied when the utility needed it most. The company that built Mr. Foster's system, Hadley & Bennett, a New Hampshire company, is busy signing up several dozen nearby Addison County dairy farmers in a pilot project using a centralized digester. To succeed, the company will need farmers with a total of 5,500 cows. Spencer Bennett, a partner in Hadley & Bennett and Vermont Biogas, a local business entity founded to operate the project, said the company was more than halfway toward its goal. In the centralized operation, Vermont Bio-gas will collect the manure from the farmers, bring it to the central digester and return the liquid fertilizer to the farmers. Vermont Bio-gas would sellpower to the utility and the solids wherever possible. While Mr. Foster produces about 150 kilowatts of electricity a few hours each day, the central system would produce 1,000 kilowatts around the clock, the company said. When the project was first announced, George Dunsmore, Vermont's Secretary of Agriculture, called it the sort of Yankee innovation that would help save the dairy industry.

200-> Carte Vermeil
To the Editor: In connection with the letter from A. M. Fraade (Travel, July 31) regarding the carte vermeil, or rail pass for elderly persons in France, I would like to find out where the card can be purchased in France and whether it is available in the United States. ALFRED M. KNOPF JR. New York Dag Scher, assistant general manager in the United States for the French National Railroads, said: The carte vermeil, entitling women over 60 and men over 62 to purchase rail tickets at half-fare, is not available in the United States but can be bought at any rail station in France. The card is good for one year and costs about $7. It is valid for travel anywhere in France (and where reciprocity agreements are in effect, even in some foreign countries, such as West Germany), but there are certain restrictions covering travel on weekends and holidays.

202-> HOUSE WRANGLING ON BUDGET HITS HIGH GEAR
The 1983 budget battle moved into high gear today as the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., and the Republican minority exchanged harsh accusations. With the House scheduled to vote Wednesday on a Democratic budget that has the personal support of Mr. O'Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat, both sides vied for the 51 Democratic votes the Republicans must get to send that budget back to committee. The day was filled with rhetorical dueling and maneuvering for parliamentary advantage on the House floor, and these were the main developments: - The House Rules Committee acted to forestall selective budget amendments, which the Republicans had sought, but said it would allow them to offer an entire, substitute budget. Republican leaders said they were unsure whether they would do so, because some believe more Democrats will defect in a vote if there is no Republican budget against which they might rally. - Mr. O'Neill said the attack by President Reagan on the budget approved last week by the Democratic majority on the House Budget Committee, which James R. Jones of Oklahoma heads, ''reminds me of the early 50's,'' a period in which ''a lot of people were seing Communists under every bed.'' Mr. O'Neill said Mr. Reagan sought ''to derail the budget process.'' - Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip, said on the floor: ''If a camel is a horse designed by a committee, then the Jones budget resolution is a fiscal camel produced by the House Democratic caucus. And that bulging hump in the middle is the whopping tax increase that King Caucus would lay on American workers.'' The Democratic budget calls for tax increases totaling $30 billion in the fiscal year 1984, which starts next Oct. 1; $40 billion in 1985, and $50 billion in 1986. - Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan denounced the Democrats' plan as ''an irresponsible blueprint for higher taxes and more spending which would, if adopted, abort the economic recovery.'' He asserted that ''the massive tax increases'' proposed by the Democrats ''could only be accomplished'' by repeal of the 10 percent tax cut scheduled for July 1 and of the ''indexing,'' or automatic adjustment of income brackets for inflation, scheduled to start in 1985. - About two dozen legislators who are members of the Conservative Democratic Forum and who supported Mr. Reagan's budgets in 1981 and 1982, drafted a budget of their own that provides for a larger increase in military spending and a smaller tax rise than are proposed in the Democratic budget. However, the Rules Committee rebuffed their request to be allowed to offer their ''Democratic alternative'' as a substitute for the committee's budget. Big Majority for Democrats The Democrats have 268 seats to the Republicans' 166, giving them a comfortable margin, even though Representative Gillis W. Long of Louisiana, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, said he expected 32 or 33 Democrats to defect. At the White House, the deputy press secretary, Larry M. Speakes, said: ''We know it's going to be an uphill battle. It's probably the toughest yet, as far as budget proposals, for us. We believe it's doable, but it's going to be difficult.'' A handful of southern Democrats called on Mr. O'Neill today to tell him they would not support him. Representative Buddy Roemer of Louisiana said afterward that Mr. O'Neill had commented that the budget likely to emerge from a House-Senate conference would be close to what the conservatives wanted. Mr. Roemer quoted Mr. O'Neill as saying he wanted all Democrats to support the House Budget Committee's plan but that ''we were free to vote on principles or politics.'' Mr. Roemer said he told the Speaker he would vote against the O'Neill-Jones budget proposal. He said the Speaker said he knew ''that such things happen in these votes and he grimaced and said he didn't like it.'' Republicans have said privately for some time that they do not want to support President Reagan's budget. One reason given is that many feel Mr. Reagan's proposed increase in military spending, 10 percent in addition to a 4 percent rise for inflation, is excessive. The O'Neill-Jones budget calls for a 4 percent rise in military spending. Mr. Roemer told the Rules Committee the conservative Democratic alternative called for a 7 percent rise, with tax increases of $10 billion in 1984, $20 billion in 1985 and $40 billion in 1986. The absence of a Republican alternative was acknowledged by Representative Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican. Mr. Gramm, who as a Democrat led Democratic support for Reagan budgets in 1981-82, today asked the Rules Committee to allow 15 Republican amendments on taxes, military spending and health, among other areas. Mr. Long, a mischievous gleam in his eye, asked Mr. Gramm, ''Is anybody going to offer the President's proposed budget?'' Mr. Gramm left that open as a possibility but spent most of his time arguing that since the Democratic budget was published last Wednesday there has been too little time to bring it to the public's attention. ''I don't think this budget would have any chance of passing if the general public knew what was in it,'' he said.

203-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS;
The recent elimination of the yacht Defender from the America's Cup trials off Newport, R.I., came as no surprise to Joel Richards. Mr. Richards is the 23-year-old grillman at Gary's Handy Lunch, a luncheonette off the beaten tourist path that is a favorite hangout for the 12-Meter crews. Mr. Richards tries to give his menu an appropriate flavor. For example, in the last America's Cup campaign in 1980, he created the Freedom Burger in honor of Freedom, the American yacht that successfully defended the cup; it is a double burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, onions and mayonnaise. When Dennis Conner, helmsman for the Freedom Campaign syndicate, chose Liberty over Freedom for the current cup defense, Mr. Richards did not change the name of the burger; the syndicate name still is Freedom, he said, and, besides, ''it's become a classic.'' The crew of Courageous, which is competing against Liberty for the defender's role, ''comes in here all the time and everyone orders the Freedom Burger,'' says Mr. Richards. ''They all love it.'' Mr. Richards was weeks ahead of the America's Cup Committee of the New York Yacht Club in evaluating Defender. He created the Defender Dog: a chili cheese dog with mustard and onions. ''It gives you heartburn,'' Mr. Richards explained. The Defender Dog now has been eliminated from the menu. Another specialty is the Victory Platter. Members of the crew for the British yacht Victory '83 arrive every morning at 7 A.M. when the luncheonette opens. But Mr. Richards was relucant to divulge his culinary creation for Australia II, the yacht with the controversial winged keel that has been kept hidden from view. ''It's a secret,'' Mr. Richards said. ''I cannot unveil it yet. But I can tell you it will be served in a brown paper bag and probably include something hot.''

205-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; BUSINESS AIDE WINS SUIT AGAINST MURCHISON
Stanley L. Neeley had his day in court, and he won - against Clint W. Murchison Jr., the Texas financier. Last week a Federal District Court jury in Dallas awarded Mr. Neeley $3.3 million. Mr. Neeley, 47, now a business consultant in Washington, was president of Optimum Systems Inc. from 1974 to 1979. The company did computer analyses for private business and the Government. It was 85 percent owned by a trust set up for the Murchison family children. Because the company was privately owned, with no public trading of its stock, a formula was devised to set a value for the stock. Mr. Neeley and William R. Roach, executive vice president, had agreements in which they could sell their shares back to the trust at a price keyed to the value of the company, which varied from year to year depending on its profitability. Peter J. Messitte, a Chevy Chase, Md., lawyer who was Mr. Neeley's principal counsel, described the background of the case. As Optimum Systems neared the end of its fiscal year on July 31, 1977, he said, it was apparent that the company was having a banner year. It had just finished work on a big contract for the Environmental Protection Agency. At that point Mr. Neeley and Mr. Roche gave notice that they wished to exercise their ''put'' option and sell their stock back to the trust. Mr. Neeley would have realized $683,000 on the deal, Mr. Messitte said. Then Mr. Murchison, according to Mr. Messitte, dissuaded them with a promise of a better deal later, an immediate loan of $350,000 to each man and a review of their salary and bonus arrangements. Except for the loans, little came to pass, Mr. Messitte said. In 1979 Mr. Neeley resigned. Mr. Roche settled out of court, but Mr. Neeley forged ahead, finally winning the jury award last week. Mr. Murchison is expected to appeal. The jury found, Mr. Messitte said, that Mr. Murchison had defrauded Mr. Neeley and on that count awarded the plaintiff $300,156. It also levied $750,000 in punitive damages. The jury ruled against Mr. Murchison as an individual. The rest of the award was accounted for by Mr. Neeley's claims of losses arising from the situation. ''I'm very pleased,'' Mr. Neeley said of the outcome. ''Obviously I had some trepidation about going down there and having to take the bear on in his own den.''

206-> Music Noted in Brief; Beethoven Society Offers Missa Solemnis
Given its standing as one of the unquestioned masterworks of the choral repertory, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis is all too rarely heard in the concert hall. On Saturday afternoon, the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the Cornell Choir and a vocal quartet consisting of the soprano Lorna Haywood, the alto Jan De Gaetani, the tenor Seth McCoy and the baritone David Arnold teamed up for a bristling performance at Alice Tully Hall, under the auspices of the Beethoven Society. Miss De Gaetani was the most impressive of the four soloists, her regal voice ringing with warm empathy. Mr. McCoy sounded strained, while Miss Haywood's operatic approach was somewhat out of place. On the other hand, Mr. Arnold's smooth command and rich tone seemed just right, and the Cornell Choir made an exuberant and focused contribution. The conception of the conductor, Murry Sidlin, was marked by an irresistible spiritual propulsion, tempered with an actor's timing. Despite some ragged ensemble playing, there was a coiled tension to the afternoon that made for an overwhelmingly positive final impression. The Beethoven Society provided full texts, copious program notes and a preconcert lecture.

207-> PRICE WINS SERIES BY 4 AS NICKLAUS IS 2D
Now Nick Price can forget his collapse in the 1982 British Open. The 26-year-old South African, a rookie on the PGA Tour, won his first American event today in a style that any professional golfer would be glad to emulate: four rounds in the 60's over the long and difficult Firestone Country Club, and a final round that included no bogeys. And in doing so, Price beat 41 of the world's best, including Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Raymond Floyd and Johnny Miller, to win the World Series of Golf. Price kept his poise and concentration and he refused to let himself be bothered by his memories of losing the British Open at Troon, Scotland, last year. With a three-stroke lead, he dropped four shots in the last six holes to give that championship to Watson. He acknowleged that that experience was on his mind, but he said he did not let it distract him. Led Start to Finish ''After the Open experience,'' Price said, ''I was happy to win the way I did, with no bogeys. I didn't choke. I proved my game is solid enough to withstand a lot of pressure.'' Price became the first winner to lead this championship from start to finish, with scores of 66, 68, 69, 67-270. That score, 10 under par for 72 holes on the par-70 course, gave him a four- stroke margin over Nicklaus, who challenged with a final-round 65. This was Nicklaus's third consecutive runner-up finish this year. Miller placed third with 67-275, while four players tied for fourth: Watson on a 65, Floyd and Mark McCumber with 69's, and Hale Irwin with a 71. The World Series of Golf is open to winners of the major championships and of PGA Tour events; the 15 leaders of the tour's money list; leaders of the Order of Merit rating systems of Europe, Japan, South Africa, Australia and Asia, and a few others. Wins 10-Year Exemption Price earned his American card in the tour's qualifying tournament last November. He spent January and February playing the South African tour, and his leading the Order of Merit there qualified him for the World Series. He joined the American tour in March. His best finishes had been ties for ninth in the Kemper Open and 16th in the Atlanta Classic. Price's victory carried a prize of $100,000 and a 10-year exemption for all PGA Tour events. The purse does not count toward his ''official'' tour winnings, since he qualified for the World Series not from the American tour but as the points leader in South Africa. His American winnings continue to stand at $28,828 for 117th place. ''The exemption is everything; the money is icing on the cake,'' said Price. ''I came here struggling to make the top-125 money list. Last Monday, I wasn't thinking about winning. I just wanted to play solidly again so I could go back to the tour to make the top 125. ''I've been pushing myself hard, 24 tournaments in 29 weeks, and I was golfed out until I took off two weeks to relax, fishing and sunning beside the swimming pool.'' Stuck to His Game Plan Price's home is in Johannesburg. When he is in the United States he bases himself at a resort in Haines City, Fla. Price, a conservative player, stuck with his game plan, which was to hit the fairways and to hit approaches to the fat, or safe part, of every green. Today's round was impeccable, with three birdies and three saves. On the front side, he missed two greens and saved par with chips. He caught a greenside bunker on the 15th but blasted out to two feet. Price started the round at seven under par, two shots in front of Irwin. He birdied the par-5 second by getting home in two with a 1-iron. On the par- 3 seventh, where he pulled his tee shot, he sank a putt of 60 feet. He carded his last birdie at the 10th with an 8-foot putt.

208-> NETS TOP SIXERS
For most of this season, the distance between the Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers has been vast. And it hasn't been measured by just victories and defeats, but by the respect that a team has earned for its reputation as a contender. That gap was slimmed a bit this afternoon as the Nets, leading throughout the second half, survived a last-period rally by the 76ers and came away with a 112-106 triumph before a national television audience and 20,149 spectators at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. It was their second sellout of the season. The victory was the Nets' first over the 76ers in three meetings this season. And it raised their record to 38-22, third in the Atlantic Division but still 12 1/2 games behind the 76ers. ''This showed someone that we can beat them,'' said the Nets' Len Elmore. ''And for the playoffs, that's important.'' For the 76ers, it marked only the first time this year they've lost consecutive games. No team has ever gone a full season without losing back-to-back contests. After losing to the Celtics on Friday and the Nets today, the 76ers are 50-9. ''It's a better story in the long run if you accomplish a lot of the little things along the way,'' said Julius Erving. ''But really, those aren't the kinds of things you talk about at the beginning of the season. They're icing, gravy. And in the end, they serve as a distraction.'' For most of the game, the 76ers looked to be distracted. Erving was held to only 5 points until the last seven minutes, Albert King, the man largely responsible for guarding him, said: ''He didn't act like he was into the flow of the game.'' And of Moses Malone, who had only two rebounds in the second half, Elmore said that he ''looked tired.'' ''They just didn't have it today,'' said Foots Walker. ''Andrew Toney didn't get into it; neither did Doc.'' The Nets, playing aggressively for most of the way, defused the 76ers' powerful arsenal. Malone, who came into the contest averaging 15.7 rebounds a game, a league-high, along with 24.5 points, finished with 15 points and eight rebounds. Erving, who had a 22.2 average, scored only 12 points. Williams Supplies Muscle For the Nets, Buck Williams applied most of the muscle underneath. He finished with 22 points, which tied King for game-high honors, and snared 15 rebounds, seven on offense. ''Buck is such a great rebounder that I just concentrated on keeping my body on Moses, keeping him away from the basket,'' said the Nets' substitute center Mike Gminski, who had an effective outing (12 points, nine rebounds) in place of foul-plagued Darryl Dawkins. Malone had 7 points and five rebounds in the first period as the game remained close. Toney's 10 points helped the 76ers gain a 28-21 lead late in the period. A late Nets surge pulled them to 30-26 going into the second period, and they regained the lead 40-39 when Williams hit a rimbending, fast-break dunk. Richardson Leads Surge From there, the lead changed hands four times before the Nets went on a 10-2 tear to build a 58-51 advantage at the half. Michael Ray Richardson led a surge at the start of the third period, scoring the Nets' opening 6 points and helping them to a 64-53 lead. Dawkins, who had only 4 points and one rebound in the first half, picked up his fourth foul less than five minutes into the period. He was replaced by Gminski, whose game hardly seems suited for the physical Malone. But throughout, the Nets employed a defensive strategy that sent one of the guards to help cover Malone whenever he got the ball. His frustration built, and Gminski took advantage of it, scoring 7 points and grabbing five rebounds in the third quarter as the Nets opened an 80-66 lead. Philadelphia began picking away at the Nets in the fourth quarter. Most of the damage was done by Maurice Cheeks, the fleet point guard. He had 9 points during a 20-10 spurt that brought the 76ers to 94-90 with 6:30 left. Then Erving hit a free throw and a fast-break lay-in on a long pass from Malone to end a 10-8 stretch that placed the 76ers behind by just 102-101 with 2:04 left. ''I thought,'' said Larry Brown, ''that Julius was going to take over then.'' Instead, the Nets' Otis Birdsong hit a jumper in the lane and, after King had stolen a pass intended for Erving, an off-balance jumper from about 16 feet that put the Nets up by 106-101 with 1:07 left. Toney then missed a 3-point attempt that was knocked out of bounds off Erving by Williams, who hit two free throws after he was fouled. The teams traded turnovers before Erving hit a 3-point shot with 23 seconds left. But the 76ers were forced to foul, and King, one of the Nets' best foul shooters, went to the free-throw line twice in the final moments. He hit all four of his attempts before Cheeks's last-second basket ended the scoring.

209-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; From Mandolins to Menus
To Theresa Costello, the display windows at 289 Bleecker Street, on the corner of Seventh Avenue South, ''looked nicer'' full of mandolins, accordions, Victrolas, records and ''O Sole Mio''-style sheet music. Now they hold dramatic bouquets - orchids yesterday - and limousines line up in front for the Vanessa restaurant. The copper cornice is newly burnished but the tiled entry still says: ''O. Pagani & Bro., Inc.'' Mrs. Costello started at the music store in 1920. She bought it and the building when Mr. Pagani retired in 1954. She still runs the business by mail order upstairs but sold the building. And she has never eaten in the two-year-old restaurant, its molded tin ceiling intact but otherwise all blond woods, mauve brocade walls and Art Deco lighting fixtures. Presiding downstairs now is 29-year-old Anne Rosenzweig, Vanessa's 5-foot, 95-pound chef, who disdains a toque blanche to top her braided ponytail. Tonight the New York branch of the Chaine des Rotisseurs, a gourmet society, will hold its dinner there. A Hunter High graduate, Miss Rosenzweig was an anthropologist and ethnomusicologist until 1981, doing research in Africa and Nepal. She refuses to discuss her college degrees . ''When I'm in my anthropological circles, I'm very proud of them, '' she said. ''But they have nothing to do with the kitchen.''

210-> MAN IN THE NEWS; JUDGE IN BRINK'S KILLINGS: DAVID SMITH RITTER
Midway through jury selection last month in the Brink's robbery and triple murder trial here, Judith Clark, one of three defendants, rose to question a prospective juror. He was a retired dairy farmer with a seventh- grade education, about 65 years old, with small, intense eyes, no teeth and a weathered face. ''My name is Judith Clark,'' she said. ''I'm an anti-imperialist freedom fighter. Do you have any feelings about that?'' ''About what?'' the farmer snapped back. The two were staring at each other. Things seemed ready for a clash. But the judge, David S. Ritter of Orange County Court, interceded. He Explains the Point ''I don't want you to answer about your feelings,'' Judge Ritter told the farmer. ''That's not the issue. The issue is not whether you approve or disapprove, but if it interferes with your ability to give her a fair trial.'' Time and again during the month of jury selection, Judge Ritter stepped in to keep the focus of the proceedings on what he often called a ''trial of specific criminal charges.'' He interviewed 1,180 potential jurors to weed out those who seemed hostile toward Miss Clark and her co- defendants, Kuwasi Balagoon and David J. Gilbert. All three are representing themselves. On days they were not boycotting jury selection, Judge Ritter barred their questions about the right to fight ''racist regimes'' and resist ''unjust laws,'' about napalm bombing of Vietnamese villages and unrest in South Africa and El Salvador, about black separationists, fascism, imperialism and revolution. ''This is not a trial of political beliefs,'' he told one potential juror. ''This is not a trial of racism.'' Reputation for Firmness To another, he said, ''The people on trial are not on trial for their views, however popular or unpopular they may be.'' In his two and a half years as Orange County judge, and in four years before then as the county's District Attorney, the 48-year-old jurist has developed a reputation for being strict and always firmly in control. When he served as District Attorney from 1976 to 1980, his office was at the rear of those of his aides. ''When you went back there, it was clear he was the boss,'' recalled a former assistant district attorney. ''There was no question about that. God forbid you should disagree with him.'' Courthouse workers say he is more reserved than most county and state judges in Goshen and less inclined than others to open his chambers to subordinates for a cup of coffee. Comfortable in Small Talk Yet during jury selection Judge Ritter often slid easily into small talk with potential jurors, speaking with traces of a country twang. The judge is one of the Republican Party's strongest vote-getters in the county. He was elected District Attorney in 1975 by about 5,200 votes out of 65,800 cast. He doubled that plurality in his re-election in 1979 before running unopposed for his $57,298-a-year county judgeship in 1980. During jury selection, an old man who wanted to be excused for heart trouble offered a doctor's note. ''I had bypass surgery, same as you, Judge,'' the man said, referring to the open-heart, arterial bypass surgery the judge underwent in 1980. ''Same doctor, too,'' Judge Ritter said as he read the note. ''And I still can't read his writing.'' Ruling Is Delayed After seven days of testimony the prosecution rested its case last Monday, and the defendants asked Judge Ritter to allow testimony by two former Black Panthers and a man accused of participating in the Brink's robbery. He put off ruling on the request until Monday. ''He's very capable, even-tempered, well qualified, and has a good judicial demeanor,'' said Angelo J. Ingrassia, a supervisory judge in the state's Ninth Judicial District, which takes in Orange County. Judge Ritter has been unflappable during the trial. He seems angered only when the defendants interrupt him, or when the prosecutor, Kenneth Gribetz, District Attorney of Rockland County, where the Brink's robbery and slayings occurred in October 1981, persists with repetitious questions. Early Ambition David Smith Ritter was born in the Orange County city of Middletown on Nov. 25, 1934. His father owned a real- estate and insurance agency. From age 12, he said in a recent interview, he wanted to be a lawyer. He said his deliberate, judicial nature could be traced to an uncle, Henry T. Dorrance, a lawyer in Utica, and Samuel W. Eager, a late state appellate judge and father of a friend. Often as a youth he talked law with the judge at his cottage on Yankee Lake in Sullivan County. He graduated from Union College in 1956 and Cornell University Law School in 1959. Immediately after leaving Cornell, he was hired by the United States Attorney General's office in Washington. In 1962, Judge Ritter, then married and the father of five young children, decided to leave Washington and return to his birthplace with his wife to set up a private law practice. 3 Years in Private Practice ''I wanted to establish myself as an individual,'' he said. He did not want to be ''beholden to somebody else with a power base.'' He was in private practice for three years, then served four years as a confidential law secretary to the late Clare J. Hoyt, a State Supreme Court justice. In 1970, he joined the District Attorney's office and remained there until his election as a judge in 1980. He and his second wife, Janet - his first marriage ended in divorce - are remodeling a century-old dairy barn. They live in it as work goes on. All the carpentry and landscaping involved prevent him from playing golf. ''The only athletic thing I've done lately is the Y.M.C.A. fitness class,'' he said.

211-> Finance Aides Asked to Meet
Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, seeking better coordination of international economic policies, said today that he had invited trade and finance ministers of the six other leading industrial countries to meetings in Paris May 10-11. The meetings would be the first gathering ever of the two groups of officials, trade and finance. The aim of the dinner discussions May 10 and breafast discussions May 11 would be to try to prevent collisions between trade and monetary policies, Mr. Regan said. One illustration he cited at a news briefing was the trend toward protectionism versus the efforts of many debtor countries to sell more abroad to pay off foreign debts. The six countries at the May meeting - Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada - will also be represented at the Williamsburg, Va., economic summit meeting to be held over the Memorial Day weekend. The Paris meeting is to be held the day after the conclusion of a ministerial conference of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a body of 24 industrial nations.

212-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Reports of Harassment
The Fire Department's admission of women as firefighters has resulted in ''isolated incidents'' of harassment, Fire Commissioner Joseph E. Spinnato said yesterday at his City Hall swearing-in. Mr. Spinnato told Mayor Koch and several hundred others in the City Council chambers that ''mostly the incidents were verbal and sexist.'' In response to questions from reporters after the ceremony, the Commissioner said he thought the department could ''handle it internally.'' Mr. Spinnato declined to cite specific incidents. But Robert K. Ling, a lawyer who has represented the women since they filed suit to gain admission to the department, charged that men had stolen women's badges from lockers, an offense that requires a police report. The Fire Department said there were no records of such losses. However, department officials acknowledged that there had been reports of a woman's boots being glued to a firehouse floor, of women being excluded from meals and other incidents.

213-> MUSIC: MENUHIN AND BRAHMS
YEHUDI MENUHIN was one player among many at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night, but it was his musical character that most strongly influenced the proceedings. The music was all by Brahms, this year being the 150th anniversary of his birth. Mr. Menuhin and Andras Schiff played the D minor Sonata for violin and piano; Nathaniel Rosen's cello joined them in the early Trio in B, and at the end was the Sextet in B flat for Strings. Mr. Menuhin was most exposed in the sonata, though he led the other pieces as well. There were here, as everywhere, occasional instabilities in his bowing arm and some miscalculations of attack. But this is a musical personality that shines cleanly and runs deep, and both these qualities rose above the roughnesses of technique. Written in 1854, the trio mixed the passions of youth with the caution of old age. Mr. Schiff was as elegant here as in the sonata, and Mr. Rosen's cello sang eloquently in the opening Allegro con Brio. In the sextet, fine edges of ensemble were sometimes a little smeared, but the overriding unanimity of spirit among the performers made this a specially winning performance.

216-> COMMODITIES; Heating Oil Rise Leads Futures Markets Rally
A broad rally occurred on many commodity futures markets yesterday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached agreement on an oil price cut and production quota. Heating oil and gasoline futures advanced their daily limits, prompting a surge in precious metals prices that signaled buy orders in many other markets as well. ''Just possibly, OPEC has gotten its act together,'' said Jack Boyd, vice president for research in New York with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The possibility of an oil price war was a key element in the abrupt decline in metals prices last month because of the implication that lower oil prices will soften the threat of inflation. ''I think because the meeting went on for so long, a lot of people expected it to disband without anything,'' said Lois Peltz, a petroleum analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch Futures. 'Psychologically Strong' Reaction ''The initial reaction was psychologically strong,'' Miss Peltz said. ''It was good that OPEC agreed. But there are a lot of questions and a lot of skepticism,'' she added, noting that a similar agreement a year ago dissolved under pressure from declining demand. Andrew Lebow, a petroleum analyst in New York with Shearson/American Express, said the agreement was ''a lot better than the market had been anticipating,'' which accounted for the sharp rally. Heating oil settled 2 cents to 2.83 cents higher with the contract for April delivery at $74.23 cents a gallon; leaded gasoline settled 2 cents to 2.45 cents higher with April at 79.45 cents a gallon. Gold settled $9.20 to $10.20 higher with the contract for March delivery at $436.70 a troy ounce; silver settled 50 cents to 50.5 cents higher with March at $11.42 a troy ounce. Grain, Soybeans Higher Grain and soybean futures prices were higher on the Chicago Board of Trade. A report released by the Agriculture Department on Friday indicated that a large amount of corn is tied up in the farmer-held reserve program and sources said that helped raise corn prices in early trading yesterday. But the major rally of the day was touched off by the OPEC agreement, said Susan Hackmann, a grain analyst with A.G. Becker. Cattle and frozen pork belly prices were higher and live hogs were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Most traders were expecting supportive news in the Agriculture Department's seven-state cattle on feed report, which was released after the close of trading, and that prompted buying, said Robert Holbert, a livestock analyst in Chicago with Conticommodity Services Inc.

The American Telephone and Telegraph Company filed a new proposal with a Federal judge to resolve a dispute over who may use the Bell name and trademarks after the Bell System is broken up next year. The company also informed the Federal Communications Commission that it will soon request permission to experiment with new long-distance pricing systems similar to those of its long-distance competitors. In today's filing, A.T.& T. said it was now proposing to allow both itself and the Bell companies to continue using the word Bell in their corporate names, but only if ''explicitly modified by a geographic designation.'' For example, Southern Bell would not have to change its name, but it could not market services without using the geographic adjective. A.T.& T. would have to use the full name of its new subsidiary, American Bell.

220-> MARCH IN CAPITAL IS SEEN SPURRING VAST COALITION
Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta said today that a coalition of environmentalists, women's rights advocates and blacks would emerge from Saturday's giant civil rights march here, and that it could help defeat President Reagan if he runs for re-election next year. ''There's no question that Ronald Reagan was the organizing factor that pulled this coalition together,'' Mr. Young said in summarizing the impact of the march by more than 200,000 people from across the country. The demonstration was held to commemorate the march for civil rights for blacks here 20 years ago today. Mr. Young was then an aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the organizers of the 1963 march on Washington. Appearing on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Young noted that President Johnson defeated Senator Barry Goldwater a year after the 1963 march. Southern Victory Is Seen ''What we have is the potential for having the same impact on the '84 elections as we did on the '64 elections,'' Mr. Young said, ''and we have the same possibility of establishing an agenda, essentially around disarmament.'' Large numbers of black voters are being registered in Southern states, he said, and ''any of the present declared Democratic candidates can carry the South'' in 1984. The Democrats' candidate in 1980, President Carter, carried only one Southern state, his native Georgia. Many of the demonstrators who marched Saturday said they came to commemorate the spirit of Martin Luther King, whose ''I Have a Dream'' speech galvanized the 1963 crowd and marked a turning point for the civil rights movement. ''I used to walk around with my head held low and felt ashamed of what I was,'' said Arthur Hill of Rosedale, Queens, who got out of bed at 3 A.M. Saturday to head for the march in Washington. ''But Martin Luther King not only lifted my head, he lifted my spirits and made me realize that I am somebody.'' The rally two decades ago championed specific legislation to end segregation and job discrimination. By contrast, the far-reaching agenda for the march Saturday embraced such issues as support for a nuclear freeze resolution, passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, a job bill, a fair housing bill, a five-year extension for the Civil Rights Commission and the declaration of a holiday in honor of Dr. King, who was slain in 1968. Sweeping Scope Criticized The sweeping scope of the agenda for Saturday's march has been criticized by some civil rights groups, including the National Urban League, as unfocused and obscuring pressing political and economic concerns, like registering blacks to vote. The league, a major force behind the 1963 march, did not participate in Saturday's protest. But ''the purpose of the march was much more sophisticated than some people give it credit for,'' according to Steve Horblitt, legislative assistant to Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress. ''What we really want to come out of the march,'' Mr. Horblitt said today, ''is for people to go back to their communities and tell their Congressional representatives that they will be judged on how they react to our proposals.'' He said a $5 billion program to create a million jobs was the key priority of the march organizers. 'Going Forward Together' Mr. Hill, the 53-year-old maintenance worker from Queens, cited a more general goal. He said Saturday's march had given him a vision of the world's possibilities. ''There weren't only black people,'' he said; ''there were a lot of white people and everybody got along so beautifully, sitting side by side. That's the way the world should be, everybody side by side and going forward together.'' The bus Mr. Hill traveled on was one of about 30 sponsored by District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. According to organizers of the demonstration, 1,500 of the 4,000 buses that converged on Washington Saturday came from the New York metropolitan area.

223-> FILIBUSTER THREAT ON ADELMAN DROPPED
Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, today withdrew his threat to filibuster the nomination of Kenneth L. Adelman as Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, saying he now felt the nomination could be defeated. The Senate scheduled floor debate beginning Tuesday and a vote on Thursday at 2 P.M. ''We're better off forgoing the filibuster,'' Senator Tsongas told reporters. ''The issue has been raised publicly. We think that on the merits we have a decent shot at defeating the nomination.'' The Senator's comments came after he met with Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, who also serves on the Foreign Relations committee. Mr. Mathias said the vote was expected to be close. In that situation, he said, ''you have to give the presumption to the President.'' ''But there are a lot of uneasy people on this one,'' Mr. Mathias added. Heavy Lobbying Expected President Reagan is expected to lobby heavily for his nominee, who critics assert lacked experience in nuclear arms control issues. White House officials believe that opponents are seeking to embarrass the President by using the nomination to call attention to what they regard as the Administration's failure to pursue arms talks vigorously. To counter the President's lobbying, opponents will seek to generate a grass-roots campaign against the nomination. The Senate Foreign Relations committee rejected the nomination by a 9-to-8 vote in February. But instead of killing the nomination, the committee was persuaded by the Senate Republican leadership to send the nomination to the floor with an unfavorable recommendation. That vote was 14 to 3. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, the majority leader, has predicted that Mr. Adelman will be confirmed but that the vote will be close. 'Doing the President a Favor' Mr. Tsongas said today that his vote count showed a 46-to-46 split. ''What you're dealing with is a reluctance to say 'No' to the President,'' the Senator said. ''We would be doing the President a favor by defeating Mr. Adelman and giving him the opportunity to get someone better.'' Mr. Tsongas said that although he would like to see filibusters prohibited in the Senate, it remained a tactic that could be used. ''If you're serious about an issue, there are rules in place,'' he said. In a colloquy with Senator Baker on the floor today, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader, said he would try to discourage Mr. Tsongas from filibustering the nomination.

225-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Federated's Chief For Discount Chain
Federated Department Stores Inc., the nation's largest operator of department stores, announced yesterday that it would get into the growing industry of selling national brands at discount prices. It named a young executive from a competitor, May Department Stores Inc., to head a chain of stores that will be opened next year. John H. Eyler Jr., 34 years old, who is currently president and chief executive of May's D&F division, with headquarters in Denver, will join Federated, which is based in Cincinnati, on May 9. Federated will be a latecomer in joining the trend. Several such chains are established and big department store companies, such as the Associated Dry Goods Corporation and Dayton-Hudson, are jumping in. In one sense the big stores will be competing against themselves by opening outlets where consumers can buy brand names at lower prices. Nevertheless, the business is obviously too profitable to ignore. Howard Goldfeder, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company planned to make a substantial investment in its new division, which is yet to be named. ''Unlike most of our current operations, which are primarily strong regional franchises,'' Mr. Goldfeder said, ''we expect our new division to by highly transportable and expandable to new markets and geographic regions.'' The division would be ''a vehicle for expansion in the mid-1980's that would provide important new earnings growth,'' he said. Mr. Eyler has been head of the May D&F division, which operates 10 stores in Colorado, since 1979. He joined May in 1971 as a trainee after graduation from the Harvard Business School. He could not be reached yesterday for comment. May announced from its headquarters in St. Louis that Joseph S. Davis, 53, president and chief executive of the M. O'Neil Company, a May operation in Akron and northeastern Ohio, would replace Mr. Eyler. Larry C. Masters continues as chairman of May D&F. Clarence A. Randall, 64, chairman of O'Neil, takes on the additonal post of chief executive, and Kenneth F. Sokol, 53, executive vice president of May's Famous-Barr Company in St. Louis, becomes O'Neil president.

226-> Live TV of Races Proposed in Bill
A bill that would authorize live telecasts of New York horse races into offtrack-betting parlors, race tracks and new betting theaters was introduced in both houses of the State Legislature yesterday. The bill, which would apply to both thoroughbred and harness races and would extend for a five-year experimental period, was drafted by the Joint Legislative Task Force on Racing. The bill seemed to offer a compromise between the interests of the tracks and the Offtrack Betting Corporation. Each of the two groups had sought exclusive control of simulcasting, but the bill would allow both to conduct wagering as well as televise the races.

227-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Amfac's President Adds Post of Chief Executive
Myron Du Bain, who has been president of Amfac Inc. since last November, was named yesterday to the additional post of chief executive at the company's annual meeting in Honolulu. Mr. Du Bain, 59, takes the reins from Henry Walker Jr., 60, who will continue as chairman. Mr. Walker, who diversified the company from a Hawaii sugar and land operation, will be based in Hawaii and oversee operations there. Mr. Du Bain will be based in San Francisco, where five of the six Amfac operating groups are situated. The company, founded 134 years ago in Hawaii, has grown from a $146 million Hawaiian company in 1967 to a diversified national company with sales of $2.2 billion last year. It employs 28,000 people in wholesale distribution, food processing, retail operations, hotels and resorts, Hawaii sugar, and land and horticultural activities. The diversification saved the company when the sugar business ran into difficulties. In 1981 sugar losses amounted to $30 million. Last year they were trimmed to $2.6 million. Mr. Du Bain said the company was cutting back on production and trying to increase productivity. ''At the very least we hope to get sugar back to a point where it is not a losing operation,'' he said. The company reported a modest profit of $1 million, or 6 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with earnings of $6.7 million, or 45 cents a share, in the period last year. It had expected a loss in the latest quarter. Mr. Du Bain said that 1983 would not be a good year for the company. ''We're still paying the price of the recession,'' he said, ''but we're quite optimistic about revenue and earnings growth over the next five years.'' He said he expected revenues at least to double, with substantial and predictable earnings growth. He was aiming, he said, for a return on equity of 18 percent within five years, up from an average of 12 percent over the last five years. Mr. Du Bain said he was analyzing all of Amfac's businesses ''to determine which we intend to emphasise in the future and those that might become eligible for divestiture.'' Mr. Du Bain comes to Amfac from a 37-year career in the insurance business. He was chairman, president and chief executive of the Fireman's Fund, a $3 blllion unit of American Express, when he left to join Amfac.

228-> Air France Proposal
Air France today proposed a capital restructuring to cover part of its loss last year of 791.8 million francs, the current equivalent of $106.6 million. The Governmentowned airline proposed paying 818.1 million francs of debt by cutting the nominal value of each of its shares to 22 francs from 40, thereby reducing its capital to 999.9 million francs from 1,818 million. Fresh capital totaling 737 million francs, through the issue of 33.5 million shares at 22 francs each, is planned mainly by converting Government loans into shares.

229-> MORE SALVADOR AID, AND MORE STRINGS; News Analysis
An emerging Congressional consensus on military aid to El Salvador, considered unlikely last winter, may provide more funds than the Reagan Administration could reasonably have expected. It would also tie more strings to the aid than critics had hoped to achieve. Although the curbs remain ill-defined, they have the potential for real bite. On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent President Reagan from later asking for more funds, and precedent suggests he will. Thus, both sides have the best deal so far in the proposed legislation that they felt they could get under the circumstances, leading Representative Henry Hyde, a conservative Republican of Illinois to quip, ''If you can't get dinner, get a sandwich.'' Risks Run by Both Parties The political risks posed by the situation in El Salvador are apparent to most lawmakers. Democrats run the risk of being blamed for an insurgent victory if the Administration does not get what it says it needs to bolster the Salvadoran Government. Republicans run the risk of increased United States involvement and of being blamed for another Vietnam. A bipartisan policy is thus considered to be in the interest of most lawmakers, especially if it is cloaked in the ambiguities provided by the compromises adopted in recent days by the relevant House and Senate committees. The committees' amendments fell into a pattern in which conditions have been imposed and it is up to the President to determine whether they are fulfilled. Although a House committee bill provided a mechanism for Congress to reverse the President's judgment, Congress has traditionally been loath to do so on such issues. Under the compromises, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved $76.3 million in military aid for El Salvador in the current fiscal year and the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted $65 million. The 1982 aid level was $26 million. President Asked for $136 Million The increase from last year obscured the fact that President had requested $136 million for this fiscal year. But few in the Administration or on Capitol Hill believed there was a realistic possibility that Congress would come close to that amount, and many regarded the request as part of a negotiating strategy. Thus, the House committee action, which would provide the lower amount, was hailed as ''a positive move'' by Powell A. Moore, Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional affairs. Although the committees approved large increases, each exacted some form of commitment to a curb on human rights violations and an ''unconditional dialogue'' with the rebels. The more stringent requirement came from the House committee, although the key provision was ambiguous. It said Congress would shut off military aid unless there was ''active preparation by the Government of El Salvador for and engagement in a dialogue, in good faith and without preconditions, with all the major parties to the conflict in El Salvador for the purpose of achieving an equitable political solution to the conflict.'' Sponsors of the compromise said during the debate that this meant the Salvadoran Government had to be ''actively engaged'' in a dialogue. Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked for a definition of a ''dialogue in good faith and without preconditions.'' ''Dialogue is a euphemism for negotiations,'' replied Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New York. ''It means that negotiations will begin without conditions.'' The phrase ''unconditional dialogue'' has become the watchword of both the Senate and House committees, but is not contained in the House committee bill, which instead speaks of ''dialogue without preconditions.'' Views of Two Sides in Salvador Unconditional dialogue has been opposed by the Salvadoran Government on the ground that it would lead to power-sharing before elections. The Government said the insurgents would have to get involved in the electoral process, which they have boycotted. The insurgents, on the other hand, want the dialogue first because they regard the elections, without prior understandings, as a device to exclude them. The Reagan Administration has not opposed discussions between the two sides so long as they were limited to establishing the ground rules for elections. But the Administration has opposed any negotiations on a division of power on the ground - or, as Secretary of State George P. Shultz has put it, the insurgents should not be able to shoot their way into power. Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States should put the insurgents to the test. The committee sent a letter to Mr. Shultz asking the United States to encourage such ''unconditional dialogue.''

231-> ISLANDERS SCORE 3 IN THIRD TO BEAT RANGERS IN OPENER
Cabbies may talk about who's better, the Islanders or the Rangers? But tonight there was no need for debate. The Islanders, with a three-goal, third-period explosion paced by Bob Bourne, pinned a 4-1 defeat on the Rangers in front of a sellout crowd of 15,230 at Nassau Coliseum. The victory gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game playoff series that will determine this year's Patrick Division champion. The teams will meet again here Friday night in Game 2, with the series moving to Madison Square Garden for games Sunday and Monday nights. ''If we get up,'' said Bourne, who tied a Stanley Cup playoff record by assisting on all three goals in the final period, ''then there aren't many teams that are going to beat us.'' The assist record is shared by many players, including a former Islander, J.P. Parese. The Rangers, until early in the second period, felt that they could beat the three-time defending Stanley Cup champions. Ron Greschner gave them a first-period goal that held up for a 1-0 lead into the second period. And with four minutes gone in that period, Ron Duguay and Mike Backman broke into the Islander end with no one to beat but the goalie Billy Smith. Smith Makes Vital Save Duguay, electing to pass instead of shoot, feathered the puck across the slot to his rookie teammate on the right side. Smith covered against the right post and easily cut down the scoring chance. ''We felt we were going to win the hockey game,'' said Barry Beck, the veteran Ranger defenseman. ''And we could have won, but we didn't bear down when we had the scoring chances. The game's totally different if we put those in the net.'' ''He made the save,'' said Denis Potvin, who eventually scored the game-winner at the start of the third period. ''It was like a mood swing.'' Less than two minutes after that save, with the Islanders skating on a 5-4 man-advantage, Stefan Persson riveted in the tying goal with a slapshot from the point. The momentum was all with the Islanders. Smith's save, preventing the opportunistic Rangers from taking a 2-0 lead, picked up his teammates' overall attack. The forechecking became fierce, bottling up the Rangers in their own end. The Rangers had no more than a dozen shots on Smith after that save, while the Islanders rolled up 22 shots on the Rangers' goalie Ed Mio in the final 40 minutes. ''And we need a sufficient number of opportunities to be successful against their goaltender,'' said the Coach Herb Brooks of the Rangers. ''Look,'' said Beck, ''we're not going to beat them with one goal. Not if we play them for 100 years.'' Bourne Starts Rally The beginning of the end came with 1:44 gone in the final period. Bourne faked a slapshot in the middle of the left faceoff circle and swung behind the net. He hoped to circle and stuff the puck inside the right post, but instead watched the puck roll off his stick and up the slot. Potvin recovered some 15 feet from Mio and quickly put in a wrist shot for the winning goal. ''What can I say?'' said Bourne, slightly embarrassed that he had missed the stuff. ''I've done a lot of things wrong that come out looking great.'' Bourne's next assist came only 2 minutes 43 seconds later, forcing the puck out of a jam on the left boards to give Duane Sutter control. Duane carried into the left corner, circled, and fired a pass to the slot for his brother Brent to hammer past Mio. Then, with 8:05 gone in the period, Bourne blasted Mio with a shot off right wing. Duane Sutter was there this time to collect the rebound and pop it in for the 4-1 final margin. 19 Saves for Smith Not long after that, with the Rangers demoralized, the chants of ''1940 ... 1940 ... 1940'' began in the Coliseum. It was a grim reminder that the Rangers last won the Stanley Cup more than four decades ago. One Islander fan later carried a hockey stick down one of the arena's aisles. Dangling at the end of the stick was a Smurf, dressed as a Ranger, hanged in effigy. The Rangers were dubbed Smurfs, small cartoon characters that are favorites of children, earlier this season by the Coach Bob McCammon of the Philadelphia Flyers. Smith finished with 19 saves, beaten only by Greschner's power-play shot at 13:01 of the first period. It gave Smith a 12-3 lifetime record against the Rangers in post-season play. ''I don't want to be the guy that costs this hockey team,'' said Smith. ''I don't want to be the weak link. The timing of that save was good - for me. We were down, 1-0, and it might have changed the game. You don't know. ''When you get a play like that, you don't even get a chance to see who it is shooting. Anyone on a play like that can put it in the net. Hey, there's two guys there, you can only hope for the best. It's like being wide open.'' The Islanders suffered one costly loss in the victory. Dave Langevin, their hard-hitting defenseman, left in the first period with a damaged right knee. ''And it doesn't look very good,'' said Arbour. Langevin could be lost for at least this series.

236-> WHAT LED TO THE INDIAN POINT RULING; News Analysis
When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted after the Three Mile Island accident to require extensive emergency preparations around every reactor in the country, opponents of nuclear power immediately thought of Indian Point. ''From the standpoint of common sense, emergency planning has always been the Achilles heel at Indian Point,'' said Ellyn R. Weiss, a lawyer who represented the Union of Concerned Scientists before the commission in an action to close the plants. ''But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had no rules that looked at these questions until after Three Mile Island.'' Before that accident in March 1979, regulations for evacuations were extremely limited. But at Three Mile Island, in Middletown, Pa., the commission found itself concurring with the decision made by state officials to advise pregnant women and families with small children to leave the immediate area. As a result, in August 1980 the commission issued a detailed rule on emergency preparedness, with a deadline for compliance of April 1, 1981. Only 16 Approved Plans In the years since, however, opponents of the nuclear plants say the regulatory climate has become more favorable to the industry, especially on emergency planning, and numerous deadlines have slipped past. Today, two years after the deadline, nuclear plants operate at 53 sites around the country, and only 16 have approved emergency plans, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was given the job of evaluating emergency preparedness. Plans for about 20 more sites are now under review by the agency, with the rest in varying stages of completion. As a national policy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's staff decided recently not to develop automatic procedures for shutting plants when emergency equipment, such as warning sirens or hot lines, was found to be out of service, even though a plant would be automatically shut if a critical pump or valve inside the plant were broken. In contrast, after the Three Mile Island accident, commission studies foresaw shutting reactors if, for example, a snowstorm made local roads impassable. Staff Making New Studies With Three Mile Island slipping further into history, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is pushing forward with new studies designed to show that even in a worst-case ''meltdown'' and the failure of most safety systems, natural chemical processes would keep nearly all of the radiation in the reactor building. The utilities, meanwhile, have been encouraged to complete analyses that calculate the chance of an accident. Such a study for Indian Point last year concluded that the chance of an accident in which evacuation would be useful was once in 14,000 years of operation for both reactors combined. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who recently held hearings on emergency plans at Indian Point, said that ''in recent years there has been a return to the pre-Three Mile Island business-as-usual attitude, which views emergency planning as a mere embellishment to the operation of a plant.'' Major Improvements Ordered Emergency planning has continued to be of concern at sites with heavy population concentrations, such as Zion, 40 miles north of Chicago, with about 200,000 people within 10 miles, and at some sites with rugged terrain, such as Maine Yankee, in Wiscasset, where this week the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered major improvements made to the emergency plan. But yesterday's action is the closest that the commission has come to shutting a reactor because of flaws in emergency plans. Nowhere have the deadlines slipped more badly than at Indian Point. The emergency planning zone - which covers 314 square miles in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties - is the worst prepared of any in the nation, according to Richard W. Krimm of the Emergency Management Agency's Natural and Technological Hazards Division. The agency has reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on three separate occasions that ''significant deficiencies'' existed in the plan to protect the 288,000 people who live within 10 miles of the Indian Point plants - the largest such population in the country. Twice, the commission has set 120-day deadlines and has threatened fines or a shutdown for noncompliance. Until now, however, the two reactors have always been allowed more time for a variety of reasons. As the decision issued yesterday notes, ''to some extent these problems are beyond the power of the licensees to resolve.'' In addition, the composition of the commission has changed over four years, and the new members have often put lower priority on emergency planning. Joan Holt, a spokesman for the New York Public Interest Research Group, which joined the Union of Concerned Scientists in petitioning for a shutdown of the Indian Point reactors, said she did not believe the present commission would approve the emergency planning rule if it were put before it today. Choice Faced by Commission However, pressed by plant opponents, the commission has found it difficult to step back. ''The choice they had to make,'' Mrs. Holt said, ''was either to take this kind of action or declare emergency planning regulations null and void. I don't think the American public and Congress would let them get away with that.'' Members of the commission have made similar points. Without action in this case, said one member, John F. Ahearne, ''I expect emergency planning will rapidly deteriorate nationwide.'' Among those watching with interest are the Long Island Lighting Company, which hopes to open its Shoreham reactor later this year, and Suffolk County, which believes that emergency planning there is impossible and that the $3.2 billion plant should be abandoned. ''We are encouraged,'' said Deputy County Executive Frank R. Jones. ''It looks as though our reasoning has been upheld unanimously by the N.R.C. Public safety does in fact come first.'' ''Shoreham is dead,'' he added. Lilco noted that part of the problem with Indian Point was the refusal of Rockland County to participate in the planning process. In a brief statement, it said that ''this would appear to be another indication that New York State will have to get its counties in line and come up with a coherent overall policy for emergency planning.'' The industry, perhaps responding to a change in the public attitude toward atomic energy, appears likely to take a similar tack. At the Atomic Industrial Forum, a Washington-based trade group, Donald C. Winston, a spokesman, said, ''Someone is going to have to define what the responsibilities are, whether you can force a county to participate, or whether a county by refusing to participate can kill a plant.'' ''It's a question of political science,'' he said.

237-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Music for the 'Middle Brow'
''It's the first time we've had an orchestra for the middle-brow soul,'' Skitch Henderson said, explaining his new New York Pops orchestra, which is to debut tonight at Carnegie Hall. Dapper in white tie and goatee, he will conduct the 100-member group in popular classics by Victor Herbert, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein and the Beatles. He has apparently struck a chord, for a call to Carnegie Hall's box office found that the concert was sold out. Mr. Henderson bankrolled tonight's concert himself, at a cost of about ''$50,000, including musicians and headaches,'' he said. The group will play in Central Park in the fall, and will have a series at Carnegie Hall next season. ''There's a difference between pop music and popular music,'' Mr. Henderson observed. ''Pop is music that comes and goes. Popular music stays.''

242-> Bridge: 32 Teams of 89 Surviving In Vanderbilt Tournament
The Vanderbilt Knockout Team Championship continued here this afternoon at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals with 32 teams of an original entry of 89 surviving. In the most interesting match of the day, a strong New York team headed by the veteran Sam Stayman, and comprising George Tornay, Saul Bronstein, Ethan Stein and Joel Friedberg, battled the seventh-seeded team: Cliff Russell and Robert Levin, both of Miami Beach; Lou Bluhm and Richard Freeman, both of Atlanta; John Solodar of New York, and Ron Gerard of White Plains. New Yorkers vs. New Yorkers In two other matches, both involving women's teams, New York experts were in opposition. In one, Ira Rubin of Paramus, N.J., in the fifth-seeded team, composed of Kit Woolsey of Arlington, Va., and Ralph Katz and Milt Rosenberg, both of Chicago, faced Rita Rand, Joyce Lilie and Pam Bridson, all of New York; Judy Wadas of Greenwich, Conn.; Esta Van Zandt of Houston, and Mildred Boyce of Austin, Tex. In another match, husband and wife were in opposition. In this, Mark Cohen of New York, Ed Manfield of Arlington, Va.; Mark Molson of Montreal and Billy Cohen of Memphis faced Stasha Cohen and Dorothy Truscott, both of New York; Edith Kemp Freilich of Miami Beach, Nancy Gruver of Ellicott City, Md.; Mary Jane Farell of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Randi Montin of Whittier, Calif. After 16 deals of a scheduled 64, Stayman trailed Solodar by 12 international match points; Rubin led Mrs. Rand by 53 points; and Mark Cohen led against his wife, Stasha Cohen, by 22 points. Among those eliminated from the Vanderbilt in the first day's play on Sunday was a strong team made up of Harold Lilie, David Berkowitz, Robert Blanchard and Drew Casen, all of New York, and a team that included Michael Moss and Mike Kamil, both New Yorkers. The winners of the women's pairs earlier in the tournament gained on the diagramed deal when Jo Morse of Silver Spring, Md., brought home a borderline game with good technique. As South, she opened two no-trump with a hand on which many would be content with a one-bid. She landed in three no-trump after her partner, Evelyn Levitt of Wilmington, Del., used Stayman to probe for a spade fit. The club queen was led and correctly taken with the king in dummy. Although this took a useful entry from dummy, it improved the prospects of scoring three club tricks, rather than two. A diamond was led, and the king won in the closed hand. Now a low spade was led, a flexible play that left all doors open. West put up the queen and there was no defense. If he had shifted to a heart, South would have won with the king in his hand and continued spades. In practice, West led the club jack, giving South her extra trick in that suit. She won and played clubs herself and eventually led up to the diamond queen to make her contract.

245-> U.S. TO KEEP ORDER TO INSTALL DUST CONTROLS AT TEXTILE MILLS
The Reagan Administration, in a rebuff to its own budget office, reversed itself today and decided that it would continue to require textile companies to develop engineering controls to protect workers against inhalation of cotton dust. Sources who refused to be identified publicly said David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, agreed to accept a proposed revision of the five-year-old cotton dust standard that retains the ventiliation control requirement. By that action, Mr. Stockman overruled one of his deputies, Christopher C. Demuth, director of the budget agency's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Mr. Demuth had argued that expensive engineering controls would offer workers no more protection than if they simply wore protective masks. The decision by Mr. Stockman ended a five-month dispute between the budget office and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which took the position that the engineering controls still should be required even if other standards were eased. 600,000 Workers Covered Officials at the safety agency declined comment on Mr. Stockman's decision, and Mr. Demuth was traveling abroad and could not be reached. The cotton dust standard covers 600,000 workers in the textile industry. The 1978 standard, which was imposed in 1980, was upheld in June 1981 by the Supreme Court of the United States, which turned aside industry arguments that the benefit of the engineering controls must be assessed against their cost to industry. About 95,000 workers are directly exposed to cotton dust in more than 440 plants, primarily in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama, Government records show. The safety agency sent the revised cotton dust standard to the budget office for approval on Jan. 11. More recently the standard was the subject of an intense debate between Mr. Demuth and Thorne G. Auchter, OSHA's administrator. 'Brown Lung' Disease Some sources had said that without a resolution of the argument, the cotton dust issue might have to be taken to President Reagan. In 1978, President Carter became personally involved before OSHA proposed the standard requiring the installation of engineering controls to protect workers against byssinosis, a debilitating respiratory ailment commonly known as ''brown lung disease.'' The 1978 standard required industries to install ventilation devices on textile mill plant floors to suck in the cotton dust fibers. OSHA economists have estimated that the industry has already spent $143.3 million on equipment needed to comply with the engineering requirement and that another $102.2 million would be needed to bring the industry into full compliance. OSHA officials maintained that worker productivity would suffer if use of masks was the only measure adopted to fight cotton dust. The agency argued that workers would spend much of their time away from the job so they could take off the masks.

246-> AROUND THE WORLD; 5 Executives Sentenced In Italian Dioxin Case
A court sentenced five former chemical plant executives to prison today for their role in an explosion that released poisonous dioxin that killed thousands of animals and caused severe skin diseases in children. Four defendants were found guilty of willful failure to prevent the explosion in Seveso on July 10, 1976, which sent a cloud of dioxin over a seven-square-mile area. A fifth was found guilty of involuntary negligence. The sentences ranged from two and a half to five years, but a three-year remission of sentence for each defendant means that one will not have to go to jail. The remission was not explained. A lawyer for Hoffmann Laroche, the Swiss-based chemicals giant that owned the plant, said all would appeal.

247-> THE CITY; Drug Agents Seize 8 Ecuadoreans
Officers of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration said that they arrested eight Ecuadoreans early yesterday in midtown. The officers said they seized 34 pounds of cocaine worth more than $10 million. The arrests began after 1:30 A.M., when the officers went to the cocktail lounge of the Holiday Inn on 57th Street near 10th Avenue and arrested a man from Guayaquil, Ecuador. They said he had a valise with 12 pounds of cocaine. In front of the hotel, officers seized a man from Parlin, N.J. Later, the officers intercepted a jeep at 49th Street and 10th Avenue and arrested a man from El Batan, Ecuador, and two New Yorkers. At the Ramada Inn at 48th Street and Eighth Avenue, the raiders seized 22 pounds of cocaine and a Miamian and two men who live in Ecuador.

248-> Topics; Jobs Undone, Well Done; Belatedly Moot
''The most important thing we do,'' Justice Brandeis once said of the Supreme Court, ''is not doing.'' For a tribunal with such power and discretion, choosing the right cases and issues - and avoiding the wrong ones - can be as important as the decisions themselves. The Court chose badly last fall when it agreed to hear complaints of racial discrimination from white Boston firemen who had been laid off while a court protected the jobs of blacks with less seniority. The issues were significant, but the case was essentially closed before it ever reached the high court. Now the Court has announced that the case is being dismissed as possibly moot - legally dead. But it seems to have taken the justices six months to appreciate what civil rights lawyers had told them several times: the prayers of the white firefighters had been answered. Not only had the Massachusetts Legislature found the money to rehire them; it decreed that these employees may never again be dismissed for fiscal reasons. Why did the Court, already complaining about too much work, reach out to consider the pleas of parties well served by the political system? What became of judicial restraint and other canons about high court intervention? Perhaps some justices were simply eager to reach a reverse discrimination issue by any route. But greater care in selecting cases can save the Court, the contestants and the nation a lot of time and anxiety.

249-> BRIEFING
Nader on Video Games I t should come as no surprise, perhaps, that Ralph Nader has turned some of his attention to video games and, while he does not have any safety bones to pick with the likes of Pac-Man, he would like to see these games directed more at worldly concerns than space fantasies. The consumer advocate recently reviewed a video game called China Syndrome for Video Review magazine and gave it an ''average'' rating. Mr. Nader likes the goal of the game, which is to prevent a nuclear power plant from blowing up, but he finds some things to criticize in the mechanics of achieving that end. The game's audio effects are ''more irritating than stimulating,'' he said, and the robot arm is ''difficult to control precisely.'' He also found that ''the joystick lacks the sensitivity to give you a real fighting chance against the bouncing fuel particles'' that multiply and cause a meltdown if they are not zapped in time by the robot arm. ''While all this may convey the message that controlling a nuclear reactor is a difficult and dangerous business,'' he added, obviously pleased with what he sees as the game's political message, ''playing an unrewarding game probably takes that lesson too far.'' For all its flaws, however, Mr. Nader says the China Syndrome game is an ''excellent idea'' that other video game manufacturers would do well to emulate. Mr. Nader says he didn't care much for Pac-Man. ''It was a little all too devouring, just gobble, gobble, gobble,'' he said. ''No social content.'' Whole Wheat Chili? Like Mikey, the kid in the cereal commercials, Senators, it seems, will eat anything at least once. Today, a group of Senators and their aides will sit down for a lunch of whole wheat chili served by Montana Women Involved in Farm Economics, a group that goes by the acronym WIFE. This, however, is no free lunch. WIFE wants the Federal Government to include surplus wheat among the food commodities it distributes to schools and nonprofit institutions This group contends that its members are thinking as much of the public health as the financial health of wheat farmers. Substituting whole wheat for meat in chili is only the beginning. WIFE is passing out recipes for other whole wheat wonders, including wheat balls, tasty wheat salad, Tijuana Toss-up (substituting whole wheat chili for salad dressing), stir-fried wheat sprouts and wheat pie (allegedly tastes like pecan pie). A Class-A Plea T he record military budgets of the Reagan Administration may be a boon to the makers of weapons, but they have done nothing for the garment workers at Cavalier Clothes Inc. in Jamaica, Queens. Cavalier makes Class A coats for the military services, doing about 60 percent of its business with the Army. Last October the Army announced that it planned to reduce its demand for these green coats by 50 percent, issuing one, instead of two, Class A coats to each recruit. That is bad news for Cavalier employees. Robert F. Brandle, the company president, said it would cost 450 workers their jobs. Company employees recently sent President Reagan a letter asking him to overrule the Army, contending, among other things, that the change will discourage ''the wearing of Class A uniforms at a time when professionalism is important to the Army.'' The Army's decision was a gesture both to demands for greater Pentagon thrift and to changing styles. The fact is, according to Army brass, the need for Class A coats has been diminishing since the service approved the wearing of gray-green shirts and pullover sweaters and black windbreakers. ''What has happened,'' Mr. Brandle theorizes, ''is the dungaree generation has become the generals.'' Now, the 'Docudance' What, some may ask, is a ''docudance?'' It is a new political art form practiced by Liz Lerman, a dancer and choreographer with the Washington Dance Exchange. Last year she did an interpretative dance on Reagnomics, a satirical number that won acclaim from local critics. Now the dancer has broadened her repertory to include the current big issues on the political agenda here. Her ''docudance'' premier is scheduled for later this month, focusing on the arms race and military spending. In one segment, ''The Story of the M-1 Tank,'' she will be dancing with a life-size puppet that looks like a Pentagon general. For variety, the ''docudance'' also will feature segments on whales, real estate and video games.

250-> About New York; ONCE UPON A STORYTELLING CONTEST
The best moment in the Sixth Annual Citywide Storytelling Festival came when the winners were announced. The worst moment came when the winners were announced, too. Fifteen public-school children, grades three through eight, had arrived at the finals of the contest yesterday, and when it was over three of them were champions, and 12 of them were just finalists. And it was clear that while it is possible to teach very young children to memorize a folk story or fairy tale, deliver it with animation and poise and punctuate it with hand gestures, it is quite impossible to teach them not to betray their disappointment when they have not done so quite as well as someone else has. ''Competition is rough when you're young,'' said Charlotte Frank, executive director of the New York City Board of Education's Division of Curriculum and Instruction. And before her on an auditorium stage stood one little girl with fat tears running amid her freckles, another with her eyes brimming and her lower lip imprisoned under her two front teeth, and any number of other youngsters whose disappointment was written as large on their faces as the morals had been in the old, old stories that they recited. For the three winners, of course, it was quite a different story. Lizandra Vega, a student at Junior High School 45 in the Bronx, and a young woman 13 going on 30, beamed and beamed like a beauty queen. Lizandra told a folk tale called ''Ticoumba and the President,'' about a man who filled his boots with Bahamian sand so he could always walk on British soil. ''I pray every night that she win,'' said her mother, Elsa, who came to New York from Puerto Rico in 1968. ''When she start kindergarten, she don't speak English because we don't know,'' said her father, Wilfredo. Eugene Veksler, his cheeks flaming, asked someone to take a snapshot for his parents. Eugene had come here from Russia just three years ago, but he recited an African folk story about how the spider got its tiny waist with gusto, in a lilting voice with the faintest touch of an accent. ''I'm glad we didn't totally get rid of the accent,'' said Bernice Haber, the teacher who taught Eugene English at Public School 105 in the Bronx. And Michael Garvey, who goes to P.S. 41 in Queens, just clasped his trophy and grinned. ''Michael, pull up your zipper,'' his mother, Carole, called up to him onstage, and Michael held the big gold cup in front of his pants. Michael's story had been somewhat macabre. Entitled ''The Yellow Ribbon,'' it was about the lifelong relationship between John and Jane and how John pleaded with her to tell him why she always wore a yellow ribbon around her neck. On her deathbed, however, Jane let John untie the ribbon, and her head fell off. ''I liked the ending,'' said Michael. It was a long way the 15 had come to this day, telling tales out of school at the Graduate Center of the City University, on 42d Street just off Fifth Avenue. Each one had won a class, school, district and borough storytelling competition. Each had memorized a long story and told it with more or less spirit and sensitivity to hundreds of other children. Some of them stood as stiff as sticks and recited their tales. Some, ill-advised by adults, added a great many hand gestures and facial expressions. All wore their best clothes and looked poised and cool. Only the hands showed what they were feeling, the fingers picking and pulling at whatever clothing came to hand. ''I was more nervous than she was,'' said Diane Morman after her 10-year-old daughter, Yuroba, had finished reciting the story ''How Big Mouth Wrestled the Giant,'' in which Yuroba produced a lusty giant's voice, deep and full. ''We live in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but she's in a special program for gifted children.'' ''I'm all talked out,'' said Yuroba darkly, chewing at a cuticle. ''You just read the story and you keep on reading it over and over until you know it by heart,'' said Dawn Traynor, a tiny child from Staten Island with pigtails and a penetrating voice who is just the sort of child usually seen on commercials. Dawn recited a story called ''The Bed,'' a complicated kind of tale that included a dog, a cat, a mouse, a pig and all their requisite noises. For one horrible moment in her animated performance her eyes had suddenly widened and rolled upwards and it had seemed that she would, as actors say, go up, or lose her lines. But it was only a moment. ''I was a little nervous,'' she said. Carl Payne, who goes to J.H.S. 167 in Manhattan, told the story of John Henry, and when he said, ''He died with his hammer in his hand,'' the room was so quiet you could hear a camera clicking. ''I did it in fourth grade, you see,'' said Carl. ''But I didn't make it quite all the way.'' Melanie Jacobs, from Intermediate School 61, recited a story by Hans Christian Andersen called ''The Angel'' and wore a white dress, shoes and tights. ''Actually, this is my bat mitzah outfit,'' she said, ''but everyone thought it was good for a story about an angel.'' All the parents wore tight smiles and carried cameras. One woman said it was hardest on the parents, but she was wrong. The judges went out to make their decision in each age group. ''Oh, God, I hate this part,'' said Lizandra. The winners were announced, and the tears came. There were trophies, and savings bonds, and more tears, and some adult unpleasantness. ''The judges were crazy, just crazy,'' one mother said flatly. ''You can enter again next year,'' another told her daughter. Carl Payne's eyes looked hurt, but he stood up straight in his red sweater on the stage. ''My father said even if I lose,'' he had said earlier, ''I'm still No. 1 with him.'' And that is the moral of this story.

251-> MOSCOW'S LESS THAN-OMINOUS REASONS FOR DEPLOYING SS-20'S
To the Editor: Irving Kristol (Op-Ed May 3) has raised a good question: Why did the Soviets deploy the SS-20? The Soviets weren't satisfied with the status quo in intermediaterange missiles in Europe for the same reason we have not been satisfied with the status quo of our ICBM force: it is seen as meeting continuing military and deterrence requirements, but becoming vulnerable and urgently in need of modernization. The Soviet Union has had 600 missiles facing Europe for 20 years. The question was not whether to create such a force, but what to do about replacing obsolete and vulnerable missiles. The SS-20 was a natural. Unlike the SS-11, a variable-range intermediate and intercontinental-range missile, the SS-20, as a replacement for SS-4's and SS-5's, would not subtract from equal SALT-limited force levels. The SS-20 was mobile, less vulnerable, more reliable and responsive, with less megatonnage and throw-weight, than the old missiles - all virtues touted by the Americans. It also had MIRV's, which increased the number of warheads but which the Americans had been justifying in SALT as a ''qualitative improvement.'' Moreover, because of Soviet agreement in SALT II not to deploy the SS-16 mobile ICBM, a production line was available to produce the SS-20 (based on the first two stages of the SS-16). Western thinking had tended to equate the 600 SS-4 and SS-5 missiles with the American Thor and Jupiter missiles of the same vintage as an interim substitute until ICBM forces would provide a real strategic deterrent; later retention was interpreted as reflecting a Soviet propensity to keep old systems. From that perspective, the decision to replace them with SS-20's was perplexing and disquieting. In fact, the Soviets never regarded their SS-4's and SS-5's as an interim strategic deterrent, but rather as an integral link in a chain of deterrent and contingent war-waging capabilities. Moreover, while it has qualities that can be useful in a first strike (as does our Pershing 2), one reason for the large numbers is to ensure survivability of at least a portion of the force for a retaliatory strike, if NATO struck in a ''first use'' of nuclear weapons. Thus there is a perfectly understandable Soviet military rationale for modernization, without resort to speculation on intentions for a first strike or political pressure. Moreover, what evidence there is argues against the explanation of political intimidation. The Soviets have been vocal and insistent that there can be no limited nuclear war in Europe leaving the U.S. aside, no decoupling of the fate of the United States from that of Europe. That is not a line calculated to play upon European fears of decoupling, but one intended to discourage what they fear is an American belief that we could wage a limited nuclear war in Europe from a sanctuary in the United States. Finally, the Soviets see the British and French missiles as part of the Western alliance capability, not as likely independent threats. In considering forces of the two sides, they insist on taking these capabilities into account - as we would surely do in their place. Moreover, announced plans for equipping with MIRV's the existing British and French forces would in fact create a larger number of warheads on these forces alone than on the entire Soviet SS-20, SS-4 and SS-5 missile force. Hence Andropov's new willingness to count warheads. Inferring Soviet ''intentions'' from such action as the deployment of the SS-20 is not as easy as Mr. Kristol implies. To answer his question -''Are there any other explanations, perhaps less alarming, for the Soviet Union's conduct?'' - Yes. RAYMOND L. GARTHOFF, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution, Washington, May 3, 1983

253-> ALLEN HURLS 6-HITTER TO DOWN DODGERS
The Los Angeles Dodgers strutted into Shea Stadium last night with the best record in the major leagues and slunk away looking like the worst team in the majors. The Dodgers, who won 25 of their first 35 games, played the sloppiest defense the Mets have seen this season, committing two charged errors, throwing one wild pitch and making several other plays that could have been called errors. It all helped he Mets post a 4-0 decision for their fifth victory in the last six games. From the Mets' viewpoint, though, it was the ineptitude of the Dodger offense against Neil Allen that provided the most significant aspect of the game. Allen, the relief specialist making his second start of the season and the seventh of his career, pitched the longest and the best that he has in the majors, stifling the Dodgers on six hits and recording their first shutout of the season. Allen allowed only one runner to reach third base as he gained his second victory against four losses. Bill Russell was that runner, and he made it to third with one out in the eighth inning on a walk and a single by Rick Monday. However, Allen struck out Steve Sax on a 3-2 pitch and retired Ken Landreaux on a pop-up. Besides the Dodgers' defense, Allen received significant assistance from Ronn Reynolds and Hubie Brooks. Reynolds, who entered the game with only 2 hits in 30 times at bat, collected 3 hits - 2 singles and a double - and he scored 2 runs. The catcher, who also entered the game having thrown out only 4 of 14 base-stealers, nailed 2 of 4 Dodgers who tried to steal second. Brooks stroked a pair of run-scoring singles against Jerry Reuss, one in the third inning, the other in the fifth. Both runs Brooks singled across were unearned, the first the result of a dropped throw by Reuss at first base, the second the result of a wild throw by Greg Brock, the Los Angeles first baseman. Reuss's wild pitch in the seventh enabled Jose Oquendo to score from third base. But those were the only plays that went into the records as miscues. Unrecorded were the following: the misplay by Brock and Reuss on Reynolds's grounder in the third inning; Sax's inability to catch Mookie Wilson's foul pop in the fifth (after which Wilson singled home a run); Brooks's fifth-inning grounder that went under Brock's glove for a hit, and the misplay by Reuss and Sax on Reynolds's grounder in the seventh. After Brock and Reuss messed up Reynolds's hit in the third, Reuss dropped Sax's throw on Allen's routine grounder (Brock already had missed it). One out later, Brooks singled Reynolds home with the first run. Reynolds led off the fifth with a double and remained at second as Reuss retired the next two batters. The pitcher also got Wilson to hit a foul pop near the right-field line, but Sax missed the ball. Wilson then singled Reynolds across, made it to second safely on Brock's wild throw after Reuss had him picked off first and scored as Brooks singled for the second time. Finally, in the seventh, Reynolds hit a bouncer that couldn't be handled by first Reuss and then Sax after it had hit Reuss's glove. Reynolds, who received credit for a hit on the play, later was out at third on a sacrifice bunt attempt, but Oquendo, who also singled, scored on Reuss's wild pitch. The Mets played flawlessly, and Allen pitched nearly the same way. All six of the Los Angeles hits were singles. The right-hander, who has had problems this season on and off the field, struck out seven.

254-> SOVIET EMIGRE'S HELPER
To the Editor: Your March 10 story about the successful attempt of a recent Soviet emigre, Peter Rabinovich, to pass the New York bar omitted one rather significant fact: Mr. Rabinovich, who earned very little money during preparation for the bar examination, received a loan from the Baron de Hirsch Fund, founded in 1891 to help Jewish immigrants. We set up a small fund to help selected recently arrived immigrants establish themselves in this country. THEODOR NORMAN, Managing Director, Baron de Hirsch Fund, New York, March 10, 1983

255-> THE REGION; Divers Find Body Of Missing Boy
Six scuba divers combing the bed of Tuthill Creek on Long Island today recovered the body of a 6-year-old boy who tumbled into the water last Monday while playing with a friend. The discovery of the body of the boy, Joey Rotondo, ended a threeday search. When the body was removed from the water and placed on the sand, the boy was clothed in the same red jacket, blue jeans and sneakers he wore when he disappeared. The body was taken to the County Medical Examiner's office in Hauppauge, where family members identified the child. A 6-year-old friend of the boy had at first gone home and told his parents he had lost sight of Joey in the woods, setting off a search there. Later, the friend led the police to the spot where Joey had fallen into the creek, an inlet of Great South Bay. The body was recovered about 150 yards away. The body was found two hours after today's search began and after a total of 16 hours of diving over three days.

256-> The Bishops and the Bomb
The two-year quest of the Catholic bishops for an answer to the nuclear dilemma is as important as the result. In composing their 150-page pastoral letter, they heard scores of experts and weighed hundreds of nuances. The key bishops and their assistants now know as much about the issues as laymen can. Their sense of moral challenge is admirable. And many of their strategic judgments, like the finding that nuclear war can never be winnable, are beyond dispute. But their letter also contains ambiguities, contradictions and dubious policy counsel that other advocates of arms control will surely want to question. Though they speak to the moral questions of war and weaponry, the bishops plainly hope to add political weight to the antinuclear movement now rallied behind the call for a weapons freeze. Though they thus come perilously close to an undesirable involvement of the church in political action, bishops have an obvious duty to concern themselves with preparations for mass destruction and killing. In their fusion of theology, morality, strategy and politics, the bishops wind up in a curious position. They are not only attacking the main doctrines of the Reagan Administration but also straying far from the prevailing theories of the arms control community. They reluctantly accept America's possession of nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet nuclear attack, pending complete disarmament. But they also characterize any use of nuclear weapons as immoral -thus emboldening Archbishop John Quinn to call upon Catholics in the armed forces to reject any order to fire them. The obvious contradiction is that a weapon that can in no circumstances be fired cannot very well deter an attack. The bishops also undermine any strategy of deterrence by opposing the targeting of Soviet cities - even to threaten retaliation for the destruction of American cities. This insistence, as in the prenuclear era, that military attacks must be limited to military targets paradoxically validates the view of those who want to prepare to fight ''limited'' nuclear war. In supporting a nuclear weapons freeze, the bishops seem unmindful of the risk that such negotiations, if successful, could end up freezing the existing nuclear instabilities and actually add to the risk of war. And by repudiating NATO's threat that it may have to use nuclear weapons against a massive Soviet conventional attack, they oppose not only the views of allied governments but of the bishops of West Germany and France. Fundamentally, the American bishops' approach falters on the assumption that the nuclear dilemma can eventually be resolved by eliminating rather than controlling nuclear weapons. But there is no known way to get rid of The Bomb, no way to guard against all possible production or concealments of warheads. That is why, for a quarter-century, negotiations have focused on limiting and reducing delivery systems. Even reductions of Soviet and American nuclear weapons, while useful, are less important than achieving a stable nuclear balance. Too much reduction could add to instability; a small number of concealed weapons could make one side dominant. None of this means mankind has to learn to love The Bomb. But it does have to learn how to live with it and manage the problems it poses. There's no place to hide, even in morality.

257-> ALEKSANDR ZHIROV, SKIER, 24, KILLED IN AUTOMOBILE MISHAP
Aleksandr Zhirov, at one time considered the best Alpine skier in the Soviet Union, died today of injuries suffered in an automobile accident, the press agency Tass reported. Tass said the accident had occurred near Yakhroma, about 50 miles southwest of Moscow, but gave no details. Mr. Zhirov, 24 years old, was ''the biggest hope of Soviet sports fans'' for the Winter Olympics next year in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, Tass said. ''His loss is irreplaceable for the Soviet team.'' All of Mr. Zhirov's success in the World Cup, skiing's top circuit, came during a 15-day period in March 1981, when he won three giant slaloms and one slalom.

258-> THE EVENING HOURS
SUDDENLY, the party pace has quickened. It's May, the last chance toa ssemble large groups of the ''right'' people before summer. As one h ectic partygoer observed: ''If you want to give a big party, it has t o be in October or May. That's when everyone's in town.'' Everyone, this week, included Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, Lord and Lady Olivier, Bob and Dolores Hope and Nancy Reagan (who popped into town to pick up an award from Phoenix House). Prince and Princess Michael are here for sundry events of the Britain Salutes New York festival and are heading down to the Kentucky Derby. Wednesday, they took a night off to attend a private dinner given by Peter de Savary, a British oil magnate, real-estate developer and chairman of the Victory Syndicate, which hopes to take the America's Cup from the United States this summer. Since Mr. de Savary's first building in New York, St. James's Tower, happens to have a $7.5 million penthouse apartment as yet unsold, he borrowed the digs, which are bigger than his own on a lower floor. Tables, Oriental rugs and potted plants were rented, a group of musicians was hired, a caterer and white-gloved waiters were engaged and 60 British and American guests were invited to dine, dance and enjoy the view from the apartment's wraparound terraces. Dress was black tie, but the mood was informal enough for everyone to join in singing ''Happy Birthday'' when a surpise cake was set in front of Claire Overton, wife of Hugh Overton, British consul general in New York. Then Mr. de Savary asked Princess Michael to present a miniature model of the America's Cup to Robert McCullough of the New York Yacht Club. His idea was that it would replace the real cup when the British win it. But the Princess had her own ideas. ''Isn't this pretty,'' she said. ''I'm supposed to present it to Mr. McCullough, but I'm not going to. I'm going to keep it so we're sure to have one, and if we win, we'll have both. We British may be outnumbered, but we're not outwitted.'' RAPHAEL PHILIPSON was back in New York this week from his retirementh ome in Goleta, Calif. The 85-year-old widower was here for a reunionw ith ''his boys.'' Phipsy, as they call him, was faculty adviser to t he De Witt Clinton High School paper from 1928 to 1955 and came to b e regarded as the Bronx's own Mr. Chips, with students like Paddy C hayefsky and Richard Avedon. He keeps a card file on former s tudents, sends out a yearly newsletter and holds a reunion every f ive years. Nearly a hundred men (a few with their wives) showed up Tuesday evening for wine, beer, sandwiches, coffee and memories. ''Phipsy told my wife I was a troublemaker and would have been a juvenile delinquent if it weren't for him and The Clinton News,'' recalled Bill Kitay, class of '35. ''I thought I was a nice, quiet boy!'' Then Mr. Philipson, wearing the huaraches everyone swore he'd been wearing for 50 years, said he'd be flying to Zurich the next day, and then to Germany to visit old friends, including ''a girl I met in Rome in 1935.'' DOROTHY LAMOUR was here for one of the many parties celebrating Bob H ope's 80th birthday. During supper in the Rainbow Room, she said: ' 'I went to the South Seas last year for the first time, after all t hose movies, and it was as beautiful as the back lot of Paramount.'' L ORD and Lady Olivier were guests of honor at a black-tie dinner at the Ford Foundation Tuesday after a screening of ''King Lear'' that had the audience in tears. ''Where's the ladies' room?'' Celeste Holm asked as she left the screening room. ''We've been crying so much, I feel in need of repairs.'' She wasn't alone. The ladies' room was awash in runny mascara. ''It's hard to make the transition from the film to standing around having cocktails,'' remarked Lee Traub. But Marife Hernandez, one of the guiding lights behind Britain Salutes New York, was beaming. ''Everybody says, 'You don't look tired,' '' she said. ''Why should I? How many times do you work on something and everything turns out right?'' DAVID LLOYD-JACOB, who came up with the idea for the British f estival in the first place, was breathing a sigh of relief at a c ocktail party at Avery Fisher Hall before Monday night's London S ymphony opening. ''All the big events are done with now,'' he said. ''One day we went to nine things, and it got to 'If this is 5:30, we must be upside down!' ''

262-> U.S. FEARS DISCORD WITH MAJOR ECONOMIC ALLIES AT ECONOMIC TALKS
Despite the Reagan Administration's efforts to assure a harmonious economic summit conference at Williamsburg, Va., over the Memorial Day weekend, aides are worried that the meeting may be marked by sharp disagreements. In interviews today, officials at the White House and State Department said President Reagan hoped the conferees could ''agree to disagree'' amicably on matters such as the charge by France that American budget deficits and high interest rates are damaging the world economy. They added that the seven heads of state who will attend the meeting, scheduled for May 28-30, had powerful incentives to avoid a divisive conference like the one last year in Versailles, France. The nations involved are the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Attitude of the Participants ''Every one of these people, for their own reasons, does not want a squabble-prone summit,'' one official said. ''They are all acutely aware that a good deal of credibility of the summit process has drained away and that they have to be seen addressing one main thing: whether we are going to have a sustainable, noninflationary economic recovery.'' As the aides made final preparations for the summit conference, to take place in the 18th-century atmosphere of Williamsburg, they listed these points of contention: - American interest rates and budget deficits. In recent days, President Francois Mitterrand has said that American failure to bring down interest rates is disrupting the world economy, forcing the value of the franc to plunge in relation to the dollar and damaging French chances of recovery. - Trade. Although the summit participants are reportedly set to agree in principle that tariff barriers should be lowered, they also accuse each other of raising such barriers in practice. Specific trade issues are not expected to be discussed at length, however. - Third-world debt. Reagan Administration aides have pressed the European allies to accept the view that the only way developing countries can repay their debts is to be able to increase their exports. These aides say the Europeans are resisting commitments to reduce tariff barriers for third-world products. - Monetary restructuring. Administration officials are highly skeptical about President Mitterrand's call for a worldwide conference to set up a new structure to stabilize international currency exchange rates. Mr. Reagan's aides say that if the industrial nations reach a ''convergence'' of their individual economic approaches, currency rates will stabilize automatically. Contrary to the fears of several months ago, Administration officials said they did not expect wide rifts on the issue of economic relations between the Western nations and the Soviet bloc. It was this cluster of issues that proved most disruptive at the Versailles summit meeting. In recent weeks, the United States and its allies have agreed at the ministerial level to tighten high-technology shipments to the Russians. Agreement has also been reached to use caution in relying on the Eastern bloc for natural gas and other energy sources and to exercise ''commercial prudence'' in subsidizing export credits to the Eastern bloc. The controversy over Mr. Mitterrand's recent call for ''a new Bretton Woods'' monetary conference illustrates the Administration's apprehension over the Williamsburg meeting, officials said. The French leader's reference was to the landmark conference of wartime leaders in Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944. That meeting set up the world's system of fixed currency exchange rates. The Bretton Woods agreement ended in 1971 when President Nixon ended the convertibility of dollars into gold. Last year the Versailles conference was split over whether currency intervention was an appropriate way to stabilize exchange rates. Countries intervene in foreign-exchange trading by having their central banks buy or sell currencies, buying to halt declines in currency value, selling when the currency's value is too high in relation to others. . The participating nations agreed to examine the matter. Their study was completed in April with an agreement that ''coordinated'' intervention in foreign-exchange markets was occasionally appropriate. Since that accord among finance ministers was reached, Administration officials have felt that the issue would not prove divisive at Williamsburg. But in interviews today, they said they were now not so sure because of Mr. Mitterrand's recent sharp criticisms. ''With Mitterrand, you never know how hard he is going to push,'' one official said. Another senior official, asked if Mr. Reagan was apprehensive about French actions, said: ''Isn't everybody always apprehensive about the French? It just goes with the territory.'' Adding to the concern of American officials is the fact that, for the first time, the summit coordinators have been directed not to produce a prewritten draft of a final statement that might help bridge differences before the conference takes place. Mr. Reagan insisted that no such document be prepared because he feared it would hamper the free-wheeling exchange he hopes for at Williamsburg. But Administration officials disclosed that a six-page document embodying ideas for possible agreement among summit partipants had been circulated recently among the summit coordinators, or ''personal representatives,'' of the summit leaders. Mr. Reagan's representative is W. Allen Wallis, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. A separate document prepared by Mr. Wallis and made available earlier this month reflected recommended positions for the United States. According to the six-page draft, the summit leaders would agree to ask the director of the International Monetary Fund to join with finance ministers to ''consider the part which might be played'' by an international monetary conference. An Administration official said that if the summit leaders agreed to this language in their final statement, it would probably satisfy Mr. Mitterrand. However, two officials reported that there is a split among President Reagan's advisers as to whether Mr. Reagan should agree even to this language.

263-> I.R.A.'S A HIT WITH TAXPAYER
About 10 percent of the nation's adult population has opened individual retirement accounts for 1982, and an additional 5 percent say they plan to do so, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. The national poll suggested that, by April 11, Americans had put about $30 billion in the tax-free I.R.A. accounts for the 1982 tax year so far, much more than the $18.8 billion total estimated by the Treasury Department for the entire tax year. The Treasury's estimate, made this week, is $10 billion higher than the figure it provided in January. Some economists, such as Jay N. Woodworth, vice president of the Bankers Trust Company, say that the extraordinary surge in the taxexempt I.R.A. accounts could have a profound effect on the nation's economy by increasing the Federal budget deficit because of smaller tax collections, by deflating the nation's money supply and by suppressing the growth of retail sales. Treasury economists acknowledge that their latest estimate may be far off the mark and that inflows into the accounts may be far greater than their own estimates. But J. Gregory Ballentine, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Analysis, contended yesterday that, even if the inflow amounted to $30 billion, the effect on the budget would be negligible. And Treasury officials emphasized that the rapid rise could have a positive effect on the economy in that it could significantly raise the nation's savings rate and provide long-term funds for such investments as housing, factories and capital equipment. The Times/CBS News Poll, involving telephone interviews with 1,489 people from April 7 through 11, indicated that the I.R.A.'s have been most attractive to people in upper income brackets. Excluding all retired Americans and all individuals out of work and not looking for jobs from those surveyed, 19 percent, or almost 1 out of every 5 adult Americans, opened an account by early April. The attraction of the accounts is twofold. First, taxpayers may deduct any funds deposited in such accounts from taxable income, thus reducing the taxes they must pay. Next, income earned on I.R.A. balances is exempt from income taxes until the money is withdrawn, usually when the individual reaches retirement age. The accounts, which were created in 1974, became particularly attractive for 1982 because of a change in the law that made just about everyone eligible. Previously, individuals who were covered by other pension plans were not permitted to open I.R.A.'s. Unusual Aspect An extremely unusual aspect of the accounts is that individuals can make deposits into them that reduce 1982 taxable income as late as today, the deadline for 1982 tax filings. In addition, individuals requesting the four-month extension to file their 1982 income tax may make 1982 I.R.A. investments up to Aug. 15. The survey showed that, the higher a family's income, the more likely it was to have established an I.R.A. Of those with family incomes of more than $40,000 a year, 28 percent had opened an account. This dropped to 17 percent for those earning $30,000 to $40,000, and to 10 percent for those earning $20,000 to $29,999. The proportion fell to 6 percent for those earning $10,000 and $19,999, and to 2 percent for those earning less than $10,000. Age also appears to be a factor. Some 18 percent of those between 45 and 64 years old had set up an account for 1982. The figure dropped to 14 percent for those aged 30 to 44, and to 5 percent for those 18 to 29. The study also showed that, the more confident people were about their ability to live on their future retirement income, the more likely they were to set up an I.R.A., which some bankers said might simply reflect the individual's general financial well-being. Among those who said they were very confident that their retirement income would be enough ''to live on adequately,'' 23 percent said they had opened an account for the 1982 tax year. Only 7 percent of those who expressed no confidence in their retirement income had opened an account for 1982. Similarly, people who are already covered by some kind of pension plan other than Social Security were more likely than those who were not to have set up an I.R.A. for the first time. Eighteen percent of those covered by a pension plan reported opening accounts, while only 9 percent of those not covered by a pension plan had done so. Among the $30,000 and higher group, 30 percent of those expressing a great deal of confidence in their retirement income had opened accounts, while only about 20 percent of those with some confidence, not much confidence or no confidence had done so. Confirming these findings, bankers said the ability to put together enough money to invest in an I.R.A. was a major factor in the decision to open an account. Teddy Marie Sitter, director Telephone exchanges called in compiling The New York Times/ CBS News Poll were selected by computer to insure representative sampling, and the results were weighted and adjusted to account for household size, region, race, sex, age and education. Page A13. of Citibank's tax-shelter center, said she feared that many people did not understand that they need not invest the maximum amount ($2,000 for an individual) to start an account. The survey findings indicated that the surge in the accounts had been considerably greater than many had expected. Bankers say the rush into the accounts began in the first week of April, just before the poll interviews began. One bank estimated that 10 percent of its total I.R.A. receipts for the 1982 tax year arrived in that one week. And the inflows have been accelerating each day. An increase in I.R.A.'s affects the nation's money supply because balances in the retirement accounts are not included in the money supply. It is believed that most of money transferred to I.R.A.'s comes from accounts that are included in the money supply. Thus, to the degree that the money supply is reduced, the Federal Reserve has greater leeway to inject more money into the economy, which could stimulate economic activity.

264-> IN AN UPSTATE COMMUNITY, TOXINS, FEARS AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
There are at least 14,000 toxic-waste dumps in the United States, and one is in this small town of Moreau in the shadow of the Adirondacks. The Caputo pit, as it is known, is neither the most nor the least dangerous of them. Like thousands of other communities with toxic-waste dumps, Moreau will never become a household name like Love Canal or Times Beach. No agency seems likely to buy this town of 12,000 - as the Federal Government did Times Beach, Mo. - and suddenly solve its problem. The story of Moreau - whose dump the Government considers the 140th-worst toxic-waste site in the nation - is not a story of extremes. If there is such a thing as a typical town plagued by toxic waste, it may be this one. Amid fear, anger and doubt, Moreau has searched for six years for solutions, only to find them temporary and partial. And as that search has continued, according to state and town tests, the toxins dumped into the Caputo pit 20 to 30 years ago have spread - into the soil, the air, the local water supply and the food chain. The people most worried are the 160 families who live within 3,000 feet of the pit. Many of these tradesmen and small-business men built their homes in the area because, with its evergreens and open fields, it reminded them of ''the country.'' Now those same residents tell of ailments ranging from recurrent skin rashes to miscarriages and cancer. They say their trauma has gone beyond the medical, to a loss of patience and faith in state environmental and health authorities. Even some of their fellow townspeople have fought Moreau's attempts at a cleanup of the dump, calling it unnecessary and too expensive. The residents' basic questions persist. What is the extent of the danger? What health problems, if any, has it caused? And, they say, thus far no one has ventured any answers. ''It's like playing Russian roulette,'' Robert Buttles, who lives 2,800 feet from the dump, said of the toxic waste. ''You don't know where it'll go or what it'll do next.'' A Discovery Spawns Questions and Worries One day in 1973, Chris Crofut, then 14 years old and a bottle collector, went scavenging. He came upon an area that ''looked like someone's garbage dump,'' strewn with industrial barrels and small, batterylike objects filled with liquid. Curious, Chris brought one home and showed it to his mother, who recognized it as a capacitor, an electrical device. The next day, he recalled, he had a skin rash. His mother put the capacitor in the family garage and told Chris it was dangerous. She did not know how dangerous until 1976. At her clerical job in Moreau Town Hall here in the village of South Glens Falls, Mrs. Crofut overheard a man from the State Department of Environmental Conservation asking if anyone knew the site of a chemical dump in Moreau, which is in Saratoga County. ''I put two and two together,'' Mrs. Crofut said, ''and knew that's where Chris had been. The man was talking about General Electric, and everyone around here knows G.E. means capacitors.'' In hearings on pollution of the Hudson River, General Electric had told the state of seven toxic-waste dumps, one in Moreau. General Electric said it had hired a company to dispose of 452 tons of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, and other poisonous solvents by placing them in the Caputo pit in the 1950's and 1960's. At the time, such disposal was legal. Capacitor Filled With PCB's The capacitor Chris brought home, it turned out, was filled with PCB's, a suspected carcinogen. So were the barrels he had seen. A state report, issued in November 1978, found PCB's in the pit's soil at a concentration 15 times what was then the Federal safety standard -and 150 times the more stringent current standard. Tests of air above the pit showed PCB levels as high as 270 times the nonbinding state guideline. It worried Carol Van Guilder, a nearby homeowner. For years, her son, Jay, had played around the pit. And for years, she said, he had suffered from rashes, blisters and swelling involving his arms and face and even parts of his body covered by clothing. ''That pit always had the wierdest smell,'' recalled Jay, now 18. ''Not like an outdoors smell. And every time we went there, we got these funny rashes. We thought it was poison ivy.'' Mrs. Van Guilder said she took Jay to various doctors 18 times in 1977 and 1978. They diagnosed his skin eruptions as anything from shingles to a staphylococcus infection. The last doctor, John Braico, advised the family to take Jay to a psychiatrist. Dr. Braico said he changed his mind after hearing of the PCB dump, and came to believe that the boy's rash was caused by exposure to the toxin. In November 1978, Dr. Braico sent blood samples from Jay and four of the boy's friends - who also played near the dump and had skin problems - to the State Department of Health for analysis of PCB content. Neither Dr. Braico nor the families ever received the results. Dr. Braico said it was the only time the Health Department had not given him the findings of a blood test. Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the department, said recently that the results ''somehow disappeared in the system.'' Rashes and Vomiting Word about Jay Van Guilder and the dump, meanwhile, brought forth other stories. ''We all wondered: 'Why is everyone this way? Why are we all itching and scratching?' '' said Mr. Buttles, who lives near the Van Guilders. ''I went to a dermatologist, and he told me I had sensitive skin.'' Kenneth and Betty Wimette recalled their daughter, Debby, breaking out in rashes after playing near the dump. Gerald Smith remembered his dog vomiting after foraging in the area. Frank Hardwick, the Moreau town engineer, said he vomited and had diarrhea after every visit to the dump. Hearing the reports, the Town Supervisor, R. Gardner Congdon, declared a state of emergency in late 1978 and spent $50,000 for removal of about 50 barrels and 120 cubic yards of contaminated soil. In July 1979, the town and the State Department of Environmental Conservation placed a clay-and-manure ''cap'' on the pit. Mr. Congdon had to defend his actions in State Supreme Court in a suit brought by Ernest Jacobie, a Moreau resident. Mr. Jacobie contended that the cleanup was an illegal expenditure of town funds. He lost the case. New Evidence, And 'False Security' Gone Experts, meanwhile, were warning that the cleanup was only ''a temporary response,'' as a state hazardous-waste specialist wrote. Another expert, Meyer Scolnick, then the regional director of enforcement in the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, wrote that the capping did not ''address itself to possible ground-water contamination.'' Robert F. Flacke, then the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, wrote of his suspicion that PCBcontaminated soil had been dumped on roads near the Caputo pit - either out of sloppiness or for dust control. For all the warnings, it would be more than three years before extensive state tests were made on PCB contamination along the roads. Tests were taken in 1979 for PCB's in the ground water - they found none - but three years passed before the state checked for other toxic solvents in the water. Most residents assumed they were safe. The most visible signs of the dump, after all - the barrels and the yellow, jellylike soil - had been covered or removed. ''Talk about being lulled into false security,'' said Mr. Hardwick, the town engineer. Accord With G.E. The prospects seemed even more promising for Moreau in September 1980. The state and General Electric signed a consent decree in which the company agreed to pay to clean the pit and monitor it for 30 years thereafter. Mr. Flacke, who served as Commissioner until January of this year, hailed the agreement as a milestone in hazardous-waste removal. It marked the first time, he said, that a company agreed to remove toxins it had legally dumped years earlier. ''Moreau,'' Mr. Flacke said recently, ''is one of the best examples of a rapid cleanup.'' Yet Mr. Congdon, the Town Supervisor, called the agreement ''a sweetheart deal'' and spoke of the state's ''incompetence'' in Moreau. The state removed 132 barrels of waste from near the pit last summer. And last month, state officials approved General Electric's plan to seal the top, bottom and sides of the pit with clay. Work may begin later this spring, state officials say. But the pit itself, the town found last summer, was only the beginning of its problems. Worry About the Water Mr. Congdon and Mr. Hardwick had never stopped worrying about water contamination. The soil beneath the pit is sandy. Beneath it, an acquifer flows southeast toward homes, a public school and, ultimately, the reservoir for Fort Edward, a Washington County community of 3,700. Pressed by Mr. Congdon and Mr. Hardwick, the State Health Department tested 34 wells in Moreau between March and July 1982. It found toxic solvents in 14, two at officially unsafe levels. Further tests by Mr. Hardwick and Charles Rich, a private hydrogeologist, found unsafe levels of toxins in 27 of the 151 wells they checked. Earl Clark, like several other residents, came home one day last summer to find a notice from the state on his door. It warned him not to drink or even bathe in his tap water. Vinyl chloride, a suspected carcinogen, had been found in his well at 60 times the state safety level. Carole Hawkins learned from town officials that her family's drinking water contained four times the limit for vinyl chloride and exactly the limit for trichloroethlyene, another solvent. She said she began to wonder whether the water could have caused her three miscarriages or her 12-year-old daughter's headaches - migraines so severe the child took four adult aspirins a day. No doctor, Mrs. Hawkins said, could give her a sure answer. ''We had this house built before we were married,'' she said. ''And we've lived here for 18 years. All that time, our kids have been drinking contaminated water and playing in contaminated air.'' Feelings of Betrayal Mrs. Hawkins said she felt betrayed. She said she had taken the state's word that her water was safe after the 1979 tests for PCB's. ''We bought our homes in good faith, we paid our taxes in good faith,'' she said. ''Where was the good faith for us?'' Charlotte and Arthur Lewis saved for 20 years to build a house on property next to the Caputo dump. They said they assumed it was safe after the capping of the pit in 1979. And they might have continued to believe so, they said, but for Ward Stone, a state wildlife pathologist. Last July, Mr. Stone stopped to ask directions from a neighbor of the Lewises. On that muggy night, he recalled, he instantly recognized the sweetish smell of PCB's in the air. Mr. Stone returned to make a series of tests. He found concentrations of PCB's in the Lewises' lawn at 20 times the Federal safety limit. He said he found PCB's throughout the food chain - in the tissues of grass, grape leaves, insects, grasshoppers, mice, shrews, toads and turtles. 'We Were Hostages' ''The state told us to keep the doors and windows closed,'' Mrs. Lewis recalled, ''told us, don't mow the lawn, don't eat outside, don't turn on the air conditioner. We were hostages in our own home, for God's sake.'' From a $55,000 home, the Lewises moved to a two-bedroom apartment. And they wondered if they had already been harmed by exposure to the PCB's. ''I'm just afraid if I have kids, what'll happen,'' said their daughter, Karen, who is 16 years old. ''And when I got married that was supposed to be my house. Now I can never live there.'' She began to cry and ran into a bathroom. ''Nobody should have to live with the pressure,'' said Mrs. Lewis. ''Everything is just so confusing.'' She, too, began to cry. ''We try to hang tight,'' she said, ''but it's not easy. We do a lot of crying around here.'' The Story Continues, The Uncertainty Remains The story of Moreau has many postscripts, but no ending. In September, State Attorney General Robert Abrams sued General Electric for $30 million to clean ''off site'' contamination from the dump. General Electric is fighting the suit in State Supreme Court. General Electric denies that the off site contamination came from its toxic waste, and says that, in any case, the 1980 consent decree settled all matters related to the Caputo pit. The company declined to comment further. Trying the case could consume years, said Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for the Attorney General. Mr. Congdon, the Town Supervisor, bought water filters last fall for 70 families with $36,000 of town funds. He was promptly sued by Mr. Jacobie - the same man who sued him in 1979 - for illegally spending public money. The case has yet to be heard in State Supreme Court. 'We Did Well' In retrospect, state officials laud their own actions in Moreau. ''We did well on this case,'' said Eldred Rich, an assistant state commissioner of environmental conservation. ''It took a long time. But we were breaking new ground and therefore we were a little more cautious, a little more careful.'' Most of the families who lived near the dump when it was discovered still do. Few feel that they can afford to move while paying off a mortgage. Real-estate agents, they say, will not even try to sell their current homes. ''You sit here,'' said Carol Van Guilder, ''and every penny you've saved your whole life is in this house. Even if we wanted to move, we couldn't. Who would buy it? ''And when you think about it, why bother moving? We could move near another dump site and never know it. We never knew what we were on top of here.''

265-> U.S. ENCOUNTERS POLITICAL SNAG IN SECURITY COUNCIL
The United States and its allies began drafting a Security Council resolution today condemning the destruction of the Korean airliner and quickly ran into a political problem, Western diplomats said. The United States is eager to denounce the Soviet Union by name for downing the passenger plane but was warned that such a course might cost the allies several votes of support. Washington has been told that some third world members of the Council will condemn the act but not the actor and might abstain if the Soviet Union is named. Conversely, third world nations sympathetic to Washington have said the resolution will win at least the minimum nine votes required for passage and possibly more if the Soviet Union goes unmentioned. In any event, diplomats agreed, a Soviet veto is taken for granted. What is involved, then, envoys said, is a political gesture in the Council. 'Horror, Outrage, Dismay' Charles M. Lichenstein, a deputy United States delegate, told reporters that ''any resolution, one responsive to the situation, should in some way or other reflect the horror, outrage, dismay and disbelief of most of the international community.'' The United States, concerned about its own domestic opinion, apparently feels compelled to press for the strongest possible text. Within the 15-member Council, Washington counts on 5 sure votes besides its own: the Netherlands, France, Britain, Togo and Zaire. The Soviet Union is certain of another negative vote only from Poland. Nicaragua, it is thought, would either abstain or vote with Moscow. Question marks hang over China, Malta, Guyana, Jordan, Zimbabwe and Pakistan. Their assent would give Washington a satisfactory total; their abstention or nonparticipation could doom the resolution to a humiliating defeat in which the Soviet vote would not even count as a veto. The Netherlands, France and Britain are all among the drafting group. Others among the drafters at the United States mission today were South Korea, Japan, Canada and Australia. Vote Expected Next Week Mr. Lichenstein said the group will finish its work on a preliminary text late Thursday or Friday. Then the political bargaining will begin. A vote in the Council is expected next week. At the Council's open meeting today, third world nations friendly to the United States added their voices to the chorus condemning the Soviet deed. Tommy T. B. Koh of Singapore called on the Russians to revise their laws prescribing the destruction of planes breaching their airspace and bring these rules ''into conformity with international law.'' Moscow's conduct this week, Mr. Koh said, ''reminds one of a person who has done something wrong but cannot find the courage to admit it.'' Poland broke the long string of speeches attacking Moscow with a low- keyed defense. Wlodzimierz Natorf, the Warsaw delegate, said the failure of the Korean pilot to land on the order of Soviet planes demonstrated that he was on an intelligence mission. Above all, Mr. Natorf said, the United States was exploiting the incident to promote anti-Communism, increase world tensions and justify a military buildup. He urged cooler heads and words to prevail.

266-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Credibility Gap
When he was convicted of assaulting a woman in San Antonio in 1978, he was just 15 years old, he had a clean record, and his promise to reform was so moving that the judge suspended the youth's 10-year sentence and placed him on probation. When the young man came back to court yesterday to plead guilty to violating that probation, his promise to reform was just as fervent, but the judge had heard it before. Addressing Tony Ayala, the former top-ranked junior-middleweight contender who was recently convicted of raping a schoolteacher in West Paterson, N.J., the judge, Mike Machado, said: ''Mr. Ayala, you stood before this court several years ago, and you made the same statement you're making now - verbatim. When you stood before me, you had a clean record. Your record is no longer clean.'' With that, Judge Machado revoked Ayala's probation and ordered him to serve a 10-year sentence. Ayala, who pleaded guilty to the probation violation after Texas authorities had agreed not to prosecute him on a 1982 burglary charge, may never serve time in a Texas prison, however. His 10-year Texas sentence was made concurrent with his 35-year New Jersey sentence, and, unless the New Jersey conviction is overturned on appeal, Ayala will complete the 10-year Texas term five years before he is eligible for parole.

267-> Planned Parenthood Regains Status in U.S. Charity Drive
Federal District Judge Joyce Green temporarily reinstated the Planned Parenthood Federation to the Federal charitable campaign today, and Government lawyers then suggested they would fight the case no further. The director of the Office of Personnel Management, Donald Devine, had banned Planned Parenthood on Wednesday from the group of 150 charities in the Combined Federal Campaign for 1983, the Federal workers' version of the United Way. Groups opposing abortion hailed that decision.

268-> SCOUTING; Ring Computers
The computer age came to the boxing ring, or at least to the edge of it, at Madison Square Garden last night for a card that featured Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini's defense of the World Boxing Association's lightweight title. This was the first card in New York State for which, under new state measures designed to enhance fighter safety, a portable terminal was available at ringside. Such a terminal will be present at every card in the state as soon as a sufficient number of State Athletic Commission employees are trained in its use. ''It will be hooked in to our main computer in Albany and to the one in our New York office,'' said John Branca, the commission's chairman. ''If there is a last-minute substitution, we will be able to instantly check our files and get the substitute's complete record.''

269-> SNIPER IN LEBANON KILLS U.S. MARINE
One United States marine was killed and another wounded today when Marine positions at Beirut International Airport came under sniper fire from neighboring Shiite Moslem quarters, a Marine spokesman said. The spokesman, Maj. Robert Jordan, said the marine who died was struck in the chest by sniper fire from the Shiite areas of Hayy al Sollum and Burj al Brajneh. The wounded man was hit in both legs. Another spokesman, Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, said the sniper fire was part of a series of attacks in the last few days apparently aimed at provoking the Marines to retaliate. The violence erupted hours after two Lebanese Moslem groups, the Shiite paramilitary organization called Amal and the mainly Druse Progressive Socialist Party, announced that they were suspending their membership in a committee of Lebanese factions that has been overseeing the 18-day-old cease-fire in the Beirut area. Lebanese Come Under Fire Lebanese Army positions in Burj al Brajneh also came under fire, a military spokesman said. Lebanese soldiers at the same time exchanged rocket and artillery fire with anti-Government militiamen at Araya, a hilltop village a few miles east of here along the main Beirut-Damascus highway. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Today's American casualties raised to 5 the number of marines killed and 43 the number wounded since the current wave of violence began at the end of August. A sixth marine was killed when he stepped on an unexploded cluster bomb shortly after the Marine contingent arrived here in September 1982 as part of the international force. The force, consisting of 5,400 members, also includes French, Italian and British troops. In addition to the sniper fire from nearby buildings, the Americans have come under artillery fire from the hills overlooking their positions. In announcing Thursday night that Amal was taking its representative out of the cease-fire committee, the group's president, Nabih Berri, said the action was in protest against measures that undermined the status of the truce. He did not elaborate. But Shiite sources said Amal objected to arrest warrants issued for Shiite soldiers and officers for having failed to report to duty. An army spokesman, however, denied such warrants had been served. Some Refused to Fight Several hundred Shiite and Druse servicemen had declared themselves ''conscientious objectors'' and refused to fight against their co-religionists when Lebanese Moslem militiamen battled with the Christian-commanded Lebanese Army last month. The Progressive Socialist Party, led by Walid Jumblat, declared its support for Amal and suspended its own membership in the secutity committee until further notice. Both factions reiterated their adherence to the cease-fire. But their temporary withdrawal evoked concern about the effectiveness of the committee, which also includes delegates from the Lebanese Army and the Lebanese Front, a Christian group. The move appeared to dim hopes for early progress in the proposed national reconciliation conference of representatives of the Lebanese Government and the nation's warring factions. An agenda for the conference, which has been scheduled for next Thursday, was agreed upon at preparatory talks held here on Thursday. Attacks on U.S. Base Before the cease-fire was agreed upon on Sept. 26, the United States base at Beirut airport came under frequent bombardment from positions held by anti-Government forces in the hills east of the runways. Thursday night a marine was slightly wounded in the left leg while on guard duty outside the consular section of the new building housing the United States Embassy in mainly Moslem West Beirut. The wounds were caused by a grenade thrown from a speeding car. A Marine spokesman said that a hand grenade was thrown on an airport runway the night before but that no one was hurt. Five days ago two marines were slightly wounded by sniper fire from nearby areas. Describing today's incident, Major Jordan said a company of marines on the northeastern perimeter of the airport came under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades in the morning. The two marines were hit while driving separate jeeps. One, identified as Sgt. Allen Soifert, 25 years old, of Nashua, N.H., was shot in the chest. He reportedly died while being flown by helicopter to a hospital aboard the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima, lying off Beirut. The other marine, who was not immediately identified, was also taken to the shipboard hospital. While the casualties were being evacuated from the Marine base at the airport, gunmen fired at the landing pad. Reagan Offers Condolences WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UPI) - President Reagan today telephoned the parents of Sgt. Allen Soifert, the marine killed in Lebanon, to ''express his regrets,'' a Presidential spokesman reported. He said the President spent three minutes on the telephone with Abraham and Joan Romer of Nashua, N.H. Mr. Romer was the sergeant's stepfather. The President also said in a statement issued by the White House, ''We are deeply concerned that our marines continue to come under fire and are saddened by the death today of another marine.''

271-> SUPPLY CRAFT SENT TO SALYUT 7 CREW
An unmanned space freighter, Progress 18, was launched by the Soviet Union yesterday to carry ''expendable materials and various cargoes'' to the two astronauts aboard Salyut 7, the orbiting craft that has reportedly been troubled with malfunctions. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that the freighter was dispatched ''under the program of insuring the further functioning of the orbital scientific station Salyut 7.'' Its cargo presumably includes food, air and other supplies so that the astronauts could remain aloft several more weeks. The Moscow radio said the craft also carried fuel for the Salyut. This development indicated that Soviet officials had no intention of abandoning the Salyut any time soon and that its presumed problems may, indeed, have been magnified in some Western accounts. Soviet officials, moreover, were denying that the astronauts, Aleksandr Aleksandrov and Vladimir Lyakhov, were stranded on a crippled craft. They have been in orbit since June 28. American space experts generally agreed with the Soviet denials, saying that some recent news reports exaggerated the situation by giving the impression that the astronauts were possibly in grave danger. Two Soviet Setbacks Intelligence sources in Washington have said they believe there was a propellant leak Sept. 9 on the Salyut that left half the craft's steering jets unusable. And Soviet officials have acknowledged that a rocket exploded on the launching pad Sept. 27, preventing a new crew of astronauts in a fresh Soyuz craft from visiting and possibly relieving the present crew aboard the Salyut. The accident created some concern for the Salyut astronauts because their own Soyuz ferry craft, attached to the larger Salyut, was reaching the end of its 115-day operational lifetime, as established by Soviet mission rules. James E. Oberg, a Houston-based authority on Soviet space, said in a telephone interview that the Soyuz time- limit was undoubtedly a conservative estimate with a ''wide margin'' for relatively safe operations well beyond the 115 days, which ended yesterday. He said the Soviet engineers had presumably verified that systems aboard the Soyuz, such as batteries and various electronics, were still healthy. Otherwise, Mr. Oberg said, Soviet space officials would be rushing to send up a new Soyuz now, rather than resupplying the Salyut with a cargo ship. Tass did not report when the Progress was supposed to link up with the Salyut. In usual resupply operations, the Progress remains attached to the Salyut's aft port for 10 days to two weeks. While the Progress is attached to the Salyut, with the Soyuz occupying the other docking port, no other craft can visit the Salyut. This led Mr. Oberg to assume that there are no immediate plans for a new attempt to send a new crew of astronauts to the Salyut.

272-> SYDNOR B. PENICK JR.
Sydnor Barksdale Penick Jr., retired chairman of the S. B. Penick Company, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Newark Airport. He was 78 years old and lived in Montclair, N.J. Mr. Penick was chairman of the company until 1967, when it was taken over by C.P.C. International, a food company in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. He was a director of C.P.C. International until he retired in 1975. Mr. Penick is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, Douglas, of Boulder, Colo., and Frank, of Halifax, Nova Scotia; three daughters, Mary Alice Burgin of Ridgewood, N.J., Jeanette Young of Los Angeles, and Margaret Lucy Penick of Montclair; 12 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

273-> THE CHANGING CITY: 18 NEW ARRIVALS
New York City is continuously renewing itself. Old buildings and neighborhoods change irrevocably. Sometimes the new co-exists with the old companionably; sometimes the juxtaposition is startling. A punk boutique replaces a shoe factory that itself replaced the lobby of a fashionable emporium. A bodega sprouts on the ground floor of a 100-year-old frame house that was once a farm. Here is a sampling of newcomers: some innovative new shops, a vest pocket park, public sculptures, an indoor courtyard where one might grab a noontime sandwich, a glistening skyscraper to admire, an elegant ice cream parlor, a courtyard of two, a palace for pizza, a gazebo in Central Park and more, which can be seen on page C24. All are new or unfamiliar and all are in Manhattan, except the baby capybaras (known for their sociability) that have settled in for the winter at the Bronx Zoo. See them. Sample them. Photograph them. Relish them or deplore them. But catch them now. Tomorrow, they may be gone. You can get onion soup a l'Armagnac or a smoked salmon sandwich at L'Ecluse, but its real draw is wine tasting. The little wine bar, newly opened at Bloomingdale's as part of the store's ''F^ete de France,'' may move to a permanent Manhattan spot. Right now, it's tucked into a corner on the fifth floor near the west end of the store, at Lexington and 59th Street. The bar offers 2 1/2-ounce glasses of wine, from $1 for a 1982 Graves Ecluse to $8 for a 1976 Chateau Latour. Hours: today and tomorrow, 11 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; Sunday, noon to 4:30. Information: 705-3799. Walking east from the Avenue of the Americas on 46th or 47th Street, one comes upon one of the newest of the city's vest pocket parks. It has all the usual accouterments: plantings, unobtruding public sculpture, seats and a food stand, in soft-colored brick. But there is an unusual feeling of openness and invention to this park, created by Hideo Sasaki and the Space Design Group and situated behind the International Paper Company building. The jutting angles of Tony Smith's ''Throwback,'' in the center, are echoed gently in the park's multilayered walkways. The childhood pleasure of hopping off curbs and balancing on walls comes back here, spontaneously and without much difficulty. The guard, standing in the front court of the new Chemical Bank headquarters at 277 Park Avenue, smiles broadly when asked where ''the statue'' is. He's used to this question, for ''Taxi,'' a commissioned sculpture by J. Seward Johnson Jr., is so lifelike it defies detection as anything more than a businessman, suit jacket flapping as he races toward Park and 48th Street for a cab. One nail is bitten and a visit to the dentist is in order. Tucked under his arm are a briefcase and overcoat that look like the real thing with an overlay of metal. And the man himself? It seems a rather winsome name for such a towering hero. Still, ''Golden Boy'' the statue has been called, since it went up in 1916 atop of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company building in Lower Manhattan. The 24-foot-high sculpture, created by Evelyn Beatrice Longman, hoists his thunderbolts today in the rotunda of the company's new headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue, near 55th Street. This corporate symbol in bronze and gold leaf is drawing traditionally incurious New Yorkers in droves. Stand for a moment in the rotunda and observe the long shadows of his arm against the massive wall. The Bronx Zoo, at Fordham Road and the Bronx River Parkway, is proud of its baby Mongolian wild horse, the first offspring of a stallion imported from the Soviet Union last year. There are also zebras, a sea lion pup and a proboscis monkey, all six months old or younger. Most endearing of all the new crop, however, are three month-old South American capybaras, right, small, round creatures who inhabit a green hill and pool opposite the Children's Zoo. Most rodents lead solitary lives, according to Jim Doherty, general curator. These are social. The zoo is open Monday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sunday, 10 to 5:30. Admission is $2.50 for adults, $1 for children. Information: 367-1010. Central Park was originally filled with ''rustic shelters'' that enhanced its reputation as an urban oasis. Built of natural materials, they fell prey to vandals and the elements. But interns at the Central Park Conservancy have re-created the Dene Rustic Shelter, perched on a rock at Fifth Avenue and 67th Street. Its fancifully decorated roof and walls lined with benches, all reconstructed with upstate cedars, have already provided a thoroughfare for squirrels, birds and children. Bear right and then take a sharp right up onto the rock from the path between 66th and 67th Streets. The newest of the new may be ''Weathered Wall Painting,'' a facade on the Broome Street wall of a garage at Varick Street, for it changes imperceptibly with every sunny hour or assault of rain. What looks at first glance like an ordinary beat-up city wall, with its dim wash of white and green, is the product of careful layers of paintings of the 80-by-90-foot expanse by Terry Fugate-Wilcox, whose oeuvre has considerably enlivened New York over the last decade or so. Mr. Fugate-Wilcox calls himself an ''actualist.'' He may begin the works of art, he says, but ''the universe finishes them.'' A new face in the ever-changing SoHo scene is the New Museum, which relocated this month to the Astor Building, 583 Broadway. The gallery is a typical SoHo environment of pillars and a long, narrow, slightly industrial-looking interior painted white. But its exhibitions have tended to be unconventional. The current one, ''Language, Drama, Source and Vision,'' celebrates the museum's past with work by 68 of the 300 artists who have shown there in its six years. Open today from noon to 6 P.M.; tomorrow, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and Sunday, noon to 5 P.M. Information: 219-1222.

274-> THE CITY; AIDS Doctor Gets Stay of Eviction
A doctor who treated patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome was granted a temporary injunction yesterday barring tenants of a Greenwich Village cooperative building from evicting him. Acting Justice Ira Gammerman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ordered the injunction against the tenants' group that owns the building, at 49 West 12th Street. The eviction ''would cause irreparable harm not so much to the doctor but to the people who are his patients,'' the judge said at a hearing. The doctor, Joseph A. Sonnabend, is suing the tenants' group, charging that it illegally tried to evict him from his office in the building because he treated patients with AIDS, a disorder that often strikes homosexuals. He said the eviction would violate state human-rights laws. The injunction will remain in effect until a decision is reached in the suit.

275-> SPORTS PEOPLE;
Jon English has lost his latest court effort to continue as Tulane's quarterback. In a 5-2 ruling, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to impose a new stay of a ruling by the National Collegiate Athletic Association declaring him ineligible. English, a Tulane transfer student who had been declared ineligible unless he sat out a year, had appeared in Tulane's first six games under a series of restraining orders pending a full hearing of his claim that he had satisfied the letter of the N.C.A.A. rule by sitting out a year following a previous transfer. When the latest restraining order was lifted earlier this week and an appellate court refused to reimpose it, English took the case to the state's highest court. As a result of its ruling against English, the son of Tulane's coach, Wally English , Tulane's quarterback for today's game against Southwestern Louisiana is expected to be Wade Elmore .

276-> SuperSonics Sold
Sam Schulman, long at odds with the National Basketball Association's hierarchy and other N.B.A. owners, announced today that he had sold the SuperSonics to Barry Ackerley, a 49- year-old Seattle billboard entrepreneur, for $21 million. ''Selling the Sonics is a very traumatic thing for me,'' the colorful and controversial Schulman, 73 years old, said at a Kingdome news conference attended by both principals and General Manager Les Habegger. ''It's almost been part of my sustenance in life. But I had to make a decision. I had to get rid of something and ease the onus and the workload. I decided on the Sonics, because if I retained them I couldn't give them the dedication they deserved.'' Schulman is a multimillionaire from Beverly Hills, Calif. Part of the work load to which he referred involves two new companies, SLM and New Century, that produce movies. He said he had become involved with both concerns during the last year. ''I think I was lucky to find an outstanding Seattle citizen,'' Schulman said of Ackerley. ''He's going to be dedicated to winning, and doing it on a sound basis.'' Much of Schulman's criticism of other owners centered on what he perceived as their role in the escalation of player salaries in recent years. He said today the SuperSonics lost about $1 million last season. He had previously announced that they lost $2 million the season before. Schulman purchased about one- third of the team when it was formed in 1967. The total purchase price was $1.75 million, he said. Ackerley, whose purchase is subject to league approval, said he did not plan to be an owner who jumps into professional sports and believes he is an immediate expert. ''I can guarantee you,'' he said, ''that's not me.'' Schulman and Ackerley said discussions over the sale of the club had been going on for about a month. ''It's kind of difficult for me to go on after a legend, which is what Sam is in Seattle,'' Ackerley said. Asked why Ackerley Communications Inc., the business he heads, decided to buy the Sonics, Ackerley replied: ''We felt it was important for someone in Seattle to run the team.''

277-> SCOUTING; Strawberry Bids Goodbye to Tutor
When Jim Frey was named manager of the Chicago Cubs last week, one of the first phone calls he received came from Darryl Strawberry. It was a conversation of decidedly mixed moods, a parting between professor and pupil. The two became close friends after Strawberry was promoted to the Mets last May. They were sort of thrown together: One month into the big leagues, the rookie was striking out frequently and was batting .167. Frey, a senior coach on the Mets, suggested they work together. So every day they arrived at the stadium several hours early and went to work. Frey threw batting practice to Strawberry for hours, but mostly they sat and discussed the mental discipline it needed to stay in the big leagues. ''The main thing Jim Frey gave me,'' Strawberry said the other day from his home in Los Angeles, ''was faith in myself.'' Strawberry, who ended the season with 26 home runs, had another reason for calling his old tutor: Frey now would be on the other side, trying to get him out when the Mets played the Cubs. ''The day I was named by the Cubs,'' Frey said at the World Series this week, ''Darryl called to congratulate me. Then he wanted to know why I was leaving, and I told him it was just a good opportunity. ''Then he said: 'Now, you'll be trying to get me out. How are you going to pitch to me?' '' ''Darryl, we're not going to pitch to you,'' Frey said. ''We're going to pitch around you.''

278-> THE CITY ;
The Manhattan House of Detention, known as the Tombs, reopened yesterday, nine years after it was ordered closed for conditions so bad that they violated the Constitution. About 130 men, all of them serving short sentences on Rikers Island, are expected to be in the renovated jail by this evening, according to the city's Department of Correction. Some were moved in yesterday. The department said all 426 cells in the jail would be occupied by the end of the year.

279-> TOPICS; FAILURES OF COMMON SENSE; Unlicensed
An appellate court in Manhattan has ruled, 3 to 2, that William R. Frye, though a distinguished journalist and lecturer, was not a ''professional'' who qualifies for the former exemption from New York's unincorporated business tax. Accountants are, and shorthand reporters, but not Mr. Frye. He lacks the ''hallmarks'' of professionalism; he is not, for example, licensed. No matter that, as Justice Theodore Kupferman argued in dissent, it would be unconstitutional to require a journalist to get the Government's permission to write. The dispute might seem academic, since the tax law was changed in 1971 to eliminate the exemption of ''professionals'' like doctors and lawyers. But it was only four years ago that the tax collectors dunned Mr. Frye for $8,725 for the years 1966 through 1970. We've always thought of Mr. Frye as a pro. His writings on international affairs and arms control have graced the pages of The Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times Magazine for many years. The judges had to be impressed when he briefed and argued his own cause, but the Corporation Counsel didn't even show up. The legal department had better send someone, licensed or not, when the case gets to the Court of Appeals.

280-> THE REGION; Committee Favors Yonkers Project
Plans to build a $100 million office park at the site of a former Yonkers city dump have been approved by a committee of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, a spokesman said today. The Budget and Appropriations Committee approved the plan by a 6-0 vote at a meeting Thursday night, said Jim Cavanaugh, a Board of Legislators spokesman. Development of the project, known as the Austin Avenue Industrial Site, still needs approval of the full board, Mr. Cavanaugh said. The board is expected to discuss the matter at its next regular meeting, Oct. 24. The county owns part of the site, and Yonkers owns the rest.

281-> MANILA RALLY SCORNS U.S. BASES
A three-day conference calling for the dismantling of American military installations ended here today with a peaceful rally by several hundred people in front of the American Embassy. Activists from Greece, Guam and Palau were among the participants. Former Senator Jose W. Diokno, secretary general of the Anti-Base Coalition of the Philippines, the organization sponsoring the conference, had ordered that there be no disorderly outbursts. Manila city authorities, who at first had refused permission for the rally, granted a permit in response to an order issued on Tuesday by the Supreme Court. The court's decision, upholding the ''right of free assembly'' under the Philippine constitution, in effect abrogated the tight control of demonstrations imposed under martial law by President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1972 and in official orders since the lifting of military rule in 1981. A resolution adopted at the conference demanding the removal of United States bases here and opposing nuclear weapons and armaments in general was handed to an embassy security officer for delivery to Ambassador Michael H. Armacost. Although the theme of the rally was peace and disarmament, many participants wore T-shirts bearing the name of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the opposition leader whose killing has been followed by almost daily demonstrations against the Marcos Government. The principal United States installations here are Clark Air Force Base and the Subic Bay naval station, both near Manila.

283-> LENT SAYS PANEL ALLOWS HIM TO VOTE ON NYNEX
Representative Norman F. Lent said today that as a result of an opinion by the House Committee on Standards of Ethical Conduct, he intended to continue voting on legislation concerning the reorganization of the nation's telephone system. Mr. Lent, a Republican who represents Nassau County, requested the ruling after it became known that his wife, Barbara Morris Lent, had been hired as a lobbyist for the Nynex Corporation. After the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company on Jan. 1, Nynex will operate the local telephone systems of New York and parts of New England. Second-Ranking Republican Mr. Lent is the second-ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which for the past week has been considering legislation that has been opposed by A.T.& T. and Nynex. The committee, in its letter to Mr. Lent, did not directly comment on whether the situation represented a conflict of interest. Instead, it quoted several rules holding that a member should vote ''unless he has a direct personal or pecuniary interest'' in the pending matter. ''As can be seen then,'' the committee concluded, ''the determination as to whether or not you should vote on matters before your committee is left for you to decide, taking into account the personal or pecuniary interest, if any, you may have in the legislation.'' Calls Decision 'Favorable' A press release issued by Mr. Lent called the decision ''a favorable response.'' In an interview, Mr. Lent said, ''It is abundantly clear to me that I do not have a direct or pecuniary interest in this matter.'' The Congressman added that his wife had a fixed salary that was not dependent on the outcome of the vote on the communications bill and that he had taken public positions consistent with his current position long before she was hired by Nynex. ''If you have an apparent conflict, that may be unfortunate,'' Mr. Lent observed, ''but the rules say you must vote.''

284-> MAN IN THE NEWS; IN EYE OF THE GRENADA STORM
Man in the News Sir Paul Scoon, a man once known as a quiet schoolteacher, has been through years of turmoil since becoming Governor General of his native Grenada. The island nation's ceremonial head of state was named today by the leader of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States as the source of a request for military intervention in Grenada. Sir Paul, who Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said was safely on the American ship the Guam, became Governor General of Grenada in 1978, four years after the small country was granted independence by the British. It remained a member of the Commonwealth. The Governor General, 48 years old, is now the hope of neighboring Caribbean nations who are calling for a restoration of constitutional government in Grenada. As representative of Queen Elizabeth II, Sir Paul would be asked to restore the nation's 1973 constitution and open the way for the restoration of an elected govenment. Bombs and House Arrest Sir Paul had been Governor General of Grenada less than a year when a coup in 1979 brought to power the leftist Government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop. In 1980, a bomb went off near him and Prime Minister Bishop. They were unhurt, but security men shot and killed a suspected terrorist. Although relations between the Prime Minister and the Governor General were strained - at one point Sir Paul was reported under house arrest - he held his title through more than four years of revolutionary government. Mr. Bishop's Government collapsed two weeks ago and the Prime Minister was killed as a result of another coup. Now regional Caribbean political leaders are hoping to restore Sir Paul's full powers and have him name a provisional Grenadian government. If that plan is realized, Sir Paul will have ample opportunity to display decisiveness, a quality whose importance he used to emphasize to his pupils at Grenada Boys' Secondary School, where he taught from 1953 to 1967. He won respect and affection there, some expatriate Grenadians report, as a teacher of English and economics. 'A Very Decent Human Being' ''He's a very decent human being,'' Keith Mitchell, a Grenadian who formerly taught mathematics in Grenada, said Tuesday when reached at Howard University, where he is a member of the faculty. ''He is someone who is admired a lot by the Grenadian people for his hard work and his achievements.'' He will also have an opportunity to undo some damage done to his reputation in the eyes of some Grenadians. Mr. Mitchell, who is also a spokesman for the Grenada Democratic Movement, an exile group that has campaigned for the release of political prisoners in Grenada and the return to democratic forms of government, said Sir Paul had ''lost some credibility'' by his toleration of the regime of Sir Eric Gairy, Mr. Bishop's predecessor as Prime Minister. Critics have described the Gairy Government as ruthless and corrupt. Sir Paul was born in Gouyave, a fishing village on Grenada's western coast in the heart of cocoa and spice country. He had his schooling in the capital, St. George's, at St. John's Anglican School and at the Grenada Boys' Seconary School. He then studied in England, at the Institute of Education, in Leeds. He received a Master of Education Degree in 1967 from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, which is part of the University of Toronto. Then he returned to Grenada and became a teacher. At the Government-run boys' school, he was known for his fondness for quoting Chaucer and Shakespeare in a commanding voice. He also won admiration for his self-discipline and a continual stress on the importance of such virtues as honesty, forthrightness and decisiveness, according to those who know him. In 1967 Sir Paul quit the faculty and became Grenada's Chief Education Officer, the equivalent of an island- wide superintendant of schools. Two years later he became Permanent Secretary in Grenada's Ministry of Education, the No. 2 man under the Minister. With Sir Eric as Prime Minister, he was Secretary to the Grenadian Cabinet from 1970 to 1972. Meanwhile he had become an international foundation executive, serving, from 1973 to 1978, as deputy director of the Commonwealth Foundation. That organization was begun in 1966 to promote closer professional cooperation, giving grants for training and research. In 1970, Sir Paul married Esmai Monica Lumsden, the widow of another senior civil servant, thereby acquiring two stepsons and a stepdaughter. Moved to a Hilltop Manse In 1978 the family moved into the hilltop Governor General's House, a spacious colonial-style manse overlooking St. George's red clay roofs. He filled his post, compatriots say, with judicial aplomb in the last years of the Gairy Government, acquiring a reputation as ''a believer in the status quo, a generally conservative figure,'' Mr. Mitchell said yesterday. He was knighted by the British in 1979. Another expatriate Grenadian intellectual, who declined to be identified, said Sir Paul was ''very proper and very dignified, but he's not stuffy. He's nice.'' In happier times, Sir Paul liked to play tennis and read in his spare time. How much popular support he will enjoy, if in fact he does emerge as the top man on the island, is an open question. But in the past he has had rank and file support, within professional groups at least. He was vice president of Grenada's Civil Service Association in 1968 and was a co- founder and for a time president of Grenada's Association of Masters and Mistresses, an organization of teachers.

286-> North Rockland Streak Ends
North Rockland's bubble burst yesterday. The Red Raiders, who had won 25 consecutive games and were ranked second in the state, were upset, 10-0, by their host, Ramapo. ''I think we lost sight of the means to our goal,'' Coach Joe Cassarella of North Rockland said after the game. ''We were distracted by all the pressure and the media coverage, and we forgot what we had to do to keep winning.'' North Rockland, which had lost its starting quarterback, Sean Donaghue, two weeks ago to an injury, was held to 128 total yards on offense. Derek Beamon, the team's leading rusher, gained only 49 yards on 9 carries. Ramapo, which entered the game with a 3-3 record, scored in the second quarter with a 25-yard field goal and clinched the victory in the fourth quarter when Chris Bibbins broke an off-tackle carry into a 95-yard touchdown run. North Rockland finally threatened to score in the final minutes, driving to within a yard of the goal-line, but Ramapo's defense held firm, sealing the biggest upset of the year. In another upset, Nyack defeated Rye, 19-12, at Nyack, ending the Garnets' unbeaten season. John Harris scored twice on short carries for Nyack, including a touchdown in the last minute of the game. The quarterback Pat Nugent completed a 5-yard pass to Kevin Holden in the second quarter for Rye's first score, and Darin Porter scored in the fourth on a 1-yard run up the middle. Nyack's record is now 5-3; Rye is 7-1. Suffern improved its chances for a playoff spot by scoring with 13 seconds left to defeat Franklin D. Roosevelt of Hyde Park, 24-19. On the first play of the game Randy Turer, Suffern's quarterback, completed a 69-yard pass to Steve Greco. Suffern scored again in the first quarter as the fullback Tim Porter ran off- tackle for 16 yards and a touchdown.

289-> MUSIC; KAFAVIAN SISTERS, MARLBORO COMING
COME next weekend, the extraordinarily rich harvest of chamber music in Connecticut will be richer still: music from Marlboro begins its annual series at Stamford's Trinity Episcopal Church Saturday at 8, while the Wilton Candlelight series opens at 4 Sunday afternoon at the Congregational Church. Both programs are scheduled within a few days of duplicate concerts at Alice Tully and Carnegie Halls, so you can get New York City quality without New York City prices or parking problems. The Stamford series, which despite its churchly locale is sponsored by the Jewish Community Center, opens with all-string program from the young Marlboro musicians, including the Mendelssohn Quintet in A, Alban Berg's ''Lyric Suite'' and the Quintet in C (the gorgeous one with two cellos) by Schubert. For single ticket reservations or subscriptions to the full three-concert package, call 322- 7900. In Wilton, meanwhile, the candlelight recitals should be off to a splendid start since the Kavafian sisters are coming together for one of their all-too-rare duo recitals. Ani and Ida are both wonderful violinists and they both won the Avery Fisher Award (in 1976 and '78 respectively) but they have been so busy with separate solo and chamber careers that only on very special occasions do their musical paths cross. With another superb young artist, the pianist Blanca Uribe, the Kavafian sisters will offer works by Mozart, Prokofiev, Moszkowski and Sarasate; for single tickets or subscription information (the two other candlelight programs will be by the Mendelssohn String Quartet and Aki- Cooper-Roseman Trio), call 762-3950. Backing up to this afternoon, you can choose between a 3 o'clock piano recital at the New Canaan High School by another Avery Fisher prize- winner, Horacio Gutierrez, and a fascinating portrait of women in the Middle Ages presented at 4 P.M. at the University of Bridgeport by Music for a While, the celebrated early music consort. On Tuesday at 12:30, the Schubert Club is sponsoring a recital by the celebrated pianist Oxana Yablonskaya and her rapidly up-and-coming cellist son Dmitry Yablonsky in Stamford's First Presbyterian Church (847-7104). Another unusual duo program is coming up Thursday evening at 8 when Judith Cline, soprano, and William Krause, master guitarist and lutanist, combine for compositions spanning some seven centuries of music (426-6448). On Friday at 8:15, the harpischordist Robert Edward Smith plays Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'' in a free recital in the chapel at Hartford's Trinity College (527-3151). A week from today there are two more interesting university-connected recitals, both free. At 3 P.M., the Wayland Quintet offers a wide spectrum of music for woodwinds, including some of Percy Grainger's delightful English folk song settings, at the Yale Center for British Art (432- 4594). At 4 P.M. Irene Schneidmann, artist-in-residence at the University of Bridgeport, gives a piano recital there of works by Mozart, Schumann, Prokofiev and Pulitzer Prize-winner Ned Rorem (576-4399). On the vocal scene there is a fine schedule, too. On Thursday at 8 P.M. Johannes Somary conducts the Yale Concert Choir and Orchestra in the University's first-ever performance of Handel's ''Judas Maccabeus.'' Soloists are graduate students from the Yale School of Music, and admission is free (438-4457). On Friday, Thomas Crawford conducts the Fairfield Chamber Orchestra in music by Mozart and Brahms in Norwalk's St. Paul's Episcopal Church, but the concert also takes on a vocal tinge when counter-tenor Johnson Flucker joins the ensemble for Vivaldi's ''Nisi Dominus'' (223- 0120). On Saturday at 8 P.M. it's choral music in a lighter vein - sea chanties, spirituals, glee club favorites, Broadway show tunes and the like - as the Boston Common, 1980 International Barbershop Quartet champions, and the Capella Cantorum, a men's chorus, join forces for a concert at the high school in Madison (457-1140). Finally, another happy lot of musical comedy songs will be off to the races when the New Haven Symphony and the Fairfield County Chorale start pops series next Sunday at New Haven's Teletrack theater at 8 P.M. For ticket information, call the symphony office at 776-1444 or the theater box office, 789-1943.

290-> Nuptials Planned By Miss Nicholas
Dr. and Mrs. William Nicholas of New Hyde Park, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Gillian Nicholas, to Thomas Gilbert Gabriel, son of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert R.

292-> SCOUTING; America's Cup Goes Top-Secret
The armed guard paces the compound enclosed by a high chain-link fence. The electronic shield is activated. Will the secret keel remain the sole possession of the Australians or is there a spy capable of penetrating the security systems? This might sound like fiction, but it's just part of daily life in Newport, R.I., during this summer of the America's Cup challenge. Every America's Cup syndicate has a security guard on duty at night to protect its yachts from vandalism. In the case of some, such as Freedom and Australia II, the guards are also there to prevent competitors from stealing ideas. ''You don't want to make it easy for anyone to look into your cockpits and acquire your ideas,'' said Ed du Moulin, the manager of the Freedom Campaign. Because it has such a radical keel, the top-seeded challenger, Australia II, is protected by the most elaborate security. An armed guard is on 24-hour duty, and when the yacht is hoisted out of the water in the evening, its secret keel is shrouded by ''security skirts'' made of fabric with plywood sides. After the Australians heard that some press people intended to dive and photograph the yacht's keel, a 12-volt electrical screen was placed around Australia II 10 days ago so that any diver who surfaced next to the boat would receive a little jolt. Warren Jones, the executive director of the Australia II syndicate, said the security systems are costing the Australians $1,000 a week. ''Frankly, we'd rather be buying sails,'' Jones added.

293-> HELMS AND ANTI-HELMS CAMPAIGNS GOING STRONG
It was a cross between a prayer breakfast and a political rally. ''Jesse Helms is a national treasure,'' the Rev. Jerry Falwell told a group of 250 ministers and lay leaders. They responded with a chorus of ''Praise the Lord'' and ''Amen.'' ''Jesse Helms is the most important man in Washington, besides the President, in the cause of leading this nation back to moral sanity,'' Mr. Falwell continued. ''Can you imagine if we had 100 Jesse Helmses in the U.S. Senate? My, my.'' The audience responded with hosannas when the Senator said, ''I'm not doing a thing in the world in the Senate that you would not do if you were there.'' He cited his opposition to abortion and his support of school prayer and ''profamily, promoral'' legislation, a strong national defense and military aid to El Salvador. Ministers as Registrars The breakfast was the next-to-last stop in a two-day voter registration drive in which Senator Helms, 61 years old, joined Mr. Falwell, the leader of Moral Majority, at stops in Asheville, Charlotte, Wilmington and Raleigh. The objective was to use the churches as voter registration centers and enlist the ministers and lay leaders as registrars. ''We plan, minimum, to enroll 200,000 new voters in the state by next year,'' Mr. Falwell told the audience. ''And we're talking about the kind of people who make a difference.'' A similar drive has been initiated by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who is leading a nationwide effort and is himself considering seeking a Presidential nomination. In North Carolina, he said, he will use the black pulpits in an effort to register 200,000 voters, with the express purpose of turning Mr. Helms out of office. Senator Helms's probable opponent for the Senate next year, Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., 45 years old, is a moderate Democrat who, like Mr. Falwell, hopes to make Jesse Helms the central issue in the campaign. 'They've Been Embarrassed' ''People feel deeply about the kind of representation we've had in Washington,'' Mr. Hunt said in an interview. ''They've been embarrassed.'' A poll published last week by The Charlotte Observer showed Mr. Hunt leading Mr. Helms by 50 percent to 31 percent, with 6 percent favoring other candidates. The poll found the Governor's support ''deep and wide,'' with solid support among all voter groups. The campaign pits the most prominent politician the state has produced since Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. against a popular but cautious Governor. ''The Governor is as difficult to categorize as North Carolina,'' said Gary Pearce, his press secretary. ''It's a morally conservative state, but in terms of health care and education, it's a progressive state.'' Strong Showing by Democrats Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 3 to 1, and last year they ousted two Republican members of the United States House of Representatives. Democrats say the state's two conservative Republican Senators, Mr. Helms and John East, are political aberrations. The campaign has already become a national one. Conservatives around the country have contributed to Mr. Helms's re-election bid, which Mr. Hunt estimates will cost $14 million, a figure Mr. Helms disputes. Liberals and moderates from other states have assisted Mr. Hunt, thereby providing grist for the Helms for Senate Committee. The committee has sponsored advertisements quoting the Governor as saying that out-of-state campaign contributions create ''obligations you ought not to have'' and showing photographs of Mr. Jackson, Julian Bond, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Sol Linowitz and several labor leaders who support Mr. Hunt. Accusations of Racism Some Democrats charge the advertisements are racist, in the word of David Price, a professor of political science at Duke University who is expected to be elected Saturday as chairman and executive director of the state Democratic Party. But Thomas F. Ellis, a Raleigh lawyer who is Mr. Helms's chief political aide, said, ''The greatest example of racism is Jesse Jackson, when he says we've got to register 200,000 blacks to put Helms out of a job.'' The Governor has won acclaim for bringing industry into the state, where the 8.4 percent unemployment rate is below the national average. He has also stressed education, improved the state university system and created a North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, modeled after the Bronx High School of Science. The Governor describes himself as a fiscal conservative. He opposes abortion but believes a woman should be able to make her own decision. He says, ''Children should be able to pray in school as they do in homes, not with politicians making up the prayers.'' Mr. Helms told the breakfast rally, ''We have it in our hands to turn this country around. I've often been accused of trying to turn the clock back, and that is correct. I'd like to turn the clock back to where the Constitution meant something.'' Both candidates say they have not fully made up their minds to run. But each could have his party's nomination for the asking, and their aides believe the die is cast. Mr. Ellis said that unless the political climate changed mightily in the next several months Mr. Helms would definitely run. Though Mr. Hunt has said he is hesitating for lack of funds, Mr. Pearce said, ''It clearly looks like the money will be there, and he'll run.''

294-> NEW JERSEY BRIEFS
THE Rev. T. James Snodgrass admits to no sympathy with the Reagan Administration, but he concedes grudgingly that ''there's something in this public-private partnership thing that smacks of truth.'' Mr. Snodgrass is rector of the House of Prayer Episcopal Church in one of Newark's most desperate neighborhoods. The church, on North Broad Street, runs a bilingual child- abuse prevention program that since July has helped 27 local families deal with the frustration and anger that, uncontrolled, can lead to violence. When the Office of Human Development Services of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services sought a bilingual child-abuse program in Newark to support, it found Mr. Snodgrass. The Government now provides $98,000 a year to help keep the operation going as a demonstration project. ''This program is proof that hands that help are holier than lips that simply pray,'' said Dorcas R. Hardy, Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services. Mrs. Hardy attended an All Saints Day dedication ceremony last week for Apostles House, a two-building complex on Grant Street, Newark, that will house the child-abuse prevention program and an emergency family shelter. The church-state partnership goes even further in that New Jersey's Department of Human Services has allocated $50,000 for the program. The money will be used to train and support the nine local residents who counsel and provide emotional support for the families involved. George J. Albanese, the state's Commissioner of Human Services, called the $50,000 grant a ''turning point'' because it marks the department's shift away from programs that react to problems and toward those that seek to prevent abuse. ''This program will be a model for the rest of the state,'' Mr. Albanese said, noting that Trenton has dedicated $2.5 million for prevention programs around New Jersey. The child-abuse program at Apostles House is now operated by a consortium of four churches called the Newark Family Resource Network, which plans to open similar projects in three more churches next year. Nearly three years ago, law-enforcement officials in New Jersey began investigating missing boys and their possible links to organized groups of men who advocate sexual consent between adults and adolescents. In the last two weeks, these investigations have led to the conviction of one man for sexually assaulting a boy and guilty pleas to similar charges by two other men. The man convicted by a Bergen County jury of sexually assaulting a minor is James Cooper, a 41-year-old Paramus engineer. According to law- enforcement officials, he is an official of NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, a nationwide group formed in Boston in 1979 that advocates consentual sex between children and adults. ''Our position is that not only was he a member, but also a high-ranking officer of some sort, possibly the secretary,'' said Raymond Farrington, the assistant Bergen County Prosecutor who handled the case against Mr. Cooper. NAMBLA checkbooks, canceled checks and inquiries for membership and literature were found in Mr. Cooper's home when he was arrested in June 1981 by the Sex Crime Unit of the Prosecutor's office, Mr. Farrington said. In a plea-bargaining following Mr. Cooper's conviction, Vincent Albrecht, a 42-year-old Clifton banker, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault involving a 14-year-old boy, and a 40-year-old Rochelle Park store manager, Lawrence Plunkett, pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a 14-year-old boy by taking nude photographs of him. In return for the guilty pleas, the prosecution dropped 13 additional charges against Mr. Albrecht and six remaining counts against Mr. Plunkett. John Stackhouse, 28, of Little Falls, the fourth man under indictment in the case, is expected to stand trial this month. Possible links to NAMBLA and similar groups in New Jersey surfaced publicly nearly a year ago, when the Special Investigations Unit of the Jersey City Police Department raided a Wareham, Mass., house where two boys from Jersey City had been living. Those arrests and others spurred a nationwide fingerprinting program to help find missing children. So far, 12 states, including New Jersey, have begun the fingerprinting.

296-> Red Sox, Up 9 Runs, Win in 10th, 14-13
Marty Barrett scored from second base when the left fielder Steve Henderson failed to hang onto Tony Armas's two-out line drive in the 10th inning to give the Boston Red Sox a 14-13 victory over the Mariners tonight. The Mariners, who trailed by 13-4 after five and a half innings, rallied for three runs in the sixth and five in the seventh, then tied, 13-13, in the ninth when Rick Sweet walked and came around on singles by Damingo Ramos and Tony Bernazard. With one out in the 10th, Barrett singled, took second on Wade Boggs's grounder and, following a walk to Dwight Evans, Armas hit his liner to left-center. After a long run, Henderson appeared to snare the drive, but the ball popped loose and Henderson was charged with an error. John Henry Johnson (2-1), the fifth Boston pitcher, took over in the seventh and earned the victory. Bob Stanley pitched the 10th for his 19th save. Ed Vande Berg (2-3) took the loss. Armas hit a two-run homer in the first inning, his 21st homer of the season. Jerry Remy and Boggs also drove in two runs for the Red Sox, and Miller had three singles. Rangers 3, Blue Jays 2 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) - Larry Parrish went 4 for 4 and drove in the winning run and Frank Tanana pitched a five-hitter in his first complete game of the season. It was the third consecutive loss for the Blue Jays. The Blue Jays had lost three in a row only one other time this season. Tanana (4-2), who had been plagued by arm trouble, struck out 5, walked 1 and retired 10 in a row in one stretch. His longest performance this season had been six and two-thirds innings. It was only the fourth victory in 16 games for the Rangers since the All-Star Game break. In the seventh, Wayne Tolleson was safe on an error by the second baseman Damaso Garcia, and Tolleson scored when Pete O'Brien doubled. One out later, Parrish singled off Jim Gott (5-8) for his 11th gamewinning run batted in of the season, one shy of the league leader, Dave Winfield of the Yankees. Brewers 7, White Sox 6 MILWAUKEE (UPI) - Rick Manning led a three-run eighth inning with a run-scoring single and scored the tie-breaking run on a double by Paul Molitor. With Milwaukee trailing, 6-4, Ted Simmons, Ben Oglivie and Manning singled to make it 6-5. Oglivie scored on a wild pitch by the reliever Juan Agosto. After Dennis Lamp entered and hit Jim Gantner with a pitch, Molitor doubled down the left-field line. Tigers 5, Angels 1 Angels 3, Tigers 2 ANAHEIM, Calif. (UPI) - Alan Trammell hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning, and Larry Herndon added a bases-loaded homer in the eighth inning of the first game of a doubleheader. Reggie Jackson hit a double and a run scoring single as the Angels won the second game, 3-2, snapping Dave Rozema's 10-game winning streak. Rozema, who is 6-1 this season, sat out most of last season with a knee injury. A's 9, Orioles 7 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Ricky Peters drove in three runs, including the game-winner decisive one, with an eighth-inning sacrifice fly. Rickey Henderson tripled with one out in the eighth off the Baltimore reliever Dan Morogiello (0-1). Tim Stoddard then gave up Peters's fly ball to left, and Davey Lopes then followed with his 13th homer of the year. Pirates 5, Dodgers 4 PITTSBURGH, (AP) - Jim Morrison hit a two-run two-out single in the bottom of the ninth inning as the Pirates rallied for their 11th victory in 12 games. The victory kept the Pirates in first place in the National League East. Lee Mazzilli reached base on an error by the shortstop Bill Russell to open the inning, but Steve Howe (3-5) got Lee Lacy to pop out and struck out a pinch-hitter, Gene Tenace. Bill Madlock then singled and Howe walked Jason Thompson on a 3-2 pitch before Morrison lined his single, his third hit of the game, into left field. Expos 9, Astros 4 MONTREAL (AP) - Al Oliver's two-run single ignited a six-run fifth inning after two were out against Nolan Ryan. The Expos trailed by 4-1 before sending 10 batters against Ryan. It was the second consecutive loss for Ryan (9-3), who struck out two batters in five innings, raising his career total to 3,585, two fewer than Steve Carlton of the Philadelphia Phillies, the leader. Phillies 10, Braves 6 ATLANTA (UPI) - Bob Dernier went 5 for 5 with three runs batted in and Pete Rose also drove in three runs to help John Denny improve his career record to 7-0 against Atlanta. Denny (9-5) pitched five and two-thirds innings, giving up 10 hits. Rick Camp (7-8), in relief, was the loser.

297-> No Headline
Bebe Moore Campbell's article points out that there is a cycle of problems that still confront black people, even those ''who have made it.'' It would be a better social and economic world if we did recognize the capable and competent job that black business people perform. This positive recognition would increase the communication and cooperation between the races. In light of our country's perilous economic situation, we need all of the quality help we can get. Mrs. Campbell is to be commended for her research and for the thoroughness of the article. The words of one of the managers in the article are worth restating: ''I could have done so much more if I hadn't had to constantly watch my back and if I'd felt more acceptance and support.''

298-> MAN FIGHTS DEPORTATION IN BOGUS DROWNING
A Canadian who was presumed drowned 13 years ago, only to reappear in Colorado with a fresh identity, is fighting attempts by immigration officials to deport him and sever him from his new family. Officials say John Kenneth Tidswell has admitted he planned to vanish on a sailing trip on Lake Simcoe in Ontario to lead the authorities to believe he had died. He left behind a wife and three children and took the name of another Canadian, Robert Ross Halfyard. Today, 54 years old, he lives with a new wife, Lilly Ruth, in Broomfield, Colo., and works in Thornton, where he sells extended service contracts and waranties for cars. He was described by a co-worker as ''one fine gentleman.'' Scuttled Boat and Disappeared ''I've never seen anything like it,'' James Hardin, of Denver, deputy district director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said Thursday. Mr. Tidswell's saga began in July 1970, when he disappeared from his 20- foot boat on Lake Simcoe about 35 miles north of Toronto. ''He scuttled the boat, swam to shore, put new clothes on and surfaced here in the United States,'' Mr. Hardin said. At the time, the Canadian authorities said he apparently died while trying to fix the boat's motor. However, Ted McBrien, a police inspector in York Township near Toronto, says officials were suspicious. ''Lake Simcoe usually coughs up its dead,'' he said, ''and in this case it coughed up nothing.'' Ten years later, after the man's Canadian wife, Kathleen, collected $70,000 in life insurance, the deception was uncovered when the Canadian authorities found the real Robert Ross Halfyard was alive and living in St. Catherine's, Ontario. Mr. Hardin said of Mr. Tidswell, ''We confronted him with this evidence and he came clean. He simply said it was an unhappy family situation in Canada.'' Passport Application Crucial A second immigration official, Dave Couchman of Salt Lake City, told reporters the hoax was uncovered when Mr. Tidswell applied for a passport to go to Canada. He has been charged with two counts of fraud and one of public mischief, according to Mr. Hardin. When the ruse was discovered in November 1980, United States immigration officials rescinded Mr. Tidswell's permanent citizen status and sought to deport him and prevent him from returning to the States. He was ordered deported in an immigration hearing in 1982, but the ruling was suspended until an administrative judge could decide on his appeal. Mr. Tidswell has contended the punishment would create unneccessary hardship for him and his new wife, who have started a family. Described as 'Gentleman' Neither Mr. Tidswell, who has an unpublished home phone number, nor his attorney, George Carter, who was said to be out of town, could be reached for comment. However, an acquaintance, Gordon Seth, general manager of an automobile dealership, said he had worked with Mr. Tidswell, whom he knew as Robert Halfyard, until about a year ago. ''Of all people, he's just one fine gentleman,'' Mr. Seth said. ''He's an excellent man to work with. What his problems were in the past, I don't know in any detail.'' Mr. Hardin said Mr. Tidswell was in his second marriage when he deserted his wife 13 years ago. This wife, Kathleen, said she found out about her husband's duplicity only in August and did not learn he was remarried until his Denver lawyer wrote to her three weeks ago.

299-> SHOPPING MILAN: CHOICE GOODS
The central shopping area of Milan could probably fit into the bedding department of Macy's. But within that concentrated area there are more designer boutiques, trendy emporiums and traditional stores for furnishings than one might expect in such a physically unprepossessing location. The primary shopping area - bounded by Via Monte Napoleone, Via della Spiga, Via Sant'Andrea and Via Santo Spirito - is the essence of northern Italian conservatism. The stores are not outwardly glamorous. Some are no larger than a doorway. And even those that have been decorated with marble floors, dark wood and immaculate window displays do not call attention to themselves. In Milan, that is bad form. Nor do the sales clerks believe in the hard sell. Perhaps with the current rate of exchange of roughly 1,500 lire for $1 (it was about 650 lire in 1974), there is no need to push foreign travelers to buy. Saleswomen will, however, point out that since Italian clothes cost three times more in the United States, a $700 dress at Valentino on Via Santo Spirito is really something of a bargain. A good place to start shopping is at the Galleria Passarella on the Piazza San Babila at the southern tip of Via Monte Napoleone, where smaller shops off the usual beaten tourist track offer some exceptional values. At Boggi, 1 Galleria Passarella, there is clothing of the most traditional sort, including Burberry raincoats and Burlington socks that a shopper doesn't have to come to Milan to buy. What's really good, though, are the shirts in gray, blue or white oxford cloth that sell for 25,000 lire, or about $17. A few doors down is Zebedia, no more than 6 feet wide and 20 feet long. Unlike Boggi, it specializes only in shirts, with prices that range from $20 to $35. At the top of that price range one can buy a button-down or dress shirt that has the fabric gathered softly across the back in little tucks, deep armholes and altogether a generosity of soft cotton usually found only in shirts that sell for $80 or more in the United States. From here one goes straight to Via Monte Napoleone, Milan's Fifth Avenue, where Milanese walk their English sheep dogs, where the men hold small cigars in their mouths as they walk and where even into October, the young women are still tanned and wear espadrilles. At 1 Via Monte Napoleone, there is the Missoni boutique. The first floor is merely a foyer that leads to a narrow passage that circles upward to a room with bare wooden floors, cool light and racks of knitted coats in oversize herringbone patterns that cost $750. Missoni, like the other designer boutiques, is expensive. Next-door is Tanino Crisci, at No. 3, which in its appearance has all the solidity of a law firm but has been selling shoes in that location for only 20 years. The great-grandfather of Mr. Crisci, however, was born, according to the store biography, in a small bottega in Milan during the 1880's and as soon as he could hold a hammer, began fashioning custom footware for the aristocracy. Today's footware is not custom-made and costs from $120 to $200. It is generally considered that there are three primary jewelers in Italy - Bulgari, Faorone and Romani Adami. Faorone is situated on Via Monte Napleone at No. 7A and specializes in such serious jewelry as emerald drop earrings. Romani Adami is at 7 Via Sant'Andrea, and the fishing rods and lures in its window barely distract the eye from an enormous diamond cuff three inches wide. In both stores, there is beauty to be had at a very high price. Farther down Via Monte Napoleone is Lario, founded in 1898, which makes shoes for Giorgio Armani, including his new tie shoe with a Vibram hiking-boot sole, priced at $140. And beyond, past Ungaro, G. Lorenzi and Lorenz (which has steel-face watches with rubber wristbands), there is one of Milan's new Japanese boutiques, Hiroko Koshino, at No. 25. Here the clothes are Occidental in design, with the cardigan sweaters with detachable surplices selling for about $350 and brass and leather belts for $55. Next to Hiroko Koshino is Santini & Domenici, at No. 27, a little oasis of high-tech humor on Monte Napoleone, with its 1950's inspired shoes with thick rubber soles that cost about $65. The jewel of Via Monte Napleone, however, is the Valentino shop at the corner of Via Santo Spirito. Here the beige marble floors are inlaid with mushroom-colored marble V's, and the window displays are artful. The light inside is as soft as the carpet. Valentino's entire fall collection is here, including his plaid wool broad- shoulder coats for $700 and his sinuous crepe siren dresses for evening. Even the jewelry from his fall show is here, glittering expensively in lacquered wood and glass cases. Walking down Via Santo Spirito, one reaches Via della Spiga, Milan's Madison Avenue, where the designer boutiques unfold one after the other: Gianfranco Ferre, Krizia, Versace, Erreuno and Gio Moretti. At Ferre, there are the new navy wool dresses that button down the front to reveal an inner second dress in blue satin and at the neck, an attached black silk scarf. The dress costs around $800. Erreuno is the new store on the street. It has marble floors and leather columns, and its clothes are designed by Armani, with smart round-collar suits in black and white plaid selling for $390, checked wool dresses for $350 and silk shirts for $350. Why does a shirt cost as much as a dress? Because, said the saleswoman, it takes just as much work to make a shirt as a dress in Italy. Turning right off Via della Spiga, one walks up Via Sant'Andrea, which is filled with new stores. Beyond Fendi there are Kenzo, Gianfranco Ferre's new men's store, the new Comme des Gar,cons, Romani Adami, and the new Giorgio Armani boutique. Nothing in all of Milan, however, is quite like the Armani boutique. The floors are made of textured rubber matting and steel girders, the walls of steel girders and translucent acrylic sheets. The ceiling is covered with track lights, and everything in the store bristles in the nicest way possible. But the prices seem almost too good to be true. Ties are $27, as compared to American prices that range from $38 to $45. Shoes are $140. And the famous navy Armani blazer is about $330, compared to as high as $700 in the United States. Outside of the central area, several shops are especially worth seeing. The first is Fiumi Orologiaio at 39 Via Manzoni. Founded in 1867, it has some of the best watches in Milan, including the black steel watch used by the Italian team competing for the America's Cup. At 4 Via Durini is Arcando, a custom shoe store where it takes two and a half months for a pair to be made. Its shoes are of classic British-American styling, and a pair costs about $350. But the workmanship is so exemplary they are worth the price. Tatiana Donna Uomo - at 14 Via Felici Cavallotti - carries men's and women's clothing by the leading Italian designers as well as some new designers. The newest find: the sweaters of Elizabeth Mambrini, including her latest black and white wool sweater ($120) with a madras front pocket, appliques of torn fabric with words scrawled on them, and over part of it a net of thin black plastic melted into the surface of the sweater. The overall effect: an exciting play of textures. Finally, there is Komlan, at 11 Corso Venezia, which is the closest thing Milan has to New York's Charivari Workshop. Its selection of clothing is extremely fashionable, including new shorter fatigue trousers by Marithe and Francois Girbaud, cotton military vests, black rubber bracelets set with large royal blue stones and all-cotton shirts by Vuarnet Scout - in gray and black stripes, crisp as a 50,000-lire bill, and probably worth a lot more.

300-> LEGAL BASIS FOR INVASION
News Analysis WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 - The Reagan Administration, expanding today on its defense of the legality of its invasion of Grenada, suggested a potentially far-reaching exception to the rules against use of military force detailed in the charters of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The State Department spokesman John Hughes released a two-page legal memorandum stating that the invasion was ''consistent with'' the charters of the two large organizations because each charter allows for ''collective action pursuant to regional security treaties in response to threats to peace and security.'' What was new in the memorandum was its suggestion, foreshadowed in statements by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other officials Tuesday, that the previously obscure 1981 treaty of the seven-member Organization of Eastern Caribbean States could provide authority for this country to launch an invasion. The United States is not a party to the treaty. Some legal experts said it would be difficult for the United States to distinguish the rationale given today from the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine, under which the Soviet Union claims the right to invade its Warsaw Pact neighbors to maintain their Marxist regimes. The United States has frequently condemned such Soviet claims as contrary to international law. 'Threat to Stability of Region' The State Department memorandum said the assertion by members of the Caribbean group ''that the collapse of the Government on Grenada posed a threat to the stability of the region'' provided a basis for the United States, at their invitation, to invade. The Administration has not itself asserted that Grenada or its Cuban and Soviet allies were planning any aggression against neighboring islands. A somewhat similar rationale could apparently be used to argue for the legality of a United States invasion of Nicaragua or any other nation in the region, or even the world, at its neighbors' request, if the neighbors were parties to a similar treaty and had asserted that the nation to be invaded was a threat to them. The United States used superficially similar reasoning to justify the naval quarantine of Cuba during the missile crisis of 1962 and the lengthy occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1965, both of which were attacked by other nations as violations of international law as spelled out in the United Nations and O.A.S. Charters. In each case reliance was placed on ratification of United States actions in votes by the O.A.S., a major hemispherewide group that has long had special status under the United Nations Charter as a regional peacekeeping authority. Basis of Justification But never since the founding of the United Nations has the United States used a treaty among such a small group of nations - seven tiny island states in all, with a combined population of less than one million - as a basis for military action. Mr. Hughes indicated that the legal justification enunciated by the State Department today hinges on assertions by some members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States that the situation in Grenada presented a threat of external aggression, assertions on which he said the United States placed ''great significance.'' The Administration has not specified who was threatened by whom, and Secretary of State Shultz said Wednesday that ''we don't have any direct information'' that Cuba or the Soviet Union were behind the bloody coup in Grenada earlier this month. The Caribbean treaty was not the only legal rationale offered for the United States role in the invasion. Today's State Department memorandum, and public statements by President Reagan and other officials, also stressed the need to guard the safety of the roughly 1,000 American citizens in Grenada. Legal experts said this rationale would justify a limited evacuation mission if the evidence supported the assumption that the Americans had been in danger, which is in dispute. But the Administration apparently recognized that it could not justify its plans to occupy the entire island indefinitely, pending establishment of a new government, on the basis of danger to Americans alone. Restore Law and Order The Administration has sought to bolster its reliance on the Caribbean treaty by stressing that the military men who seized power in a bloody coup and murdered Prime Minister Maurice Bishop earlier this month ''did not purport to be a government'' with any legitimacy or even control, as today's State Department memorandum put it. Thus, rather than overthrowing an established Government, the Administration has stressed, the invasion was designed to restore law and order so that neighboring states could fill a governmental void. Such factors have some relevance in the fluid body of rules, principles, exceptions, corollaries and vaguenesses that is called international law. It seems, nonetheless, that the rationale suggested by the State Department today might be a significant departure insofar as it purports to provide a basis for ignoring the international law rules against invasions and interventions in the affairs of sovereign states whenever a few countries get together to form a collective security treaty. Questions About 1981 Treaty Aside from the question of whether a treaty between a handful of nations could ever justify the United States' invading one of them at the invitation of the others, there is considerable doubt whether this week's invasion is consistent with the intent of the signers of the 1981 treaty or the language they used. It is difficult to believe, for example, that Grenada, which was ruled by Mr. Bishop, a Marxist ally of Cuba, when it signed the treaty in 1981, intended to consent to being invaded under any circumstances. In addition, the treaty nowhere states that concern for collective security could justify an invasion of one of the members, and it specifies that the members are still bound by other treaties to which they are parties, including the United Nations and O.A.S. Charters with their prohibitions against use of military force. The treaty's collective security provisions provide only for cooperation ''against external aggression,'' and only by unanimous vote of the members. There is considerable dispute whether either of these conditions was present here.

301-> Republic Air Asks Wage Cut
Republic Airlines, expecting a $100 million loss for the first half of the 1983 fiscal year, announced it would ask all employees to accept a 15 percent wage cut for at least nine months. Walter Hellman, manager of media relations for the airline, said the pay cut is to begin Sept. 1 and last through May 1984. Such a cut for the airline's 14,700 employees nationwide, combined with ''improved employee productivity'' the company is also seeking, would save $100 million, Mr. Hellman said. The Republic official said initial response from management and union leaders had been ''excellent.'' It will be the fourth time in two years that Republic has cut or deferred employee wages. In the area of productivity, Mr. Hellman said the airline was asking its unions ''to consider or extend the use of part-time people, to relax certain provisions in contracts that will enable the company to utilize people more effectively and more productively.'' He said the unions had been responsive to such requests in the past. Republic flies to 147 cities in 29 states, Canada, Mexico and the Cayman Islands. It bills itself as the nation's fifth-largest passenger carrier, with sales exceeding $1.6 billion annually.

302-> CONCERT: FORTEPIANO AND PIANO AT MOSTLY MOZART
THIS year's installment of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra has received much justified praise. But of the three hours of playing (plus intermissions) at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday evening, far and away the best work of the night came from the keyboard players, or more precisely two of them. The two were Steven Lubin, who played the fortepiano during the preconcert recital in what was billed as the first time that delicate precursor of the modern piano had ever been heard in a large New York concert hall, and Alicia de Larrocha, who took the solo part on a modern Steinway in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 19 in F (K. 459). There was a third keyboard player in the person of Julius Rudel, the conductor of the concert proper. Mr. Rudel plunked away at what sounded like a rather crudely amplified harpsichord during the concert's opening Haydn Symphony No. 8 in G (''Le Soir''), which was admirable in musicological theory but less admirable in his rather unimaginative practice. Mr. Lubin offered a ''Mozart'' piano concerto, too, No. 1 in D (K. 107), which consists of a reworking by the 14-year-old composer and his father, Leopold, of a Johann Christian Bach sonata. The accompaniment is for strings alone, played on Monday by three solo players - Benjamin Hudson and Elisabeth Adkins, violins, and Myron Lutzke, cello. After that, Mr. Lubin turned his attention to the much better known Mozart Sonata in F (K. 332). Aside from a tendency to rush, which sounded more like a nervous habit than a musicological decision, Mr. Lubin's playing was both superbly controlled and deftly sensitive, and his dash through the final Allegro assai of the sonata proved pretty exciting. But naturally, the real star of the occasion was the instrument itself, wispy and shallow in this hall and in comparison with modern pianos, but crystalline and idiomatically exact, too. And Mr. Lubin was clever to pick the F-major sonata, with its rapid alternations of forte and piano clearly designed to exploit the selling point of the then-new instrument. Miss de Larrocha never seems to disappoint, and her playing of K. 459 was a model of elegance, sensitivity and subtle tonal control. She made no effort to disguise the fact that she was playing a modern grand piano - no artificially austere pedaling or exaggeratedly dry pointillism of touch for her. But neither did she wallow in anachronistic Romanticisms. This was playing that in phrase after phrase revealed a wonderfully complete blend of thought and intuitive feeling. Mr. Rudel was at his best in the outer movements of the concluding Beethoven Symphony No. 2, where his predilection all night long for hearty vigor served the music well. And it was good, as ever, to hear a work like this with a true chamber orchestra, as opposed to even a reduced full-sized symphony. Elsewhere, however, Mr. Rudel was not at his best. The orchestra's playing was good but not really very polished, and the phrasing betrayed a persistent lack of refinement.

303-> Experts Laud Tooth Sealants
A thin plastic coating over children's teeth could prevent many from getting cavities and decay if more dentists used the method, a panel said today in a draft statement to the National Institutes of Health. Plastic sealants, which could prevent decay and reduce dental costs, are greatly underused despite their great promise, the panel said. Dr. James W. Bawden, professor of dentistry at the University of North Carolina, the chairman of the group, said the use of sealants was safe and painless. The panel said many children could benefit from sealing some of their teeth to prevent food and bacteria from lodging in the pits and grooves, common areas of decay. The prevalence of cavities, or caries, has been declining in children and adolescents in the United States and several industrialized countries because of water fluoridation and other methods of fluoride therapy, the panel said. ''Expanding the use of sealants would substantially reduce the occurrence of dental caries in the population beyond that already achieved by fluorides and other preventive measures,'' the group said.

304-> Smith Woman
To the Editor: The Pearsall Smith women, as Pauline Maier points out in her review of Barbara Strachey's ''Remarkable Relations'' (Dec. 12), had a relatively private impact on the spheres in which they moved. However, the impact of other members of Hannah Whitall Smith's matriarchy did reach farther. M. Carey Thomas, Hannah's graddaughter, made enduring contributions to the progress of women's education in this country. She shaped the educational scope and standards of Bryn Mawr College as its second president, and with her friend Mary Garrett she made the admission of women to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine possible. What Carey Thomas experienced of the Whitall Smith influence is perhaps nowhere as evident as in her famous remark concerning Bryn Mawr alumnae: ''Our failures only marry.''

To the Editor: As a frequent customer of many of the restaurants mentioned in Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's article on San Francisco Chinese restaurants, ''Where the Twain Meet - Deliciously'' (Travel, Dec. 5), I was particularly gratified to see Canton Teahouse listed in the dim sum section. This restaurant's sweet egg custard in pastry and green pepper halves stuffed with shrimp are both wonderful. I would like to add that, for the diner who enjoys both traditional as well as unusual hot and spicy Chinese cuisine, Mandarin Delight (941 Kearny at Columbus) is a must. Ask for the squid in black bean sauce even though it's not on the menu. DANIEL A. CONRAD

307-> The Restoration Of East Rock Park
With regard to the recent developments between the Southern New England Telephone Company and New Haven's East Rock Park (Connecticut Journal, Dec. 12), it is important to realize that the proposal was withdrawn before meaningful programs for park improvement could be discussed. The assurance of safety in the park and concurrent reduction in vandalism are of paramount importance to the future of the park. The many individuals who use and are interested in East Rock Park continue to work to restore the park to its past glory. Our goal is to work with all interested parties, both private and public, to have programs equal to the park's valuable and varied natural resources. The monetary part of Snetco's proposal was generous and inspiring. We hope this interest in East Rock Park is sustained. SALLIE SPERLING, DICK LYONS, Chairmen, Friends of East Rock Park, New Haven

308-> CITICORP CONTESTS CURBS ON REGIONAL BANKING
Contending that regional banking compacts are unconstitutional, Citicorp said yesterday that it had filed suit in Federal court to overturn recent laws that allow banks in one New England state to acquire banks in other New England states, while prohibiting banks from outside the region from doing so. It also asked the court to block the consummation of several interstate acquisition agreements among New England banking companies. The suit, filed in the United States District Court in Massachusetts, named as defendants several Massachusetts state officials, plus four banking companies in Massachusetts and Connecticut that have announced plans to acquire New England banks based outside their respective states. None of the defendants who were reached by phone yesterday were willing to comment on the suit, saying they either had not seen it or they had not had a chance to study it. The move was viewed as a first step in an effort by Citicorp to prevent similar agreements elsewhere in the country. In a press release, Citicorp said that Patrick J. Mulhearn, its senior vice president and general counsel, ''indicated that Citicorp will pursue similar lawsuits, if necessary, to have any future state laws leading to permanent regional compacts declared unconstitutional and to stop any mergers that may be begun under them.'' Although Rhode Island recently enacted a similar law, Citicorp did not name that state or its officials as defendants, apparently because the Rhode Island statute lifts the regional restriction after two years. ''If there were a Federal statute that allowed regional banking for two years, that is something we wouldn't have a problem with,'' Mr. Mulhearn said. In its suit, Citicorp disclosed that it had been holding merger discussions with a small bank holding company in Massachusetts, but declined to identify the holding company. Unlike many other large banks across the country, Citicorp's strategy is to build its own local banking institutions rather than to acquire large existing ones. In Maine, for example, which has passed a nonrestrictive interstate banking clause, Citicorp has announced it plans to establish a new bank. Under the New England arrangements, however, even Citicorp's bank in Maine would not be allowed to acquire other banks in New England because of its New York ownership. The Northeast Bancorp Inc. of New Haven, which is seeking to be acquired by the Bank of New York, has filed an action similar to Citicorp's in Connecticut. The giant New York banks are especially upset about the regional agreements because these banks feel the laws are being designed specifically to keep them out of other areas. Senior officials of Chase have indicated they also might take legal action. Unlike Citicorp, Chase's strategy appears to be to acquire large out-of-state banks. It has already made small investments in relatively large banks outside New York but, under Federal law, it may not control these institutions. In the suit filed yesterday, Citicorp charged that the agreement violated the compact, commerce and supremacy clauses of the Constitution. The compact clause requires Congressional sanction for states to enter into compacts among themselves. The commerce clause prohibits discrimination against companies engaged in interstate commerce, and the supremacy clause says that when Congress takes action in a field it pre- empts the states. Douglas Amendment Cited Citicorp contends that Congress has acted in regard to interstate acquisitions of banks. Under the Douglas amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act, banks may acquire banks outside their own states if specifically allowed by laws of the host state. The argument is that one state cannot open the door merely to specific bank holding companies, but to all bank holding companies. The defendants named in the Citicorp suit are the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation; Paul E. Bulman, Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; Ira R. Jackson, Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue, and Robert Q. Crane, Massachusetts Treasurer and Receiver General. It also named two Massachusetts bank holding companies, the Bank of Boston Corporation and the Bank of New England Corporation, and two Connecticut bank holding companies, the CBT Corporation and the Hartford National Corporation.

309-> PEUGEOT PLANS DEEP CUTBACKS
Peugeot S.A., the privately owned French automobile maker, said today that it would attempt to cut back its work force by nearly 10 percent, a decision that could create labor unrest and major policy difficulties for the Socialist Government. The announcement, which said the company has suffered losses of about $776 million over the past three years, with an accumulation of $3.5 billion in debt, was denounced by the Socialist Party as ''the most radical possible solution,'' and described by a Communist union leader as ''a deliberate attempt by Peugeot to destabilize economically and politically the management of the country.'' Andre Sainjon, the union official, accused the corporation of being themost reactionary element in French industry, actively collaborating with what he called ''right-wing forces.'' His remarks implied that Peugeot, through the cutbacks, sought to create unemployment, thereby threatening the future of Francois Mitterrand's Government. 7,371 Workers Affected The cutbacks would affect 7,371 workers of the 81,700 employed by Peugeot and Automobiles Talbot, the wholly-owned subsidiary purchased as Chrysler-Simca by Peugeot in 1978 and subsequently renamed. In anticipation of the announcement, workers at a Talbot plant in the Paris suburb of Poissy started a 24-hour strike this morning, halting operations at the factory. The reductions, which are scheduled to start in October, involve the dismissal of some workers and the elimination of jobs through such procedures as early retirement. Union-management discussions, with the possibility of Government intervention, are scheduled for August and September. Finance Minister Jacques Delors has suggested that the Government might, under certain circumstances, offer Peugeot financial assistance. The layoffs are to come at a time when the Government expects a general increase in unemployment as a result of the economic policies it is following in order to lower the inflation rate, stabilize the franc and reduce the foreign trade defecit. Aides to President Mitterrand have told reporters that they expect new layoffs in a wide range of industrial sectors to increase the possibility of strikes. The Government, while promising to save jobs, is also trying to restructure and modernize industries to make them more competitive on international markets. Government Assistance Possible Visiting a textile factory today, Mr. Mitterrand, without referring directly to the Peugeot announcement, spoke of the condition of the French economy. Watching women piece together trousers at the Big Chief workrooms in western France, he said, ''We're still moving in a bad direction. ''We've got to try to win the economic battle,'' he said. ''It hasn't been won. Consistency and tenacity are necessary, otherwise we're going to fall on our faces.'' Explaining Peugeot's position, Lucien Collaine, the company's general director, said: ''In order to reinforce the competitiveness of Peugeot and Talbot against international competition, elimination of overmanning has become unavoidable. This is at a time when the economic situation can only lead to a contraction of markets, notably in France.'' When Peugeot took over Simca-Chrysler in 1978, the two manufacturers held 28 percent of the French automobile market. With production at Talbot declining, that figure is now 18.1 percent. Peugeot - which also owns the separately managed Citroen automobile concern - has said that its plans for the next decade are centered on new production methods, including computerization and robots. Following this policy, Peugeot has been able to reduce the work forces at its factories in Spain and Britain by about 9,000 workers.

311-> DEVILS BEATEN, 6-2, BY BRUINS
Rick Middleton's 12th goal of the season broke a 1-1 tie early in the second period today as the Boston Bruins skated to a 6-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils. It was the 20th loss in 22 games for New Jersey. After spotting the Devils a first- period lead on a goal by Jan Ludvig, the Bruins took over in the second period, during which they outshot New Jersey by 16-1. Mike O'Connell tied the score with a slap shot from the point 36 seconds into the second period, then Barry Pederson and Dave Silk set up Middleton for the go-ahead score. Nevin Markwart, a rookie, converted a goal-mouth pass from Tom Fergus for the third Boston score, and Pederson stretched the lead to 4-1 with 1 minute 7 seconds left in the middle period. Fergus and Ray Bourque scored goals for the Bruins, and Billy MacMillan got the second New Jersey goal in the final period, during which the Devils were outshot by 16-7. The Bruins had 40 shots on Chico Resch in the New Jersey cage. the Devils had only 15 on Pete Peeters of the Bruins. Capitals 5, Canadiens 2 MONTREAL (AP) - Bob Gould and Bobby Carpenter each scored two goals to lead Washington to its first victory in Montreal. The Capitals had been 0-22-1 at the Forum since they entered the league in 1974. The loss ended Montreal's five-game unbeaten streak. Glen Currie scored the other goal for Washington, and Ryan Walter and Larry Robinson scored for Montreal. Stars 7 Maple Leafs 6 TORONTO (AP) - Minnesota's center, Neal Broten, scored three consecutive goals, including the tying goal with three seconds left in regulation and the winner 1:42 into overtime. Broten forced overtime with a goal as the North Stars swarmed the goaltender Mike Palmateer in the final seconds with a two-man advantage. The Leafs' defenseman Jim Korn was sitting out a penalty, and the Stars' goaltender Don Beaupre had been pulled for an extra shooter. Nordiques 3, Sabres 2 QUEBEC (UPI) - Michel Goulet had two goals and an assist to help Quebec end a five-game home streak without a victory. With the score tied at 2-2, Goulet, a left wing, scored at 5:22 of the third period, driving a pass from Dale Hunter between Bob Sauve's pads.

Power Seat surged to the lead at the half-mile pole of the Red Mile today, then held off TV Yankee and Tarport Lizzy in the homestretch to win the Kentucky Futurity, the final race of the triple crown series for 3-year-old trotters. A trotter must win two heats to capture the Futurity. Power Seat's decisive victory came in the third heat, after he had taken the second and TV Yankee had won the first. Power Seat, driven by Bill O'Donnell, took the third heat by trotting the mile in 1:58 and paid $2.80, $2.10 and $2.10 for $2 across the board. TV Yankee returned $2.60 and $2.10, and Tarport Lizzy, the only filly in the 10-trotter field, paid $3. Three trotters will share the 1983 triple crown.

314-> Poland Grain Import Plans
Poland plans to import 3.5 million metric tons of grain from the West next year at a cost of more than $600 million, the official P.A.P. press agency said today. Western agricultural experts here doubted that imports would be that high. They estimated Poland would need about 2.5 million metric tons of wheat, 400,000 metric tons of corn and a few hundred thousand metric tons of oil feeds. They estimated the total grain harvest this year at 22 million metric tons, up from last year's 21.1 million tons. Because of Poland's acute foreign-currency shortage, grain imports fell from more than 6 million metric tons in 1981, to 3.7 million metric tons in 1982.

317-> KOCH CRITICIZES AMERICAN JEWS WHO YIELD TO 'ANTI-ISRAEL SENTIMENT'
Some American Jews have ''knuckled under to the pressures of the State Department and the anti-Israel sentiment that has grown in our land,'' Mayor Koch said yesterday. He called the Reagan Administration ''fair weather friends'' of Israel. The Mayor delivered a speech that was in part a challenge to some of his fellow Jews, in part a rebuttal to a recent speech in New York by the Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger. Mr. Weinberger's name was booed on its first mention by 350 guests at a luncheon of the Emunah, Women of America, in the New York Hilton Hotel. City Hall aides called it a ''major address,'' and the Mayor, who usually prefers to improvise, deviated little from the text. Weinberger's Comment Recalled Three times in talking to the group, part of the world religious Zionist women's organization, Mr. Koch referred in scornful tones to Mr. Weinberger's comment to the American Jewish Committee that he had ''no animus'' against Israel. ''Can we believe our Government when it tells us it has 'no animus' toward the state of Israel?'' the Mayor asked. ''Their 'love' for Israel lasts as long as Israel does exactly what the State Department wants it to,'' he said. He saw a deceptive lull in current relations between the two countries. ''The White House is not talking about Israeli 'intransigence,' '' he said. ''They are grateful to Israel for agreeing to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.'' 'You Have to Speak Out' The Mayor declined to name any American Jews who had ''knuckled under,'' but did say that, among American Jews, ''there are people who run for cover, afraid of being accused of dual loyalty.'' ''They want to bury their heads in the shtetl,'' Mr. Koch said. Retreating back to the ghetto is ineffective, Mr. Koch said. ''You have to speak out,'' he added. After his speech, the Mayor described President Reagan as a better friend of Israel's than President Jimmy Carter had been. But often, he said, Mr. Reagan gets bad advice because he is ''surrounded by a number of people who have been anti-Israel.'' In his speech, he criticized two recent incidents - Mr. Reagan's and Mr. Weinberger's speedy dissemination of the report that an American marine had halted three Israeli tank columns in Lebanon and the ouster of Ariel Sharon as Defense Minister to satisfy ''enlightened world opinion and many of our Jewish 'liberals.' '' Marine Incident Called 'Phony' His text put the word ''liberal'' in quotations, and he pronounced the word mockingly when he spoke. Mayoral aides say Mr. Koch, who has been an outspoken supporter of Israel, is particularly irritated at American Jews who do not share his enthusiasm. The incident with the marine was a ''phony report,'' full of inaccuracies, he said. ''With all this,'' he said, ''did our Government acknowledge the facts? No! There was no apology.'' As to Mr. Sharon, he said, Israel had been ''forced to sacrifice one of its most competent military leaders and to embarrass its field commanders before people will say: 'Now we know that Israel is a democracy.' '' He shook his head. ''So what's new?'' he said. ''Of course it is. The only democracy in the Mideast.'' Applause interrupted the Mayor's speech 11 times. Afterward a small crowd gathered around as Mr. Koch said to reporters that, as a Jewish-American, he felt no more hesitation in speaking out for Israel than Irish-Americans do in speaking out against oppression in Northern Ireland or blacks in speaking out against racism in South Africa. But there have always been some Jews who thought that ''if you did not speak up, then the Czar would leave you alone,'' he said. He shook his head thoughtfully. ''It doesn't work,'' he said.

318-> Trial Lawyers Reply To Liability Article
The Association of Trial Lawyers of America-New Jersey Affiliate is constrained to reply to the comments of Mark C. Perlberg (Opinion Page, Dec. 12), which decried the holding of the Supreme Court of New Jersey in recent products liability decisions. The public should be made aware that for more than 20 years the court has been recognized throughout the country as being in the forefront of the development of products liability law aimed at providing redress to those members of society who are harmed and damaged by defective products. Mr. Perlberg's comments essentially restate the losing arguments of the various defendants to the Supreme Court. The holding in the Beshada case was that, since knowledge of a defect is imputed to a manufacturer under the established principle of spreading of the risk, whether or not a manufacturer is in a position to have knowledge is irrelevant where the product is defective by reason of its failure to be accompanied by suitable warning of its hazards. To a lay person, such concepts may be legalistic, but the underlying policy considerations are clearly understandable. Strict liability is product-oriented and the conduct of the manufacturer is not of concern. The doctrine of negiligence deals with evaluation of conduct, but those principles have no pertinency in strict tort liability. Strict liability operates under the theory of risk-spreading, which is, simply, that the price of a product should reflect all of its costs, including the cost of injuries caused by the product. Thus, the whole cost of the product is borne by those who profit from it: ''The manufacturers and distributors who profit from its sale and the buyers who profit from its use.'' Better this than imposing the often-times devastating cost of severe injury upon a victim of a defective product. It is particularly fitting that the so-called ''state-of-the-art'' defense was struck down in a case where Johns-Manville, of asbestosbankruptcy fame, was one of the losing defendants. It has been documented in reported cases throughout the country that Johns-Manville did, in fact, have knowledge and was aware of the insidious hazard of asbestos exposure in the 1930's, and willfully chose to suppress that knowledge to the eternal harm of thousands of asbestos victims.

319-> EGYPT COOL TO ASSURANCES BY U.S. ON STRATEGIC ACCORD WITH ISRAEL
Nicholas A. Veliotes, the new United States Ambassador to Egypt, presented his credentials to President Hosni Mubarak today and tried to assuage Egyptian concerns about the new strategic agreement between the United States and Israel. But Egyptian officials reacted coolly to American assurances that the American-Israeli accord would not impede the search for peace in the Middle East. Osama el-Baz, a key foreign policy adviser to Mr. Mubarak, told reporters here Tuesday that despite American assurances, Egypt continued to see the new arrangement as an obstacle to the peace process and a clear indication that the United States is biased in favor of Israel. Mr. Baz, whose titles are First Foreign Under Secretary and director of the President's Office for Political Affairs, met over the weekend in Washington with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. The meeting, which was also attended by Ashraf Gorbal, Egypt's Ambassador to the United States, had been requested by the Egyptians to convey President Mubarak's concern about the accord, Egyptian officials said. Air Attacks Worry Cairo The comments by Mr. Baz were the first reaction by an Egyptian official to recent American efforts to soothe anxieties in Cairo about the accord and about American air attacks on Syrian- occupied positions in Lebanon. Mr. Baz told reporters, according to an official translation of his remarks, that in Washington he had delivered a message from President Mubarak calling on the United States to exercise restraint and to avoid an intensification of the fighting in Lebanon. He called Washington's decisions to resume sales of cluster bombs to Israel and to assist the production of Israeli military aircraft regrettable. He said the decisions, part of the agreement to increase political and military cooperation to thwart Soviet involvement in the Middle East, were a notable departure from the course that the United States outlined in the Camp David peace process almost five years ago. Mr. Baz noted further that the Reagan Administration had entered into the agreement at a time when Israel still occupied territory of what he referred to as three Arab countries - Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Envoy Urges Close Ties Today, Mr. Veliotes reiterated the Reagan Administration's position that good relations with Egypt were among the United States' top priorities in the Middle East. The new Ambassador, after meeting with President Mubarak, said the United States remained committed to the peace proposal put forward by President Reagan in September 1982. News reports of the strategic agreement with Israel have exaggerated aspects of the new accord, Mr. Veliotes asserted. He said there was no change in American policy in the Middle East. Donald Rumsfeld, the Reagan Administration's special Middle East envoy, is expected to arrive in Cairo Friday to explain further details of the American-Israeli accord to Mr. Mubarak and other senior officials, Egyptian officials said.

320-> OBJECTIONS TO AN UNWITNESSED WAR
Journalists and Congressional leaders, including many who approved of the invasion, were outraged by what some saw as an assault on the public's right to know. The Senate voted, 53 to 18, that the restrictions should ''cease.'' As fighting on the island subsided last week, the House of Representatives dispatched its own fact-finders. Press groups said the blackout on combat coverage had no precedent in World War II, Korea or Vietnam. ''The Defense Department has let down the American public,'' the American Society of Newspaper Editors said. Information was confined at first to Government handouts, Pentagon film and amateur radio broadcasts. Later, reporters got brief escorted tours. As protests swelled, news people were allowed to remain on their own . Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said permitting direct coverage might have jeopardized the operation and journalists' safety. A House judiciary subcommittee looked for broader implications. Chairman Robert W. Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat, saw the curbs as part of ''a swing back toward restrictions on civil liberties'' that included President Reagan's executive orders. The orders have expanded authority for political surveillance, the use of lie detectors to discourage unauthorized disclosures, lifetime censorship of the writings of high-level officials and tightened restrictions on scientific communication. Senator John Tower, Texas Republican, told the admirals who took responsibility for the Grenada restrictions, ''You have done the right thing.'' This view was shared in many letters published by the newspapers.

322-> DEMOCRATS' SWEEP THROUGH WEST POINTS UP SOME POLITICAL DISCORD
After a cross-country fund-raising tour for their party, six Democratic Presidential candidates scattered today to resume their own campaigning and to assess what they may have gained or lost from the two days of joint appearances. Although the Presidential Sweep tour was supposed to have presented a front of party unity, by the time it ended here Tuesday night it had added to the political differences among the candidates over party rules and campaign issues. Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, whose speech Tuesday night at a $1,000- a-plate fund-raising event included a series of political jokes that were greeted with silent stares from the audience, left town complaining that the Democrats had let pass an opportunity to learn from Western governors here how the West could be won in 1984. ''The dominant political fact is that for the last four national elections Democrats have conceded the 122 electoral votes in the West to the Republicans,'' said Mr. Hart. ''There is some justification for the perception out here that Democrats don't really care about the West.'' Focusing on Each Other Mr. Hart, who is counting on Western support to help his Presidential campaign, made an unsuccessful effort to have the candidates and the governors who gathered to meet with them stage a public debate on Western issues. But the governors insisted on holding a private meeting with the candidates, followed by a joint news conference this morning. Instead of focusing on the Western political agenda, however, most of the candidates used the news conference to attack rules for selection of party delegates and to assail the candidacy of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who skipped the event to campaign in Texas. Senator John Glenn of Ohio, for example, had less to say about Federal water policy, a major issue out here, than about Mr. Mondale's campaign promises to various interest groups. ''If we go out and keep overpromising,'' the Senator said, ''we either will have to break our promises or break the bank.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the party's only black Presidential candidate, who was the center of attention on the tour, warned that state and national party leaders would have to come to grips with ''the new political reality'' posed by his challenge of the party's delegate rules if Democrats expected to defeat President Reagan next year. Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, billing himself as the ''Cabbage Patch'' candidate, urged that Democrats pay as much attention to the budget freeze he had proposed as to the nuclear freeze. A Gloomy Note For his part, former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota steered clear of party disputes and personalities and sounded the gloomiest note of the tour. ''I don't say this lightly,'' he said at every stop, ''but President Reagan is heading us toward war in the Middle East and Central America.'' The fund-raising tour, which brought in $1.5 million, drew out some of the frustration the other candidates feel over their unsuccessful efforts to whittle down Mr. Mondale's commanding lead in the public opinion polls. In a number of interviews on the trip, Mr. Hollings, whose political humor has taken on a bite lately, spoke almost contemptuously of Mr. Mondale and Mr. Glenn, referring to them as the candidates of ''mush.'' He criticized Mr. Mondale for his caution in commenting on American policy in Lebanon and other issues. Of Mr. Glenn, Senator Hollings said in an interview today, ''Old John is inadequate. He just doesn't like politics.'' Mr. Hollings said Mr. Jackson's entry into the race was ''a healthy thing'' and that he might follow the lead of Mr. Hart in exploring the possibility of a series of joint campaign appearances with the civil rights leader, whom Mr. Hollings calls ''a black Kennedy. The Senator said he had great personal affection for Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina but has made Chicago his base, adding, ''I wish I wasn't running so I could coach him some.''

324-> MYSTERY: THE NIGHT KNITTERS
What is going on these evenings on John Finley Walk makes for one of New York City's more unusual cottage industries, not to mention a recurring social get-together alluded to with some mystery by neighbors as the Maltese Circle. John Finley Walk is the promenade of Carl Schurz Park, which separates East End Avenue from the East River in the upper 80's, and each evening before dusk a number of Maltese women who knit come to one of its green-painted circular benches. Usually there are half a dozen, occasionally as many as 12, all sitting side by side, knitting. Often they rock baby carriages with their feet as they knit. Often they caution their children playing in an adjoining stone-rimmed sandbox. Often their husbands are with them on the ends of the bench. And until dark the women chat laconically with one another and with curious passers-by while they create sweaters and tops destined for the collections of one or more American designers. Not That Communicative The mystery lies in which designer or designers they are working for. The Maltese women aren't all that communicative. They mentioned Perry Ellis's name, but Mr. Ellis's office says it isn't sure whether the women are knitting for him or not. The women would not say who exactly had hired them other than that it was a woman who wanted fine knitwear for designers. One curious passer-by was Ruth Goldschlager, who said that she had noticed ''these youngish women knitting, late into the dark, chattering in this strange language.'' She said: ''My sister asked who they were. They said they were Maltese and they were knitting for Perry Ellis. It gave us a jump on what the new colors would be. Last year we looked for tweeds and blues. This year for yellows and light colors.'' Another observer was a jogger, Robbie Carp, a textile designer, who said she first noticed them ''all knitting the same thing one night under that one light.'' ''We know how to knit, it is our tradition,'' said one of the women the other night. She said her name was Josefina. ''It is what we grew up with on Gozo.'' All of the women who were on the promenade bench the other evening declined to give their last names because, they said, they thought that they might lose their jobs if they did. They said their first names were Josefina, Margarita, Catherine and Maria. ''All of us are from Gozo, we knit, we crochet,'' Josefina said. ''It is how we make our living.'' Gozo is the northernmost of the five islands that make up the Republic of Malta, a Mediterranean country 58 miles south of Sicily that was a way station of history for Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, the knights of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, the French and the British until it became a republic 19 years ago. Its language, Maltese, is an amalgam of Arabic and Italian, and it is this language that the knitting women of Gozo speak, but they do speak enough English to say that they have brought with them a tradition of lace tatting, hand spinning of yarn and fine knitting. It was natural for them, according to Maria, to be interested when an advertisement asking for fine hand knitters appeared in a newspaper several years ago. ''It was this lady,'' she said. ''She said she wanted fine knitting for designers. She said she worked privately.'' Had they indeed knitted for Perry Ellis, as some passers-by said they were told? ''We used to work for Perry Ellis,'' Maria said. ''Then he went broke,'' Josefina said with a joking laugh. ''Now Perry Ellis comes from China,'' Catherine said. ''It's cheaper to make knitting there. By machines.'' A call to Mr. Ellis's office brought a comment from a spokesman: ''Mr. Ellis really doesn't know if they've knitted for him. After all he has people knitting for him all over the world, including New York.'' He suggested that Monique Recant, Mr. Ellis's knitwear director, be asked. Miss Recant said she couldn't tell whether the Maltese women in Carl Schurz Park had in fact knitted sweaters for Mr. Ellis. ''It's conceivable,'' she said, adding that most of the knitting work is farmed out through contractors. ''We're always flattered when people say they're knitting for Perry Ellis, whether they are or not.'' ''Maybe they're knitting for Calvin Klein or Ralph Lauren,'' Miss Recant said. Had the women knitted for Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren or even Geoffrey Beene, for that matter? ''We're not saying,'' Margarita said. ''But many come to us because we are the fastest and the best.'' Margarita was knitting a white and yellow top, Catherine a black sweater, Josefina a beige top trimmed with aqua and peach, Maria a cream sweater with blue and yellow trim. The yarn is provided by their contractor, the women said, and they are paid by the garment. ''She gives us the patterns,'' Josefina said. ''What we are paid depends on how fast we work,'' Maria said. ''For us it's like a hobby. We make our own conditions. We sit here. We talk.'' ''We meet here in the summer,'' Josefina said. And in the winter? ''We knit in each other's houses,'' she said.''

325-> MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY The New YorkExperience
For New York City's garment industry and for thousands of out-of- town buyers gathered to view its new spring lines, last week was a washout. A 68-year-old, 12-inch water main burst, short-circuiting a subterranean power station and blacking out the 12 Manhattan blocks where the fashion business is based at the height of the August market week. Wholesalers and designers scrambled to set up alternate showrooms or simply prayed buyers wouldn't leave town. ''Stores around the country are dependent on the garment center,'' said a spokesman for the Federation of Apparel Manufacturers. Even so, the disruption might cost the $17.5-billion-a-year industry tens of millions of dollars and more than a few of F.A.M.'s 5,500 members their shirts. Macy's and Gimbels also lost a bundle before reopening with generator rigs. The New York Statler Hotel sent 2,500 guests packing. Officials in Washington indicated they would look favorably on a city request for disaster aid. Mayor Koch, meanwhile, said he was ''proud'' the public was ''supportive.'' That may have been partly due to a saturation force of police, who racked up $1.5 million in overtime. The city lost about $250,000 a day in sales taxes and could face staggering liability claims. The massive rewiring effort by Con Ed supervisors - unionized employees were in the seventh week of a strike - was complicated by fierce thunderstorms that also disrupted subway service. They nevertheless managed to restore power yesterday morning, three days after the main broke and two days ahead of their original estimate. Commuters from New Jersey had another problem. Shortly after the Monday morning rush, a ceiling suspended over the Journal Square PATH station collapsed, killing two, injuring 10 and closing the station. The Port Authority acknowledged that a section of the ceiling was found to be sagging during an April inspection but said the problem was not considered an emergency. An investigation was under way.

327-> IDEAS & TRENDS; THE MARK OF A DREAD DISEASE
Doctors must be able to diagnose a genetic disease before they can help its victims. Huntington's chorea, a frightening and invariably fatal nervous system disorder, has thwarted all such efforts. Last week, scientists announced finding a genetic marker, or sequence of genetic material, associated with the gene that causes the disease. Moreover, they said they had developed a test to determine who carries the tell-tale sequence. According to Dr. James F. Gusella of Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the principal researchers, the techniques used in this case - a combination of genetic engineering and a trial-and-error comparison of known gene markers with genetic material from Huntington's chorea victims - should lead to the development of diagnostic tests for other hereditary ailments. The research is described in the Nov. 17 issue of Nature. Huntington's chorea, also called Woody Guthrie disease after the folk singer who died from it in 1967, does not show itself until the fourth or fifth decade of life, by which time adult victims may have unknowingly passed it on to their children. The new test, which won't be ready for standard use for another year or two, would permit early diagnosis and thus genetic counseling.

It was some put down for Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Continental Airlines. Mr. Lorenzo, who has been battling striking pilots over work- rule changes aimed at saving money, was aboard a Continental flight that landed on a taxiway instead of a runway at Denver's Stapleton Airport last week. No one was hurt and there was no damage (the taxiway is as long as the runway but only half as wide). But the leader of the striking pilots, saying the airline's new rules were unsafe, cited the incident as ''an example of why we've been warning passengers not to fly Continental.'' The airline said its work rules were in compliance with Federal regulations and were no tougher on pilots than those of some other carriers.

330-> NEW YORK JOBLESS DECLINE
The unemployment rate for New York City dropped to 10.1 percent in September, compared with 10.6 percent in both July and August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. The unemployment rate for New York State, however, edged upward to 8.6 percent in September from the July and August figure of 8.5 percent. New Jersey's rate moved downward to 8.2 percent in September from 8.9 percent in August. The rate for the state in July had been 8.4 percent. The figures for both states are seasonally adjusted. In New York City there were 315,000 unemployed residents in September, compared with 330,000 in July and August, according to Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the bureau. A year ago, there were 280,000 jobless, he said. 'Still Weak and Hesitant' The number employed in the city in September was 2.8 million, little changed from August or a year ago, although Mr. Ehrenhalt said positive signs in the job market here were ''still weak and hesitant.'' He observed, however, that the downtrend in manufacturing employment in the city had eased after a loss of 50,000 factory jobs in the last two years. In New York State overall, he said, there was some strengthening of the employment situation even though the jobless rate rose slightly. Total employment of New York State residents in September was 7,538,000, up about 200,000 over the year. The rise in jobs, he said, indicates that the recovery has ''firmed'' and that ''things seem to be looking up in New York State.'' But the state has a long way to go, he said, noting that the current total of about 1.3 million manufacturing jobs was still 200,000 below what it was in 1979. The number unemployed in the state last month was 710,000, only a little higher than in August or a year ago. A Drop in Jersey Jobless In New Jersey the number of unemployed residents inched down by 26,000 from 331,000 in August to 305,000 in September. A year ago there were 336,000 unemployed. The downward movement in the state's jobless rate last month was accompanied by an over-the-year gain in the number of employed residents. At 3.4 million, the number with jobs in September was up 100,000 from the end of 1982.

331-> Harvard Trounces Penn, 28-0
Harvard trounced Pennsylvania, 28- 0, today at Soldier Field, and an Ivy League championship for the Crimson became something more than a September possibility. Dartmouth's loss to Brown and the outcome here brought about a three- way tie for first place in the league. Dartmouth, Harvard and Penn have 4-1-1 records in the league, and next Saturday the Ivy season concludes with Dartmouth playing at Penn and Harvard at Yale. What happened here today suggested that Harvard has an excellent chance at the title, which was shared last year by the Crimson, Dartmouth and Penn. Coach Joe Restic's team was never in difficulty after stopping an 88-yard drive by Penn in the first quarter. The Red and Blue had little offensive effectivenss thereafter and Harvard looked good on offense and defense. Harvard Shows Quickness Since losing to Dartmouth Oct. 15, one week after a tie against Cornell, the Crimson has beaten Princeton, Brown and Penn and tied undefeated Holy Cross. Quickness, so essential to the complex Restic offense, was there today and mistakes were few. Playing conditions were poor because of a brisk wind that blew and swirled inside the stadium and chilled the crowd of 12,000. The first affecting penalty was an obscure one - illegal participation - on a punt play hastily called by Harvard. Penn, in switching its lineup, had players still coming and going from the sideline. (A team must be stationary and set by the time the ball is snapped.) Bob Steinberg kicked to the Penn 6 but the ball was brought back and the 15-yard penalty gave Harvard a first down at the Red and Blue's 16. Four plays later, Mark Vignali, the wingback, scored from the 2 on third down. Harvard's next touchdown followed a turnover, a fumble by the Penn fullback, Chuck Nolan, at the Red and Blue 32. An 11-yard pass-interference penalty placed the Crimson at the 1 and Greg Gizzi, the quarterback, scored from there by running straight ahead. The Crimson continued to roll in the third quarter, driving 57 yards in 9 plays for a third touchdown, scored by Tim McGugan from the 1. Crimson Scores a Safety A safety added 2 points when John Dailey blocked Sam Coroniti's punt and the ball rolled out of the end zone. Gizzi made the last score on a 7-yard end run. Gizzi had 13 carries in the Restic game plan and completed 9 of 14 passes for 117 yards, all of them sensibly short in the windstorm. The Penn quarterbacks, John McGeehan and Jim Crocicchia, had more difficulty with passes, completing only 4 of 17 for 39 yards. Steve Ernst, the fullback, was the key performer in the Harvard attack as he gained 115 yards on 24 carries.

France deployed paratroops in the eastern Chad town of Abeche. The French forces were backed by helicopters and had orders to return fire if attacked. The move came as the Government forces they support pulled back to a new defense line under continued Libyan air strikes. (Page 1, Column 1.) Anti-Pinochet protests continued in Chile. Seven people were killed Friday night, raising the death toll in two days of protests to 24, the Government said. (1:2.) The Green Party in West Germany, an upstart political group formed by a generation of people in their 20's and early 30's, has major implications for the future of West Germany, the European pivot of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The four-year old Greens stand for preservation of a threatened environment and opposition to nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, but their fundamental position is a rejection of what has been West Germany's economic and foreign policy consensus, and President Reagan's foreign policies. (1:2.) The U.S. firmly insisted that officials be allowed to interview a Russian diplomat's son, who apparently wants to remain in the United States, before he is returned to the Soviet Union. (1:1.) National Depressed American communities along the Mexican border were promised more attention by President Reagan. In a speech in El Paso, where he continued his campaign to win Hispanic votes and Texas support in his presumed re-election bid, Mr. Reagan announced a new ''inter- agency action group'' to deal with the border communities. (1:5.) Part-time jobs are held by more and more American workers out of choice or because full-time work is not available. In 1982, 18.3 million people, almost a fifth of the employed workers, worked part time. Part-time work also offers advantages to employers in the form of substantial savings on labor costs. (1:3.) The arms control issue dominated a ''peace forum'' in at the Des Moines Civic Center attended by Walter Mondale and Senators John Glenn of Ohio, Gary Hart of Colorado and Alan Cranston of California, candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination. They assailed President Reagan for putting a military buildup ahead of nuclear arms reductions. (20:1.) The Mount Palomar telescope in California is threatened, according to astronomers, by a new street lighting system San Diego officials plan to install. Scientists contend the new lights would drastically increase skyglow over San Diego, 60 miles from Palomar, thus interfering with the optical telescope's ability to see distant galaxies. (25:1.) A break-in of computers via telephone by a group of young people in Milwaukee was done just for fun and needed no unusual expertise, according to interviews with people familiar with the group. One member of the group said many computer installations made little effort to keep unauthorized people out. (30:3.) Metropolitan The garment district blackout ended, and life began returning to normal in the 12-block area where electricity was cut Wednesday by a fire in a substation.

As Russell Baker began to develop his point that the Government has been telling the public they don't know enough about the freeze to have an opinion, and should leave the matter to ''experts,'' I started asking myself, ''Where have I heard this before?''

Carried to an extreme, the notion that a populace can have only limited knowledge of important domestic and foreign issues is a dangerous one. It fosters elitism and government by secrecy.

Mason Jr., assistant director of the Morgan, said yesterday. As a result, the New York Public Library, which now houses the documents temporarily by court order in its performing arts branch at Lincoln Center, yesterday dropped out of the contest to obtain them permanently. The public library said that it would not compete against a ''sister institution.'' After months of trying, the public library had been unable to raise more than $2.2 million in pledges to acquire and maintain the Russian-born composer's collection. The Morgan donor's proposal is $250,000 more than that offered by the Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland, which up to now had been the highest bidder for the collection. Sources in New York and Europe, who declined to be identified, said that Paul Sacher, the wealthy Swiss collector and orchestra conductor, would continue his efforts to obtain the Stravinsky documents. The deadline for the final bids for the collection is Monday. ''High noon is 2 P.M.,'' said one of the lawyers for the Stravinsky estate. At that time, any competing offers for the papers will be considered and the disposition of the papers decided, according to Martin Garbus, a trustee of the estate, who, with his co-trustee, James J. Higginson, represents the Stravinsky heirs and beneficiaries. 'Private Charitable Foundation' The anonymous donor is believed to be a family foundation that has close ties to the Morgan Library, at 36th Street and Madison Avenue. The lawyer for the donor, James Woodman Lloyd, a member of the firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, said yesterday that his client had authorized him to say only: ''A private charitable foundation, which wishes to remain anonymous, is interested in acquiring the Stravinsky collection and lodging it in the Morgan Library for exhibition and study by scholars.'' Under the conditions of the donor's offer, the papers would be placed at the Morgan on deposit rather than donated as an outright gift, sources involved in the negotiation said. The details of the offer are now being discussed by lawyers, trustees and philanthropists. The terms of the acquisition, according to Mr. Garbus, will include 10 percent of the purchase price down at the time of the offer, and the balance when title passes to the collection -the day the papers are removed from the New York Public Library. The potential bidders have been informed that the conditions of sale also include that the collection will not be resold or broken up and that the papers be maintained, exhibited and made available to scholars. It is possible that the Sacher Foundation could come up with a higher offer than that of the anonymous donor for the Morgan Library. If so, complex tax considerations would come into play. The trustees do not have to accept the highest bid, according to a Surrogate's Court decision. Library Still in Running There is still a small chance that the New York Public Library would continue to hold the Stravinsky papers in case a hitch develops in the negotiations with the trustees, heirs and beneficiaries of the estate. Waiting in the wings, the public library will be present in the negotiations Monday as a party in interest rather than as an active bidder. Vartan Gregorian, president of the public library, said of the new offer: ''The library welcomes this development. We our proud of our unrelenting efforts to gain the support of the American philanthropic and cultural community, which we believe contributed to bringing to the fore a donation which may keep the archive in New York. The library will not bid against a sister New York institution or take any action to jeopardize the donation on its behalf.'' The public library recently appealed to other cultural institutions for what Mr. Gregorian described as a possible ''joint acquisition.'' Such an appeal failed to materialize with institutions in New York and elsewhere. . Asked why he thought the anonymous donor had decided to make the donation to the Morgan instead of the public library, Mr. Mason of the Morgan said, ''I have no idea,'' then added: ''Of course, the anonymous charitable foundation knew of our interest in the Stravinsky papers and our own extensive musical collection. We got the call and we were delighted.'' The Morgan Library had shown its own independent interest in the Stravinsky collection even before the papers landed in the public library early this year. Stravinsky manuscripts already held by the Morgan include the full score and 76 parts of his 1910 ''Firebird''; the 1918 manuscript of ''Ragtime for 11 Instruments''; the revised 1946 orchestral score of ''Petrouchka,'' first performed in 1911; part of the 1936 score of ''Persephone,'' and other manuscripts and letters. According to both Mr. Gregorian and Mr. Mason, the newspaper stories in recent weeks caused the anonymous donor to come forward with a pledge. The Stravinsky archive in the public library that goes on sale Monday is considered one of the most important 20th century private collections in existence. It covers 60 years of musical, dance and literary history, including 116 boxes of letters and memorabilia and 225 drawers holding manuscripts, including unpublished pieces. There is correspondence from Debussy, Diaghilev, Poulenc, Auric, Milhaud and hundreds of other musical figures. The material goes back to 1905 and is practically a history of the Ballets Russe. There are two groups of heirs and beneficiaries who would benefit from the sale of the collection. They are the children and grandchild of Stravinsky, from his first marriage, and Robert Craft, Stravinsky's collaborator and biographer. Two of the children, Soulima Stravinsky and Milene Stravinsky Marion, live in the United States; his oldest son, Theodore, and granddaughter, Catherine, live in Europe. Mr. Craft is an American. For those living in the United States, there could be tax credits, an important consideration in the final disposition of the collection.

338-> News Summary; MONDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1983
International Hindu tribesmen killed 600 people in an eight-hour attack on Moslem settlements in a rural area of Assam, a state in northeastern India, according to a senior state official. Witnesses said that the Moslem settlements were attacked by thousands of tribal people armed with homemade guns, machetes and spears. The figures, if confirmed, would bring the number of dead in three weeks of sectarian and ethnic violence in the state to about 1,000. (Page A1, Column 6.) Ariel Sharon will remain on two important Government bodies, the steering committee for the negotiations with Lebanon and the larger of the two ministerial panels on defense. The decision by the Israeli Cabinet, made at Prime Minister Menachem Begin's request, appeared to mean that Mr. Sharon, the former Defense Minister, would continue to have a major role in shaping Israel's positions in the talks with Lebanon, officials said. (A1:4.) A moderate P.L.O. official resigned after Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, prevented him from addressing a meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algeria. The official, Dr. Issam Sertawi, had been expected to call for an expanded dialogue between the P.L.O. and Israelis, as well as for a clear-cut P.L.O. acceptance of the ''two-state solution'' - a Palestinian state in the West Bank side by side with Israel. (A7:1.) Libya's apparent threat to the Sudan has ''receded,'' Secretary of State George P. Shultz said. Another State Department official said that unless there was a sudden outbreak of violence the four Air Force planes that were been sent to Egypt by President Reagan last week when the threat seemed a possibility would be withdrawn. (A1:5.) Fear of an OPEC price war that could break up the organization brought about urgent consultations between Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members after Nigeria, another OPEC member, lowered its price Saturday by $5.50 a barrel, to $30. (A1:5.) An agricultural trade war is threatened among leading industrialized nations as they compete for a share of world food markets to compensate for a decline in industrial exports. One of many Government officials concerned about the possibility of all-out farmtrade war is Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that such an outbreak would have a ''devastating impact'' on the world economic order. (A1:2.) Supporters of Joshua Nkomo, opposition leader in Zimbabwe, gathered by the thousands outside his home in Bulawayo after his eight-hour detention by the police, who prevented him from boarding a plane for a trip to Czechoslovakia Saturday and confiscated his passport. He was to attend a meeting of the Soviet-sponsored World Peace Council. (A3:4.) National Medicare's financial problems have worsened since the withdrawal of $12.4 billion from the Medicare trust fund to rescue Social Security's old-age benefits trust fund. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Medicare trust fund will be depleted by 1987 or 88. Medicare's annual report, to be issued in April, shows that it will be depleted by 1989 or sooner if the Social Security System fails to pay interest on the money it has borrowed. (A1:1.) The Justice Department was asked by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether a former agency official acted improperly at the time of Government negotiations on cleaning up a hazardous waste site, high E.P.A. officials said. They said the Administrator, Anne Gorsuch Burford, believed the actions by the official, Rita M. Lavelle, might have violated Federal law. Miss Lavelle was recently dismissed from the agency by President Reagan. (A1:2.) The 13 people shot dead at a gambling club in Seattle's Chinatown Friday came from throughout Chinese society in the Seattle area. Twelve men and a woman were tied, robbed and shot at the Wah Mee club, a fixture of Seattle's International District for 50 years, a survivor of many that had flourished in the region. (A12:2.) Further isolation of small towns is feared by their residents as a result of a new Federal law that has given intercity bus lines sweeping authority to abandon routes they no longer want to operate. A typical town being affected by the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 is Kerman, Calif. (B7:1.) Metropolitan An affirmative-action program in New York State was promised by Governor Cuomo in a speech in Albany at the 12th annual meeting of the Legislature's Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. He said the program would ''develop annual goals for minority employment in every department of state government.'' He also announced his nomination of three blacks and five persons of Hispanic origin to ranking administrative posts. (A1:1.) New York-Connecticut talks about what to do about the Connecticut 17 1/2-cent turnpike tokens that fit city subway turnstiles were approaching agreement when they hit a snag. The turnpike tokens were to be sent back to the mint to be made thicker, but New York balked when Connecticut requested that the city promise not to change its tokens for ''the foreseeable future.''

339-> Mafia's Help Reported In the Rescue of Dozier
American and Italian intelligence officials turned to the Mafia for help in locating Brig, Gen. James L. Dozier after his kidnapping in Italy and rescued him the day after a Mafia leader revealed where the general was being held, Time magazine reports in its current issue. The magazine said the operation was so secret that not even the American Ambassador to Italy, Maxwell Rabb, had been aware of it. The magazine said it was unclear if Franchino Restelli, a Mafia leader imprisoned in Milan, was the first or sole source of the Padua address at which Red Brigades members were holding General Dozier. But Time said a participant in an interview the authorities had with Mr. Restelli on Jan. 27, 1982 - more than a month after the Dozier kidnapping -said the Mafia leader provided the address.

Pope Hopes for Truce In Lands He Is to Visit ROME, Feb. 20 (Reuters) - Pope John Paul II wants his trip to eight Central American and Caribbean nations next month to provide an opportunity for at least a truce in the civil wars in the region, Vatican officials said today. Speculation that the Pope might drop Nicaragua from his itinerary because of the church's involvement in the Sandinist Government, meanwhile, has been firmly denied by Vatican officials. Leading Nicaraguan bishops met the Pope here on Saturday, setting off rumors that his March 4 visit to Managua might be in question. But a Vatican spokesman excluded any significant change of program and said the meeting had been for routine consultations. ---- SAN SALVADOR, Feb. 20 (Reuters) - Defense Minister Jose Guillermo Garcia today rejected a call for a truce in El Salvador's war against leftist guerrillas during Pope John Paul II's visit. ''The armed forces cannot ask for a truce,'' he said, ''because it is not fighting a conventional war against another nation, but a dirty war.''

341-> TV: 'PERSEPHONE,' BALLET
ONE of the most ambitious undertakings of the New York City Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky festival was ''Persephone,'' which will be seen tonight on Channel 13 in ''Balanchine Celebrates Stravinsky,'' in the ''Great Performances'' ''Dance in America'' series. Created by Igor Stravinsky in 1933, ''Persephone'' is a blend of dance, music and declamation that has seldom been presented in anything but concert form. To tell the ancient myth of the abduction of Persephone by Pluto, ruler of the underworld, and of her subsequent return to earth as the personification of spring, the work requires a tenor, mixed chorus, boys' choir, dancers and orchestra. It also demands a performer who can move and recite verse. In this new staging by George Balanchine, John Taras and Vera Zorina, ''Persephone'' has found an ideal central figure in Miss Zorina, a noted interpreter of the role. The dance element is muted here. In the production's two most animated moments of dance, Mercury looks as if he may bound into a cartwheel at any moment, and a duet for Pluto and the spirit of Persephone is pretty undistinguished stuff. But Miss Zorina, a former ballet, film and Broadway dancer and actress, fills the stage with her serene presence. She moves lyrically and speaks Andre Gide's verse in clear, beautifully cadenced French, particularly in Persephone's poignant awakening in the underworld. No translation is needed, though the subtitles for the narration by Eumolpus are helpful in advancing the plot. Joseph Evans was the strong, dignified Eumolpus, and Mel Tomlinson was a glittering Pluto, reptilian and regal, a suitable escort to Karin von Aroldingen as the spirit Persephone. Gen Horiuchi was the fleet-footed Mercury. As designed by Kermit Love, this ''Persephone'' is a ritual that suggests the rites of Russia and of Greece. It is also a spectacle that benefits from the focus and framing of the camera eye. Mr. Balanchine's ''Agon,'' which opens the program, does not. Here the camera cuts away the open space so necessary to the ballet and distorts its scale. It does provide closeups of fine performances by Heather Watts and Mel Tomlinson, in the ballet's signature pas de deux, and by Maria Calegari, Daniel Duell, Wilhelmina Frankfurt, Renee Estopinal, Victor Castelli and Peter Frame. Even more rewarding, ''Balanchine Celebrates Stravinsky'' records the genius of Suzanne Farrell, as once more she gives herself up with utter generosity to Mr. Balanchine's choreography, here the knotty, haunting ''Variations.''

342-> POSTINGS; COLONIAL TOUCH
In 1898 Ernest Flagg, the architect of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., built an estate on Staten Island called Stone Court. For the main house he drew upon Dutch colonial and Caribbean architectural influences, as well as the American colonial tradition. To this day the house is known as the Flagg mansion, though now it is the of the St. Charles seminary. The 300-acre estate, in the Todt Hill section, has long since been subdivided, but the seminary had a seven-acre parcel that it offered for sale not long ago. The buyer was Sanford Nalitt, a developer. Now Mr. Nalitt is planning to build 22 houses on the property, to sell for upwards of $500,000. To a large extent his plans have been shaped by the fact that much of the property falls within a designated preservation district. The project's architect, Robert A. M. Stern, has been working with the staffs of both the City Planning Commission and the Landmarks Preservation Commission to produce a master plan that both commissions will accept. The goal is to make both the houses and the re-landscaped public areas compatible with the mansion's architectural style, Mr. Nalitt said. The prominence of stone in the design of the houses will help to do this. The builder will also renovate a few of the original secondary buildings for residential use. The development will be called Copperflagg. Houses will be built on quarter-acre lots and will average 4,000 square feet. Many will be four-bedroom units and all will feature screened porches. Mr. Nalitt said he hoped to begin construction in September.

343-> POSTINGS; JAPANESE BUILD ON E. 79TH ST.
During the past 15 years, Nissho-Iwai, a Japanese trading company, made its name in real estate by building some 18,000 condominium units throughout Japan. Now the company is making its bid for a share of the New York condominium development market with its first project in the United States: a 21-story condominium apartment building at 124 East 79th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues. The East 79th Street condominium, as well as others planned by the Japanese company, will be built through its real-estate concern, Sun Realty Corporation. The apartment building will rise on a 66- by 100-foot parcel that is now occupied by two four-story buildings scheduled for demolition. The architect for the residential structure, Peter Samton of the Gruzen Partnership, said the main goal was to design a building that fit gracefully with the other ''street-wall'' facades in the block. ''For a long time, the trend in designing the fronts and facades in residential buildings was for various setbacks and plazas,'' Mr. Samton said. ''But not only have we realized that those designs were not always desirable, but in this case such a design would be out of character. We want the building to be like connective tissue that ties together with other buildings on that street.'' The building's height will not surpass that of any other structure on the block. But because the developers have applied to the City Planning Commission for a bonus of about 20 percent above the existing floor-area ratio for the lot, the design is subject to the approval of both the commission and Community Board 8. The condominium building will have 70 studios and one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. The plan still requires approval by the Attorney General's Office and is subject to change, but prices for the units are expected to range from about $130,000 for some studios to $600,000 for one of the three-bedroom penthouses. Construction is expected to begin in October and be completed by early 1985.

345-> MUSIC: CLEVELAND COMPOSERS
NEW YORK chauvinists often divide music of our time into two arbitrary categories: ''uptown'' and ''downtown.'' At Symphony Space on Saturday night, David Stock, conductor of the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, made a plea for what he called ''out-of-town'' music, and devoted an entire program to works by members of the Cleveland Guild of Composers. The longest composition of the evening was also the least gratifying. Dennis Eberhard's ''Parody,'' for soprano and chamber orchestra, is a collection of disjunct rattles, groans, honks and squeaks written in an academic style that is now largely passe. Much more interesting was Eugene O'Brien's ''Embarking for Cythera,'' which alternates between scurrying 16th notes and organlike drones, and features a delicate and evanescent coda. In addition, the New Music Ensemble offered authoritative performances of Edwin London's amiable pastiche, ''Bebop Dreams''; Larry Baker's ''Reason,'' an ambitious but drab experiment with microtones and spatial arrangement; Rudolph Bubalo's colorful ''Strata II,'' and Thomas Janson's sincere but fitful rhapsody, ''The Harlequin.'' The committed and generally praiseworthy soloists included the hornist John Scandrett, the soprano Lynne Webber and the violinist Richard Di Adamo. Tim Page

346-> Money Supply Fraud Case
A Federal judge has imposed a sentence of one year's probation on a former Federal Reserve System employee who illegally retrieved sensitive information from the Fed's computer after he left the agency. United States District Judge William B. Bryant handed down the sentence Friday to Theode C. Langevin, 34 years old, who had pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. Mr. Langevin, of Laurel, Md., received information about the nation's money supply last November from a computer terminal at E.F. Hutton & Company in New York. Hutton, which had just hired the money supply analyst, was not implicated in the case.

347-> TAXING CAPITAL GAINS: CHANGE HELPS INVESTORS
One of President Reagan's major changes in the tax field has been a lowering of the rate of taxation on capital gains: the maximum tax on long-term capital gains realized in 1982 is only 20 percent. As a result, it is more attractive than ever to invest in property that is expected to increase in value, be it over-the-counter stock, gold coins or a new home. ''Except for inventory, pretty much anything you held for more than a year and then sold or exchanged at a gain can give rise to the capital gains tax, and whether it's stock or silver or household furniture, the most tax you will pay on it will be 20 percent,'' said Martha Jay of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. an accounting firm. ''There was a lot of discussion about going even further and reducing the holding period to six months, but that never happened, at least not yet.'' The current rate - down from a previous maximum of 28 percent went into effect in the middle of 1981, so 1982 was the first full year with the 20 percent ceiling. Reporting Gains and Losses Capital gains and losses must be reported separately from other income, on Schedule D. Long-term gains and losses come from assets that have been held more than a year; short-term gains and losses come from those owned a year or less - except that commodity futures are arbitrarily deemed a mixture of the two, 60 percent long-term and 40 percent short-term. Generally, gains are reported in the year the proceeds are received. There is a new exception to this rule, though, which can be of great tax-planning value to those who own stock that has risen in value. Because it takes a few days for securities transactions to be settled, gains on stock sold last year after Dec. 23, can be reported on either the 1982 return or the 1983 return, whichever will be more helpful to the taxpayer. Losses must be reported on the 1982 return. The tax due on capital gains and losses is figured as follows: First, short-term gains and losses are put together to determine a net gain or loss. Then the same is done for long-term gains and losses. Capital losses are useful to taxpayers because they reduce taxes by, in effect, offsetting as much as $3,000 of income a year. (Every dollar of net short-term loss offsets a dollar of income, while every dollar of net long-term loss offsets 50 cents of income.) Losses that are cut off by that $3,000 offset limit are carried over into the next tax year. Short-Term Gains Net short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income. But where there are net long-term gains - to the extent that they exceed any net short-term losses - 60 percent of the gain is excluded from being taxed, and the other 40 percent is included with ordinary income. Depending on the tax bracket, it is subject to a tax of up to 50 percent. The result is a ceiling rate of 20 percent on long-term gains. So if a taxpayer has a $50,000 net long-term capital gain from the sale of his house, $30,000 will be excluded and $20,000 will be added to his other taxable income. If the taxpayer is in the 50 percent bracket, he will have to pay $10,000 in tax on the sale. Taxpayers who have a substantial percentage of their income sheltered in capital gains or other ''tax preference'' items may find themselves subject to other special taxes, which are meant to keep too much income from falling out of the Federal tax system. Those who had more than $20,000 of capital gains excluded in 1982 - or who had very large charitable contributions, interest expenses or certain other itemized deductions - may be subject to the ''alternative minimum tax,'' which is computed on Form 6251. Similarly, those who had more than $10,000 in such tax preference items as accelerated depreciation, depletion or oil and gas intangible drilling costs must file Form 4625, and they may be subject to another minimum tax, known as the ''add-on'' tax. ''The alternative minimum tax and the add-on tax didn't apply to too many people in 1982; but for 1983, they've been combined into a new alternative minimum tax that will hit more people,'' said Leon Nad of Price Waterhouse & Company. State and Local Taxes As of 1983, state and local taxes will be included, along with other tax preference items, to compute the alternative minimum tax, a change that will affect many people in New York who have large deductions for local taxes. ''I don't think this will have a profound effect, but it's easy to fall into this tax if you're not planning around it,'' said Mr. Nad. ''If you've realized a big capital gain, perhaps you ought to look around and generate some capital losses.'' The lower capital gains tax is not the only good news for those with investment property. To encourage investment, the new tax laws have also made it faster and easier to deduct the cost of new business equipment through an accelerated depreciation schedule. (Depreciation is the tax system's method of recognizing that property used in business becomes less valuable as it wears out.) Capital assets that are used to produce income - machinery, vehicles and so on - are generally depreciable, or, as the new tax vocabulary would put it, are recovery property eligible for the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. This tax provision is normally of greatest interest to business, but its provisions can also benefit ordinary taxpayers who buy certain equipment to use in their work, such as a writer who buys a word processor or a filmmaker who buys fancy cameras. Cost Recovery System Basically, the cost recovery system classifies property as three- , five- , 10- or 15-year property, and then allows set percentages of the cost to be deducted for every year of what is deemed the useful life of the property. ''There used to be a lot of disputes with the I.R.S. about the depreciable life of an asset,'' said Miss Jay of Peat, Marwick. ''Was this machine good for five years or seven years, and so on. Now there's a set schedule.'' Under the Accelerated Cost Recovery System, business machines such as typewriters and personal computers are considered five-year property, and their entire costs can be depreciated, 15 percent the first year, 22 percent the second year and 21 percent the third, fourth and fifth years. In addition, taxpayers can take a 10 percent investment tax credit for the purchase of five-year business property, that is, 10 percent of the cost is deductible from their tax bill. (Three-year property - such as cars and light trucks - is depreciated 25 percent the first year, 38 percent the second year, and 37 percent the third year, and gets a 6 percent investment credit.) Income-Producing Property For those who bought income-producing personal property last year - a home computer used to keep track of investments would be one example - there is an important new tax decision to make. Starting with the 1982 tax year, up to $5,000 of the cost of the property can be deducted immediately. Although the portion of the cost above $5,000 can then be depreciated, no investment tax credit is allowed on the portion of the cost that has been deducted under the $5,000 expense provision. As a general rule, a taxpayer is better off claiming the $5,000 expense deduction if his income in the year he acquires the property is substantially higher than it is expected to be during the years when the cost would be depreciated. ''The fellow who's looking for immediate savings is better off expensing the $5,000,'' said Mr. Nad. ''For most people, though, it doesn't make much long-term difference whether you take the expensing or the investment credit.'' Tomorrow: Real estate taxes.

348-> ADVERTISING; Kraft to Modify La Creme Claim
When Kraft takes on General Foods' Cool Whip topping with its La Creme product and the advertising keeps repeating ''real cream'' and ''cream'' and ''real cream taste'' over and over, a consumer could get the idea that the Kraft product is predominantly cream. At least that is what the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus said after a complaint from General Foods. Kraft responded to the N.A.D. that nowhere did it state that cream was predominant or the only ingredient, but that the cream taste, according to its tests, is perceived by consumers. But, even though it disagreed with the N.A.D. that ''the television commercial might tend to overemphasize the cream content,'' Kraft, whose agency for La Creme is N.W. Ayer, agreed to modify the claim. The case was one of four of the eight challenges to national advertising claims that the N.A.D. resolved after advertisers agreed to change them or drop the advertising. The other four were found supportable. The remaining three that were changed or dropped included a Time Inc. ad for campus representatives done in-house that said: ''You can earn a sizable income as a Time Inc. College Bureau Campus Representative. Maybe enough to pay your tuition and college expenses.'' The N.A.D. asked for documentation that any youngster had earned the $12,000 to $14,000 a year needed to support such a claim. Time responded that its reps had earned enough to pay their way in many schools, but agreed not to republish the ad because of the possibility of a misconception about the earnings potential. The other two advertisers were the Tomy Corporation for Scramble Hand Video Game advertised by Sachs, Finley & Company and the Washington State Apple Commission, which was promoting the apple diet plan through Cole & Weber, a diet plan that was developed with the University of Washington but was not tested for effectiveness, according to the N.A.D.

350-> AFTER THE STORM; IN CONNECTICUT, SKIERS FROLIC
The ski area operators and even the state officials who had to keep the roads open had some kind words today about the storm that dumped up to two feet of snow on Connecticut Friday and Saturday. Snow was piled shoulder-high along the highways, and a few towns, such as Ridgefield and Fairfield in Fairfield County, delayed the opening of schools this morning. But for the most part it was a typical Monday traffic flow. ''We are pretty well back to normal,'' said Jack Shea of the state's storm control center in Hartford. ''Some of the secondary roads may still have some slush, but we came out of it really good,'' he added. Some parts of the state, such as the Danbury area, reported up to two feet of snow, and the National Weather Service station at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, north of Hartford, recorded 21.5 inches. That was a record snowfall for a 24-hour period, topping the 19.2 inches that fell on Feb. 28 and March 1, 1949. But because the storm hit at the beginning of a weekend and was not accompanied by high winds and near-zero temperatures, Connecticut coped much better than it did in the blizzard of February 1978, which caused businesses and state roads to be closed for days. ''We never closed a road,'' said William Keish, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation. He noted that Bradley Airport had reopened early Saturday afternoon and most of the major highways had been cleared by late Saturday. At least five deaths in Connecticut were attributed to the storm, including three cases that apparently involved heart attacks of people who had been shoveling snow.

351-> AMENITIES, AND HOPE, FOR JOBLESS EXECUTIVE
Dwight Ives gets up early, grabs his briefcase and drives through rush-hour traffic from the suburbs to the downtown Chicago office of the Executive Assets Corporation, where during the day he anxiously checks his messages, dictates letters and makes phone calls. He often wanders by John J. Doherty's well-appointed office. But Mr. Doherty and Mr. Ives are at Executive Assets for different reasons: Mr. Ives is unemployed, and looking for work in an office that is not really his. Mr. Doherty, whose office, with its fine leather furniture and splendid view of Michigan Avenue are reminders of just how good business has been, is looking for more people like Mr. Ives. Executive Assets, a 10-year-old ''outplacement'' firm, is one of the growing number of concerns that provide office space, secretaries, telephones and other services to people who need such amenities while they look for work. Who picks up the tab? Usually, it is the companies that dismissed the people in the first place. Typically, the employers pay the outplacement firm 15 percent of the dismissed employee's salary. Mr. Doherty, the president of Executive Assets, who was himself once dismissed from a job, said that outplacement firms are useful to employees and employers alike. ''We get fired people to a point where they're in a frame of mind to get a job,'' he said. And the employer who is cutting back can be helped to make the experience less distasteful. ''We teach them how to fire people,'' Mr. Doherty said, ''But we do everything possible to ease the pain of termination.'' Many of the newly unemployed favor outplacement because it gives them somewhere to go at a time when life could deteriorate into long, unstructured days. ''It made all the difference in the world,'' said a now-employed former client of Executive Assets, who asked not to be named. ''If you're used to working every day, having a routine and operating in a businesslike fashion, it's important to have the office facilities available,'' Mr. Doherty said that his business increased 20 percent annually in its first nine years, and 40 percent last year. Robert Swain, president of the New York-based Eaton & Swain outplacement firm, said, ''Now, we're being asked to go out and deal with companies lopping off several employees at a time.'' About the only way the recession is hurting outplacement firms is that it takes longer to find jobs. The firms lose money after a client is with them for more than about three months. Fierce Competition Competition is fierce, and as a result, outplacement firms are often reluctant to divulge the names of important clients. However, Executive Assets said its list included Borg-Warner; International Harvester; Esmark; Canteen Corporation; Libby, McNeil & Libby; Morton; Thiokol; Philip Morris Industrial, and Abex. But Mr. Swain of Eaton & Swain sees the growth now in ''the forgotten middle - those who did not aspire to senior management and thought they were safe.'' He added: ''The hard times have lasted for so long that companies have had to break that unwritten contract, and fire people in their 40's and 50's who have been with them for 20 or 30 years.'' Outplacement is not a new idea, but traditionally has been for a select few, according to Jim Gallagher of Gallagher & Associates in New York. ''It began with consumer product companies that were very aware of their image,'' he stated. ''It's a good test of a company's human resources policy to see how they treat people who won't be working there anymore. The remaining employees watch.'' Advice on Food Stamps Much of the growth in outplacement work is in closing down businesses. This is done at the place of business, rather than in outplacement firm offices. ''We advise employees on what to sell, and when - things such as the house, the car, the boat,'' said Mr. Doherty, who also counsels the employers on potential legal problems. Employees also get advice on where to go for counseling and such things as food stamps. The mainstay of outplacement firms, however, has been in providing office space. The services in outplacment offices vary, and include resume advice, leads on jobs, help on finding insurance when company benefits run out, videotaped interviewing practice, and career and psychological counseling. Doris Krepp, a clinical psychlogist who works at outplacement firm, said that high-level executives often have more difficulty adjusting than middle managers. ''These are big deal executives who have made big decisions,'' she said. ''Suddenly, they're questioning even the simplest decision, such as writing a letter.'' Spokesmen for outplacement firms said that most clients find jobs at least as good as the ones they lost. While outplacement firms do not guarantee anyone will find a job, most keep people on until they do.

352-> STENMARK IS SKI WINNER; PHIL MAHRE 4TH
On an icy, hazardous course, Ingemar Stenmark turned in a strong second run today and scored his first World Cup giant-slalom victory of the season. His total time on the wind-swept Ahornbuehl slope was 2 minutes 45.66 seconds. Max Julen of Switzerland, who had the fastest time, 1:20.65, in the second heat, finished at 2:46.68. His countryman, Pirmin Zurbriggen, was third in 2:46.71. Stenmark's victory moved him to second place in the overall cup standing behind Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash. - 198 points to 167. Mahre, the defending cup champion, was fourth today in 2:46.76. Stenmark previously won three cup slalom races, and has 71 career triumphs. He skied low and tight round the 57 gates on the second run, coming up from fifth place on the 56-gate first. ''I just tried to attack on the second, and it worked,'' said the 25-year-old Swede. ''It was the most difficult giant-slalom race since the Olympics in Innsbruck.'' Course Hard and Icy The sun shone brightly on Todtnau's first World Cup event - only the second in West Germany this season. But many skiers called the 1,400-meter course, with a vertical drop of 400 meters that was steep in places. one of the trickiest. ''It's terrible at the top,'' said Mahre. ''Down at the bottom, it gets smoother but there are some real tough parts.'' Bojan Krizaj of Yugoslavia, who on Saturday posted a slalom victory in Markstein, France, took the lead on the first run with 1:24.49. But he lost a ski on the second when he hit a gate and a binding sprang open. Another casualty of the icy conditions that forced skiers too far off the course was Hans Enn of Austria. Third after the first run, he missed a gate after clocking the fastest halfway time on the second. Only 30 of the 83 starters finished both runs. ''It was really difficult,'' said Zurbriggen, who maintained third place in the overall standing. Steve Mahre, Phil's brother, managed only 20th place. He was unable to keep his weight in the right place on the turns. ''We were both sliding instead of carving the turns,'' said Phil. ''I had a really bad second run. This wasn't an ideal giant-slalom course, as they had to put so much water on it, and that's why it was so icy.'' One skier who benefited from the piste was the hometown favorite, Egon Hirt, who finished a surprising ninth. It was the first time he had been among the top 10 in a cup race. ''I'm surprised with this result, but I knew the piste,'' he said.

353-> NEW MEXICO GOVENOR PICKED AS LEADER OF HISPANIC LOBBY
A loosely structured coalition of Hispanic leaders from around the country today chose Gov. Toney Anaya of New Mexico to lead a new political lobbying group that hopes to influence candidates for the Democratic Party's 1984 Presidential nomination. The coalition's activities will include raising money, making recommendations for delegate selection for the Democratic National Convention and lobbying for Hispanic positions on a range of political issues, according to Governor Anaya and others who attended the one-day, closed-door organizational meeting here. ''The unifying element here is that everyone recognizes that we all have much broader agendas as Hispanics,'' Governor Anaya said in an interview. ''We aren't just interested in immigration or in bilingual education, but in the economy, defense spending and international issues.'' Mr. Anaya, who is 41 years old, was elected Governor of New Mexico last Nov. 2 and assumed office on Jan. 1. He had served as the state's Attorney General from 1975 through 1978. New to Hispanic Community Governor Anaya, who invited the leaders to attend the meeting, said he had been asked by some Hispanic Americans to organize the national lobby. Mayor Maurice Ferre of Miami said the lobbying group was a new move for Hispanic Americans, but he noted that other ethnic groupshad taken similar steps to become more involved in Presidential politics. Mr. Ferre said Mr. Anaya was ideally suited to head the organization. ''The Governor is an easy guy to coalesce around, and he's a likable guy,'' said Mr. Ferre, a native of Puerto Rico who has been Mayor of Miami since 1973. Tony Bonilla, president of the 100,000-member League of United Latin American Citizens, said many efforts have been made to form Hispanic coalitions ''but none have accomplished much.'' Voter Registration Stressed Polly Baca Barragan, vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a Colorado State Senator, said the coalition would try to increase voter registration among the nation's 14 million Hispanic citizens. She said three million to four million Hispanic Americans were now registered, and that about 85 percent of them were registered as Democrats. She estimated that as many as six million more Hispanic Americans were eligible to vote but had not registered. Richard Alatorre, a California Assemblyman from Los Angeles, said the lobbying group would push to increase the number of delegates of Hispanic origin to the Democratic convention and to heighten the interest of Hispanic Americans in party politics. Governor Anaya said the group would hold a second meeting in Phoenix early in May. He said members of other Hispanic organizations and political leaders not invited to the first meeting would be asked to attend.

356-> LITTLE TOWNS ARE CUT OFF IN U.S. BUS DEREGULATION
It's been years since any passenger trains stopped here. Kerman never was big enough for airline service. And soon, the Greyhound buses that come to a stop at Kerman Junction twice a day with a hiss of their brakes will be gone. This farming community of 4,000 or so people in California's bountiful San Joaquin Valley, along with hundreds of other small towns across the country, is losing its bus service as a result of a three-month-old Federal law that has given the country's intercity bus lines sweeping new authority to abandon routes they no longer want to operate. Residents of many of the small towns, saying they have already been isolated by cutbacks in train and airline service, are complaining that the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 is isolating them even more. ''It's going to hurt old people and minorities most,'' said Mayor Harry Pederson of Kerman, who manages Reno's Hardware Store. ''There's a lot of people who live here who don't have a car and have to depend on the bus; they don't have a choice.'' Provisions of Deregulatory Law The law, which took effect Nov. 19, largely deregulated the intercity bus industry. Except for safety matters, it ended most control of the industry by state regulatory agencies, including their authority to force bus companies to maintain service to a town. Since then, Greyhound Lines, which operates about 60 percent of the country's scheduled intercity bus service, has begun restructuring its route system in virtually all 50 states, including New York, according to company officials. It has notified state agencies that it intends to drop hundreds of places, many no more than country hamlets or rural junctions, from its timetables. Trailways, the second largest national bus system, and dozens of smaller companies have also acted to realign their route networks. Earlier, service was cut back in Florida, Arizona, Wisconsin and Ohio as a result of deregulation on the state level. This town is one of 97 communities in California where Greyhound plans to end service this spring. Citing legal deficiencies in Greyhound's notice of cancellation, the California Public Utilities Commission temporarily blocked the cutbacks last week. But the agency said there is nothing it can do under the new law to stop Greyhound from carrying out the plan. In Illinois, Greyhound has filed a notice that it intends to end service to 61 communities, mostly in rural regions in the southern part of the state. In Texas, it has filed its intention to eliminate service to 58 communities. Effects in New York In New York, Greyhound has notified the state Department of Transportation that it wants to end service to 34 points, mostly in the northern part of the state. Transportation Department officials in New Jersey and Connecticut said they were unaware of any plans to cut back Greyhound service there. In all, Greyhound officials said the company expected to eliminate service to almost 500 of the 15,000 points it now serves. It is not known how many points will be dropped by other lines, but it, too, is expected run into the hundreds. Greyhound says it is no longer feasible to serve many smaller communities, partly because it now has more competition on its express routes between major cities, like New York-Philadelphia and Los Angeles-San Diego. That has reduced Greyhound's ability to subsidize losses on rural services with low passenger volume, company officials say. Moreover, they point out, the elimination of rural stops that generate little passenger traffic will allow the company to reduce the number of detours off interstate highways and make trips faster for the majority of passengers, who travel between large cities. ''A lot of people are going to be getting much better service,'' said William McCracken, a Greyhound executive working on the route restructuring. By dropping a handful of communities, including this one, from the San Joaquin Valley service, he said, the trip time between Los Angeles and San Francisco, nine to 10 hours on non-express runs, can be reduced by almost an hour. Hardships Are Foreseen Such comments do not ease the dismay of residents of the communities now threatened with the loss of their only public transportation. Buses, they point out, are the only way many people, especially the poor, the unemployed, the young and the aged, have to travel. They also note that many small-town businesses, like florists and auto parts dealers, rely on buses' express freight service. ''Greyhound said they were losing money,'' said Robert Blair, the City Administrator in Tiffin, Ohio, a town of 20,000 people, some 60 miles southeast of Toledo, that lost its bus serice. ''We understand that from an economic viewpoint. But we have people who are not being served and we know, particularly, the abandonment has created hardship on elderly people.'' Joyce Bailes, whose family has operated the Greyhound agency in Herrin, Ill., since 1934, said that when service there ends soon, local businessmen will have to drive 10 miles to pick up their packages. But low-income travelers will not have that choice, she said. ''They can't afford to pay a cab to go 10 miles to catch a bus.'' Happening in Other Industries The decision by Congress to deregulate the bus industry is part of a broader movement begun in the Carter Administration to lessen governmental controls in a wide range of enterprises, from airlines to savings banks. Proponents of deregulation argue that if businesses are allowed to operate according to natural economic forces in the marketplace, without governmental interference, the most efficient will prosper and consumers will benefit. Responding to the needs of the marketplace, they say, smaller bus companies will fill the vacuum left when Greyhound and Trailways abandon a route. Transportation specialists, regulators and public officials interviewed in several states said that it was too soon to measure the full impact of the Federal and state bus deregulation laws. But many agreed that the principal result so far had been increased service and competition on heavily traveled intercity routes and poorer service to lightly populated areas. Seen Benefiting Greyhound Some small bus lines have complained that Greyhound has been using the new law to increase its industry dominance, dropping service to smaller communities while moving in on other lines' more profitable routes. ''Our hope had been that smaller bus companies would fill the void,'' said William Dixon of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission. ''We have had a few, but very few.'' T.@W. Haworth, owner of Orange Belt Stages, has been in the bus business here in the valley for 59 years. ''Nobody's going to pick up those small stops abandoned by Greyhound,'' he said. ''No mom-and-pop operator can come in there and pick up the service without a tremendous subsidy, and the state is broke.'' Mr. Haworth compared the situation to the result of airline deregulation. ''The small towns,'' he said, ''they're out of luck.''

AFTER 17 YEARS IN SENATE, BYRD SAVORS RETIREMENT WINCHESTER, Va., Feb. 1 (By BEN A. FRANKLIN, Special to the New York Times) - Harry F. Byrd Jr., the scion of one of the country's most enduring political oligarchies, the conservative, segregationist organization founded in Virginia by his father in 1926, is in an ebullient mood these days. With his recent retirement after 17 years from the Senate seat his father held 32 years, Virginia is without a Byrd in the halls of power for the first time in half a century. But the 68-year-old Mr. Byrd gives few apparent signs that he places much gravity in that fact. ''It feels good,'' he said in an interview in his pine-paneled office at The Winchester Star, the newspaper founded by his father, Harry F. Byrd, at the turn of the century. His desk was cluttered with partly read newspapers, The Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Harrisonburg (Va.) Daily News-Record, another Byrd property in the prosperous Shenandoah Valley, and, of course, The Winchester Star. Goals for Future Winchester is two hours from Washington, and Mr. Byrd is keeping in touch. Politically, he said, ''I will be involved in a number of different matters in Virginia and the nation, but I do not have a statement on that at this time.'' He also plans to do some newspaper business consulting. Mr. Byrd was criticized for the scant legislation he introduced in the Senate. But he has no apologies. He said, ''There has been too much legislation, and too much government in our lives,'' adding that the Reagan Administration was making ''the fundamental error'' of planning budget deficits that ''will be devastating to our country.'' He said he would make no apologies, either, for his role as an ''organization'' man in the State Senate in 1954, when Virginia, under his father's discipline, strove to block school desegregation by a strategy of ''massive resistance.'' For four years school systems under court orders to integrate were systematically closed and abandoned, interrupting the education of thousands of children. ''You have to consider that in the context of the times,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''The object was to get through a very difficult transition without violence.'' 'Pay as You Go' Like his father, Mr. Byrd has held tenaciously to a ''pay as you go,'' low-tax brand of fiscal conservatism, and he has an easy verbal facility with the dazzlingly large figures of the Federal establishment. In the interview, he recited in precise billions of dollars, year by year, his forecast that ''these fantastic deficits are going to be a very, very serious matter that will bring back inflation.'' For a man whose style has been described as private, reclusive and even mystic, the trim, white-haired, elegantly tailored Virginian displayed flashes of charm and wit that few in the state have ever associated with the Byrds. Over 50 years the family had imprinted on the minds of most Virginians an image of power that suggested the imminence of great decisions, made in marble offices behind closed doors. After becoming ill in 1965, the elder Mr. Byrd used his power to give his Senate seat to his son, who never sought to be the same kind of political boss. The father died in October 1966. Little Senate Action As a United States Senator, the present Harry Byrd is remembered for just three actions: an amendment that rolled back a United States boycott of chromium ore from Rhodesia; a bill restoring citizenship to Robert E. Lee, and a statute, which Mr. Byrd concedes is violated at will, nominally requiring Congress to adopt a balanced budget. In 1980 he blocked President Carter's appointment of the first Virginia black to be nominated to a Federal judgeship. He later barred Senate confirmation of the Reagan Administration's appointment of Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., retired, a former Chief of Naval Operations, to an arms control advisory board. Senator Byrd chose to retire rather than risk losing a bid for a fourth six-year term in 1982. Since his first re-election campaign in 1970, when he left the Democratic Party to become the Senate's only independent, Mr. Byrd has basked in bipartisan conservative approval in his home state. He has already been feted in retirement at a Richmond banquet attended by Vice President Bush and Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. of the Supreme Court. Local admirers are staging another retirement gala for him here next Thursday. He is just back from a monthlong vacation in California and Hawaii with his wife, Gretchen, and he has only begun to unpack the mementos accumulated over years in the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington. One of them is a desktop paperweight displaying, in Chinese and English, a saying of Mao Zedong. ''Not what you'd expect of a Byrd, is it?'' the retired Senator said, laughing. The axiom, however, fits the taciturn tradition of Mr. Byrd and his father, who were both known for their strategic refusals to divulge what they thought, what they would or would not do next, or whom they would endorse, if anyone. It reads: ''Talks, speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the point. Meetings also should not go on for long.''

358-> N.F.C. Wins Pro Bowl, 20-19
Danny White, the Dallas quarterback who sat on the sidelines with an injury as the Cowboys lost the National Football Conference title game last month, threw an 11-yard scoring pass to John Jefferson with 35 seconds remaining to give the N.F.C. a 20-19 victory over the American Conference today in the Pro Bowl. Washington's Mark Moseley, who earlier had missed three field goals and had another blocked, made the extra point to give the N.F.C. the deciding margin. White, who completed 14 of 26 passes for 162 yards, kept the winning, 65-yard drive alive when he connected with Jefferson, a Green Bay Packer wide receiver, on a fourth-and-7 play at the A.F.C. 25. Jefferson made a diving, fingertip catch to give the N.F.C. a first down at the A.F.C.'s 11. White is a seven-year pro who was making his first Pro Bowl appearance. The N.F.C. victory overshadowed a Pro Bowl-record passing performance by Dan Fouts, the San Diego quarterback who threw for 257 yards. Fouts, who played the entire first and third quarters and the last half of the fourth quarter, set records for most yards and most completions. He completed 16 of 26 attempts. He connected with the Jets' Wesley Walker on a 34-yard scoring throw in the opening quarter, then helped the A.F.C. to a 19-10 advantage when he directed a 69-yard scoring drive in the third period. Marcus Allen, the Los Angeles Raiders rookie, capped the march with a 1-yard touchdown plunge. The N.F.C. trimmed the difference to 6 points four minutes into the final period on a 41-yard field goal by Moseley. The N.F.C. now holds an 8-5 edge in the series.

359-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
A Threatened Landmark O n the doors of the Church of St. James are three handwritten signs, in English, Spanish and Chinese, directing parishioners to Sunday services in the school across the street. Another sign, stamped with a big red seal, is an order to vacate from the city's Department of Buildings. The declaration that the church's roof is ''in danger of imminent collapse'' is hard to reconcile with the monumental, timeless feeling of the large 1836 Greek Revival building. A plaque proclaims it to be the oldest Roman Catholic church in Manhattan, and Gov. Alfred E. Smith was an altar boy there. Yesterday about 400 parishioners gathered outside in narrow James Street on the edge of Chinatown as their church became the latest landmark house of worship to be threatened with demolition. ''I cry for my church,'' said Luz Rodriguez, a member since 1955. She said many parishioners, though poor, had made contributions. But $1 million is needed for repairs, according to the pastor, the Rev. Kevin O'Brien. The singing, speeches and sign-waving were meant to demonstrate concern to the Archdiocese and the Landmarks Commission. Several City Council members showed up, worried that the case could set a precedent for using vacancy orders to supersede church landmark status when demolition is the aim, according to Councilman-at-Large Edward Wallace of Manhattan.

360-> IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES
THEATER ''Taking My Turn'' (at the Entermedia Theater) is an upbeat entertainment on an unlikely musical subject: aging. It represents a creative collaboration of Gary William Friedman (music), Will Holt (lyrics) and Robert H. Livingston (adaptation and direction). This is the trio that was primarily responsible for ''The Me That Nobody Knows,'' a long-running musical collage about children growing up in the city. Using the same technique - ''found'' words springing into song - the team studies the flip side of the life cycle, men and women, euphemistically called ''people in their prime,'' growing old in the city. The entire evening is performed with a minimum of artifice and an engaging air of self-acceptance, as exemplified by the song, ''Fine for the Shape I'm In,'' sung sisterly-style by Marni Nixon, Margaret Whiting and Cissy Houston. They and the other members of the eight person cast are an exemplary ensemble of singer-actors. The others are Sheila Smith, Victor Griffin, Mace Barrett, Ted Thurston and the indomitable Tiger Haynes, who sings ''Taking Our Turn'' as a zestful salute to perennial youthfulness. Mel Gussow

361-> IDEAS & TRENDS
Discord ShakesA Foundation The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which seems to create oceans of controversy as it gives away mountains of money, has lately found discord from within. Created in 1978 and quickly famous for its so-called genius awards to individuals, it now faces a federally mandated divestiture of assets that is taxing the genius of its own board members. A law enacted in 1969 after Congress found evidence of financial hanky-panky by some foundations requires the MacArthur fund to reduce its 100 percent interest in Bankers Life and Casualty Company to 20 percent by the end of November. Disposal of the company's insurance holdings alone would be the largest such sale in history, but would still leave the trust with as much as $1.5 billion. ''The divestiture problem has been a terrible distraction,'' said Dr. John E. Corbally, foundation president. The real distraction, however, centers on charges by J. Roderick MacArthur, son of the patriarch, that Bankers Life's assets have been mismanaged. ''When a foundation's assets are mismanaged and wasted, there is an obligation to do something about it,'' said Mr. MacArthur, a self-made millionaire in his own right. He would not rule out suing MacArthur board members, four of whom also sit on Bankers Life's board. Mr. MacArthur charged that they were eager to sell off the insurance company at a ''distress price.'' ''We started out with the boldness of a toddler and we've grown into the brashness of adolescence,'' Dr. Corbally said. ''I hope we don't lose these qualities.''

362-> ISRAELIS BUILD NEW DEFENSES AS LEBANON PULLBACK NEARS
The Awali River is not mighty, but over time it has cut a deep gorge that slashes in a spectacular hook from the Mediterranean coast above Sidon to the towering mountains that overlook the Bekaa region in eastern Lebanon. It is to this natural defense line that the Israeli forces in Lebanon will soon withdraw, to cut casualties from persistent terrorist attacks and to reduce the cost of their stay in the country, now moving into its second year. But the Israelis are not relying on nature alone for their new defense perimeter. At positions just south of the Awali, huge bulldozers are carving trenches, gun emplacements and helicopter landing sites from the chalky stone. Electronic sensors will also be planted to detect movement in the hills. The new line, which as yet seems to have acquired no nickname, will reportedly cost $30 million. The Israelis have insisted that their pullback, which they prefer to call a ''redeployment'' to avoid suggesting a retreat, does not mean they are partitioning Lebanon or planning to stay for a very long time, as many Lebanese suspect. Israelis Stress 'Non-Permanence' ''I was stressing the nonpermanence of this structure, which isn't much of a structure,'' said Capt. Mark Mendelson, an American-born officer, somewhat dismissively showing a group of journalists around a nearly completed network of trenches with a commanding view of Sidon, the sea and the Awali gorge. The trenches, lined with aluminium, looked like a bargain version of World War I dugouts and indicated the Israelis do not expect to confront formidable enemies here. The location of the new zone, which will include the important port city of Sidon, is also the object of considerable explanation. The Israelis insist they are not cutting off Sidon, which has a population of 249,000, from the rest of Lebanon. At the same time, they say Sidon must be ''connected'' to its ''hinterland,'' by which they mean the land to its south, toward Israel, not to its north, toward Beirut. Overall, the Israelis will be abandoning 235 of the 1,330 square miles they seized during their invasion of Lebanon last summer: strategic ground in the hills above Beirut, the crossroads town of Aley on the Damascus highway and the Shuf Mountains that run down to the Awali. Their positions facing the Syrians in the eastern Bekaa will remain unchanged. Timing of Pullback Secret The timing of the pullback still remains a secret. Gen. Moshe Levy, the Israeli Chief of Staff, said this week that it would begin in ''a matter of days,'' but other indications suggest that it may not start until early September. Heavy Israeli military traffic rumbling down the monumentally clogged coastal highway toward Sidon shows that, in logistical terms, the withdrawal has already started. The Israeli pullback has stirred a mood of deep crisis in Beirut, where President Amin Gemayel must now decide whether to send his young and untried army into the Shuf Mountains to replace the Israelis. The army could face stiff resistance in the Shuf from Druse militiamen who regard the army as biased in favor of the Christians. The Israelis have been having troubles with some of their erstwhile Christian allies in the south. Last month they moved into the village of Kfar Falous, just south of the Awali, and effectively blockaded a garrison of the Lebanese Forces militia, which is generally called the Phalange. An Israeli lieutenant in Kfar Falous explained today that the Phalange there had been running guns and ammunition into the Shuf for their longstanding feud with the Druse - a supply effort he said could not be allowed to continue after the Israelis pulled back to the Awali. He added that pressure from Israeli Druse, worried about the fate of the Druse in Lebanon, had also contributed to the crackdown in Kfar Falous. Weapons Kept in Church Under a compromise arrangement, the Phalangists in Kfar Falous are allowed to keep their weapons in the local church. ''They can take them out, but only slowly,'' said the red-haired lieutenant, grinning. ''Everyone thinks that we are the police in Lebanon. But it is not easy. There are so many groups.'' Most of the Phalangist fighters in the village have gone north to the Shuf, where the action is, explained two of their comrades, who lounged around a yellow sandstone villa watching an American detective film. They seemed eager to show that the Phalange had preserved its dignity in Kfar Falous, even though the Israelis clearly have the upper hand. Israel's perceptible effort to woo, and pressure, the Druse in the Shuf has led to a tantalizing ambiguity in the final contours of their new line: will it include the village of Moukhtara, seat of the Jumblatt clan and home town of Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the Druse Progressive Socialist Party? By some accounts, the line embraces Moukhtara. But Col. Ranaan Ghissin, an Israeli spokesman, said today that the Moukhtara question had been ''left open'' and would be decided ''on the basis of political considerations.'' The message to Mr. Jumblatt seemed to be that if he cooperates with the Israelis, they may give him back Moukhtara.

363-> A RICH DIVERSITY IS THE KEY INGREDIENT IN NEW YORK'S ABUNDANT FOOD SCENE
Spurred by an increase of foreign visitors and the growing sophistication of the local audience, New York is strengthening its traditional role as the country's most demanding and diverse city for food. This is true of both its restaurants and its retail shops. Diversity is the city's specialty, closely followed by professionalism in management. Despite the current recession being felt by many restaurants and fancy food shops, New York is now the world's leading market for high-quality wines and luxury food products. And because it has the country's most demanding audience, many chefs and restaurant owners say they feel challenged to test their mettle here. Others, deterred by the city's fast pace, intense competition, crowded facilities and high costs of labor, real estate and construction, say they are content to make their marks in the less pressured surroundings of other cities in the country. If New York does not rival Paris, Tokyo or such northern Italian cities as Milan, Venice and Florence as a source of trend-setting culinary innovation, it makes up for that by offering a far wider selection of ethnic cuisines of remarkably high quality. ''You can find better French food in Paris and better Italian food in Italy,'' said Giorgio DeLuca, the owner of the innovative SoHo food shop Dean & DeLuca, ''but there is no other single place where you will find so many different kinds of food of high quality coming together.'' And, if because of lower overhead and less competition, there is more experimentation with food in restaurants in California or in smaller cities around the country, it is New York that gives those styles their professional gloss. ''There are interesting regional cuisines throughout this country and wonderful things are happening in California,'' said Joseph Baum, who is the president of his own restaurant consulting service, the Joseph Baum Company, ''but New York is still the place that puts an imprimatur on a style. This is a proving ground and if a style plays well here, it says certain things to the rest of the country. It says that it is worth spending time on because a tough audience has accepted it and, therefore, that you can get real money for it.'' New York is also renowned for its methods of restaurant management that are of increasing interest to chefs and owners from other cities. Faced with increasing costs in their cities, they are looking on New York as the model for management. ''Many chefs from Europe visit my kitchen,'' said Andre Soltner, the chef and owner of the haute cuisine restaurant Lutece, ''but they are less interested in what we are doing than in how we are doing it.'' Describing a visit from Freddy Girardet, the chef and owner of the celebrated haute cuisine restaurant that bears his name in Crissier, Switzerland, Mr. Soltner said, ''Girardet told me that he would need twice as many people as we have here to get the same production.'' The growing audience for fine and exotic food products has also inspired chefs to work with unusual ingredients, while other people are opening ambitious, deluxe retail food shops. ''It is amazing to realize how many wonderful things we can get in New York that were not available even a few years ago,'' said Mr. Soltner. ''Whether imported or grown here, we can get fresh produce from California and things like wild mushrooms from this country or Europe. All sorts of fish is flown in and there is even experimentation in producing foie gras here. And because many restaurants are competing, all want to offer the best products.'' ''Cheese has been the only flop,'' he said. ''Americans have just not learned to eat it in quantities that make the best available.'' The new interest in home cooking has also made these products important in retail shops that were inspired by European stores, such as Fauchon in Paris, Peck in Milan, Harrod's in London and Dallmayr in Munich. ''But we have taken the concept much further in New York,'' said Mr. DeLuca, ''and maybe we'll send it back to Europe with American products.'' Demand for Wines Grows Wine merchants also have found that New York customers are willing to pay top prices. Wine importers and wholesalers - such as Robert Fairchild, president of the House of Burgundy, and Gerard Yvernault, senior vice president in charge of the wine division of Kobrand - say that New York is the world's leading import consumer of bottled premium French and Italian wines. One of the major changes during the past five years is in New Yorkers' attitudes toward Italian food. White truffles, wild mushrooms, cheeses, oils and vinegars from Italy are prized as highly as similar products from France, according to Mr. DeLuca. And while it used to be rare for Italian restaurants to command prices as high as their French competitors, that is no longer true. ''In 1946 or 1947, an Italian chef or restaurateur who came to New York was afraid to open a restaurant identified as being Italian,'' said Adi Giovanetti, the owner of the two expensive and elegant northern Italian restaurants, Il Nido and Il Monello. ''They worried that Italian food did not have a quality image. And so they opened restaurants with French names, or Continental places like the Colony.'' The latest glossy showcase for Italian quality products is the DDL Foodshow, owned by film producer Dino De Laurentiis on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the first of a chain he plans to open in American cities. The Nation Watches New York ''The whole country watches what happens in New York,'' Mr. De Laurentiis said, ''and if my store is a success here, it will be easier to open in other cities. My second store will be in Beverly Hills, but New York had to be first.'' The increased social status accorded the chef's profession has also enriched restaurants in New York and throughout the country, according to Joseph Amendola, the senior vice president of the Culinary Institute of America, the country's foremost professional cooking school, in Hyde Park, N.Y. ''To many of the 1,120 graduates we have each year, the only place to make it is in New York,'' Mr. Amendola said. ''They may start on the West Coast but they consider New York the real test. Unfortunately, that can be a mistake. Too many young talents burn out there.'' Pressures Widely Recognized Both the challenge and the pressures the city engenders are also recognized by experienced restaurateurs who are successful in other cities, both in the United States and Europe. One of those who says he still wants to prove himself in the New York market is Julio Santillo, who owns the highly successful, expensive Italian restaurants Tiberio, in both Washington and Bal Harbor, Fla. Now in negotiations for a space on Park Avenue at 5lst Street, where he expects construction to begin later this year, Mr. Santillo said: ''To me New York is the ultimate place to make it. It is the big test. If you are not in New York, you're never really sure how good you are. I want to try even though there is a great risk because of high cost.'' Ingredients Easier to Get ''But in other ways it is easier to operate in New York because it is easier to get fresh imported ingredients,'' he said. ''It takes me three or four days longer for imported Italian mushrooms and mozzarella to get to Washington. Also, in New York you have the choice of better staff. Few good chefs, captains and waiters want to leave New York because the best job market is there.'' Not all of Mr. Santillo's colleagues agree with his assessment. Jean-Louis Palladin, the young French chef who has been so successful with his restaurant, Jean-Louis, in Washington, said: ''Yes, I could make twice as much money in New York because people there would understand my food better, and they are less concerned about price if they are getting what they want. But I grew up in a small country town and I want to keep my family in that kind of setting. It is also easier for me to be creative here because there is less pressure.'' Jean Banchet, the chef and owner of the well-known nouvelle cuisine restaurant, Le Fran,cais in Wheeling, Ill., agrees that New Yorkers are the country's most appreciative audience for fine food. ''I know I would do twice the volume in New York,'' he said, ''but I do not think I would make more profit and I would work even harder than I do now.'' Although innovative and successful New York restaurants are often copied in other cities in the United States, New York's influence is weaker abroad. A Success in Paris One New York original that is successful in Paris is the pubtavern, for which P.J. Clarke's on Third Avenue is the model. Joe Allen, who copied that format in the theater district, is also operating successfully in Paris, where specialties such as Irish coffee, Bloody Marys, spinach salad and hamburgers are as popular with the French as they are with Americans. A similar restaurant in Paris is Conway's, owned by the American fashion model Avia Conway. Miss Conway said that at least 75 percent of her customers are French, a number that has increased steadily since she opened seven years ago. Most French customers appreciate the simplicity, conviviality and flexibility of the pub-tavern, Miss Conway said. Although much credit is given to California and the Southwest for the creation of what is called the new American cuisine, Tom Margittai, who with Paul Kovi operates the Four Seasons restaurant in New York, said he believed that the movement began with the opening of the Four Seasons in 1959. His claim is supported by a reading of the earliest menus for that restaurant. ''The Coach House was also way ahead of California,'' Mr. Margittai said, ''and after all, what they are doing out West is merely an extension of the freewheeling, tradition-breaking French nouvelle cuisine carried out with American products.'' The Coach House, a renowned Greenwich Village restaurant, features a distinctive combination of American and Continental cooking. Regional Cuisines Are Adapted American regional products and cuisines find a market in New York, but not always in their original forms. Abe de la Houssaye, a Cajun from Louisiana who is the chef and partner in two fashionable New York restaurants, La Louisiana and Texarkana, said he has customers from France, Italy and Japan. ''They are mostly business people in their 30's and 40's,'' Mr. de la Houssaye said. ''But I found I had to change Cajun food to make it seem right here. Maybe I would not have had to do that in an informal storefront restaurant, but if you want a fashionable place, it needs a new framework.'' Perhaps most gratifying to chefs who worked in New York is the attention they are finally getting from foreign critics, who long ignored the city's restaurants. ''Fifteen years ago, we practically never saw a European food critic in New York,'' Mr. Soltner said. ''Now they come all the time from France, England, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. It's about time. They also know now that it is not enough to be French; you also have to be good.'' Despite New York City's high crime rate, fiscal troubles and other problems, it has managed to retain and strengthen its pre-eminence in a number of fields. In a series of articles, The Times is looking at the city's standing in some of these areas.

364-> AROUND THE NATION; Republican is Elected To Succeed Jack Swigert
State Senator Dan Schaefer, a Republican, inheriting political support from the late Jack Swigert, easily defeated his Democratic opponent today to capture the Congressional seat left vacant by the death of the former astronaut. With all 386 precincts Mr. Schaefer had 49,216 votes to 27,672 for Jack Hogan, a Democrat who is a member of the Aurora City Council. Jack Heckman, a retired businessman who ran as an independent, had 1,096 votes. Officials said there were 199,162 eligible voters. Mr. Swigert, a Republican who had flown on the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, had defeated Mr. Hogan in last November's general election, but died of cancer on Dec. 27, one week before he was to be sworn in. Mr. Schaefer, a public relations consultant from Lakewood who has been vocal in his support of President Reagan, will represent the Sixth District, which bends in a horseshoe around Denver's southern boundaries.

365-> Lag in Outlays Seen for 1983
Major manufacturers raised capital spending allocations during the last quarter of 1982 but investment is likely to lag this year, the Conference Board reported yesterday. The business research group said capital appropriations normally lagged behind the kind of overall economic recovery expected this year. ''The important question is what happens in 1984,'' said Lora S. Collins, director of business conditions analysis at the Conference Board. ''Current expectations of the large manufacturers suggest that it will be another year of weak investment.'' The board surveyed capital appropriations among the nation's 1,000 largest manufacturers. The companies appropriated $21.5 billion in the last quarter of 1982, up 16.4 percent from the previous quarter. The largest gain was in petroleum, up 26 percent. Motor vehicles and textiles showed no gains, although they had posted large gains during the third quarter.

366-> Europe's Crisis Was America's, Too
That Common Market cliff-hanger last weekend concerned currency revaluations in Europe only, but the world's jittery financial markets could do without such shock waves. The battle, resolved for now, was essentially between France and West Germany, the dominant partners in the eight-nation monetary pact of 1979 that aims to fix the values of West European currencies in relationship to each other. There have been several revaluations, and this one was brought on by over-stimulation of the French economy. The Mitterrand Government's unrealistic effort to pull France, by itself, out of the world's recession only made its currency weaker. West Germany aggravated the problem with its customary super-diligence in fighting inflation, making the mark yet stronger. Having already devalued the franc twice in 18 months Mr. Mitterand wanted the Germans to up-value the mark instead, at further expense to their exports and employment. In the end, both countries adjusted to the currency values suggested by the marketplace. The lesson for Europe, and also for Americans who advocate fixed currency values, is that currencies can't hang together if economic policies hang separately. While it is too much to expect governments to cede much authority over policies that bear on the welfare of their electorates, any agreement to fix currency relationships also requires coordination on basic objectives. There are consequences beyond the Common Market currency zone, as well. The franc's de-valuation will also reduce American exports to France, where all foreign goods now become more expensive. And France may seek to balance its payments accounts by raising new import barriers, always more tempting than austerity measures. Such protectionism will be hard to shed and will tempt other nations to retaliate. As trade shrinks, everyone loses just as the world is groping toward expansion. The United States shares some of the blame. The Reagan Administration engineered a recession that prolonged and deepened recession everywhere. And high American interest rates distorted most currency values by pulling foreign funds into dollar investments. In this interactive world, only international collaboration and burden sharing can assure escape from common difficulties.

367-> CITY CHAINS POST 5.7% SALES GAIN
Sales by seven major retail chains in New York City rose an average of 5.7 percent in February from a year earlier, according to a spotcheck conducted last week. But the overall average gain was sharply inflated by one store chain's 16.7 percent increase, and four of the seven respondents posted declines for the month. Discounting the single large increase, the remaining six retailers as a group had an average gain of only six-tenths of 1 percent for the month. In January, the retailers reported an 11.6 percent increase, the biggest year-to-year gain since 1979. December's sales rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier. January's results were generally aided by a strong carry-over from the intense Christmas shopping pace, retailers said, while February's business suffered from at least a three-day lapse created by the 20-inch snowfall in midmonth. The snow, which began on a Friday, caused most stores to close early and disrupted normal weekend shopping. While downtown stores reopened on Saturday, shopper turnout was minimal, and suburban stores generally did not reopen until Monday. In effect, the entire three-day weekend was blanked out by the weather. Stores participating in the spotcheck were the Macy New York division of R.H. Macy & Company; Bloomingdale's; Saks Fifth Avenue; Abraham & Straus; Lord & Taylor; the Gimbel New York division of Batus Retail, and B. Altman & Company. Results are obtained from each company on the condition that they not be linked to the stores. Including the results of their suburban stores, the seven chains reported an average February sales gain of 6.7 percent over the 1982 month. The results, though, were again skewed by the 18 percent increase reported by one retailer; without that individual gain, the metropolitan area increase averaged only 2.2 percent over 1982. Retailers reported that the month was marked by a continuation of general price-cutting, heavy promotional advertising and a strong emphasis on national or designer brand names. The company that reported the biggest sales gain said it was able to offset the impact of the three-day storm hiatus through aggressive clearances. These resulted in double-digit business gains in three of the four weeks of the month, it said. The stores also reported that the Washington's Birthday weekend drew heavy traffic, resulting in good gains for most them. Several said they resorted to heavier-than-usual promotional advertising in the period to try to recoup their lost Lincoln's Birthday business, with mixed results.

368-> Johnny Hartman, Jazz Singer; Album Was >TO>
Johnny Hartman, the jazz singer whose album ''Once in Every Life'' won a Grammy award nomination, died of lung cancer yesterday at the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He was 60 years old. Mr. Hartman, a native of Chicago, began his professional career with a week's booking at a Chicago nightclub while attending a music school. The week's engagement stretched into a year. He later sang in concerts and on records with such jazz stars as Dizzy Gillespie, John Coltrane and Earl Hines and had appeared at Town Hall, Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall and numerous clubs in the United States and abroad. He is survived by his wife, Theodora, and two daughters, Lori and Tedi. A funeral service will be held Monday at 8 P.M. at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street.

369-> SECRETARIES' POLL ON COMPUTERS
Computers have become an integral part of many offices, and secretaries by and large like it that way. But they do not like the eye strain and headaches that they say go along with the use of some electronic equipment. These opinions come from a national survey on ''The Evolving Role of the Secretary in the Information Age.'' More than 2,000 secretaries and 1,000 executives responded to the survey, which was sponsored by the Minolta Corporation's business equipment division in cooperation with Professional Secretaries International. It was conducted by C.A. Pesko Associates, a research organization specializing in the information-processing industry. Results of the survey, which was conducted by mail and phone in 21 major cities, were released this week. The survey concentrated on the attitudes of secretaries toward automated office equipment, which includes electronic typewriters, word processors, microcomputers, computer terminals, electronic mail systems and electronic filing systems. There are 2.5 million electronic work stations in offices in this country, and the number is growing. In fact, office automation has been called the No. 1 growth industry in the country. Electronic typewriters, word processors and printers are now installed in one out of five secretarial work areas, according to the survey. Efficiency and Complaints In the survey, 87 percent of the secretaries said they thought automation had had a positive effect on their profession and 90 percent said it had increased efficiency. The survey said the attitudes of executives toward office automation closely paralleled those of the secretaries. But more than half of the secretaries said they had experienced physiological problems when using word processors with cathode-ray-tube display screens. Eye strain was cited by 52 percent, back or neck problems by 46 percent, headaches by 30 percent. Two-thirds of the secretaries also said they believed there were limits on their salary and career aspirations, one-half said they were dissatisfied with their level of responsibility and 40 percent said they felt overqualified for their jobs. Although 56 percent of the secretaries polled said they expected to remain in their profession, only 37 percent of those under the age of 30 felt that commitment. The younger women consider their jobs as stepping stones to managerial positions. One-third of this group are graduates of college or junior college. Of the 2,008 secretaries who took part in the survey, only 7 were men. By contrast, of the 1,034 executives queried, only 10 percent were women. The tasks secretaries said they enjoyed most were receiving visitors, writing letters, typing, scheduling appointments, making travel arrangements and attending meetings. Their least favorite tasks were filing and using photocopiers. Yet the survey shows that the photocopier has replaced the water cooler as the favorite place for socializing.

371-> COLONEL STIRS QUESTIONS ON MX-FIRING DOCTRINE
An Air Force colonel's comments about the MX missile have raised new questions about whether the Reagan Administration is moving toward a doctrine of launching American missiles at first warning of a Soviet attack. Lieut. Col. John Politi, deputy director of the MX program, said at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Laramie, Wyo., Wednesday that the Commission on Strategic Forces would recommend to President Reagan Monday that the United States adopt the strategic doctrine of ''launch on attack.'' Commission members quickly denied that current drafts of their report recommend any change in strategic doctrine. The Defense Department also issued a statement that the Administration ''does not rely on its capability for launch on warning or launch under attack,'' but it stopped short of ruling out a launch-on-attack strategy. Colonel Politi said the still-secret report would recommend basing 100 MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos at a cost of $16.5 billion, about $10 billion less than for the Administration's last proposal. That plan, to concentrate the missiles in a 20-square-mile area, was rejected by Congress. 69 Would Be in Wyoming Colonel Politi said the new plan would put 69 MX missiles in southeast Wyoming and 31 in western Nebraska, all under command of Warren Air Force Base, near Cheyenne, Wyo. In a statement cleared with other officials, Fred C. Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, said: ''It is our policy not to explain in detail how we would respond to a missile attack, to increase the uncertainties in the minds of Soviet planners. However, the United States does not rely on its capability for launch on warning or launch under attack to insure the credibility of its deterrent. It would be a hair-triggered, dangerous situation if we were to depend for deterrence on such a posture.'' The doctrine of ''launch on warning or attack'' has long been controversial because of the risk that the United States might fire its nuclear missiles in response to a false alarm from the early warning system or to a misinterpretation of a Soviet missile test as the start of a major attack. For that reason and others, many Democrats and some Republicans have opposed basing the MX missile in Minuteman silos that are vulnerable to Soviet attack, since they feel that would put pressure on a President to authorize launching the missiles instantly to avoid their destruction. It is understood that the commission will conclude that it is not possible to build a land-based MX system that would be invulnerable to attack. 'To Put Fear in U.S.S.R.' In his luncheon talk, Colonel Politi described the commission's recommendation as one of launching on attack. In a question-andanswer session afterward, he was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, ''The intention is to put some fear in the U.S.S.R.'' He reportedly added that ''we've got to make them concerned'' about a launching of the MX ''before we're attacked.'' Presumably that would mean firing missiles before a Soviet missile landed on American soil but after it was believed to have been launched. A reporter from The Star Tribune of Casper, Wyo., also quoted Colonel Politi as saying the declared strategy called for the MX to be launched ''on attack'' in order ''to keep it from being a firststrike weapon,'' that is, a weapon used by the United States in a pre-emptive initial attack on the Soviet Union. A high Pentagon official said Colonel Politi's comments about the commission report were inaccurate. ''He was not only speaking out of school, he does not know these policy matters,'' the official said. Colonel Politi left Wyoming shortly after his speech and could not be reached today for comment. In questioning, he said that fitting the MX missile into existing silos would require little or no additional land, would have minimal effect on water supplies and would require a peak work force of about 2,000 people, far less than needed for the earlier basing plan. Keep the Russians Guessing High Administration officials said one reason for not categorically ruling out a launch-on-warning doctrine was to keep Soviet planners uncertain. But they noted that the Administration had sought funds to improve the command, control and communications links of American strategic nuclear forces. One high official said this should be interpreted as a sign that the Administration was ''trying to move away from hairtriggered dangerous situations where you have very little time for decisions.'' If a launch-on-warning strategy was adopted, he said, such improvements in communications from the President and Pentagon to outlying missile bases would not be needed because launch instructions would be predetermined. Nonetheless, proposals to base the MX missile in fixed, vulnerable silos has reopened questions about strategic doctrine. In his report to Congress in 1980, Harold Brown, then Secretary of Defense, emphasized the importance of not allowing the MX to be put into a ''use or lose'' situation, where it would be destroyed if it was not fired quickly. Mr. Brown, a consultant to the new commission, said today that he still favored the mobile MX system recommended by the Carter Administration.

372-> STERLING TO TRY AGAIN WITH A NONASPIRIN DRUG
For Sterling Drug Inc., the makers of Bayer aspirin, the recall of Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol last September presented an unexpected opportunity. Sterling had for years been trying unsuccessfully to break Tylenol's grip on the pain reliever market, and this sudden moment of vulnerability must have seemed just the right time for Sterling to try again. It was also an opportunity for the company to gain a foothold in the aspirin-free pain reliever market, something it has been refusing to attempt in recent years despite a decline in demand for aspirin products. Accordingly, analysts say, Sterling decided to introduce its Panadol drug, a nonaspirin pain reliever sold only overseas for the past 25 years, into the United States next month. ''This marks a significant change in company strategy,'' said David Crossen, an analyst at Smith Barney. Typically, Sterling's chairman, W. Clark Wescoe, a physician, would not comment on the introduction of Panadol. And Walter C. Camas, president of Glenbrook Laboratories, the drug division of Sterling, would say only that the addition of Panadol to the company's line ''will provide the right over-the-counter pain reliever for almost every need.'' Large Promotion Planned But the company has allocated $100 million for the promotion of Panodol, its largest such budget ever, and it clearly hopes to make more than a ripple. In particular, analysts say, Sterling's target is Tylenol. There is a catch, however. Tylenol, in the six months since seven people died from ingesting capsules that were laced with cyanide after having left the plant, has already recovered most of its market. Thus, analysts say, the Panadol strategy may be an example of Sterling's coming up with too little, too late. In 1978, Sterling tried to compete with Tylenol directly by introducing an aspirin-free Bayer. But the product failed to take hold against its more heavily promoted competitors, Bristol-Myers' Datril, American Home Products' Anacin 3, and, of course, Tylenol, the market leader, which had been introduced three years before. As it turned out, the nonaspirin Bayer, which had become known throughout the industry as the ''nonproduct Bayer,'' had to be withdrawn six months later. Direct Challenge Next, having failed with its nonaspirin product, Sterling redoubled its efforts to push its aspirin products. Once again, the target was Tylenol, and this time the campaign took the form of a direct challenge to Tylenol's advertising claims. When the ads seemed to suggest that doctors recommended Tylenol, Sterling responded with ads reading: ''Makers of Tylenol, shame on you!'' The ads contended that doctors do not recommend products by name but simply say, ''Take an aspirin.'' Tylenol is not aspirin, the ads observed, and Bayer is. The Bayer ads further attacked the aspirin-free ingredient in Tylenol, acetaminophen, as a potentially harmful chemical that ''leading experts have expressed great concern about.'' In the industry, many believed that the Sterling ads backfired and only served to reinforce Tylenol, which later grew to a $400 million profit center for Johnson & Johnson. In addition, analysts say, the ads left the impression that Sterling was pro-aspirin and antiacetaminophen, despite the fact that Sterling also made acetaminophen drugs like Panadol, which is 100 percent acetaminophen. Indeed, had Sterling not taken a stand against the nonaspirin drugs, analysts believe, it might have been able to move more quickly into the nonaspirin market in the United States. ''They probably should have gotten into acetaminophen years ago,'' said Kent Blair, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin. ''But, the reason was that Sterling is aspirin.'' From the look of Sterling's Panadol ads, the company appears to be taking a conservative approach in bringing the drug to the United States. The Panadol ads are straight-forward, without references to competitors. The ads are also careful not to oversell Panadol. In the past, Sterling has been warned by the Fedeal Trade Commission against promising consumers too much. Share of Market The nonaspirin pain relievers, originally available only by prescription to people allergic to aspirin, have been sold over the counter for 10 years. In recent years, their share of the overall market has been growing and is now more than a third the size of aspirin's. Bayer aspirin is Sterling's best-known drug. It also provides the bulk of the company's $230 million in annual domestic proprietary product sales. Total sales from Sterling's six divisions amount to $1.8 billion. ''Sterling was possibly too loyal to Bayer,'' said Joseph Riccardo, an analyst at Bear Sterns. As the market shifted toward nonaspirin products, Sterling remained committed to Bayer, a product name the company acquired after the German concern Bayer A.G. lost the right to use it in the United States after World War I. But recently, Sterling's loyalty to aspirin has apparently begun to cost it sales. Drug sales were up just 4 percent in 1981, and last year, even with a new, coated Bayer aspirin, they were up even less, although the company hasn't made public the 1982 figures for its proprietary drug division. As a whole, Sterling has announced that it had zero growth for all of 1982.

373-> Commodities; Settling Contracts In Cash
WHAT do the leaders of the futures industry talk about at their annual conference besides having had another year of record volume and profits? Their problems, of course. One of the problems discussed at the Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Fla., last week was the system of delivering physical commodities against futures and a possible solution to the disputes it creates - the settlement of contracts in cash. Although fewer than 5 percent of the futures contracts traded last year actually involved deliveries of goods, the cost of litigating disputes over the quality, warehousing, transport and other delivery factors soars each year, along with volume. Last year, for example, 112.4 million futures contracts were traded, up from 98.5 million in 1981. In fact, delivery problems rank second to the collection of debts each year. ''No one has put a dollar cost on these problems, but we all know they are enormous and growing,'' said Leo Melamed, special counsel to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, its former chairman and a major architect of financial futures. ''This is why the trend in the industry is toward contracts featuring cash settlement rather than the physical delivery of goods. It is the most equitable system, the main reason the Commodity Futures Trading Commission favors it.'' Even when the delivery system works well, he said, the prices of the delivered commodities are usually adjusted through discounts or premiums to reflect quality, geographic location, transport and other factors that often distort the value of the futures contract. Those who stand for delivery can make money when the cash price of the commodity is above the futures price. They do this by having their brokers exchange the futures for the goods in the form of warehouse receipts and then selling the receipts in the cash market. Others who normally take delivery are those who use futures as ''paper warehouses.'' Rather than finance inventory, commodity users, exporters and manufacturers buy futures with deliveries calculated to match their needs. But the prospect of having to take delivery usually drives many small traders out of a market weeks before a contract expires, thus often denying them potential profits, Mr. Melamed pointed out, and this breeds many disputes as well. ''But the naysayers insist that a futures contract that is settled in cash is gambling,'' he added. ''We say that the prime purpose of a futures market is to afford trade hedgers with a means of insurance against adverse price moves. Yes, speculators are a vital part of the futures market, but so are the willing risk takes in the insurance or any other market.'' Recently, Mr. Melamed's exchange proposed that its new futures in gasoline offer traders the option of settling their contracts in cash. Michel D. Marks, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where disputes over the grading and transport mechanism for delivering potatoes has been a perennial problem, said his market was seeking Government permission to trade potatoes solely on a cashsettlement basis. Susan M. Phillips, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said: ''While cash settlement would certainly reduce the mountain of litigation, it may not be a suitable system for all commodities. On one hand, stock index futures are obviously made to order for cash settlement because they reflect their underlying averages. Also, it is impractical to deliver a basket of hundreds of different shares on the expiration date. ''Settling live cattle futures in cash would help because physical deliveries of the animals are difficult. But even so, cattle prices vary greatly from market to market. So do almost all other agricultural commodities. Cash settlement can only work if there is widespread agreement on value at any given moment. This is rarely the case with agricultural commodities.'' Nathan Most, vice president in charge of new products at the American Stock Exchange, agreed, noting: ''All our proposed stock index and gold bullion options would be settled in cash. Aside from the easy availability of accepted price standards, this system does away with warehouse receipts, the registration of warehouses, and in the case of bullion it eliminates assay delays and disputes over the relative values of different marks on the gold bars.'' Thomas A. Russo, partner in the Wall Street law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, and an authority on commodities trading, agreed with the others but offered a view that is rarely aired publicly: ''True, cash settlement is one of the most important developments sweeping the industry because it would greatly reduce the chances of squeezing a market when the supply-demand situation is naturally or deliberately distorted. ''By the same token, it raises the question of whether the speculative element that provides the crucial market liquidity for the commercial hedgers would like an antiseptic, homogenized, pasteurized futures market. The same applies to arbitragers who also depend on momentary price distortions.'' Mr. Russo noted that futures and options markets thrive on price volatility, no matter whether the prices are rising or falling. If this volatility is lacking, both the volume of hedging and speculation dries up, he said.

375-> TV: 'M.A.D.D.,' DRAMA FIGHTS DRUNKEN DRIVING
THE acronym marches on. We've had innumerable productions with letter collections such as ''S.W.A.T.'' or ''F.I.S.T.'' or ''M*A*S*H.'' Tonight at 9 on Channel 4, there is ''M.A.D.D.'' The explanation is thoughtfully contained in the subtitle: ''Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.'' Michael Braverman's script is based on the true story of Candy Lightner, a Californian responsible for some of the strongest legislation against drunk driving that has been passed in this country. On May 3, 1980, Mrs. Lightner's 13-year-old daughter, an identical twin, was killed in a hit-and-run auto accident. At first, the nearly inconsolable mother assumed that the driver was an irresponsible youth. Then she found out that he was 47 years old and was out on bail on a previous drunk-driving charge. When she is told that he will probably avoid a major prison sentence, she begins her crusade for justice. Like most television movies constructed dramatically around a social problem, ''M.A.D.D.'' is short on complex characterizations. The situation, the cause, is all. Mrs. Lightner, divorced, has a woman friend who is a solid source of support. The drunk driver has a wife who turns him in for reasons that are never really explained. Somebody merely says, ''Because she's a decent, Christian woman - that's why.'' But the subject is compelling, and this treatment touches on the key points. It's noted that drunk driving has, in purely social terms, gone the way of divorce - ''it no longer stigmatizes you.'' Despite the fact that in California alone 2,500 people are killed annually in drunk-driver accidents, juries don't like to convict in such cases. The theory is offered that most jurors drink and take the attitude that ''there but for the grace of God go I.'' And on top of this, the film says, there are drinking legislators, alcoholic judges and a powerful liquor lobby. It is therefore not surprising that tough new drunk-driving laws had been going down to defeat every year. Mrs. Lightner and the thousands of members of more than 100 national chapters of M.A.D.D. have been making a difference. That is the message of this movie. Meanwhile, Mariette Hartley has the job of fleshing out the character of Mrs. Lightner into something more than a militant crusader, and she succeeds nicely. The pain and rage of the woman are depicted powerfully. Miss Hartley demonstrates once again that her range goes a good bit beyond the cool charm she has marketed in those camera commercials with James Garner. In fact, the rest of the cast also turns in impressive performances in what are essentially one-dimensional roles. Paula Prentiss is effective as the sympathetic friend. Grace Zabriskie is exceptionally good as the wife of the drunk driver. And John Rubinstein is properly serious as a lawyer who advises Mrs. Lightner. But the dramatic stress is always kept on the problem itself. Among other things, it is noted that every 21 minutes somebody is killed by a drunk driver. Mrs. Lightner was instrumental in getting tough new laws for California last September. Subsequently, we are told, in the first two months, drunk-driving deaths were down by 22 percent.

377-> ST. JOHN'S IS SEEDED NO. 1 IN EAST FIELD
The Big East, which in four years has developed into one of the nation's best basketball conferences, placed five teams, headed by St. John's, in the 45th annual National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. The Redmen received the top-seeded position in the East Regional in the selections announced yesterday, and they will begin play in the second round Sunday in Hartford. St. John's qualified automatically by beating Boston College for the conference title last Saturday at Madison Square Garden. The Big East teams receiving at-large bids were Villanova, Boston College, Georgetown and Syracuse. The Big Ten Conference also had five teams named: Indiana, the league champion which was seeded second; Ohio State, Iowa, Illinois and Purdue. Only once had a conference placed five teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament - the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The 52-team tournament will open with four preliminary-round games tomorrow night. Those games will determine the last qualifier in each region. First-round games will be Thursday and Friday, across the nation. The tournament will end with the Final Four at Albuquerque, N.M., April 2 and 4. Virginia, which had appeared certain to be the No.1 seeded team in the East, was shifted from that region and seeded No.1 in the West after being upset by North Carolina State in the A.C.C. final yesterday. This made it possible for St. John's to move to the top spot in the East and gain a first-round bye. The Redmen will play the winner of Friday's first-round game at Hartford between Rutgers and Southwestern Louisiana. If St. John's wins, it will advance to the regional semifinals at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse. Two conferences, the A.C.C. and the Southeastern Conference, placed four teams each in the tournament. North Carolina, the defending N.C.A.A. champion, joined Virginia and Maryland as the A.C.C. teams that received at-large berths. The Tar Heels, who were also upset by North Carolina State, in the A.C.C. semifinals, were seeded second in the East and will play in the second round Saturday in Greensboro, N.C., against West Virginia or James Madison. The S.E.C. will be represented by Georgia, the surprise winner of the conference tournament yesterday; Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. All 16 teams that were seeded No.1 through No.4 in the four regions received first-round byes and will play their second-round games Saturday or Sunday. Louisville was seeded No.1 in the Mideast, and Houston, ranked No.1 in the nation by the two news-service polls last week, was seeded No.1 in the Midwest. Thus, Houston will play its first game in Houston with a homecourt advantage. Notre Dame, Iona and Fordham, the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference champion, had expected at-large berths, but, instead, were among the first 15 teams named for the 46th annual National Invitation Tournament. Seeded behind St. John's in the East were North Carolina, No.2; Ohio State, No.3, and Georgia, No.4. St. John's could meet any one of these teams. The Carrier Dome has been the site of the largest on-campus crowds for a basketball game, and Syracuse, which was also placed in the East bracket, will have a homecourt advantage if it advances to the regional semifinal. The Orange first must beat Morehead (Ky.) State in the first round Friday then Ohio State in the second round Sunday. The St. John's coach, Lou Carnesecca, who was invited to a New York studio to comment on the selections when they were announced on CBS-TV late yesterday afternoon, gave two sentences of comment long before the selections were given. He then excused himself to return to St. John's and learned of the top seeding in the East as he was riding across the Queensboro Bridge in a limousine. Commenting on going to Hartford, the closest site to the Redmen's campus in Jamaica, Queens, Carnesecca said: ''It doesn't matter where we play as long as we're in it. We're familiar with the area.'' Asked about the possibility of meeting North Carolina in the East regional, Carnesecca said: ''There are so many upsets, let's get the first game out of the way. It may never come.'' The five selections from the Big East accorded that conference a strong endorsement as the top-rated conference going into this N.C.A.A. tourney. Three of the five teams from the Big East were seeded among the top 16 over all; in addition to St. John's, Villanova was seeded third in the Midwest, and will play Saturday in Houston, and Boston College was seeded No.4 in the West and will play Sunday in Corvallis, Ore. The Big Ten had two of the top-seeded 16 - Indiana and Ohio State. Georgetown plays a first-round game against Xavier of Ohio or Alcorn State on Friday at Freedom Hall in Louisville. Xavier and Alcorn meet in one of the preliminary-round games at Dayton, Ohio, tomorrow night. In the other game at Dayton, Georgia Southern plays Robert Morris of suburban Pittsburgh for the right to meet Purdue on Friday in a first-round game at Tampa, Fla. Princeton plays North Carolina A. and T., and La Salle plays Boston University in a preliminary-round doubleheader at the Palestra in Philadelphia tomorrow. The Princeton-North Carolina A. and T. victor meets Oklahoma State on Friday at Corvallis, and the La Salle-Boston University winner plays Virginia Commonwealth on Thursday at Greensboro. Dave Gavitt, chairman of the nine-member N.C.A.A. Basketball Tournament Committee, which makes the selections and seedings, said that upsets in conference playoffs last weekend had had a bearing on the final assignments. He cited the upset of Virginia as an example. Although the 10-school S.E.C. placed four teams in the tournament, Gavitt said, ''The S.E.C. had eight teams considered, and I don't ever remember a time when eight teams from a conference were taken under consideration. Throughout the entire bracket, the seeding process was very difficult.'' U.C.L.A., which holds a record 10 N.C.A.A. championships, was seeded second in the West.

378-> YANKS CALM AMID CONFUSION
A sign of the times: The Yankees messed up two suicide squeeze plays and a double steal and missed a bunch of signs today, and neither Billy Martin nor George Steinbrenner exploded. ''If it was during the season, you'd really be red-hot,'' Martin said after the Yankees lost a 10-inning, 5-4 decision to Montreal. Bob Shirley shut out the Expos for the first five innings, the best outing for a Yankee pitcher this spring, but Montreal eventually won on an unearned run resulting from errors by John Mayberry and Ed Rodriguez. ''I'm not upset,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I found out some things about some guys today, and we'll continue to find things out.'' It was such a bad day for sign-giving and sign-taking and executing that even Don Zimmer, the third-base coach, missed a suicide squeeze sign. Oakland Days Recalled Squeezes and steals are an integral part of the type of game Martin played in Oakland for three years and hopes to play with the Yankees this year. Spring training, the manager said, is the time to practice such plays, and if players are going to make mistakes, spring training is the time to make them. ''I remember the first four games in Oakland,'' Martin said. ''We couldn't do a thing right. Finally, we executed one play right and you should have heard the scream on the bench. You'd have thought we won the pennant.'' In the second inning today, Rick Cerone made the wrong move between first and second on the back end of an attempted double steal, and Oscar Gamble was out easily at the plate. In the seventh inning, Butch Hobson bunted into a double play on an attempted suicide squeeze, and in the ninth, Bob Meacham, a pinch-runner, was out at the plate after everybody fouled up a would-be suicide squeeze. Nobody had to stay after the game today to work on signs or bunts. Last year, after Andre Robertson failed to sacrifice, Steinbrenner sent down an order for him to bunt 100 pitches after the game in the batting cage. ''That's up to Billy, I'm not going to get involved,'' Steinbrenner said today when reminded about his punishment drill a year ago. ''You're finding out about certain guys who can't deliver.'' Confusion at the Plate Speaking of the seventh inning when Hobson didn't deliver, Martin said rather tamely, ''I'm sure Hobson never squeezed before.'' With one out in the ninth inning, and the game tied, 4-4, Meacham was at third, Rowland Office at first and Don Mattingly at bat. Before Mattingly went to the plate, Martin told him the suicide squeeze was on. However, when Mattingly reached the plate and looked at Zimmer, the coach flashed the ''take-off'' sign. ''I gave him the take-off,'' Zimmer explained later, ''because I didn't think the squeeze was on. If it was on, I messed up.'' Mattingly was confused. ''I decided,'' the rookie said, ''that if out of the corner of my eye, I saw the guy running from third, I would bunt. But he wasn't running.'' Mattingly, though, started to turn as if to bunt. After he took the pitch, Zimmer called him down the line for a conference. ''He told the whole world it was on,'' Martin said, thinking at the time that it was Mattingly who had messed up. ''He wrote a letter. But at that point I wasn't going to take it off.'' The Expos guessed Martin would keep it on, and Tom Dixon, the pitcher, threw a pitch high and away from Mattingly. He had no chance to bunt at the ball, and Meacham was an easy out. ''That's just one of many signs we've missed,'' Zimmer said. ''We'll go over another set of signs tomorrow.'' On the aborted double steal, Cerone, the runner from first, is supposed to fall down and look as if he's trying to get back to first. When the catcher throws to get him, the runner at third breaks. However, Cerone ran too far before falling down, and the catcher, Bobby Ramos, only looked at him, then threw to third and caught Gamble in a rundown. Winfield in Center Dave Winfield played center field Sunday. Martin said there was no significance to the move, that he only wanted to rest Jerry Mumphrey. However, there were other indications that Martin would like to make the move permanent. Winfield, however, has always resisted playing center field regularly.

382-> SPINKS-BRAXTON: A CONTEST
MAYBE Marvelous Marvin Hagler will fight Thomas Hearns this year, or maybe Larry Holmes will meet Michael Dokes. But there are no doubts, the Professor said, that the fight of the year will be Michael Spinks against Dwight Braxton Friday night in Atlantic City. ''This should be a classic from way back,'' said George Benton, the Professor, whose classrooms are the gyms of Philadelphia. ''This is going to be one of the best fights you've ever seen.'' The respected trainer has seen this fight many times. Three years ago, Spinks was not a World Boxing Association champion nor Braxton a World Boxing Council champion. They were in no position to unify the light-heavyweight title for a reported $2.1 million each. Three years ago, they were just two fighters beating up each other in Philadelphia sparring sessions. The gym was Joe Frazier's, and Benton watched as the two fought about 120 rounds during most of 1980. ''It was always a nip-and-tuck thing at the time,'' said Benton. Braxton, at 5 feet 6 3/4 inches, is the shortest light-heavyweight champion in history; Spinks, at 6-2 1/2, is one of the tallest. Their heights have helped shape their boxing styles, making this an intriguing bout. It is one that ''causes you to do some thinking and planning,'' said Quenzell McCall, Braxton's chief trainer. On Jan. 7, it appeared the planning would have to be delayed. Spinks's common-law wife, Sandra Massey, the mother of his 2-year-old daughter, Michelle, was killed in an automobile crash in Philadelphia. ''I thought about canceling it,'' said Spinks, his long legs covered by a blanket after lunch in his motel at St. Augustine Beach, Fla. ''I knew if I wasn't going to fight, I had to straighten things at home. I had to pack up Sandy's things. I couldn't do it. I remember moving all her clothes to one side in the closet and ... ''Every night for a week now I've been dreaming about Sandy.'' Leon Spinks, his older brother, said: ''The only thing he can do is make it right for his daughter, make sure she gets the best of care and be the best father he can be.'' ''She's going to have a great family - mine and Sandy's,'' said Michael, ''Little Squeak, I call her. She has a precious little voice.'' Braxton sent flowers, and his manager, Rock Newman, attended the funeral. ''What was so crazily ironic,'' said Newman, ''was that the same night Dwight's fiancee had checked into a hospital in Cherry Hill for an emergency operation. It really gave him a sense of what Michael was going through.'' ''She was really sick,'' said Braxton last week at his training camp in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ''It was the scariest thing that can happen. I can only empathize for Spinks. But I can't sympathize with him. If I sympathize with him, that will be dangerously sentimental. I'll get sentimental when I knock him out. Then I'll go over and kiss him.'' Braxton does not talk as someone whose educational background consists mainly of reform schools and prisons. In one 15-year period, he spent 11 years locked up, the last five and one-half for armed robbery. He has become a spokesman for going straight. With Newman's encouragement, he started ''Stay-in-School'' programs in Camden, N.J., where he grew up, and Washington, his manager's hometown. He talks now of studying criminal justice when his boxing career is over. He had changed to his Muslim name of Dwight Muhammad Qawi, but readily accepted the use of the better-known Braxton for publicity purposes for this fight. There was little difference between the mean ghetto streets of Camden and the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis, where Spinks grew up. Both boxers feel free now and both are heavily involved in charitable works. Spinks set up his training camp at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, and was so touched by the youngsters he began studying sign language. In Myrtle Beach, Braxton stopped by a telethon for the local heart fund and wrote a check for $1,000. In St. Augustine, Spinks led a campaign to raise money for a liver transplant for a 10-month-old boy. But sociological factors and social consciousness are not the keys to this fight. The keys are jabs and uppercuts, stamina and determination, training practices. Those are the ingredients that could produce the fight of the year. Braxton is a 30-year-old, sway-and-swing fighter. Spinks, the harder puncher, has a classic upright stance. He also has the edge in experience, although not as a professional. Spinks, the W.B.A. champion, has a 22-0 record, including 16 knockouts. Braxton, 19-1-1 with 12 knockouts, had no amateur experience when he turned pro at 25. Spinks's 93-7 mark as an amateur included a 1976 Olympic gold medal. Gil Clancy, the former manager who is now a CBS boxing adviser, believes that Spinks is the ''better-quality'' fighter. In horse-racing terms, Spinks has shown stakes quality. Braxton began as a claimer, but under the tutelage of McCall and Wesley Mouzon, steadily moved up in class before, in what was considered an upset, stopping Saad Muhammad for the W.B.C. title Dec. 19, 1981. ''Remember, they were nip and tuck before Braxton was doing the jabbing he's doing now,'' said Benton. ''Braxton has improved a lot, Spinks hasn't.'' Spinks admitted, ''I guess I haven't improved.'' He is what Benton calls ''a zebra.'' ''The zebra is the one animal in the world you can't train,'' explained the Professor. McCall said he had helped train Spinks and had taught him the punch he calls most dangerous for Braxton - a left uppercut, or a ''double cross.'' ''Quenzell ain't done a thing for me,'' said Spinks. ''I was taught in St. Louis. I haven't adopted anyone in Philadelphia to teach me, that's how much I thought of trainers in Philadelphia. No one in Philadephia is worth me jeopardizing what little I do know. The key to boxing is, when you know how to fight, that's it.'' Spinks has a good idea of what he must do, and the skill to do it. Some experts have suggested that his sharp left jab, aimed at a man almost eight inches shorter, would leave Spinks open to overhand rights. In training, Spinks occasionally has widened his stance to compensate. Braxton has promised to stick so close to Spinks that ''you'll think we're Siamese twins.'' Spinks has promised that he will ''tie him up and lean on him.'' Braxton has been compared to Joe Frazier, who bulled his way inside taller opponents. ''I don't like to get hit that often,'' said Braxton. ''That man took punches and came back to the corner and said, 'It ain't nothing but a body.' '' Braxton works his way inside behind a hammer-like left jab, and although he is the aggressor, he is also the boxer. He has a magnificent defense, especially against rights. ''He loves you to throw that right against him,'' said Leon Spinks. But Michael has more than a right. When his right was hurt, his left was good enough to stop Ramon Ronquillo in six rounds. He has every punch in the book, including some the book bans. He knocked out Jerry Celestine with a combination of a right uppercut and, on the follow-through, a right elbow. Saad Muhammad had planned to hit Braxton with right uppercuts in their second bout. He could not. At one point, Braxton hit Saad with one of his own, and said, ''Is this what you've been trying to do?'' In training, Braxton has worked on the left uppercut, not only from the defensive point of view. He has a natural ability to make an opponent miss by narrow margins, enabling him to be close enough to counter. ''I used to hit Braxton all day long in the gym,'' said Spinks. ''I ran around all day long, eight rounds, just hitting him with the jab.'' Braxton said Spinks was ''just fantasizing.'' ''It was heated times,'' said Braxton. ''We knocked each other around.'' McCall conceded that Spinks would have won if they had met in 1980, ''but only because Dwight was just starting out.'' ''He's a real thinking fighter now,'' said McCall. ''When he fought Saad, he figured out a weakness which had to do with Saad tipping off his right hand with his knee. We've spotted a weakness in Spinks, too. Remember, he's got a bad knee.'' Spinks's bad right knee prevents him from pivoting sharply. Braxton has been working on moving from side to side while in close. Against a man whose nickname is Slim, Braxton will be aiming for the body. ''I don't know anybody who's hit Spinks in the belly,'' said Mouzon. ''Mike is an awkwardly clever boxer. He'll give you anything to hit but his head. He calls that dynamite defense. I believe, take what you can get. ''Nobody went for Saad's body before Dwight did, also. Everybody went for his head because he cut so easily.'' Stamina could be a major factor. Spinks, a slow starter, has demonstrated staying power. According to Saad Muhammad, Braxton was tired even while knocking out the former champion twice, the second time in six rounds. ''When I used to fight this bum every day,'' Spinks said, ''he was beating up on everybody, but I was one he couldn't beat. He used to wonder why. He always used to think I'd get tired. He'd tell me, 'One more round, man, one more round.' '' Braxton has been suffering from a bad cold, but he said: ''I don't care if I'm coming off a six-day drunk or a cold. I'm going to win.''

387-> WINDS DECISIVE FACTOR FOR CUP FINAL
The seventh and decisive race in the 25th America's Cup series begins at 12:10 P.M. Saturday between Australia II, the challenger that is faster, and Liberty, the United States defender that must rely on a faster-thinking crew. This is the first time ever that the series has gone to seven races, and a loss by the United States would mark the end of an era in yachting history. The cup was first won by the schooner America against Britain's finest yachts in 1851 in a race around the Isle of Wight. Since then, the United States has never lost it. Despite years of preparation and millions of dollars spent to reach this final four hours or so of racing, the outcome could well be in the hands of Aeolus, the mythological ruler of the winds. Australia II's helmsman, John Bertrand, called a lay day, or day off, for today not only to give the crew a rest but also anticipating the winds would become quite light on Saturday, conditions in which his yacht has excelled. Today, the Australian crew spent a few hours sailing in what Alan Bond, chairman of the Australia II syndicate, called ''a light workout.'' Last-Ditch Preparation The Americans, who had seen their 3-1 lead disappear Wednesday and Thursday, were not so casual. Liberty was towed to Cove Haven Marina in Barrington, R.I., Thursday night to lighten ballast in anticipation of light air, a last- ditch effort to squeeze the last fraction of speed from the red-hulled yacht. For the Americans, to win with a slower boat would be heroic. Australia II, the controversial yacht with the winged keel, represents the culmination of a 12-year, $16 million effort spread across four challenges by Bond and Ben Lexcen, the yacht's designer. If Australian II loses, says Lexcen, the syndicate will not return for another attempt. If Liberty wins, Vic Romagna, secretary of the America's Cup Committee of the New York Yacht Club, said, ''We're probably going to wonder how we did it and then spend some time being overjoyed.'' Southwesterly Winds in Store The forecast for Saturday was northwest winds in the morning shifting southwesterly at 10 to 12 knots in the afternoon, according to the Newport Weather Center, a private company that has been advising the competitors. Before the southwesterly breeze becomes established, there could be a period of very light, fluky air. Johan Valentijn, Liberty's designer, said 910 pounds of internal ballast was removed. This was in the form of 26 lead bricks weighing 35 pounds each that were taken from the ballast stowed in the bottom of the boat. Before the change, Australia II, at 50,000 pounds, was approximately 4,500 pounds lighter than Liberty. The change in ballast required a remeasurement of the yacht, which was done Thursday night and today. A remeasurement is allowed, providing the opponent is notified by 8 P.M. the day before the next race. 'Like a Rocket in Light Air' ''We know we can beat them in winds of 10 to 12 knots,'' said Valentijn. ''Now we've got to get going in 0 to 10 knots. And we know we can make that boat go like a rocket in light air.'' Of course, if the forecast is wrong and the winds are strong, the change will hurt Liberty. According to the rules governing the 12-Meter design, if ballast is removed a certain amount of sail area can be added. While waiting for Liberty's new measurements to be taken, one of its crewmen, Jon Wright, surveyed his battle-worn looking yacht and observed that a strip of sail could be added to the jib or the size of the spinnaker could be increased. Wright said he felt it was more important to be able to use a larger spinnaker to be more competitive downwind and the lighter weight would help Liberty accelerate somewhat. Until the ballast change, Liberty was almost 4,500 pounds heavier than Australia II. He said that Liberty raced at the lighter weight at the end of the July trials against Courageous ''and we sailed away from her.'' ''The Australians may see a different boat out there tomorrow,'' Wright said. First Race Was Hardest The first race was the hardest, he said, adding, ''at least, we know what we're up against now - a faster boat.'' Regarding Australia II's innovative winged keel, Wright said, ''It's easy to use that as an excuse, that we're not playing with a full deck.'' To win, said the 35-year-old sailor from Rosemont, Pa., ''Everybody has to stop looking over their shoulders. We have to forget about all the guys who have defended the cup before. It's our ball game. And we have to go out and sail the best race we can. If we do that, we'll come out ahead.''

389-> THE BAUERS, DAREDEVILS OF THE BIG TOP
The four Fearless Bauers, whose daredevilry atop 70-foot poles without a net is a high point of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, live up to their billing. They cannot, they say, recall ever being scared of heights. However, they can experience a qualm if, as Joe Bauer put it, ''maybe you slip a little up there.'' As often as three times a day, Mr. Bauer, his wife, Elizabeth, and two of their children - 17-year-old Joe Jr. and 25-year-old Lisa - scramble hand over hand up the skinny, steel poles, which are anchored in tubs on the floor of Madison Square Garden and topped by a small, round platform. Once up there, the Bauers lean to make the poles sway, dipping to angles of nearly 40 degrees in every direction, to the delighted terror of neck-craning spectators. They do stunts - handstands, for instance -while swaying; exchange poles (as the audience groans, ''Oh, no!'') and even slide back down head first at 60 miles an hour, stopping abruptly by hugging the poles with their arms and legs about four feet from the ground. The descent, which takes less than one second, is the riskiest part, they said; going up - which takes all of 27 seconds - is the hardest. You have to climb fast and smoothly, or the poles wiggle a lot, Joe Jr. explained. The Distractions Below At all times, they must concentrate. Are there not distractions? Lisa Bauer smiled. ''If someone is really good-looking down there,'' she said, ''that's distracting. And my brother. I'll look over at him, and he'll be grinning and giving some girl the eye.'' Seated in their carpeted trailer, parked backstage near the chained elephants, the Bauers spoke matter-of-factly about a way of life that has been in their families for a long time. On Mr. Bauer's side, circus performing goes back five generations; on Mrs. Bauer's, seven, both in Switzerland. The couple, now American citizens, moved to the United States 28 years ago and live in Sarasota, Fla., during the two months of the year when they are not on the road. There have been only a few accidents along the way. Mrs. Bauer suffered a split skull and concussion at the age of 14 or 15 when she slid down the pole and did not stop in time. And Mr. Bauer plummeted with his pole in Cleveland in 1970 when a bolt securing it to the floor snapped. ''I was lucky,'' he said. He landed on stacked sections of a lion cage. His kneecap was shattered and his hand cut almost to the wrist. But he was back performing in five months. The poles are no longer bolted. They now fit in tubes emerging from water-filled aluminum tubs that are six feet in diameter and about two and a half feet high. Each tub weighs about a ton once it is filled with 600 gallons of water. The poles are X-rayed each winter to detect possible flaws. Brief Warm-Up Session For 15 minutes before each 8-minute performance, the Bauers warm up with push-ups, knee bends, arm swings and jogging. That's all that's needed. ''If we do two and three shows a day, we don't need extra practice,'' Mrs. Bauer explained. But back in Sarasota, the Bauers practice with their poles, in the privacy of high trees on their property. They also have a gym and a pool at home, and frequent a health spa. Strong muscles are crucial, Mrs. Bauer explained, flexing her arm to reveal biceps like boulders. They eat sensibly, but aren't fanatical about it. Generally, they don't have a sweet tooth among them, although Miss Bauer craves cheesecake when she visits New York. (''I ate a whole one by myself the other night,'' she confided). They drink wine with dinner, which is at about 11 P.M., after the evening show, but otherwise they eschew alcohol, Mr. Bauer said. The Bauers' other daughter, Amanda, 9, won't be able join the act because of vision problems. Joe Jr. and Lisa, though, can't remember when they didn't want to emulate their parents. ''When I was little and would hear the fanfare,'' Miss Bauer recalled, ''I would run as fast as I could to watch. And each time it would be as if I was seeing it for the first time.'' She and her brother, who made his debut this season, trained in stages. They swayed at first only five feet from the ground, then gradually went higher - easily arranged, because the poles consist of sections that fit together. Miss Bauer started at the age of 12 and joined the act at 15. She also performs separately on the trapeze. Discos and Fishing Their education has consisted of tutoring, correspondence courses and public school whenever they are at home. Miss Bauer finished high school, and Joe Jr. is doing so now. For diversion, the younger Bauers enjoy discos. Mrs. Bauer likes ''all kinds of music except that wild stuff the kids put on,'' and Mr. Bauer goes fishing when he gets the chance. Mr. and Mrs. Bauer, who have appeared in circuses, fairs and exhibitions, performed with Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey before forming their own act 15 years ago, but this is their first year there as a family. In a year, the parents plan to retire. ''We want to stop while we are still physically fit,'' Mr. Bauer explained. He is 49 and has an agency that books circus acts. Mrs. Bauer, 44, owns an apartment complex and may open a boutique. The younger Bauers will continue to perform, as a duo, and their parents will keep in shape with the poles. After all, Mrs. Bauer could not resist observing, ''The family that sways together stays together.''

390-> SCOUTING; Shortened Season
Nancy Lopez, who has accumulated $81,448 while winning twice on the Ladies Professional Golfers Association tour this year, does not plan to compete during the final five months of 1983. She and her husband, Ray Knight, are expecting their first child in mid-November. Knight is an infielder with the Houston Astros. ''I expect that my last tournament of the year will be the U.S. Women's Open in Tulsa, Okla., in late July,'' she said yesterday at the Upper Montclair (N.J.) Country Club while practicing for the Chrysler-Plymouth Classic, which begins today. ''I'm hoping to return to the tour in late January. Until Ray has to report to spring training with the Astros, he and the baby can travel with me to a few tournaments. Then a nursemaid will accompany the baby to the tour cities.'' Miss Lopez, who has earned more than $1 million since turning professional in 1977, was asked if she wanted her baby to become a major league third baseman (like her husband) or a woman golfer. ''I really hope neither,'' she said.

393-> STAMFORD TO GET A NEW RAIL STOP UNDER U.S. PLAN
Ground breaking will take place here Friday for a new $50 million railroad station, one of the largest construction projects in a $2.19 billion revitalization effort along the Boston-Washington rail corridor. Two other new stations are now under construction along the 457-mile line while four others are being restored, some to their original grandeur. Six others are being or are soon to be extensively upgraded in the program. Authorized by Congress in 1976, the Northeast Corridor Project is now moving into its most visible, and for riders most inconvenient, stage. Eight States Involved The work to date has primarily been on tracks and equipment under the direct jurisdiction of Federal agencies, while construction work on the stations involves facilities owned by either state or city agencies. The project involves eight states. ''This summer will mark the peak of construction of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project with nearly all the contracts having been awarded,'' Transportation Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole said on Monday. She was touring one of the stations in the project, the $6.2 million restoration of the 72-year-old Penn Station in Baltimore. By the end of the summer, Mrs. Dole said, 75 percent of the Amtrak project, which incorporates local commuter lines such as Metro North, will be completed. Construction began in March on the most expensive undertaking: a $100 million complex for Providence, R.I., situated a few hundred feet from the existing station, which will be converted for other purposes, possibly a convention site, according to the city's planning officials. The Government supplied more than $30 million with the remainder supplied by the state and city. Other stations that had fallen into disuse during the railroad's decline following World War II are being restored, including Union Station in New Haven. All told, work on the 13 stations will cost $210 million, with $165 million paid by the Federal Railroad Administration and $45 million in state and local funds. Additional funds for commercial projects being incorporated into new stations is being supplied by local governments and private developers. The architect for the entire station revitalization program is Skidmore Owings & Merrill. In addition to new stations for Stamford and Providence, a third new facility is now under construction in New Carrollton, Md., using $11 million in Federal funds. Other primarily historic renovations in addition to New Haven and Baltimore will occur in Wilmington, Del., and Newark. Improvements in Stamford The remaining six stations being upgraded are Boston's South Station; New London, Conn.; Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan; Metropark, N.J.; Trenton, and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. The smallest Federal expenditure is $500,000 to refurbish Metropark. Contracts for the second largest station improvement, South Station, are expected to be signed ''in a few weeks'' with work scheduled to start by midsummer, said Louis S. Thompson, assistant administrator of the project. ''Traveling from Boston to Washington will be a first-class experience all the way,'' he said. The new Stamford station will span the tracks with stairways leading to four tracks, enabling local and express trains traveling in the same direction to be in the station at the same time. Currently, one train must wait until another has cleared the station. The station will include a 750-garage and outdoor parking for 250 cars. In the meantime, however, more than 7,000 commuters who enter and leave on 160 trains each workday will have to endure at least two years of construction activity involving the moving of station facilities as the buildings on the two sides of the tracks are torn down to make way for the new station. Also, parking lots around the station will be closed with 700 spaces for cars to be used instead by construction equipment. Other parking will be provided several blocks from the station.

394-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Forsch Sues Agent
Bob Forsch, the St. Louis Cardinal pitcher, has filed a damage suit charging that his former agent, LaRue Harcourt, had invested $281,500 in ''speculative and unsafe'' ventures that benefited Harcourt's family, cost Forsch dearly and entangled him with the Internal Revenue Service. Some of the money, Forsch said, had been used to buy a tavern for Harcourt's wife and some had been used to buy a house for Harcourt's lawyer. In addition, the suit charged, an investment Harcourt made for Forsch in a commodities program had led to an I.R.S. audit of Forsch's tax returns that could cost him additional taxes and penalties. Harcourt, a California school teacher who represented Forsch when he signed a contract with the Cardinals in 1980, said that he had not been notified of the suit.

397-> DANCE: THREE WORKS BY LAURA DEAN
SINCE the early 1970's, Laura Dean has been noted for choreography that emphasizes clear patterns for groups. But last year, with ''Sky Light,'' she created a dance that also emphasized solo choreography. ''Sky Light'' was on the program that Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians presented Saturday night in the Center for the Arts of the State University of New York at Purchase. So were ''Inner Circle'' and ''Enochian,'' which received their world premieres in Greensboro, N.C., only last month. If all three reflected Miss Dean's newfound concern for solos, they also suggested that she has not lost her love of patterns. Miss Dean remains one of modern dance's most interesting and unusual choreographers. At first, ''Inner Circle'' looked as if it would be a solo for Ching Gonzalez involving steps to the side, kneebends and fluid arm gestures reminiscent of those in traditional Indian dance. But one by one, Marianne Schultz, Elizabeth Maxwell, William Setters, Kristin Jackson and Renouard Gee entered to join him in the same movements. Thus a solo became a unison ensemble. Yet the way it did so made one realize that a unison dance can be viewed as a group of people doing the same solo simultaneously. ''Inner Circle'' contained other examples of interplay between individuals and groups. From time to time, while everyone else continued in unison, Mr. Gonzalez stepped forward with different steps and then was absorbed back into the group. But his venturings forth never destroyed the balance of the stage picture. When confident parades with big swings of the arms were performed both in unison and contrapuntally, one became aware of individuals moving in harmony with other individuals. A similar harmony was evident in passages of spinning in circles. Because the very sensation of turning may totally absorb a whirler's attention, spinning could be called an inner-directed act. Yet, with her groups of whirlers, Miss Dean made spinning communal. ''Enochian'' surprisingly demonstrated that a solo can be a dance for more than one person. It began with Mr. Conzalez going from a yogalike meditation posture into sequences containing upward stretches of the arms and high extensions for the legs. Mr. Gonzalez left the stage and Miss Dean entered to carry on the solo without a break, her steps, like his, proving that both fast and slow movement can be equally serene. Here was a dance that one person could have done. Yet Miss Dean had two people do it. ''Sky Light'' started off with a comparable solo for many people: in this case, the six dancers of ''Inner Circle,'' each taking his turn with a set of phrases. Since its premiere, ''Sky Light'' has been revised and the dancers wear some new yellow, and very simple, costumes. Filled as it is with jumping, ''Sky Light,'' which looked lively enough last year, looks, if anything, even more lively now. At times, as dancers in two lines confronted one another at stage center, it could have been a celebration of team spirit, and certain frozen poses recalled statues of athletes. Everyone even got a chance to show off in solos exemplifying the infinite varieties of spinning. ''Sky Light'' ended with all six dancers moving together, but in separate pools of light. That image summed up the entire program. Once again, Miss Dean provided the music, as well as the choreography, for her dances. Her scores for percussion and synthesizer, played by David Yoken, Don McGlashan and Miss Dean herself, helped reinforce the choreographic rhythms. However, though they may have been spare, they were not monotonous. The music for ''Inner Circle'' had a driving intensity. ''Sky Light'' was a confident rat-tat-tat and ''Enochian'' combined liquid murmurs with chiming bells.

398-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; TENNIS'S 'SHERIFF' ENFORCES THE LAW
The most important person in tennis is not competing in the United States Open this week. The most important person in tennis is a rangy 45-year-old North Carolina attorney with a soft Southern accent and a soft button-down shirt. M. Marshall Happer 3d is the administrator of the Men's International Professional Tennis Council, the closest thing to a commissioner that this fragmented and footloose sport has had in its 15 years of open tournaments. To some tennis people, Marshall Happer is known as ''Sheriff,'' for the same reason Wyatt Earp was known as Marshal. Just as Dodge City attracted the gun-slinging outlaws of the Old West, the boom of open tennis attracted racquet-slinging outlaws who have held up tournament promoters, abused officials and ripped off spectators. But now, with a new five-year contract that denotes not only the council's support but also his own commitment, Marshall Happer is slowly restoring law and order. ''The thing we're looking for,'' he was saying yesterday in his midtown office, ''is reasonable order with a system that will last for a few hundred years.'' Even a few hundred weeks would be an improvement, but Marshall Happer obviously is a sheriff who's looking beyond his time. He's also a sheriff who helped rewrite the uniform code of conduct that has been in effect this year for the first time, the code of conduct that intimidated John McEnroe into virtual silence Monday during his fourth-round loss in the Open; that suspended Yannick Noah for 42 days for missing a World Team Cup match; that suspended Guillermo Vilas for one year and fined him $20,000, pending his appeal, for accepting a reported $60,000 appearance-fee from a Rotterdam tournament. ''The top players think we're being too tough,'' Marshall Happer said, ''and the public feels we're being too lenient.'' John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl have supported Guillermo Vilas in his appearance-money defense, typical of the top players' tunnel vision, if not their selfishness. Tennis will mature as a sport when the top players support Marshall Happer in his enforcement of the conduct code, just as many of the National Football League's top players and even its Players Association supported Commissioner Pete Rozelle's suspension last month of four players for drug violations. ''Appearance money is bad for the integrity of the sport,'' Marshall Happer said. ''If a guy is being paid $100,000 to show up for a tournament where the first prize is $32,000, it's wrong. I don't mind a player being paid big prize money, but I do mind a player being paid under the table and just for showing up. Instead of providing appearance money, a tournament should add that money to the prize money.'' Another test of Marshall Happer's effectiveness will be the cooperation of tournament sponsors, especially those at smaller tournaments where ticket sales and television income depend on the presence of top players. Appearance money isn't provided, or demanded, at the United States Open or at Wimbledon because the title is enough to attract the top players, the title that affects their lucrative equipment and clothing contracts. But elsewhere, the top players often collect appearance money. In their quarrel with Marshall Happer, the top players snubbed him at the Open's players' meeting last week. ''Mats Wilander of Sweden was the only top player there, as I recall,'' Marshall Happer said. ''Most of the top players tend to want to deal with me through their agents, and I can respect that. I don't talk to John McEnroe very often; he's going from one tournament to another anyway, but I talk to his father a lot.'' In his 2 1/2 years as administrator since he was found by an executive search firm, Marhall Happer, once the president of the Southern Tennis Association and the Carolina Tennis Association, has established a staff that includes three assistant administrators (two in New York, one in Paris) and six tournament supervisors. One morning during the Italian Open this year, Marshall Happer's phone rang. ''Kurt Nielsen, our supervisor there, was calling to tell me that Jose- Luis Clerc of Argentina had withdrawn from the doubles after a dispute with an umpire. Under our rules this year, that meant he also was out of the singles even though he already was in the quarterfinals. He said he hadn't realized that, and it was unfortunate because he had never had a misconduct problem, but those are the rules.'' Tennis has always had rules, but Marshall Happer appears to be its first administrator with the power, as well as the courage and the independence, to enforce those rules, whether the top players like it or not. ''In the past, the men's game was ruled part-time by the International Tennis Federation and part-time by the Association of Tennis Professionals, which created conflicts of interest,'' he said. ''Needless to say, a lot of things were never done. But now it's a full-time effort by the total game rather than a portion of it. And the council has been extremely good in backing me.'' The council includes three I.T.F. members, three player representatives and three tournament representatives. ''I really think misbehavior is slowly coming under control,'' Marshall Happer said. ''Two years ago it was common to see misbehavior on almost every court at a big tournament. But that no longer happens. Now it's only a small number who have problems, but the public is more aware of that minority than it is of the overall change. What happened this year is that all the fines were collected out of a player's prize money immediately. The younger players quit misbehaving because they can't afford it.'' The top players, of course, can afford it. ''For the last 10 years, the top players have been getting away with murder,'' Marshall Happer said. ''So this comes as a shock to them. But our enforcement of the conduct code is really a long-term investment for the younger players' benefit. In the next generation, we'll have a healthy sport.'' That's as close as the ''Sheriff'' would come to acknowledging that tennis isn't healthy now, and won't be until the top players and the tournaments support him completely.

399-> SOVIET SAYS WORLD OPINION IS ON ITS SIDE
The Soviet Union stood firm today in its defense of a Soviet fighter pilot's action in shooting down a South Korean airliner and maintained that world opinion and international law were strongly on its side. A Government statement on the incident that was published Tuesday appeared to have signaled the end, at least for now, of Soviet disclosures. Having acknowledged in the statement that the plane was shot down, the Kremlin appeared content to leave the matter to a barrage of largely polemical articles in the official press. Several of these asserted that the version of events put out here, centering on charges that the Korean aircraft was on an American spying mission, was winning the battle for world opinion. A typical assertion was that of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the newspaper of the Young Communist League, which said the incident ''has caused legitimate indignation in the Soviet Union and among all honest people on earth.'' Statement Given Prominence Tass, the official press agency, said that ''indignation is growing around the world'' at the United States' role. The Government statement, printed on the front pages of almost all Soviet papers, described this as a ''preplanned'' matter, charging that the Korean Air Lines 747 jet flew over sensitive Soviet military installations with the provision that a ''major political provocation'' could be staged against Moscow if Soviet air defenses ''stymied'' the operation. The official information media backed the claim of international support with a battery of dispatches from around the world, but the majority of these consisted of statements by Communist governments allied with Moscow or foreign Communist parties. On the television news the principal report dealing with international repercussions of the affair was from Hanoi and involved an article in the Vietnamese Communist Party paper, Nhan Dan, that accused the White House of shedding ''crocodile tears'' over passengers whose deaths it said had been caused by an American plot. There were also references to the Western press, but as has been the case throughout the crisis many of these were removed from context or otherwise presented so as to suggest support for the Soviet position not intended by the original. The television news emphasized that the full text of the Soviet Government's statement had been published in The New York Times, a development evidently intended to show that the statement had gained credibility in the West. Responsibility for Decision The Government statement implied that the decision to shoot down the 747 was taken by the ''command post'' of the air defense forces in the area where the airliner went down, in the Sea of Japan off Sakhalin island, without reference to higher military or political authority. But press accounts today emphasized that the whole country stood behind the fighter pilot's action. Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, had talked about Soviet actions in the affair as if he had never heard of the concept of sovereignty. It said that the Soviet Union took this idea seriously, and added, ''Our country will continue to act in compliance with Soviet laws which fully correspond to international norms, no matter whether Mr. Speakes and his ilk like it or not.'' Another Komsomolskaya Pravda article, striking a more emotional tone, said that reaction in some quarters abroad implied regret that the Soviet Union regarded its borders as ''sacred.'' The paper took this as a cue to refer to the country's losses during World War II, saying: ''Yes indeed, they are sacred. We shall never forget the price of our victory. Millions of people perished, and not only soldiers, but also civilians thrown into abandoned mines, forced to labor camps and poisoned in gas vans.'' One of the few hints that the incident might have caused damage to the country's international image came in a commentary in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, which asked if the ''South Korean plane incident isn't too propitious for Washington'' to have been a coincidence. The commentary charged that Washington had ''unleashed'' the affair so as to cover its own ''crimes'' in Lebanon, Central America and elsewhere. International Law Cited Considerable stress was laid on the contention that the fighter plane's action against the Korean airliner was soundly based in international law. One of the country's top academic lawyers, Nikolai A. Ushakov, said in the keynote commentary on television that the Soviet planes ''acted completely legally and in full accordance with international rules,'' including sections of the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. Mr. Ushakov, head of the international law department of the Institute of State and Law, a body under the Academy of Sciences, said that Article 1 of the Chicago code laid down the complete sovereignty of each nation over its airspace and Article 6 provided that all flights through that airspace should take place in accordance with the rules laid down by the nation concerned. He said these left no doubt as to the legality of intercepting the plane. Pilots Authorized to Use Arms A senior official in the Ministry of Justice, Georgi D. Golubov, in an interview with Tass, also cited the Chicago convention, but his remarks followed the Government statement in basing the actual destruction of the plane on the Soviet border law promulgated last November. The relevant article of the law empowers the Air Defense Forces to use ''weapons and combat equipment'' in cases where violators of Soviet airspace cannot be detained by other means. All Soviet commentaries avoided saying directly that the South Korean plane had been shot down, using instead the formulation in the Government statement, which said that the fighter had fulfilled a command post's order ''to stop the flight.'' Although ambiguous in English, the word used in the Russian text of the statement, ''presekat,'' would probably convey more of the finality of what happened to a Soviet audience. The standard dictionary used by Soviet translators, published by Moscow's Russian Language Publishers, gives various synonyms, including to ''suppress,'' ''stop at once'' and ''nip in the bud.''

400-> 9TH DISTRICT: THE 'FAIR FIGHT' CAMPAIGN
OSSINING AS the sun beat down on the Chilmark Shopping Center here, Bill Crosbie assembled campaign literature last week under the raised trunk lid of Stan Kirwin's Toyota. Then Mr. Crosbie, a County Legislator, set off with Mr. Kirwin, who is running for Ossining town justice, and two local Republican candiates to knock on doors in Indian Village, a section of small houses on neatly trimmed lawns in the eastern part of the village. ''I don't know the district yet,'' said Mr. Crosbie, a Republican. ''It's always best to go with a local leader who can introduce you.'' Down in Tarrytown, Sandy Galef toted her yellow campaign shopping bags up to Joseph Goldfeder, a 79- year-old retiree who was sunning himself on a bench outside Fascinating Foods on North Broadway. A Democrat who is also a County Legislator, Mrs. Galef explained that she was running against Mr. Crosbie. ''You better get yourself known,'' said Mr. Goldfeder, who lives in Tarrytown. The need for increased recognition in new neighborhoods has become a fact of political life for both William R. Crosbie, 59 years old, and Sandra R. Galef, 43, who are locked in the only ''fair fight'' race for a seat on the County Board of Legislators this fall. They are both running in the Ninth District, to which Mr. Crosbie was appointed this year and into which Mrs. Galef, a Democrat, was thrown by reapportionment. Only one will survive. Redistricting has meant the loss of the Second District for Mrs. Galef, who lives in Ossining and represented it for two years on the Board. She must now campaign in the less-familiar Ninth District, including Tarrytown, which has been Mr. Crosbie's home for 28 years. By contrast, Mr. Crosbie, a Legislator in the early 1970's who was appointed to serve out the term of Richard L. Brodsky - who was elected to the State Assembly in 1982 - must learn about the voters in Ossining and Briarcliff Manor, a Galef stronghold. The Ninth lies along the Hudson River and includes Tarrytown and an unincorporated part of the town of Greenburgh on the south, North Tarrytown, part of the town of Mount Pleasant and the villages of Briarcliff Manor and Ossining on the north. The Ninth District has lost the villages of Irvington and Elmsford and much of the rest of Greenburgh. The district has become more formally Republican in its party enrollment, according to County Board of Elections figures. Before reapportionment, there were 9,943 Democrats and 8,609 Republicans enrolled in the Ninth and 6,201 voters who stated no party preference. In the new Ninth, the figures stand at 7,328 Democrats, 7,643 Republicans and 6,540 independents. ''The only way I can win is to have the support of Republicans and independents,'' said Mrs. Galef last week. Both she and Mr. Crosbie acknowledge that Mrs. Galef has retained somewhat more of her old district's population than Mr. Crosbie has. ''All I've got to do is neutralize Ossining, and I'll win,'' said Mr. Crosbie. He declined to say how many votes he thought he would need. By last Tuesday, 1,422 signed petitions collected by the Common Sense Independent Party on Mrs. Galef's behalf had been filed with the Board of Elections, Mrs. Galef said. She will need 837 valid signatures to gain an independent line on the Nov. 8 ballot. Mr. Crosbie has the Conservative Party endorsement as well as the Republican line. A Right-to-Life Party candidate, Kathleen A. Yasinsac of Tarrytown, is also on the ballot. Mrs. Yasinsac, 41, a mother of four who for ''personal reasons'' does not plan to campaign actively, said that ''to keep the party viable you have to have candidates on the ballot.'' She added that more education was necessary for voters to realize that ''tax dollars are going for abortions.'' A number of issues divide the two major-party candidates, including Ossining Sewer District taxes, the Indian Point nuclear plants and how effective each can be as Board members. To homeowners answering his ring last week, Mr. Crosbie emphasized that Mrs. Galef had been responsible for ''a 220 percent increase'' this year in the tax rate for the Ossining Sanitary Sewer District. The rate for Ossining rose from $4.49 per $1,000 of assessed valuation last year to $14.39. Mr. Crosbie said that an ''artificially low'' 1982 rate had resulted from the return of $1.2 milllion in reserve funds for the district to taxpayers through lowered rates. He asserted that the action was ''against county policy'' and that the money should have been gradually returned over a period of several years. The funds were returned because the start of operations at the district's county sewage-treatment plant in Ossining had been delayed more than a year. It began to treat waste in June last year. Mrs. Galef said last week that ''my perspective is that that the money belongs in the taxpayers' pockets instead of in the county's reserves.'' Mr. Crosbie pointed out that in his 1983 budget message, Alfred B. DelBello, then the County Executive, had described the action as ''unfortunately contrary to county policy of using such reserves, on a planned basis, to ameliorate tax increases in future years.'' Mrs. Galef said that she had a letter approving the action signed by Mr. DelBello and Edward J. Brady, the Board's Republican majority leader. She said the letter had been written before the vote by which the Board of Legislators had approved the action. Potentially, the district's sewer rate may be reduced because of two new customers. Under one of three plans being considered by the county for the International Business Machines Corporation's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, it would join the sewer district. Another likely customer is a new facility being built by the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America - the Maryknoll Fathers - in the town of New Castle. In both cases, the county is negotiating the financial arrangements for using the sewer-treatment plant, which was built and is run by the county. Of the nuclear facilities at Indian Point, Mrs. Galef said, ''I still don't think we have a safe plant. We should shut them down until we have an evacuation plan that everybody agrees is acceptable. We have buses but no drivers. We haven't trained emergency workers.'' Mrs. Galef, whose home lies within a 10-mile radius of Indian Point, said she was not against nuclear power as such, ''but I'm concerned because we're in such a populated area.'' Mr. Crosbie, a vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York, said, ''The plant is safe. Close it, and we'll raise the cost of power to Con Ed customers. It might close General Motors.'' The G.M. plant in North Tarrytown is a major employer in the county. ''The evacuation plan has to be re- formed, but we don't want 2,000 people to lose their jobs,'' Mr. Crosbie said, referring to employment at the plants owned by Consolidated Edison and the New York State Power Authority. Mrs. Galef was critical of Mr. Crosbie's status as the only New York City commuter on the 17-member Board of Legislators because his bank position takes him away from Board duties. She is a homemaker and former teacher, whose husband, Steven A. Galef, is a New York lawyer. Mr. Crosbie said of the Board, ''This is a part-time job. I've been at 90 percent of the Board meetings and 99 percent of the budget meetings.'' He is a member of the Board's Budget and Appropriations and Public Works Committees. Mrs. Galef is on the Health and Hospitals and Legislation Committees. ''He indicates I'm a housewife and jobless,'' Mrs. Galef said of Mr. Crosbie, ''but I keep telling him I have a full-time job, I love it and want to keep it.''

401-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Dressing for the Occasion, With a Bit of Help
A New York-bound executive from the West Coast, trying to make it in time for Wednesday's opening concert of the New York Philharmonic, was changing into his tuxedo on the plane when he made a discovery: no cuff links and no shirt studs. Still clutching his gaping shirt front, he ordered the waiting limousine driver to call the Mayfair Regent Hotel, where he would be staying, to unearth a spare set of jewelry. Meanwhile, Dario Mariotti, the hotel's general manager, was having dinner at his Upper East Side apartment when the phone rang. ''I looked everywhere but couldn't find my own studs,'' he said yesterday. ''So I got a dress shirt that didn't need any.'' He rushed it to the hotel. Five minutes after he got back, the phone rang again. And Mr. Mariotti rushed a pair of cuff links, to go with his shirt, to the hotel.

402-> 2 BUYERS HALT PLANS FOR MERGER
The Associated Merchandising Corporation and Frederick Atkins Inc. said yesterday that they had terminated their merger plans. The union, proposed in January, would have created a combined group with $15 billion in purchasing power. The two organizations are separately owned by some of the country's largest department store chains and independent retailers. Ferd O. Lawson Jr., president of Atkins, said in an interview yesterday that ''both organizations felt that in the final analysis it was more desirable to go forward with their present organizations rather than to merge.'' The decision by the buying offices, both of which are based in New York, was ''reached amicably,'' he said. Lee Abraham, chairman of Associated Merchandising, could not be reached for comment yesterday. Buying for Members Buying offices such as Associated Merchandising and Atkins engage in buying for their retail members, advise them on merchandise trends and carry on research for them in both sales and operations. The two offices are unusual in that they are owned by their members, wheras most buying offices represent retailers for a fee. The decision to call off the merger was reached last Friday, Mr. Lawson said, following a meeting of principals of both organizations. He declined to discuss details of the reasons for the decision. But sources in the industry said a major difficulty was the likely reduction of as much as 30 percent of the domestic staff and foreign offices of both concerns. Another reason, the sources suggested, was the delicate situation that would have been posed in cities where the merged group would have had two offices representing major competing stores. Currently, these are represented separately by either Associated Merchandising or Atkins. Possible Developments In Philadelphia, for example, John Wanamaker is in the Atkins fold, while Strawbridge & Clothier is represented by Associated Merchandising. In the merger, these competitors would have been buying much of their goods through the same office, which could lead such embarrassing developments as having the same goods and the same prices as their competition. The strategic figures of each would also be available to the other. But some sources believed the principal reason for canceling the merger was the complications that would have been caused by shifting foreign offices, centralizing some and dropping others. Associated Merchandising operates its own foreign buying offices while Atkins largely uses commissionaires or sales agents. The merger move began at the initiative of Associated Merchandising, which sought to find some way of offsetting the decision by its largest member, Federated Department Stores, to pull out of Associated's domestic buying activities. Federated, whose divisions include Bloomingdale's Abraham & Straus, Filene's and Bullock's, will continue with the buying office's domestic activities for another 18 months but will remain with Associated's foreign buying offices through 1986.

403-> Initial Jobless Claims Found Increasing 4,000, to 473,000
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose slightly, to 473,000, in the last week in April, the Labor Department reported today. There was an increase of 4,000 people applying for first-time benefits in the week, bringing the total to 473,000, adjusted to account for seasonal changes in the economy. The last increase came for the week ended April 9, when the total climbed to 506,000. At the same time, the weekly report by the department's Employment and Training Administration showed long-term jobless workers receiving special Federal supplemental unemployment checks continued to climb. Workers receiving the special compensation rose 129,000, to 1,247,300, according to data not adjusted for seasonal factors.

406-> ABOUT MEN; MAKING THE CUT
BY JOHN TARKOV John Tarkov is a senior editor of Geo magazine. EDWARD SOREL HE LESSON is a hard one, and it gets no easier through repetition. I got an early dose of it in high school, when I was trying out for varsity basketball and - for reasons that must have made sense to me then - feeling confident about my chances. In the end, there was a piece of paper taped to the locker room door. On it were the names of the guys who had won uniforms. I had to read the list more than once before I would believe it, as if my name was really up there, somewhere between the lines. After a while, I walked away. Making the cut. The phrase comes from the vocabulary of sport, but the experience extends beyond the realm of gyms and practice fields. Getting a job, starting out alone in a new city, stretching a paycheck, holding a marriage together, scavenging for status and power - whether the goal is commendable or open to question, if things work out poorly, the message a man so easily hears remains the same: You aren't good enough. That is the message of the cut. There is a gear in a man's inner workings that grinds against those words. If a man cannot - or will not - come to terms with them, they can hound him into rage or into a fixed posture of defeat. When I was in college, I worked after school in a furniture warehouse. One of my duties was to slip outside when I was asked to and return with a pint of whisky for one of the regulars. He was in his 50's, and he was a decent man who had heard the message of the cut unrelentingly. I spent a winter assigned to his section, running his errand for him and helping him wrestle recliners and sofas onto racks and skids. He liked to talk, and over the months, the skeleton of his life emerged: He had taken to heart the idea that he was dull and without promise as a boy, dropped out of school, married very young, raised his four kids and never saw a paycheck that didn't belong to someone else as soon as it was handed to him. I wonder now if he heard the message of the cut each payday. I wonder how he felt on those Thursday afternoons. One evening, working overtime and in a mood to show off, he took in too much liquor too fast. I tried to walk him around, but his legs had lost any sensible linkage to his brain. A friend of his helped me get him out through a side door, and he eased into stupor in the back seat of his friend's car. Later on, we sneaked his card into the time clock and punched him out, and his friend drove him home. The next day, he sent me out for a pint. A man's response to missing the cut rests, naturally, on his temperament and on how deeply the message of the cut has taken root. I know men who have heard the message and been hurt by it many times, and yet they seem to shrug it off and proceed much as before. I have known others who retreated into a life of little risk. What you can never know is a man's tolerance for the message of the cut, or how much of it he holds hidden inside. I once knew a man whose life in its externals was prefectly in place, all the details in enviable order. His high-school years were a time of celebrity, as an athlete in a town where high-school sports were a fulcrum to life. He did well in college and had moved on to a good job. His mariage was a new and happy one. And yet the explanation he committed to paper before he put a bullet through his eye at the age of 24 could be distilled to this: I'm not good enough. It had echoed within him since a boyhood of deprivation, until he could listen to it no more. His sister called from the Middle West to tell me what had happened, weeping over the words and trying to make sense of them. Just then, you didn't want to make sense of them. And so your spirit livens every time the obverse message is heard: You are good enough. Not long ago, a friend wrote to say that he had moved from a dead-end job into management. I understood what the promotion and the extra money meant to him and his wife, with a third child on the way. Another friend has met a woman who is changing his life for the good. Another calls to tell me that his documentary on the old Negro baseball leagues has been scheduled for early fall on PBS. I know about the years of effort he put into it. I know also how it must have felt when his own baseball career ended in the minor leagues after he ruined his pitching arm. To hear the news is to feel it as well. You know what it is to make the cut, and you know what it is to miss it. And so there is a special moment of elation and shared understanding when the cut is made. OU COME full circle to sports, finally, trying to explain and understand. The movie ''Rocky'' established a mythic character in the American consciousness: A man whose life consisted of nothing but missing the cut, but who was good enough in the end. Before the sequels to the film came out, the story ended on a note of purely personal triumph. A journeyman club fighter had lost a split decision to the heavyweight champion of the world. He was still standing after 15 brutal rounds. The man had earned a moment of uncomplicated worth and pride. It is difficult to feel anything like pride just at the time you miss the cut. But then you find yourself proceeding with your life, for all the times you have perceived yourself in failure - as not being good enough. And you may want to rethink your definition of what failure means. I think of men who buckled under the message of the cut, and I see no failure there, no more than in a fighter who was overmatched and whose body and spirit finally gave way. I think of men who would not stay down and who went on, perhaps in more certainty of punishment than relief from it. Call it the grace to continue. There is absolute worth and pride due a man who will simply continue. To do that, perhaps, is the finest measure of making the cut. And I look back to the man I worked with in the warehouse that winter long ago, fetching his booze for him and trusting him to balance his own breaking point against the breaking point of his paycheck and his debts. Think what you want about his drinking; you'll never know all the reasons, and neither will I. Perhaps they ran deeper than the lines of the self-portrait he sketched. Perhaps he compounded his own punishment. But judge him gently, if you have a need to judge. The man had the grace to continue. I wish that he were here right now so I could tell him that he didn't miss the cut at all.

407-> SOUTHLAND AND OFFICER INDICTED
The Southland Corporation, which runs the nationwide 7-Eleven convenience store chain, and one of its vice presidents were charged by a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn yesterday with conspiring to bribe New York State tax officials to fix sales tax cases involving the chain. The indictments do not charge that the $20,000 in bribes were actually paid, said Raymond J. Dearie, the United States Attorney in Brooklyn. The indictments said that the identities of the officials who were to have received the payoffs in the planned 1977 transactions were unknown. The vice president indicted was Eugene De Falco, 44 years old, of Dallas. His attorney, Robert Epstein, said he could not comment because he had not yet seen the indictment. Also charged in the case was Eugene F. Mastropieri, 45, a former New York City Councilman at Large from Queens. The indictment charges that he received $96,500 from Southland, out of which a $20,000 ''slush fund'' was created for use in paying off one or more state tax officials in the sales tax matters. According to the indictment, Mr. Mastropieri was to ''act as an intermediary'' in paying the bribes. William Sonenshine, Mr. Mastropieri's attorney, said he too could not comment until he saw the indictment. Court papers related to the case also state that Southland's chairman and chief executive officer, John P. Thompson, was among several other company officials being investigated in connection with the case that led to yesterday's indictments. According to a ruling last week by the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued in a related aspect of the case, Mr. Thompson and the other officials ''are all targets of the grand jury investigation and have refused to testify.'' The appeals court said that ''the Government believes that the bribe was discussed at a meeting in February 1977'' that was ''attended by the chairman of the corporation'' and the others. A spokesman for the Dallas-based Southland said of the company's indictment yesterday: ''Our lawyers have not reviewed it yet, and until they do we just cannot discuss it.'' As for the statement that Mr. Thompson was a subject of the investigation, the spokesman, Allen Liles, quoted John Rodgers, Southland's general counsel, as saying, ''John Thompson is not named in the indictment, and we are not aware of any continuing investigation of him.'' Southland, which says it is the 10th-largest retailer in the nation, was first publicly identified last August as being the subject of the investigation that led to the indictments yesterday. Mr. Dearie said the sales tax cases the company was accused of seeking to influence involved a ''potential liability'' by the 7-Eleven operation that was ''substantial.'' He said Southland was charged with a single conspiracy count and, if convicted, faced a maximum fine of $10,000. Mr. De Falco and Mr.Mastropieri were each charged with this count and with two other counts of defrauding Southland's shareholders and face up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted. The prosecutor in the case, James D. Harmon Jr., said he could not comment on what actually happened to the $96,500. The indictments say that $20,000 of this amount ''had been deposited in an account at the Bank of Montreal in Toronto to be used as a slush fund from which a bribe was to be paid to an official or officials of the Tax Commission.'' Southland shares closed yesterday up 1 3/8, at 38 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange. According to the indictments, in 1977 and early 1978 Southland conducted an internal investigation to determine whether there had been ''any questionable receipts, payments or political contributions'' by the company. In this inquiry, the indictments said, various people ''failed to disclose'' the bribery conspiracy to such parties as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the company's independent auditors. A House subcommittee has been looking into the role that John M. Fedders, now director of the S.E.C.'s Enforcement division, played in this aspect of the case as a private lawyer in the late 1970's. According to parties familiar with the case, Mr. Fedders served as an outside legal consultant to Southland's in-house attorneys as they conducted their internal inquiry. Mr. Fedders's lawyer, Nathan Lewin, said last night that his client ''certainly did not know there was a conspiracy to bribe.'' He added that, if yesterday's charges were true, Mr. Fedders ''was one of the persons to whom'' those knowing of the plot failed to disclose it. According to Mr. Lewin, Mr. Fedders had been ''a cooperating witness'' before the Brooklyn grand jury. Mr. Fedders is not mentioned in the indictments.

408-> Sears Trade Unit And First Chicago
Sears, Roebuck & Company said that the First Chicago Corporation would become a partner in Sears World Trade Inc., an international trading company recently formed by the retailing giant. The two companies said they intend to commit $35 million in start-up capital to the new company. Roderick Hills, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the head of the new trading unit, noted that Sears's expertise is mainly in retailing, and said that the First National affiliation would help the trading company to attract business from emerging industrial companies around the globe. First National, which already has offices in these areas, would finance much of the trading activity.

409-> GAF Sees Delay In Certification
The GAF Corporation said Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had indicated he would issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting for 10 days the certification of the shareholders' vote in GAF's election of directors. The restraining order would further prolong the proxy fight between GAF and Samuel Heyman, a dissident shareholder who has claimed an ''overwhelming victory'' in his attempt to unseat GAF's management. GAF has asked for a preliminary injunction enjoining the certification pending a determination of whether a resolicitation of the shareholders is necessary. On April 28, at the annual meeting, GAF postponed the closing of the polls in the election until today to allow the solicitation of additional proxies and the switching of existing votes. The Heyman faction has opposed GAF's attempt to extend the voting period and delay certification.

410-> A DREAM COMES TRUE FOR AN ENTREPRENEUR
THE recording studio that John Montagnese built in his converted carriage house in Stamford looks like a space- age sound-stage fantasy fulfilled. In a control room, an English custom-made ''mixing'' console consisting of multicolored knobs, wires, jacks and tape reels can be engineered to compress or expand sound, with the aid of automatic computerized features. Here, such effects as echoes are created through a digital delay system. The main studio, which can accommodate 40 people, is divided into two sections, one of them carpeted. An ''isolation booth'' encased in glass is filled with drums. ''I get mesmerized looking at all those buttons,'' said Mr. Montagnese's wife, Terri Klausner. ''Two musicians put together can sound like an orchestra.'' Miss Klausner, cabaret and stage performer, was referred to as '' 'Evita' by day'' when she played the title role in that musical at matinees during the first year and a half of its Broadway run. The couple and their three Scottish terriers - Evita, Monty and Briggie - live upstairs. Mr. Montagnese, who is 32 years old, left Stamford in 1969 to go on the road as a drummer. Before returning to his roots, he toured in Europe, Africa and South America as part of a travel study program in cooperation with the University of Hartford. Then he moved to Denver, where he became a musician on television and radio. Along the way he acquired a graduate degree in child psychology. When his father died in 1978, Mr. Montagnese came back to take over the family automotive repair business. This was in his ''genetic makeup,'' he said, although he ''wasn't really cut out to be an automotive czar, but rather a music entrepreneur.'' ''Knowing that I wanted to put together a production company and studio was the light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said. ''That made the drudgery of the garage business easier to take.'' Looking for a home that could include space for a studio, Mr. Montagnese came upon ''half of an old estate just up the road'' from the repair shop three years ago. Many members of his family live nearby. The renovations that Mr. Montagnese said were ''a family project'' involved ''two years of working seven days a week.'' They included ''gutting the whole place'' and installing 14- inch-thick walls for acoustical refinement with the help of Miss Klausner's brother, and putting up a cathedral ceiling provided by Miss Klausner's father, who is in the steel business. Mr. Montagnese estimates that such labors saved him $70,000 and that the equipment, aside from the property itself, is worth more than $200,000. In his Carriage House Studios, Mr. Montagnese produces commercials, jingles, songs, full-scale classical and jazz compositions and demonstration tapes. Clients range from corporations to rock-and-roll musicians. In a commercial for the studio that stresses the innovative and promotional possibilities of music, two voices, one of which belongs to Miss Klausner, sing: ''We know music and we know how to make it work.'' It is also Mr. Montagnese's mission to encourage, develop and promote ''new raw talent'' especially when it involves jazz - where ''my heart is.'' When those who have this talent cannot afford to go to New York and record, Mr. Montagnese said, he gives them the time and space to develop and put tapes together - if they are talented enough. Miss Klausner and Mr. Montagnese celebrated their third wedding anniversary two weeks ago. They were married the day she left ''Evita'' to join the original cast of ''Sophisticated Ladies.'' ''I walked offstage and put a wedding gown on,'' she said. That was the same day Mr. Montagnese sold the automotive shop. Once called ''too versatile'' by a reviewer of one of her nightclub acts produced by her husband, Miss Klausner at 28 has had a compressed career in swift ascent. Her singing style encompasses what she calls ''belting'' Broadway songs and sultry ballads. Her soprano register can soar into operatic arias. On Thursday night, when ''A Chorus Line'' will become the longest-running show in Broadway history, Miss Clausner is expected to take part in a special 10 P.M. performance that will have eight alternating casts. When the show opened, Miss Klausner had never seen a Broadway musical. Soon afterwards, she attended two in one day - ''Pippin'' and ''Grease.'' ''That was it,'' she said. ''You could have turned me inside out five times. I was crazed.'' Four years later, after she joined a rock-and-roll band formed by Mr. Montagnese, Miss Klausner auditioned for ''A Chorus Line.'' She remembers receiving applause for her singing, but was told her dancing ''wasn't good enough.'' ''I felt like such a nerd,'' she recalled. Enrollment in two daily classes followed. She tried out again, won a part and became understudy for two other parts in the Chicago company. That was her big-time debut. To get her, the producers of ''Evita'' had to buy out the remaining month and a half of her six-month ''Chorus Line'' contract. Despite such credits, Miss Klausner admitted that she ''just began taking acting classes this year.'' Miss Klausner is involved in the evolution of a musical that she said Tom Eyen was writing with roles for her, Laurie Beechman and Anita Morris in mind. The working title is ''Kicks.'' Commenting upon his transition from performing to producing, Mr. Montagnese said: ''I'm the epitome of a side man. You don't know I'm there, but I hope you'll miss me if I don't show up. I put people together with people - singers with arrangers and writers and engineers and club owners and concert promoters. My biggest asset is my roller desk.'' Among the rock-and-roll musicians who have come out to the Carriage House Studios are Meat Loaf, Al Di Meola, members of the David Johansen group, the Blue Oyster Cult and the Alice Cooper Band. Mr. Montagnese continued: ''They like to take their shoes off, bring their dogs, wives and kids. Sometimes they come here because no one knows they're here. They appreciate the environment where they can really relax and it feels good to have sun and air. Now I'm here to stay. My ashes will be spread on this lawn. This is a private in-house production. If you want to work here, you have to be our friend because you're coming into our home.''

411-> THEATER: 'ASIAN SHADE,' TWO SOLDIERS ON LEAVE
TWO young men, buddies in a small Southern community, are home on leave before being shipped to Vietnam, and they are eagerly trying to have a high-spirited holiday. The situation is familiar, but the play, Larry Ketron's ''Asian Shade'' (at the WPA Theater), has the buoyancy of youth, and the actors - most of them new faces - inhabit the landscape as if they are natives. Mr. Ketron is a most prolific playwright, with a play a year since 1976. He has always had a homespun humor and a gift for local color, but more and more he has learned to relax and to allow his characters to develop organically. In this play, he has also jettisoned his archenemy, whimsy. Before they know it, five days of leave have evaporated for the green recruits, played by Lenny Von Dohlen and Mark Benninghofen. Under Dann Florek's astute direction, the play speeds by just as quickly for the audience, leaving a trail of warmth and memory. The two youths are a mass of pos@tadolescent contradictions. They are torn between to-hell-and-back patriotism and boyish hedonism, proud of being ''in the military,'' angry at local 4Fs but embarrassed to be seen in town wearing crewcuts. Borrowing a bungalow from a genial farmer (Tom Brennan), they set up bachelor housekeeping, hiding out, almost as if they are convicts on a brief reprieve. Each has a fondness for his family combined with a reluctance to spend any more time than necessary in their company. Mr. Benninghofen is especially self-conscious at the way his parents stare into his eyes, as if trying to remember what he looks like. Neither he nor his friend wants to be pinned down to anything. With near desperation, they simply want to have a good time, as represented by two tempting local girls, Marissa Chibas and the flightier Dianne Neil. The four swim, dance, kid around and, as expected, one relationship begins to be serious. Shadowing the couple is the imminent overseas shipment. The author avoids the pitfalls of sentimentality and overstatement. Until a second-act showdown, a well-motivated outburst of temperament, everything remains easygoing. Both play and characters follow a natural course. Occasionally a line seems dislocated in time, with a code of morality that is more redolent of the 1950's than the 60's. But the writing retains its freshness. For one thing, Mr. Ketron has a nice way of using a cliche for comic purpose, as when Mr. Benninghofen hints at a change in their military assignment: ''Certain moves are being made on the old checkerboard of life.'' In ''Asian Shade,'' everyone, including the playwright, plays the game as if for the first time. The relationship between the two boys is particularly wellobserved. While Mr. Von Dohlen combines impetuosity with sensitivity, the more knowing Mr. Benninghofen is an opportunist. At the same time, the two girls carefully measure reputation against desire. All four actors are charming, as is J. Smith-Cameron as another young woman, who arrives at the end of the evening for a wistful postscript. ''Asian Shade'' is more a cameo than a full-scale canvas, but it was conceived with honesty and it is performed with authenticity.

412-> CRITICS TELL OF 'BARRIERS' FROM A 2D CITY AREA CODE
Residents of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, testifying yesterday at an often-raucous public hearing, complained that the New York Telephone Company's plan to change their area code would harm community morale, disrupt businesses and lead to higher phone bills. ''It's amazing in the year when we mark the 100th anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge, which brought Manhattan and Brooklyn together, that the telephone company wants to split us up again,'' said Ben Miller, a retired printer from Brooklyn. Others testifying at the hearing, which had an audience of about 60, said the new area code would pose problems for the elderly and handicapped. The hearing, at the State Public Service Commission's World Trade Center offices, was the first of four that will be held throughout the city by the agency. The others are to be held in Brooklyn and Queens and on Staten Island. The telephone company needs the P.S.C.'s approval to carry out its plan to switch the three boroughs to a 718 area code in June 1984.Manhattan and the Bronx would keep the 212 area code. A few people at the hearing equated the loss of the 212 area code with a loss of their identity as New Yorkers. Others did not carry the argument that far, but spoke of the creation of a new interborough rivalry. Statement by Councilman ''Phone users in the three boroughs are every bit as much New Yorkers as those in Manhattan and the Bronx,'' said Steven S. Orlow, a City Councilman at Large and a Queens resident. ''We resent any artificial splitting apart. Psychological barriers already exist among the boroughs, and this change makes the barriers worse.'' Like many opposing the new area code, Mr. Orlow was applauded during his testimony by a small group of protesters in the audience. An attorney for New York Telephone, Arnold S. Rosenberg, said the new area code was needed because the company had nearly run out of phone numbers in the city. The shortage was caused, he said, by an increase in sales of advanced communications equipment that uses phone lines, such as computers and radio beepers. The new area code, he said, would not affect the cost of calls between places in the city. Others at the hearing thought otherwise. Richard Kessel, a consultant to Borough President Andrew J. Stein of Manhattan, said he feared that by creating a new area code, the phone company could more easily raise its rates. The company, he said, might be tempted ''to make a call from Brooklyn to Manhattan into a long-distance call.'' In a written statement released at the hearing, City Council President Carol Bellamy suggested that the 718 area code be applied only to the advanced communications equipment. ''What New York Telephone is really proposing,'' Miss Bellamy said, ''is that millions of New Yorkers suffer the inconvenience and bear the costs such a changeover would entail, because of the needs of machines.'' 'Save Their Fingers' Louis Powsner, a Coney Island shopkeeper, said the new area code, by requiring people calling his store from Manhattan to dial 11 numbers rather than seven, would hurt business. ''There are so many ways to make mistakes when you have to dial 11 numbers,'' he said. ''I say let people save their fingernails, let people save their fingers.'' And John Krasman, who lives in Brooklyn, said elderly people with arthritis would have a hard time dialing the extra numbers. ''Senior citizens should not be subjected to this,'' he said.

413-> 'WIND' FROM MALI AND 'REASSEMBLAGE' IN SENEGAL
Souleymane Cisse's ''Wind,'' from Mali, begins on a relatively lighthearted and familial note, though it may take New York Film Festival audiences a little while to untangle the family relationships that are being described. At the relatively modern household of a provincial military governor, there are two senior wives plus one young, tarty and ill-behaved one; domestic quarrels are lively and involve them all. The governor's daughter, a student named Batrou, is in love with Ba, who lives with a grandfather from a tribal background and a tiny grandmother who douses Ba with water when she suspects he has been taking drugs. At this, Ba pounces on the old woman and tries to pummel her until his towering grandfather interferes. Here, as in the other household, modern and traditional influences mix uneasily, and there's little on which the young people can model themselves. An old era is over, but the new one hasn't yet begun. This is especially apparent at the university Batrou attends, where student unrest is on the rise. Mr. Cisse's film, while at first it follows the love affair between Ba and Batrou, moves on to study the incompatibility of their families and the incongruities that mark the culture in which they live. Drugs, tennis and contemporary furniture have all found their way into the confines of this society. Rather than signs of progress or prosperity, these things appear to be reflections of a deep dissatisfaction that, by the end of the film, has erupted into violence. Mr. Cisse's feeling for his characters is strong, and they are vividly drawn; his film works best when it approaches them individually, since the group scenes are sometimes too indirect and mildly confusing. The courtship of Ba and Batrou is an unusual one - both are very shy and they're seldom alone, but on one of the rare occasions when they are, they share a bath - and many of the family scenes are similarly idiosyncratic. The film's most impassioned sequence is a mystical one in which Ba's grandfather communes with a deity, praying for his grandson's future, and in a broader sense, that of his culture. Another film on the same festival bill is ''Reassemblage,'' by Trinh T. Minh-ha, a Vietnamese director now living in Berkeley, Calif. '' 'A film about what?' my friends ask,'' Miss Minh-ha repeats several times in voice-over. ''A film in Senegal. But what in Senegal?'' Her friends were right to wonder. A collection of images - women, breasts, children, herds of animals - is examined; meanwhile, in voice-over, the director considers their meaning from the standpoint of semiotics and derides those who bring to bear foreign values and insensitivity upon ethnological studies (she mentions a Peace Corps volunteer who couldn't hear the tribesmen through his Walkman). In the end, she says, ''What I see is life looking at me.'' Her film is no more startling or specific than that conclusion. Both ''The Wind'' and ''Reassemblage'' will be shown tonight at 6 o'clock and tomorrow at 2 P.M. at Alice Tully Hall. The Casts THE WIND, directed by Souleymane Cisse; script and dialogue (Bambara with English subtitles) by Souleymane Cisse; photography by Etienne Carton de Grammont; music by Pierre Gorse, Radio Mogadiscio and Folklore Mali; produced by Souleymane Cisse.

415-> GIANTS BEAT REDS ON 2-HITTER
Mike Krukow pitched six hitless innings before giving way to a pinch hitter, and three San Francisco pitchers settled for a two-hitter and a 4-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds tonight. Krukow (1-2) a 31-year-old right-hander, came off the 21-day disabled list last Sunday after a bout with a sore right elbow. He was removed for a pinch-hitter in the top of the seventh, and Jim Barr lost the no-hitter when Ron Oester tripled off the center-field wall leading off the eighth. Oester scored the Reds' second run on Wayne Krenchicki's grounder. Dave Concepcion got the Reds' other hit with a one-out single in the ninth. Gary Lavelle entered the game to get the last out and record his third save. Krukow had four strikeouts and walked four batters, two of them in the first inning when the Reds scored their first run. The Giants took a 2-0 lead in the first inning off Bruce Berenyi (3-3). Darrell Evans extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a double that drove in a run. Cubs 6, Phillies 3 CHICAGO (AP) - Hot-hitting Larry Bowa hit a three-run homer, his second home run in five days, and Chuck Rainey and Bill Campbell combined on a six-hitter for Chicago. Bowa's homer capped a four-run Chicago rally in the seventh. Before this week, Bowa had last hit a home run out of a ball park in July 1978. He had two homers in 1980, both inside-the-park hits and no homers in each of the last two seasons. He now has 15 homers for his career and 16 hits in his last 31 times at bat. Dodgers 4, Padres 3 SAN DIEGO (UPI) - Pedro Guerrero hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and added a sacrifice fly in the eighth to lift the Dodgers. Guerrero's home run came off Tim Lollar following a two-out single by Dusty Baker and wiped out a 2-0 Padres lead. San Diego had gone ahead in the second when Luis Salazar hit his second homer of the year, with Kurt Bevacqua on base. Fernando Valenzuela (4-2) yielded six hits, walked seven and struck out six in eight and two-third innings to earn the victory. Dave Stewart came in to get the final out with runners on first and second to record his fourth save. Cardinals 4, Expos 0 ST. LOUIS (AP) - Bob Forsch pitched a three-hitter, Darrell Porter homered and scored three runs and Tommy Herr and Willie McGee hit run-scoring singles for the Cardinals. Forsch (2-3) retired 10 consecutive batters in one stretch, and the Cardinals executed three double plays behind him. A's 11, Tigers 4 DETROIT, May 12 (AP) - Dwayne Murphy belted a grand slam, and Kelvin Moore hit two homers to lead the A's. The loss dropped the Tigers into last place in the American League Eastern Division, 4 percentage points behind the sixth-place Yankees. With the game tied, 4-4, in the fifth, Tony Phillips of Oakland opened with a double. Rickey Henderson hit a single, and Mike Davis walked to load the bases with none out. After Carney Lansford flied out, Murphy slammed Dan Petry's first pitch into the upper right-field seats for his fourth homer of the season. Jerry Ujdur relieved and walked Mitchell Page before Moore hit his second home run and fifth of the season to make it 10-4. Red Sox 5, Brewers 3 MILWAUKEE (AP) - Jerry Remy drove in the deciding run with a tworun triple, and Jeff Newman hit a home run to lead Boston. Mike Brown (3-2) scattered five hits through seven innings.

417-> Brett Smashes Three Homers
George Brett belted three homers and drove in seven runs, including a two-run shot in the top of the ninth inning that gave the Kansas City Royals an 8-7 victory over the Detroit Tigers tonight. Trailing, 7-6, Kansas City's Willie Wilson began the rally with an infield single, a bouncer over the mound. After a reliever, Aurelio Lopez, struck out U.L. Washington, Howard Bailey (1-2) replaced Lopez and Brett greeted him with his third home run of the game and fourth of the season, a shot into the right-field stands on a 2-0 pitch. Brett's final shot made a winner of the Kansas City relief ace, Dan Quisenberry (1-0), who worked the final three innings after both he and the starter, Larry Gura, were hit hard in a six-run seventh inning by Detroit.

418-> MARCOS FOE QUITS ASSEMBLY AND DENOUNCES COLLEAGUES
The head of a coalition of 12 opposition parties resigned from the National Assembly today with a speech denouncing its members as puppets of President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The opposition leader, 49-year-old Salvador H. Laurel, one of only about 12 of the 160 Assembly members who are not identified with the party of the President, said the legislative body was unable to deal effectively with such problems as corruption or such national needs as land redistribution. He said he wanted to have nothing to do with what he described as the ''nefarious Government'' of President Marcos. He also questioned the impartiality of the five-member judicial commission appointed by Mr. Marcos to investigate the killing of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the opposition leader who was shot at the airport here Aug. 21 on his return from the United States. Mr. Laurel has accused the Government of complicity in the slaying. The coalition that Mr. Laurel heads, the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, is trying to extend its influence nationwide, seeking to unseat President Marcos by nonviolent means. Catholic Pastoral Letter In another gesture of opposition today, Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, made public a pastoral letter calling for a five-minute period of prayer every noon, beginning Monday, for ''peace and justice'' in the Philippines. Cardinal Sin, a critic of the Marcos Government, asked in the letter that pastors ring their church bells 21 times at the beginning and end of each prayer period, symbolically recalling the imposition of martial law by President Marcos on Sept. 21, 1972. Mr. Marcos formally announced he was lifting martial law in January 1981 but retained the power to order summary arrests and detention without bail of people deemed to be subversive. Spokesmen for the Cardinal said half a million copies of the pastoral letter, to be read in Manila's 200 churches on Sunday, had been distributed to thousands of Roman Catholic parishes throughout the country. Although Cardinal Sin's authority is limited to Manila, it is expected the letter will have a nationwide effect since about 85 percent of the 52 million Filipinos are Roman Catholics. This afternoon about 5,000 students gathered at Manila's main post office to shout slogans, wave banners and distribute handbills protesting what they referred to as the abridgement of freedom of the press and other repressions of the Marcos Government. They dispersed after a peaceful march through the university district. More Demonstrations Predicted Student spokesmen, however, have predicted that much larger demonstrations will be held on Wednesday, the anniversary of the imposition of martial law. ''You might say that the revolution has already begun,'' Mr. Laurel said in an interview on the Roman Catholic radio station Radio Veritas, after his resignation speech. Mr. Laurel, a lawyer, belongs to a politically powerful family in Batangas Province. His father, Jose B. Laurel, was President under the Japanese occupation and was later absolved of collaborationist charges.

419-> Economic Scene; Threats to U.S.
THE United States, powerhouse of the industrial revolution in the 20th century, has been suffering from acute anxiety that it is losing its industrial and technological leadership to other countries, and losing ground in key world markets to countries that have forged ahead through close cooperation between business and government. To study the problem, the National Academy of Sciences 14 months ago assembled a distinguished panel of economists, businessmen, engineers and scientists, headed by Howard A. Johnson, chairman of the corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Frank Press, president of the academy, said the most remarkable thing about the report was that strong-minded and independent people, who started far apart, came to the unanimous conclusion that United States technological leadership is vulnerable both from domestic weaknesses and from damaging practices of other countries. The panel reached a double-edged recommendation. The first part was that the United States Government should take a stronger hand in helping to maintain the nation's capacity for technological innovation, to benefit its domestic economy, its national security and its competition for global markets. The second was that the Government should pursue policies to reduce trade frictions troubling economic and political relations among the United States and its principal industrialized allies, and, if necessary, get tough if other countries refuse to cooperate in opening up their markets. The panel called for ''the most immediate hard bargaining'' against such unfair trade practices as predatory pricing, the targeting of specific United States advanced technology markets through governmentally orchestrated industrial strategies, government intervention to force the purchase of products from domestic suppliers, and restrictions on foreign direct investment, particularly those that deny distribution outlets for United States advanced technology products. To deal with such cases, the panel proposed a series of escalating actions, ranging from bilateral discussions to formal dispute proceedings. If all else failed, it called on the United States to take ''unilateral action to protect the national interest as a step of last resort.'' The panel recommended one major organizational change: a biennial Cabinet-level review of the nation's innovative capacity and trade competitiveness. The review would cover not only research and development but also manufacture and distribution. It would also assess the broad elements that affect innovation, including the macroeconomic environment, regulatory policy, patent policy and the antitrust laws. Its report calls for greater governmental aid to education, both higher and lower. The American primary and secondary system for teaching science and mathematics is in trouble, the report says, noting that the higher productivity growth of the Japanese economy has been attributed partly to the high quality of that country's precollege educational system. Thus the American spotlight is back on the factors affecting economic growth. Basically, there are two forces behind growth. One is a set of cultural factors, including science, technology and the skills, education and drive of a nation's people. The other is a set of economic factors, especially the accumulation of capital and its investment in plant and equipment or in research and development. On the cultural side, the United States still looks very strong. American scientists still lead the world in winning Nobel Prizes. There is a zest in science and engineering that carries over into many high-technology industries - the kind of zest described in Tracy Kidder's book, ''The Soul of a New Machine.'' But there are deep concerns about the nation's social, economic and educational disparities, with a fissure developing between ''upper class'' and ''underclass.'' The large number of unskilled and undereducated workers hampers the nation's technical and industrial progress. On the economic side, persistently high interest rates and low rates of savings and investment are slowing the growth of productivity. While many small companies are showing remarkable dynamism and have ready access to venture capital, America's basic industries are having trouble raising long-term funds at costs below anticipated rates of return. High interest rates, resulting from the clash between loose fiscal and tight money policies, have made the United States dollar so overpriced as to undermine American exports and overstimulate imports. And high interest rates have helped slow the growth of the United States and the world economy. The academy report should help mobilize Government support for the nation's slipping technological and international trade position. It could also help improve the macroeconomic and social environment for growth, if the nation's policy makers will read it and take it seriously.

420-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; ALI FOGS HOLMES'S VIEW
LAS VEGAS, Nev. S uddenly, his voice dropped almost to a whisper, as if he were talking about a loved one who had aged quickly, sadly. And he was. Larry Holmes was talking about having seen Muhammad Ali here this week. ''He's getting $1,200 for three weeks,'' Larry Holmes said. ''What's he getting the $1,200 for?'' somebody asked. ''I don't want to talk about that,'' the 33-year-old unbeaten heavyweight champion of the World Boxing Council said quietly, as if it pained him to discuss the 41-year-old three-time titleholder, for whom he was once a sparring partner. ''You're only good for people who are out to use you.'' ''How does Ali look? How's his speech pattern?'' ''Ali's always talked low to me,'' he said, sprawled in a soft chair in his Dunes Hotel suite. ''His voice is lower than it was in 1971, 1973, 1975. It's more slow and softer. He's hard to understand. But I don't look for him to stumble when he walks and stutter when he talks.'' ''But do you see that as a warning to yourself?'' ''Life is a warning,'' Larry Holmes said quietly. ''Is Ali staying here at the hotel?'' he was asked. ''Yeah, I went to his room to see him, and I met him in the coffee shop. To me, he's one of the greatest fighters of all time, he's my friend, he's a man I love and respect. I don't look to see if he's shaky, if he's punchy, if he's broke.'' S ilence changed the subject to the reason Larry Holmes is here: to defend his title tonight against Tim Witherspoon, an unbeaten but undistinguished challenger. ''Two guys go the distance with me, and people think I got to be losing my sting, losing my punch,'' Larry Holmes was saying now, referring to his inability to register a knockdown in a 15-round battering of Randy (Tex) Cobb and a 12-round tango with Lucien Rodriguez in his last two title defenses. ''I hope I don't knock this guy out too soon. I'm gonna start quicker.'' Perhaps it was the melancholy mood that Ali's appearance here had created in Larry Holmes, perhaps not. Whatever the reason, Larry Holmes sounded like a champion who was suddenly tired at the age of 33 despite a 42-0 record with 30 knockouts, a champion who was taking a challenger lightly. He sounded like a champion who could be ambushed unless the bell wakes him up tonight. ''Have you seen Witherspoon fight much?'' he was asked now. ''Three times,'' Larry Holmes said. ''I saw him beat my sparring partner Marvin Stinson, but he tired after the fourth round. Jerry Williams was getting to him with left hooks and right hands, but he knocked him out with an uppercut. And against Renaldo Snipes he won, but it was a lousy fight. I thought the decision went to Snipes.'' Tim Witherspoon, a 25-year-old Philadelphian, has a 15-0 record, with 11 knockouts. But he hasn't fought in nearly a year; he suffered a fractured jaw last fall. ''What can a guy learn in 15 fights?'' Larry Holmes said. ''You duck the good fighters at that stage of your career. You're just trying to get into position.'' Larry Holmes was looking ahead to another title defense later this year, perhaps against the winner of the Greg Page-Renaldo Snipes bout tonight. He spoke of ''taking an evaluation'' after that, perhaps devoting himself to his business interests in Easton, Pa., where he lives in a spacious home with an indoor swimming pool shaped like a boxing glove. ''I'd rather be in Easton,'' he said. ''I never been in the fast lane. I don't need the bright lights, I don't need drugs, I don't need nothin'.'' L arry Holmes doesn't need the $1.5 million he's getting tonight. And he professes not to need a unification bout with Michael Dokes if the World Boxing Association champion retains his title against Mike Weaver here tonight. Five months ago Michael Dokes dethroned Mike Weaver in only 63 seconds. The bout was stopped so quickly that the W.B.A. decreed a rematch. ''I like boxing but not the politics, the games people play,'' Larry Holmes was saying now. ''I'll fight anyone, but there'd be a lot of controversy if I fought Dokes.'' Conflict of interest as well as controversy. Don King not only has promotional contracts with both heavyweight champions, but also has been Larry Holmes's de facto manager for a decade. To add to the intrigue, Don King's son, Carl, is Michael Dokes's manager. ''I don't want all the talk,'' Larry Holmes said. ''I can get out of the game clean. I can live with myself. I never took nothin' under the table. I never took any dives. I can go home and not worry about nothin'.'' But even if he were to retire as planned, sooner or later he would be tempted to make a comeback. All the champions are. Muhammad Ali, remember, made his comeback nearly three years ago at the age of 38 against Larry Holmes, who treated him tenderly until Ali's manager, Herbert Muhammad, signaled from ringside to stop the embarrassment after 10 rounds. ''Not me, I won't be back,'' Larry Holmes said. ''Ali always had people to tell him what to do, and he needed boxing, he needed the Rolls-Royces, the big camps, the women, all that. I don't have those problems to keep me going. Ali gave a guy a million to pay his taxes; the guy took off.'' But if Gerry Cooney were to justify himself as a challenger again, Larry Holmes might fight him - if the price were right. Larry Holmes talks about demanding $50 million for that fight, in contrast to the $10 million that he and Gerry Cooney each collected last year when the champion registered a 13th-round knockout at Caesars Palace. ''The aggravation I went through before the fight, I'd have to get $50 million the next time,'' he said. ''But no money is worth your dignity, worth your respect. Me and Cooney, we should fight with no referee and no judges. Whatever he do to me, I do to him. Whatever I do to him, he can do to me, an old-time fight to the finish. But it would only take me seven rounds.'' Larry Holmes sounded interested, sounded the way a fighter is supposed to sound. But he was talking about Gerry Cooney, not Tim Witherspoon.

423-> EUROPEAN NATIONS AGREE TO REALIGN THEIR CURRENCIES
Eight European nations agreed today to realign their currencies after West Germany accepted French demands and agreed to a set of currency values that avoided the possible collapse of the European Monetary System. West Germany and four other members of the European Monetary System revalued their currencies upward, with the German mark rising 5.5 percent in relation to the seven other European currencies. The French, in turn, agreed to a devaluation of only 2.5 percent, which was two or three percentage points less than what Bonn had sought. ''It was up to our German partners to make the biggest step,'' said Jacques Delors, the French Finance Minister, at a news conference. ''They made it.'' The realignment strengthened the dollar in foreign exchange trading today. Dealers said they bought dollars because they considered the currency realignment - which in effect devalued the franc by 8 percent - insufficient, and they said the monetary system would suffer further problems. For the United States, the realignment should have little impact on the cost of German automobiles or French wines. It also avoids a disruption of trade with Europe that a collapse of the monetary system could have provoked. In the long run, however, the dollar is likely to strengthen until Germany and France, the two most powerful Western European nations, resolve their differences. (Page D24.) Although the European currency realignment was widely interpreted as a victory for France, that country did agree to German demands that Paris deal with the problems that have weakened the franc, mainly inflation and a huge trade deficit. The austerity measures that Mr. Delors agreed to, according to German officials, would reverse the spending programs that the Socialists had embarked upon to expand the economy and reduce unemployment. German officials said Mr. Delors had given assurances that France would reduce its budget deficit by cutting spending on social programs and welfare payments. Mr. Delors also reportedly said that France would try to reduce the deficits of its nationalized industries, another cause of inflation. The devaluation itself would cut the trade deficit by making imports more expensive and exports less costly to others. ''I am satisfied with what was said,'' said Gerhard Stoltenberg, Germany's Finance Minister, referring to Mr. Delors's assurances. ''I hope it will be put into effect quickly.'' The European Monetary System, set up in 1979, seeks to promote trade by keeping the currencies of the eight member nations stable relative to each other. But in nearly all of the seven realignments that have occurred since 1979, Germany, with Europe's strongest economy, has increased the value of the mark while France has devalued. This time, however, France's Socialist Government resisted devaluation because of concern that it would increase inflation - now at about 8.5 percent - by forcing the French to pay more for imported products. The devaluation they did agree to was the third since the Socialists came to power in May 1981. At the start of the negotiations on Saturday, France's Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, threatened to withdraw from the monetary system. Such a development, and a parallel retreat into protectionism, would have reduced European trade. That threat prompted the Germans to back down today, officials said. Other Changes The Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Luxembourg eased the burden on Germany by also revaluing their currencies upward, thus making the rise in the cost of German goods sold in those countries less than the rise in France. The Dutch guilder was put 3.5 percent higher, the Danish krone 2.5 percent and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs 1.5 percent. The Irish pound was devalued 3.5 percent - even more than the franc -and the Italian lira 2.5 percent. The eight nations involved are members of the European Economic Community. Two other members, Britain and Greece, are not included in the European Monetary System. In Washington, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said the realignment should result in ''a settling down of exchange markets, with perhaps a weakening of the dollar'' over time. Three Days of Talks The realignment agreement came after a dramatic three days of haggling that was accompanied by the resignation of a key French minister and the decision Sunday night to allow European currency rates to float today while the talks continued. Mr. Stoltenberg, the German minister and chairman of the conference here, announced the currency realignment ''to strengthen confidence and calm currency exchange markets.'' He said the ministers also agreed to adjust European farm and steel prices ''as soon as possible'' so that trade in these products within the Common Market would not be affected by the realignment. A currency realignment means that prices for these goods from countries that devalued their currencies would fall, increasing their competitiveness against products from the five nations that revalued their currencies. Compromises by All Mr. Stoltenberg said all the governments ''gave up a piece of their starting positions.'' He said a one-sided revaluation of the mark, as originally demanded by France, would have been ''unbearable, in the interest of Germany's foreign trade.'' Commenting on the agreement, Otto Pohl, head of the German Bundesbank, said European central banks would be empowered ''immediately'' to intervene on currency markets to support the new ratios. He also said exchange rates in today's free trading ''did not depart essentially'' from the new official levels. The eight members of the monetary system members and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which supervises trading in the United States, said they did not buy or sell currencies today to stabilize exchange rates. Nevertheless, France, which has used up most of its foreign reserves purchasing francs in recent weeks in an effort to support the currency, said it would seek an additional $4 billion in emergency funds to intervene when necessary. Currency dealers sold European currencies today to buy dollars. In Frankfurt, where the dollar weakened earlier in the day, purchasing 2.3870 marks, down from 2.3927 on Friday, the dollar rallied to 2.4185 marks in unofficial trading this afternoon, after the announcement in Brussels. Criticism in Germany The agreement met with sharp criticism in Germany, where the Federation of German Industry warned that a stronger mark would cause ''growing export burdens'' that would hinder an economic recovery by jeopardizing a revival of export trade. Much of the strain on Europe's monetary system was caused by the enormous trade imbalance between France and Germany, Europe's two largest trade partners. France tallied a $13 billion trade deficit last year. The deficit with West Germany, its major trade partner, accounted for more than 40 percent of the total. The conference of finance ministers was called by Mr. Stoltenberg last week after several weeks of turmoil on currency markets. Speculators sold francs heavily in anticipation of a devaluation forced on France by the trade deficit, inflation and the weak showing of the Socialists in recent municipal elections. Under the European Monetary System, seven of the eight members' currencies are allowed to fluctuate by up to 2 1/4 percent in either direction from an agreed central rate. The lira is permitted a 6 percent fluctuation. The speculation strained these limits. Heads of Government Meet The agreement came only hours before European government leaders began a two-day meeting that is expected to focus, among other things, on coordination of broad economic policy within the Common Market. Nevertheless, the difficult struggle among the finance ministers was expected to cast a long shadow over the leaders' deliberations, the first to be led by Mr. Kohl, who was returned to office in a landslide victory March 6. The seriousness of France's trade problems was underlined Sunday, when Foreign Trade Minister Michel Jobert resigned. That led to speculation that the French Cabinet would be reshuffled. President Mitterrand has scheduled a television broadcast Wednesday to comment on the outcome of France's recent national municipal elections, and it is thought the address might serve to announce an austerity program. ---- Pound at a New Low By The Associated Press The British pound, which is not part of the European Monetary System, fell to a record low against the dollar in trading yesterday. After the realignment announced in Brussels, the dollar rose to 2.4120 marks in Frankfurt, up from the earlier fixing of 2.3870 marks and from last Friday's close of 2.39. The French franc plunged against all leading currencies, including the mark, which rose to an record 2.9925 francs, from 2.8985 Friday. The franc was devalued by 2.5 percent; the mark was revalued by 5.5 percent. Early yesterday, the dollar traded at 7.1450 francs, but after realignment it jumped to 7.2120 and by the close of trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 7.2313 francs, up from 7.01. While remaining steady against European currencies, the pound sank to a record low of $1.47 at the close of trading, down from Friday's finish of $1.48875. In later New York trading, sterling fell to $1.4733, from $1.4862. The pound has been hurt by political problems at home and falling world oil prices, which have cut into Britain's revenue from North Sea oil reserves. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the negotiations, monetary authorities in France, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Sweden all suspended foreign exchange quotations Monday. Other Late Rates Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday, included: 2.0752 Swiss francs, up from 2.0610; 1,445 lire, up from 1,434.50; 1.22525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.22545, and 2.6900 guilders, up from 2.6550. Dollar rates in New York at 4 P.M., compared with late rates Friday, included: 2.4150 marks, up from 2.3838; 2.0773 Swiss francs, up from 2.0595, and 1.2240 Canadian dollars, unchanged. Markets were closed in Tokyo for a national holiday. In London, the dollar edged up to 240.30 yen, from 238.60 Friday, and later in New York, the dollar climbed to 240.92 yen, from 239.65. Gold slipped to $414.50 an ounce in London, from Friday's late $420.50. In Zurich, bullion dropped to $415.25, from $421.75. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold drifted down 36 cents, to $412.60. But in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $4.60, to close at $420 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. In later New York trading, bullion was bid at $419 at Republic National Bank, compared with $415.

429-> BRIEFING
President and Pen Pal P resident Reagan is sometimes known as the Great Communicator, but he is also a Great Pen Pal, according to White House aides. When he writes one of the ordinary citizens who write him, he may dictate the letter or write it on yellow legal paper. He does not forget people who wrote him before he was President. In April 1942, when Dolores Ballachino of Buffalo was a schoolgirl, she wrote a fan letter to Ronald Reagan, the actor. Later in the year, her class was given a project: Write a serviceman to lift his morale. Ronald Reagan was then on active duty with the Army Air Corps. She wrote him again. He replied; the correspondence has never stopped. Mrs. Ballachino has about 200 letters and post cards from Mr. Reagan, and letters from his mother, Nell, and wife, Nancy. The correspondence with him touches such subjects as marriage, the family, job experience and ''life in general.'' Just after he became President, he was briefly introduced to Mrs. Ballanchino but she never got a chance to sit down with him. She did Thursday when she was in the capital with her husband, Paul, and a television crew from P.M. Magazine, which is doing a report about her. After the camera crew left the Oval Room, for the first time in 41 years, the pen pals sat down alone and chatted. In Praise of Bureaucrats B ureaucrats are the Capital's largely anonymous desk-bound majority that run the Government. There are also people who make a living studying bureaucrats. The Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, a nonprofit research organization, offers a ''fact sheet'' noting that the Federal Civil Service is 100 years old. President Arthur signed the Civil Service Act on Jan. 16, 1883. The publication suggests a causal connection between the act and the assassination of Arthur's predecessor, President Garfield, who was killed by Charles Guiteau, a frustrated job seeker, a victim of the patronage and spoils system for Federal jobs. ''The assassination capped years of discontent with the spoils system,'' the publication says, ''and Garfield's successor created a hiring system based on merit instead of patronage.'' The center says the Government now employs 2.82 million civilian workers, adding, ''The Federal bureaucracy, in general, is one of America's favorite scapegoats.'' Matthew Lesko, author of Information U.S.A., a 990-page, $19.95 paperback book on how to get help from Government agencies, offers another analysis: ''Bureaucrats, for the most part, have been given a bad rap. Despite the derogatory labeling, they are people, some more responsible than others, but all of them appreciative of a respectful and succintly phrased request for the information they have available.'' What if they lose the papers, put your phone call on hold, hang up on you? ''If they are impolite you can report them to their supervisor and this can lead to their dismissal.'' For Immediate Release A ll week the Justice Department's press office got calls from reporters hungry for details on the investigation of the case of the purloined papers, in which the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign was said to have received documents belonging to President Carter's campaign organization. The press office produced little news on the case, but yesterday morning the department called reporters with the announcement of a ''major new anticrime initiative.'' The Justice Department had formed an Economic Crime Council ''to further the Attorney General's program to combat white-collar crime.'' How new was this? The Attorney General signed it into effect May 16. James F. Clarity Warren Weaver Jr.

431-> LIBERAL SAYS PARTY DISPUTE LED TO JOB THREATS
A Liberal Party official said yesterday that about 15 party members told him they had been threatened with dismissal from their state jobs unless they switched votes in a party leadership battle. The official, Raymond B. Harding, said he had supplied the names of the employees - most of whom were members of the party's state committee - to the State Commission of Investigation. Mr. Harding, who is one of 19 party vice chairmen, was replaced as unofficial party leader this year in the leadership dispute. He said the employees contended that the job threats had been made earlier this year by other party members who also held state positions. He said he believed that the committee members who had been threatened had supported his faction. Mr. Harding said in an interview that one of the employees had secretly recorded a telephone conversation in which the threats were made. The recording, he said, has been turned over to the investigation agency. Inquiry Started Last April Lola S. Lea, the outgoing chairman of the commission, and Thomas P. Staff, the agency's chief counsel, yesterday declined to discuss the inquiry. But other officials and investigators, who asked for anonymity, said that the investigation began last April and that more than 20 state employees and Liberal Party officials had been questioned. James Notaro, a leader of a group that displaced Mr. Harding and now the party's secretary and executive director, said five or six party members told him they had been questioned by the commission. He said he knew of no ''pressure or threats'' against party members. The commission inquiry, he said, has been ''instigated by Harding in an attempt to become the boss of the Liberal Party.'' Commission investigators said the inquiry was begun after the agency had been informed by the former State Superintendent of Insurance, Albert B. Lewis, that some state employees had complained about being pressured. Mr. Lewis denied yesterday that he made any ''complaint'' or ''report'' to the commission.

433-> PHILIPPINE DEBT DELAY IS GRANTED
An advisory committee representing banks with loans outstanding to the Philippines agreed yesterday to a 90-day moratorium on payments of the country's foreign debt. The request for a three-month moratorium is only for principal payments coming due the rest of this year, according to a statement issued by the committee. No mention was made of the status of interest payments still due this year. The request for a moratorium was made by the Philippine Prime Minister, Cesar Virata, and by Jaime Laya, governor of that country's central bank, at a meeting yesterday in New York. The Philippines is the first Asian country to request a change in its foreign debt repayment timetable since the international debt crisis intensified a year ago. The move chiefly reflects the domestic political crisis set off by the assassination in Manila on Aug. 21 of Benigno Aquino, an opposition political leader, The impact of that event on business's confidence in the Marcos regime brought on a 21 percent devaluation of the Philippine peso amid large-scale purchases of dollars. The resulting drop in the nation's foreign reserves has created problems in making foreign payments. The 10-bank advisory committee said that its agreement was subject to approval by the more than 300 financial institutions with more than $20 billion in outstanding loans to the Philippines. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the committee's lead bank, did not disclose how much the Philippines owes in principal or interest for the next three months or how much it has fallen behind. In a statement issued at the close of yesterday's meeting, a spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover said that the Bank of Tokyo would act as deputy chairman, and that the committee will work with the Philippines in reviewing the country's credit needs this year and next. The request for a 90-day moratorium represents a major step beyond discussions about the country's economic and financial situation that began last month at the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington. Rescheduling Held LikelyThe request is probably the precursor to a formal debt rescheduling agreement, analysts said. According to the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the Philippines had $20.8 billion in foreign debt outstanding to banks and government entities at the end of last year. Forty-four percent of that figure, or $9.1 billion, was due this year. Commercial banks around the world hold $12.6 billion of the country's overall debt portfolio. More than $5 billion of that is held by American banks, the Morgan statistics show. The Philippines central bank puts the foreign debt at $18 billion.

436-> TO GET MULTINATIONALS FROM BEHIND FOREIGN SKIRTS
To the Editor: Your Sept. 12 Washington Watch column on the states' use of the unitary tax-assessment method claimed the Reagan Administration is in the ''middle of a long-running feud that pits 12 states against various multinationals and foreign governments.'' While 12 states apply the unitary method to foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-based multinationals, the proposal made by Treasury Secretary Regan, and rejected by President Reagan, would have denied 34 states over $750 million in revenue by restricting unitary and state taxation of intracorporate dividends. Multinationals, including British Petroleum (owned by the British Government) and Royal Dutch Shell Oil (owned by the Dutch Government) claim double taxation, but in reality are seeking Federal intervention to lower their taxes and raise those of small businesses. The column repeated the unsubstantiated, self-serving claims of these multinationals that ''A foreign- based company, for example, may wind up paying income tax to a state where its local operations show a loss.'' But the column ignored the reasons why the states have used the unitary method for decades. As the sorry spectacle of the U.S. Government begging for Swiss cooperation in its efforts to prosecute Marc Rich & Company for alleged tax evasion demonstrates, multinationals continually try to avoid taxes by hiding behind the skirts of foreign governments. Without the right to apply the unitary method to multinationals, as it is now applied to small business, the states would be at the mercy of accounting shell games designed to hide in-state profits from taxation. That is the reality of state tax policy that was unfortunately left out of the story. JAMES C. ROSAPEPE, Washington Representative, Multistate Tax Commission, Washington, Sept. 28, 1983

437-> DE GUSTIBUS; IN ITALY, AN ELEGANT DESSERT OF FRUIT
One of the pleasantest and more enduring mealtime customs in Italy is the way in which fruit is served for dessert. There have been many changes and modifications in Italian eating habits during the last 10 or 15 years (for the most part for the worse), but when fruit is ordered for dessert, as it almost always is, an assortment arrives accompanied by a big glass bowl of cold water. It is a service that is as attractive as it is practical. Fruit spoils more rapidly after it is washed, so that step should be taken only just before it is to be eaten. The moisture of refrigeration also dissipates the flavor and hastens the spoilage of most fruits. The bowl of cold water (often pleasantly chilled with ice cubes) enables diners to wash only the fruit they want, cooling it in the process. There is also a sensual appeal to fruit served in this way. One observes a marvelous careful anticipation as diners contemplate the assortment and make a choice. Apricots right now in Italy all seem to be rose-gold and as sweet as honey, and dark-red peaches in the markets look tempting. Tiny jade-green pears and wine-dark plums are in most fruit bowls this season, and cherries are at their darkest and meatiest. And so the Italian connoisseurs eye the assortments, pressing a peach here and an apricot there to ascertain ripeness. They seem to choose fruit in courses, adding their selections to the water. Watching this ceremony in restaurants throughout Italy, I have noticed that the standard selection is usually three pieces of fruit - an apricot, a peach and a plum - followed by 8 to 10 cherries. Magically - or, more probably, as a result of experience - diners here know their capacity for fruit and never wash more than they can eat. It is easy to suggest that American restaurant owners copy this attractive idea and serve their fruit Italian-style. Imagine the beautiful footed fruit bowls and the sparkling glass water bowls they could use. But the big deterrent would probably be the audience. For strange and inexplicable reasons, Americans by and large have never taken plain ripe fruit seriously as dessert. Unless it tops pastry or is poached in wine or is combined in a liqueur-accented macedoine, fruit is relegated to between-meal snacks. It would be easy to say that the reason is the lack of flavor and sweetness in our fruit. Picked unripe before sugar and flavor have developed, our fruit is no match for the luscious specimens seen here. But the real reason probably is the American preference for pastries and elaborate desserts, especially when eating in restaurants. The idea of paying restaurant prices for a peach and an apricot when one could have chocolate mousse cake is probably not one that Americans will accept. Restaurateurs who try to pioneer a graceful fruit service will probably wind up with a good deal of waste. The only hope is that perhaps the ceremony of eating fruit in this way will make it seem so glamorous that it will be accepted.

438-> RESTAURANTS
From the Far East to the Southwest. I S there cosmic significance to a menu that offers both potato salad and sashimi? Can one read deeper meaning into a restaurant that employs Japanese chefs and American waiters? Probably. East has finally met West at Gyosai and, in hindsight, the meeting seems inevitable. When sushi bars in America started serving California rolls - seaweed and rice wrapped around avocado, crab, crab roe and cucumber - it was only a matter of time before someone would decide that both Japanese and American food, or at least a Japanese chef's version of American food, should be served in the same restaurant. Katsutoshi Fukumitsu, the owner of a chain of sushi bars in Japan, and three Takesushi (also spelled with a ''z'') restaurants in this country,is responsible for this phenomenon. On entering the New York version, with its gray- green interior and subdued lighting, the diner has no clue to what is in store. At the sushi bar in the back of the restaurant, the look becomes distinctly Japanese, but this is a restaurant designed for those who love sushi and who have friends that do not. Once you come to terms with the idea that much of the food at Gyosai is not classical Japanese - some isn't Japanese at all - there are a number of dishes that can be appreciated for themselves. A delicate egg custard, for example, filled with bits of shrimp and crab, picked up hints of the orange in which it was steamed, producing a subtle combination of flavors. The yosenabe - chicken, tofu, fish and vegetables - served in a handsome iron kettle, was aptly described by one diner as ''exactly like my mother's chicken soup.'' Good, but not Oriental. The sukiyaki tasted like mu shu pork. Chicken cheese age (pronounced AH-geh) - deep fried white chicken rolled around carrot sticks, spinach and cheese - unknown in Japan, was, however, too dry. The rolls were accompanied by lemon mayonnaise (I am assured there is some form of mayonnaise in Japan) and by potato salad made with too much mayonnaise and overcooked potatoes. For those who like traditional sushi and sashimi, the fish is impeccably fresh, the ingredients first rate and the presentation worthy of the most expensive sushi parlor in town. And the prices are quite reasonable. The Gyosai Chef Special Sushi, presented on a burnt orange-and-gold lacquer platter trimmed in black, changes according to the fish available, and at $19.50 it is a bargain for two. On one occasion, we were served sea urchin, salmon caviar and crab roe sushi that offered a fascinating contrast in textures and tastes, ranging from the creaminess of the sea urchin through the delicate crunch of the tiny crab roe to the poplike bite of the salmon caviar. An exceptional nori-maki, where the fish is rolled in the center of the rice, was made with crab and the fragrant and flavorful shiso leaf, a member of the mint family that adds a refreshing touch of lemon and pepper. If the sushi had one failing, it was the tentative hand used to season the rice with wasabi. There is, however, more than enough wasabi on the side to compensate. Gyosai Chef Special Sashimi, at the same price, is, if anything, more spectacular looking. Its centerpiece is a conch shell on a bed of seaweed; the wasabi is molded in leaf shapes; the lemon cups are decorated with shiso leaves and salmon roe, and the fish is arranged in decorative patterns. For sheer beauty as well as an opportunity to sample some of the restaurant's best offerings, the special dinner that comes in a series of handsome lacquered containers is recommended. Most of the fried dishes, including a white fish vegetable roll, a vegetable and shrimp tempura and seafood dumplings, were all delicately fried, tender and free of excess oil. The avocado chunks, however, are not appropriate for tempura: they become mushy. The service is pleasant, if amateurish. The kitchen has not yet learned how to time the food so that those who are dining together can actually eat together. And some dishes that should be steaming hot, like the soups and one-pot meals, are lukewarm. The quality of the meat for the teriyaki also needs to be upgraded. While some of the salads are made with fresh ingredients, a few have been sitting around too long. One, the nutamiso vegetable cocktail, tasted musty. The Japanese do not eat desserts in the Western sense, so they are better off not trying to accommodate the American palate. Gyosai serves artfully arranged fresh fruit, but except for that it is not a restaurant to come to for dessert. If you stick to the Texas or New Mexican version of Mexican food at Santa Fe and price is no object, you will find a number of dishes to please you at this Manhattan interpretation of a chic Southwestern restaurant. There is a strong visual appeal of muted desert colors in the high-ceilinged dining room with its deep-peach-colored walls, white shutters, Indian baskets and weavings and dramatic paintings of the Southwest. And the cacaphony of the usual Upper West Side bar scene as you enter, where bicyclists, their front tires in tow, rub shoulders with men in three-piece suits, seems to fade in the dining area. But the attractiveness of Sante Fe does not entirely compensate for the food, which can be flavorful, but was, over a four-month period, inconsistent. Among the dishes that could be counted on: the nachos richly laden with runny cheese and just a hint of fire from the jalapena; deliciously soft quesadillas, flour tortillas filled with cheese, topped with a bit of acceptable guacamole and hot pepper; tender, perfectly cooked lamb chops that had been suffused with the flavor of a good charcoal fire. The frozen margaritas had plenty of tequila. The salsa that accompanied the corn chips (sometimes oversalted) combined both sweet and hot peppers that provided it with a complexity not found in the usual salsa. In turn, it added character to a guacamole that was undistinguished without it. The colorful medley of vegetables that accompanied many of the main dishes was always crisply cooked and the piquant relish of corn, onion and green and red peppers provided a lovely foil for the richness of the Mexican food. The chances that the rest of the dishes will be properly executed are not always in favor of the diner. On two occasions, the chili rellenos were watery: on the most recent visit, they were not. Once, the seviche was sour with too much lime juice and the scallops, sitting in the marinade too long, were ''overcooked''; another time, the balance of the lime and fresh coriander was perfect. Sometimes, the chicken used to fill the soft tacos, enchiladas and chimichangas (deep-fried, stuffed flour tortillas) was stick-to-the-roof-of-the-mouth dry; on other occasions it was acceptably moist. Twice the ground beef used in the combination plates tasted as though it had come from a can, but the last time it was fresh if not exceptional. The fish was always watery. The desserts - decidedly not Southwestern - have also been uneven. The lemon mousse can have the consistency of cornstarch pudding or be ethereal. The apple crisp has been, on different occasions, unnappetizingly pasty and appropriately crunchy. However, the obligatory chocolate truffle cake - the one dessert not made on the premises - was always appropriately deep, dark and fudgy. (Diner's Journal appears on page C22).

439-> STEEL AND PATIENCE
To the Business Editor: In their Oct. 16 article, (''The Only Source of 'Patient Capital' ''), the authors argue that the Federal Government should directly invest in promising new industries because ''very few investors or managers look beyond one year.'' Fortunately, ''patient capital'' is far more abundant in the private marketplace than these gentlemen suggest. United States investors do indeed look beyond one year when investing in growth industries, and they have generously funded companies that will not produce sizable profits for half a decade or more. Consider the biotechnology industry: Investors showered it with over $500 million in capital between 1976 and 1981, even though substantial profits appeared unlikely before the later 1980's. In July of 1981 the stock Genentech - already down sharply from its highs of the previous year - was selling at 22 times estimated 1985 earnings. And in the two years since then, capital has continued to pour into the industry from a variety of sources: venture capitalists, public stock offerings, large pharmaceutical companies, and research and development partnerships. Given the availability of ''patient capital'' on Wall Street and the gargantuan size of the Federal deficit, it seems unwise to saddle the Government with yet another costly responsibility. Rather than forge into the unfamiliar realm of corporate finance, Washington should reduce spending in order to shrink the deficit. By easing upward pressure on interest rates, this policy would greatly assist small growth companies. THOMAS N. DOERFLINGER New York, Oct. 18

The Exxon Corporation, the nation's largest producer of natural gas, has gone to court to try to make the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation fulfill 80 contracts for the purchase of natural gas. Exxon filed the suit Wednesday in Federal District Court in Lafayette, La. Columbia notified Exxon in April that it was unilaterally reducing the price and volume of gas to be purchased under the contracts, according to the suit. It said Columbia bought about 500 million cubic feet of gas a day from Exxon in 1982.

441-> LONG ISLANDERS; FILM BUFF NOW PRODUCER
''IWAS a fanatic moviegoer as a kid,'' said Michael Phillips. ''I used to spend my entire allowance every week on going to the movies.'' But Michael Phillips, who grew up in Roslyn, where his parents, Lawrence and Shirley, and his younger brother, Mark, still live, never thought he would grow up to be a movie producer, much less an Academy Award-winning producer - for ''The Sting.'' ''I don't think many people aspire to be producers,'' he said during a break from the filming in New York of his latest movie, which bears the tentative title ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' and stars Matt Dillon in the story of a young man's coming of age in 1963. In fact, during his years at Dartmouth after his graduation in 1961 from Roslyn High School, when Mr. Phillips ''had the first glimmer of an idea of what I'd be doing,'' his thoughts turned to Wall Street. He said, ''I fell in love with the stock market,'' where he and two friends turned a $300 stake into $30,000. He graduated in 1965 with a B.A. and entered New York University Law School, focusing on business-related courses while earning a J.D. in 1968. Then it was off to Wall Street as an analyst. ''And the only thing that went wrong was that the market turned sour two weeks after I joined this firm,'' he said, ''and I discovered that my plan to get rich was not going to proceed according to plan.'' Mr. Phillips had been married since 1966 to the former Julia Miller of Great Neck (they have since divorced), who was in the movie business as a story editor. The Phillipses became friendly with Tony Bill, an actor and aspiring producer who has also become a director. ''And we began to talk about doing something together,'' Mr. Phillips said. The three pooled their resources - $2,500 from the Philllipses and $1,000 from Mr. Bill - and found an unemployed writer, a graduate of a film school who was selling vacuum cleaners. His name was David Ward. ''And David was trying to get someone to pay him to write a movie about confidence men,'' Mr. Phillips said. The Bill-Phillips combine offered him $3,500 for the script of ''Steelyard Blues,'' which had already been written, and for an option on the unwritten script about the confidence men. ''Steelyard Blues,'' released in January 1973, was a failure. The film about the confidence men, ''The Sting,'' won seven Academy Awards in 1974, including best picture. Mr. Phillips went on to produce such films as ''Taxi Driver,'' ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ''Heartbeeps'' and ''The Big Bus.'' ''Being an independent movie producer,'' he said, ''is kind of like a traveling medicine show. You set up your tent for a year and you fold it, and then you're starting from scratch again. So a lot of time is spent getting the ball rolling. ''The bulk of the producer's time is spent trying to get momentum into his projects. That's the part of producing I like least. I would like to solve that and create a structure that would have some kind of continuity - organizing myself in a business fashion in a way that allows for continuity in film making instead of these collapsible enterprises.'' Now living in Los Angeles, the 40-year-old Mr. Phillips, who had one daughter by his first marriage, also has a daughter by his second, to a Norwegian-born producer, Liv Faret. While attending to the filming of ''Sweet Georgia Brown,'' he was also planning his next project - ''Wilderness,'' starring Richard Dreyfuss and directed by John Frankenheimer, which Mr. Phillips described as an action-thriller in the tradition of ''Deliverance'' and ''Straw Dogs.'' Looking back over his career, Mr. Phillips said, ''I feel very lucky.''

442-> HOME APPLIANCES: ADVICE FOR OWNERS
Today's refrigerators do more than chill - they spit out ice cubes at an alarming rate, make chocolate ice cream and keep lettuce leaves crisp in a plastic container designed for just that purpose. Like other major appliances, they are complicated machines that require proper care. As a result, at least two makers of home appliances have broadened their user-care literature. Instruction books are printed in both English and Spanish, and safety guides for children have been prepared in cartoon and coloring book format. ''Solucion de Problemas'' and ''Precauciones Importantes'' are two chapter headings in a series of six user manuals that can be obtained from General Electric. The Spanish- language booklets apply to several models of refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers and microwave ovens with both dial and touch control. ''We're not able to make a specific manual in Spanish for every product model,'' said Jack Cowan of G.E.'s consumer services division. ''But we did want something to answer general sorts of questions. The new Spanish-language manuals are compilations of information.'' Included are tips on basic appliance safety as well as instructions on how to care for special appliance features such as lint filters in washing machines and refrigerator ice dispensers. The books can be obtained at no charge by calling the toll-free G.E. answer center at 1-800-626-2000, where questions can be answered in Spanish between 8 A.M and 5 P.M. Eastern time and in English 24 hours a day. The Spanish use and care manuals are also available from local G.E. dealers. Whirlpool also publishes consumer information in Spanish. In April 1982, the company began distributing brochures for Spanish-speaking consumers including a microwave cookbook, an energy-saving tip book and a guide to selecting home appliances. Whirlpool has also published two coloring books with captions in Spanish and English with information on home appliance use. For example, a connect-a-dot picture of a thermostat appears on one page of the Whirlpool ''Saving Energy'' coloring book with the following caption: ''Este es un termostato. Es el control que indica a cual grado calentar la agua caliente. Como los tanques de agua caliente usan mucha energia, el papa de Jaime bajo el termostato a 140 grados.'' Next to this caption is the following one in English: ''This is a thermostat. It is the control that tells how warm to heat the hot water. Since hot water tanks use a lot of energy, Jim's dad turned the thermostat down to 140 degrees.'' In the ''Color Me Safe'' coloring book, children can color large ink drawings of fire extinguishers, oven ranges and home electrical outlets. And for teen-agers, there is a cartoon guide to proper laundry care. All these publications are free and can be obtained by writing to Appliance Information Service, Whirlpool Corporation, Benton Harbor, Mich., 49022. Like G.E., Whirlpool has 24- hour lines to answer consumers' questions, though only in English, about simple repairs and the use and care of products. The Whirlpool toll- free line is 1-800-253-1301.

444-> Steel and Patience
To the Business Editor: In their Oct. 9 article, ''The Fallacy of a Modern-Day R.F.C.,'' Roger C. Altman and Jeffrey E. Garten cite the steel industry as an example of a Federal aid program failing to restructure an industry. While we may not oppose their central argument, I wish to correct their misstatements concerning the steel industry. Briefly, the writers argue that the ''aid package'' for steel - consisting of ''cost-saving abatements of pollution regulations, import quotas and depreciation allowances'' - failed because there was no quid pro quo demanded of the industry, as in the case of Chrysler and New York City. In fact, the individual Government measures on steel which were attempted over several years failed because they were inherently inadequate. * ''Cost-saving abatements of pollution regulations.'' The so-called steel stretch-out amendment to the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1981. It did not provide a reduction in the industry's expenditures, but a stretch-out for an additional three years. Few companies were eligible to take advantage of the amendment. The financial effect on the industry was negligible. * ''Import quotas.'' There were no import quotas. The writers apparently refer to the trigger price mechanism, which was presumably designed to give the steel industry the benefits to which it is entitled under the trade laws which are applicable to all United States industries, i.e., elimination of dumped imports from the marketplace. The trigger price mechanism was an abysmal failure. It was introduced in 1978, and by 1981 imports had reached the highest market-penetration level on record. Because of the failure of the trigger price mechanism, the industry had to resort again to the antidumping and antisubsidy laws. * ''Depreciation allowances.'' These were hardly the result of some quick decision on the part of the Carter Administration. The steel industry had been urging the Treasury Department for about 10 years to acknowledge that depreciation based on the physical life expectancy of a piece of equipment was the wrong approach; that instead, the depreciable life should be based on technological obsolescence. Trimmed by the Carter Administration from 18 years to 15, the industry's depreciation guideline was still one of the highest in the I.R.S. Code. Financial benefits were negligible, since many companies had net operating loss carry-backs from the $3.2 billion of net losses in 1982 which wiped out any advantage obtained from the modestly accelerated depreciation for steel to which Mr. Altman referred. Even today with five-year depreciation for all industries, steel can't benefit from it, due to the enormous losses generated in 1982 and 1983. The steel industry has not sought and does not now seek Federal funds, bailouts, loans, subsidies or other financial assistance comparable to the Chrysler and New York arrangements. To have cited the industry as a recipient of significant Federal aid in this context was a basic error. ROBERT B.

445-> THE HARD CODE OF THE SUPERCHIEFS
-- While reading Barbara Gelb's insightful article on the high command of the New York City Police Department, it struck me that if police abuse were controlled as assiduously as police corruption from within the department, there would be no need for Congressional hearings and no embarrassment for Mayor Koch's administration. The lesson in Mrs. Gelb's article is that the strictest form of supervisory responsibility is the only effective means of controlling both vices.

446-> MARCOS BEGINS A NEW INQUIRY ON FOE'S DEATH
President Ferdinand E. Marcos announced today that a new commission would investigate the killing of the opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino Jr. The panel will replace the five-member presidential commission that resigned on Monday, citing widespread doubts that its inquiry would be impartial. The presidential palace announced that two of the new panel's members would be appointed by Parliament and that three to five others would be named from among people recommended by ''various sectors of society, such as legal associations, civic and service organizations and the business, education, student and labor sectors.'' The President's action was immediately criticized by the opposition leader Jose Diokno, who said that as long as Mr. Marcos was President there could be no impartial inquiry. Parliament, which would appoint two members of the panel under the decree, is overwhelmingly controlled by the President's supporters. Foreign Minister Present Mr. Marcos signed the decree on television, in the presence of Government members including Arturo Tolentino, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Tolentino said on Monday that he could not accept a presidential appointment as chairman of the original commission because the panel lacked independence and apparently had prejudged the case it was investigating. Mr. Tolentino said in an interview today that the commission envisaged in today's presidential announcement was ''a sort of compromise'' between the body he had recommended, composed only of nominees of the private sector, and one over which the Marcos Government would have more control. In his television appearance today, President Marcos also formally abolished the original commission. In a letter to the four former justices on it, he said that their resignation Monday had been compelled by the ''present morbid atmosphere.'' Ever since they resigned, their staff members have criticized the Government for the reports it had presented to the commission on the death of Mr. Aquino, who was shot on Aug. 21 soon after arriving at the airport from three years of voluntary exile in the United States. One such document, which was submitted to the commission on Sept. 20, was described by a staff lawyer as substantially ''inconsistent with the technical reports'' that other Government investigators had compiled a few days after Mr. Aquino's death. ''I don't believe that report,'' the lawyer, Amadeo Seno, said of the 11-page document bearing the signature of Maj. Gen. Prospero A. Olivas, who had been named by Mr. Marcos to conduct the Government's investigation. The report said a civilian named Rolando Galman had been proved ''scientifically'' and ''indubitably'' to have killed Mr. Aquino. Mr. Galman, officially identified as a hired assassin with leftist connections, was shot dead at the airport by security guards. According to Mr. Seno and other commission sources including its general counsel, Rustico V. Nazareno, the original commission's staff had been hampered by what was described as limited distribution of police and military findings. The sources complained also about the lack of funds with which the panel might have been able to engage independent investigators. The report said that Mr. Aquino, seconds before his death, had been followed down an airport stairway by four soldiers, including an intelligence operative who was evidently wearing civilian clothes. Mr. Aquino was shot in the back of the head from a distance of between 6 and 18 inches, according to the report, immediately after he reached the bottom of the stairs. Opposition leaders have contended that Mr. Aquino must have been shot by someone on the stairs. But military investigators have said he was shot by an assailant - Mr. Galman - who had dashed out from behind the stairs Mr. Aquino was descending. Dr. Bienventio Munoz, a police doctor, who had performed an autopsy on the body of Mr. Aquino, testified before the original commission on Sept. 7 that Mr. Aquino must have been looking upward at the time. That, the doctor said, would explain how the bullet had emerged through Mr. Aquino's chin. The Olivas report leaves many questions unanswered. For example, of the four military guards who are said to have followed Mr. Aquino down the stairs, only two are mentioned as having witnessed the killing. One, Constable First Class Rogelio Moreno of the paramilitary Philippine Constabulary, is never mentioned again in the report. The other was identified as Sgt. Filomeno Miranda, ''an intelligence operative.'' He ''ran for cover,'' the report says, when the shooting started. Constitutional Amendments MANILA, Oct. 14 (AP) - President Marcos also announced plans today for new constitutional amendments providing for parliamentary elections by district rather than by region. These were apparently a concession to critics who said current laws gave an edge to the Government party, the New Society Party, over the poorer opposition groups, since it costs more to campaign in the larger areas.

448-> IN THE 2 BERLINS, A LITTLE UNDERGROUND COEXISTENCE; The Talk of Berlin
There are two subways that daily whisk commuters from one corner of West Berlin under a slice of East Berlin and then back out again, to what is sometimes called the free world. On the darkened East Berlin stretch of tunnel, the old U-Bahn stops are bricked up and guarded by grim-looking representatives of the East German Volkspolizei, or people's police. Joshing and flirting in the rattling subway, West Berlin teen-agers make this eerie ideological passage without any perceptible unease. At the Friedrichstrasse stop, which is kept open on the Communist side, pensioners and free-world derelicts alight, stock up on cigarettes and whisky at a hard-currency, duty-free shop run by the East Germans and then shuttle back to West Berlin. Others may also get off at Friedrichstrasse and, for $12, the amount a visitor is required to exchange daily into East German currency, make a day visit to dowdy, hushed East Berlin. But surprisingly few of them are West Berliners, who often tell you that they do not see the forbidding gray wall that surrounds their divided city. ''You can find many Berliners who have not been to East Berlin in the last 25 years, even if they could go,'' said Hartmut Jackel, a professor of political science at the Free University in West Berlin. ''There are tens of thousands of Berliners who live as if the G.D.R.'' - the initials for East Germany - ''didn't exist.'' The West Berliners' insouciance is instructive when set against warnings out of Moscow that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's willingness to accept new American missiles on West German territory is a step toward a new cold war. West Berliners, who know from the 1948 Soviet blockade and American airlift what cold war is about, clearly do not believe those threats. ''I don't want to say that we will be excluded from the overall weather situation,'' said Richard von Weizsacker, the city's Christian Democratic Mayor. ''But I think it will not be the politics of the Soviet Union to bring NATO together or to reunite the peace movement with their governments.'' A new Berlin crisis, he suggested, would do just that. Unlike many of the two million West Berliners, Mr. von Weizsacker often travels to the other side, where he is instantly recognized since about 70 percent of all East Germans watch West German television. He prides himself on his good, private contacts with members of the East German Politburo, which he uses to push favorite projects like a joint electricity association for the divided city. At the end of July Franz Josef Strauss, the Christian Democratic leader of Bavaria, who is normally described as a hard-liner on East-West matters, is supposed to have a seemingly casual encounter with Erich Honecker, the East German leader, to discuss a $397 million loan put together by Bavarian banks. Despite the missile confrontation, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Strauss seem persuaded that Mr. Honecker is going to lower the obligatory bordercrossing fee for West Germans because of the loan. Like the subversive seduction of West German television, the loan is intended to bind East Germans into a certain dependence on the West. ''There are at most 3 to 5 percent Communists over there,'' Mayor von Weizsacker said. ''And active anti-Communists - there are also about 3 percent. And most of the rest are private people, looking for their niche. ''They feel themselves to be German,'' the Mayor said. ''But they don't want to be reproached for being East German. In a sense they are even proud of a system they don't like.'' For West Berliners who do cross over for a visit, East Berlin, in all its shabbiness, has some perversely sophisticated appeal. Even from a distance, denizens of West Berlin's thriving counterculture find deliriously funny the midday East German television program that shows hard-working citizens awarded medals for increasing productivity in factories or at collective farms. ''I like the warmth of the people over there,'' said Marianne Ensenzberger, a singer who is making a low-budget film in which she plays a vampire whose bite liberates conventional middle-class Germans. ''They've got that old friendship feeling that we've lost. It's very private, but it's very, very nice.'' ''When I get there,'' said Mrs. Ensenzberger, who has close friends in East Berlin, ''I think I talk too fast, I move too fast. I'm too hectic.'' She said she had noticed other nuances in East Berlin discotheques. ''They dance more in patterns,'' she said. ''Here people just jump. There it's still a dance.'' She said that on a recent visit an unsmiling East German policeman tried to make her take off a button that read ''Don't point your finger at the guitar player.'' ''He totally freaked out,'' she said, exploding in laughter. ''He thought it was political.'' Trying to cash in on a good thing, the East Berlin authorities launched a rock group a few years ago called the Pudis, and the band won a certain following in West Berlin and West Germany, if only because of its political novelty. But the Pudis have since been swept aside by ''the new German wave'' - an explosion of West German rock - and Hans Georg Sausse, a young cultural writer, said insiders now dismissed the East German sound as ''a little like a stupid Pink Floyd.'' Over a mineral water at the Einstein cafe, Mr. Sausse said covering East Berlin's counterculture scene posed ethical problems for West Berlin journalists. A while back, he said, his magazine, Tip, reported on the emergence of a small number of East Berlin punk rockers. ''After that,'' he said, ''they were all arrested.'' Like a figure in a Kafka novel, Roland Jahn, a 29-year-old East German from Jena, was determined to do nothing illegal. But, at the same time, he wanted to protest the creeping militarization of East German life and its stultifying constraints. Thrown out of a university in 1977 for supporting Wolf Biermann, an exiled protest singer, Mr. Jahn began staging his own rebellion. He once could be found riding around Jena on his bicycle with the Polish flag in support of the Solidarity movement. Earlier, after a like-minded friend had died in police custody, Mr. Jahn placed a memorial advertisement in a Jena newspaper and then pasted copies of it all over the city. At solemn May Day ceremonies one year, he appeared with a drooping Stalin moustache on one side of his face and a stubby Hitler moustache and slicked-down forelock on the other. He innocently insisted that he looked like Maxim Gorky and Charlie Chaplin, but was jailed for seven months anyway. Last month, weary of his impish presence, the East German secret police put Mr. Jahn on a train to Munich. He now lives in West Berlin and insists he wants to go home. ''You sit there in solitary confinement,'' Mr. Jahn said. ''They acknowledge that you haven't done anything illegal, but they say they have the power to hold you. 'How do you see your future?' they ask. 'You have none here.' ''

The Electronic Mail Corporation of America said it had completed a $15 million zero-coupon Eurobond financing and the simultaneous repurchase of 400,000 shares of its common stock. The bonds, priced at 98.5 and due in 1990, are convertible into common stock at $11.90 a share after 90 days from the closing. The company said it had used half of the proceeds to purchase $15 million face value of zero-coupon bonds issued by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. These bonds have been placed in escrow with Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Should the new E.M.C.A. bondholders choose not to convert their bonds into stock, $15 million in cash will be available to the company in 1990 with which to redeem the new Eurobonds at face value.

453-> Bauer Leads 6-Day Run
Siegfried Bauer of New Zealand covered 363 miles in the first 4 days of the New York Six-Day Run, but he had to alter his strategy in order to maintain his first-place position over Colin Dixon of England and Jean Giles Boussiquet, a Frenchman. As of yesterday afternoon at 4:12, the point during this event at which one long day turns into the next, Dixon had covered 327 miles on the Downing Stadium track on Randalls Island. Boussiquet was third with 320 miles. Lorna Richey of Toledo, Ohio, had covered 259 miles and led the women. One runner, George Gardiner, from Hope Valley, R.I., was forced to leave the race to have his lower right leg X-rayed for a possible stress fracture. It was doubtful that he would return. When Bauer, 41, retired to his tent at 2 o'clock Friday morning, he held an advantage of 30 miles over Dixon. Bauer followed his usual routine before bedtime. First, he swallowed half a sleeping pill to calm his nerves and then he received a deep massage before falling off to sleep. Upon awakening two and one-half hours later, he discovered that Dixon had closed to within 11 miles. Bauer immediately abandoned his weeklong ritual of taking frequent rests. He ran practically nonstop for the next 12 hours and regained his wide margin.

455-> DELOREAN GRANTED DELAY IN HIS TRIAL
John Z. DeLorean today was granted a two-month postponement of his trial on Federal charges that he promoted a scheme to smuggle $24 million in cocaine. Federal District Judge Robert M. Takasugi granted the delay on a request by Mr. DeLorean's lawyers, who argued in part that they needed additional time to substantiate their theory that the Governments of Britain and the United States had conspired to bring about Mr. DeLorean's downfall as head of the DeLorean Motor Company. The judge set Oct. 4 as the new trial date for Mr. DeLorean, 58 years old, and a co-defendant, Steven Arrington, a 34-year-old San Diego man who was called the courier in the drug trafficking. Howard Weitzman, one of the DeLorean lawyers, argued for the postponement at a hearing that neither Mr. DeLorean nor his wife, Cristina, attended. Mr. Weitzman said his client's case also had been adversely affected by the change to a guilty plea 10 days ago of William Morgan Hetrick, who was indicted as the procurer of Colombian cocaine for the scheme. Mr. Hetrick, a 51-year-old pilot and small-aircraft operator, agreed to testify for the prosecution if asked to do so. DeLorean Explained Defense Mr. DeLorean, who left a top executive post at General Motors and founded the DeLorean Motor Company Ltd. to make sports cars in Northern Ireland, is free on $5 million bail. He has said in his own defense, in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, that he thought he was entering a transaction with legitimate investors who would help him save the financially ailing company, but that the ''investors'' turned out to be undercover Government agents who trapped him, including handing him a bundle of cocaine. The Government has said it has videotapes of Mr. DeLorean holding the cocaine and has promised to enter them as key evidence. A motion filed by Mr. DeLorean's lawyers last Friday asked for the trial delay to investigate further a theory that the Britain's Conservative Party Government, headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, plotted with the United States authorities to destroy Mr. DeLorean and his business.

457-> COLLEGE SURVEY FINDS END TO DECLINE IN STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT
A survey of college officials aroundthe country indicates that academic achievement has stopped its decline of the 1960's and 1970's and may even be improving, particularly among students majoring in engineering and science. The survey, whose findings have not been formally released, was conducted last year by the American Council on Education for the Federal Government's National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. About 60 percent of the deans and other academic officials believe that achievement has held steady and that there has been no significant change in the quality of students overthe last five years, according to summaries of the findings by the National Science Foundation. Furthermore, ''significant improvement'' in the quality of undergraduate students was reported by 25 percent of the academics in science and engineering and 16 percent of those in the humanities. The survey was based on the responses of academics at 486 undergraduate and 383 graduate schools of more than 500 of the nation's 2,000 four-year institutions. ''Every year we make our courses more rigorous, and every year the students keep up,'' Joseph F. Traub, chairman of the computer science department at Columbia University, said when asked to comment on the survey. Another recent indication that the long drop in the ability of college-bound students has finally played itself out was that in 1980 a 17-year decline in scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test stabilized. The study of college academics does not address the quality of students who do not reach four-year colleges, and it is possible the upgrading of college students has been accomplished, in part, by diverting the less-prepared applicants to two-year institutions. Education as Job Training The survey concludes that many of the best high school graduates are now enrolling in engineering and science programs, largely because they seem to offer better career opportunities. ''People believe that you find jobs more readily, at least jobs that are well paying, if you have some math and science background,'' said William E. Mastrocola, who has taught mathematics for 21 years at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y., which has seen a large increase in the number of mathematics majors. Gail Merrell of Plainview, L.I., a senior at the State University of New York at Albany, had a simple explanation for her decision to major in computer science: ''More than anything else, I wanted to come out of college with vocational training.'' Dr. George Beakley, associate dean of engineering at Arizona State University, said his students ''are better in that they graduate higher in their high school graduating class or have higher entrance test scores. If that is the definition of better, then they are definitely better.'' The federally sponsored survey and an earlier study by Lyle V. Jones, dean of the graduate school of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, indicated engineering and the sciences were not as affected by academic deterioration. The Jones study found that Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of students entering those fields did not decline as much as the scores of nonscience majors, perhaps because of an inclination of less able students to major in softer fields requiring less grounding in mathematics and science. Even at Columbia University, where entrance requirements are high for undergraduates in all fields, Jeanella Nelson, a 20-year-old mechanical engineering major from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, said in comparing her classmates with students majoring in the liberal arts, ''Most people at the engineering school can transfer to Columbia College and do well, but not everyone from the college could transfer into engineering and do well.'' 'Stronger Test Scores' ''We are getting students with higher S.A.T. scores than five years ago,'' said Dr. William Rey, dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Alabama. ''The students coming into engineering have stronger test scores than students in other schools. They're scoring higher in math than they used to. They are either taking more or better math courses in high school.'' The survey indicates that the attraction of engineering and the sciences seems to be most pronounced at the big state universities that confer the greatest number of degrees. ''A majority of the officials of the 100 largest baccalaureate-producing institutions and all public and all doctorate-granting institutions reported a shift of the most able undergraduate students toward science and engineering fields; almost none reported a shift away from science and engineering fields,'' the survey found. But not all institutions have experienced such a trend, and officials at many say outstanding students are still as likely to major in the humanities as in engineering and science. ''Our traditions are in the humanities - they are not scientific,'' said Howard Rothstein, biology chairman at Fordham University, which has campuses in the Bronx and Manhattan. Moreover, engineering and the sciences are not the only fields appealing to the better students. John Zich of the University of Illinois, who earned a place on the dean's list as a civil engineering major, has now transferred into photography as a senior. ''I think a lot of people over there,'' Mr. Zich said with a nod toward the engineering complex, ''are missing out on a lot of social science and humanities courses.''

458-> CAMERA; NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN INSTANT PHOTOGRAPHY
Instant photography has been from its very beginning a minor miracle that still amazes people. To take a picture and have it develop before your eyes in broad daylight without the need for using messy chemicals or requiring a dark room - and thus be able to see the finished photo in 60 seconds - represented a quantum leap forward in the technology of image making. But despite these great advantages, there have been some drawbacks, especially in the early years. Color quality tended to vary from one pack of film to another and in the beginning the pictures had to be coated with a protective solution that was messy to apply - but essential for the permanence of the picture. Fortunately, Polaroid and Kodak, the only two companies engaged in this field, have continued to improve their products. Colors are truer, quality control is better and a new wave of products has appeared that makes the future seem even brighter for this fascinating area of photography. One new introduction from Polaroid is its type 612 black-and-white Land film for ultra high speed instrument recording. This may well be the world's fastest film with an ISO of 20,000! Although designed to record low-level light sources such as oscilloscope traces on a cathode ray screen, the film may be used to also photograph conventional subject matter. It will produce high contrast effects that transform the ordinary into the unusual, so a little experimentation will yield rewards in the form of challenging and fascinating excursions into creativity. For example, using this film I have photographed a scene in my garden at night, with only a little light filtering out through the window. I used an exposure of 1/60 second at f/2.8. A test picture in the brightly lit kitchen required an exposure of 1/500 at f/11. The images are grainy and the contrast very high, but the results are quite dramatic. The film comes in a 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 film pack that fits a Polaroid accessory back which, in turn, adapts to a standard 4x5 Graflok back common to many large format cameras. Two other new films from Polaroid, both having much slower speed but higher quality, are the Time Zero Color films. One is Type 778 (for Polaroid SX-70 type cameras). It has an ISO of 150 and is balanced for daylight and electronic flash. The other is Type 779 (also for SX-70 type cameras), which has an ISO of 640 and also is balanced for daylight and electronic flash. Both take a 3 1/8 x 3 1/8-inch picture, and both color films exhibit extraordinary color quality and a batch-to-batch uniformity that makes them particularly dependable for serious users. Polaroid lists these products in their Industrial, Scientific, Professional and Medical Applications catalogue, but despite the professional listing they may be used by amateurs as well as professionals in most Polaroid cameras. Many dealers do not stock it, but they can order it for you. The price of these superior films is about the same as other instant color films that are designed for use in SX-70 cameras. Polaroid has also produced two- large format (3 1/4x4 1/4) color films in pack form that have a multiplicity of uses. The first is Polacolor 2, type 668 with an ISO of 80 and a zippier contrast than its companion, Polacolor ER, type 669, which has an ISO of ISO, with medium contrast and extended dynamic range. Both have an actual picture area of 2 7/8 x 3 3/4 inches. Although both films have been designed for in-camera use, they are ideal for making color prints from 35mm slides in the Polaroid PolaPrinter. When making color prints from 35mm slides there is usually an unavoidable build-up in contrast in the finished print that sometimes blocks up the highlight areas of the picture and causes loss of important highlight and shadow detail with a tendency to degrade the appearance of the finished print. However, the type 669 Polacolor ER film, with its lessened contrast and extended dynamic range, will go a long way towards producing more satisfactory results. On the other hand, slides that are inherently low in contrast will print better on the type 668, Polacolor 2. In short, both films can be used much as different grades of paper are used in black-and-white enlarging. For pictures of people, the 669 will yield better skin tones, but on cloudy, overcast days the 668 will produce better results. Both films are also available in 4x5-inch format, with the Polacolor 2 type 58 being equal to Polacolor 2, type 668; and the Polacolor ER, type 59 being the same as Polacolor ER type 669. The 4x5 films must be used in an accessory 4x5 Polaroid film back which fits the standard 4x5 Graflok back. For those who have been faced with the problem of making 35mm black- and-white slides for projection, there is now a simple solution to what has always been a complicated and difficult problem. Polaroid has just begun to market two 35mm black-and-white slide films that will fit any 35mm camera - Polapan CT and Polapan HC. For the first time, these eliminate the need to use Polaroid film backs or cameras. However, both these films require the use of the Polaroid Auto-Processor to develop the pictures. The necessary chemicals (sealed in a plastic container) come packed with each roll of film. The films may be used either to produce direct positive slides from any subject; or to make photographic copies of any photograph - original photographs or those published in a newspaper or magazine. The most versatile of the two new films is the Polapan CT (for Continuous Tone). It has an ISO of 125, possesses excellent fine grain charateristics, good highlight and shadow detail, and exhibits a long range of tonalities in the gray areas. Polapan HC (for High Contrast) has an ISO of 400 and, perhaps because of the greater speed, shows considerably more grain than the other. It is more suited to pictures of oscilloscope screens, faded newspaper clippings and subject matter of very low contrast. Using the Polaroid AutoProcessor with these films is quite simple. The device is small enough (4 x 4 x 9 inches) to sit conveniently atop a table or desk and requires neither darkroom or temperature control to develop the films. In use, the small chemical pack that comes with the film is inserted into the unit along with the film to be processed. Closing the lid and pressing a lever causes a release of the chemicals used for developing and starts the sequence. Turning a crank moves the film out of its light-tight cassette and into contact with the processing chemicals. After a 60 second wait the lever is pushed into the up position and the film cranked rapidly through the machine. The processor is then opened and the fully developed dry film is ready to be placed into plastic slide mounts. The entire developing process takes less than two minutes. Kodak has introduced a new instant film, called ''Trimprint,'' that attacks a long-standing problem which has plagued users of instant pictures. All films of this type retain the chemicals with the print inside a ''sandwich'' in back, so if you try to trim these prints to fit a wallet or small frame you may cause a release of some of the caustic chemicals that are enclosed in this ''sandwich.'' This can cause skin irritations and sometimes serious burns. The new ''Trimprint'' film prevents this because the film may be peeled away from its chemical pack after an hour's wait.

459-> Boat Sailing to Coast Found Crippled With Captain Dead
A sailboat that left Honolulu in October for a one-month trip to Newport, Ore., was found crippled Friday about 700 miles off San Francisco with her captain dead and the only other occupant exhausted, according to the Coast Guard. A Japanese freighter found the 27- foot twin-masted boat with both masts broken. The captain, Erwin Fitze, 65 years old, of Newport, an experienced seaman, was dead and His foster son, Jerry Ballard, 38, was in a state of exhaustion, the Coast Guard said. The boat was left adrift after Mr. Ballard and the body of Mr. Fitze were taken aboard the freighter, which was on they way to Tokyo. Mr. Fitze's cause of death has not been determined, according to the Coast Guard said.

460-> CHARISMATIC MANIPULATOR
BRECHT By Ronald Hayman. Illustrated. 423 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $24.95. EVERYBODY knows Bertolt Brecht - everybody and nobody. The sly face in the late photographs, partly hidden by the pudgy thumb and inescapable cigar, seems determined to give away very little. His plays, divided between distancing dramas designed to make the audience think and didactic stage lessons designed to make the audience believe, leave conflicting clues, behind which their author escapes. We know that Brecht was what we may call, rather simplistically, an antifascist; but, beyond an implacable hatred for Hitler, the precise place on the political spectrum at which he wanted to locate himself remains obscure. Even after embracing Communist causes, he left escape routes open. And the autobiographical jottings of his late years are little better than calculated bits of self-dramatization, presenting a young Brecht single-minded, consistent and responsible - none of which he was. Among the most celebrated playwrights and poets of the century, he remains one of the most elusive. The very abundance of divergent stories and appraisals that his entourage has left for us - by women who loved and men who admired him - is an obstacle to unriddling his mystery. And, as Ronald Hayman quite properly reminds us in his biography, Brecht started his quest for impenetrability early in life. As a schoolboy, he learned to write prose his authoritarian teachers found unobjectionable, even though his urge to be singular - his raw, irrepressible originality - sometimes wrestled down the self-protective devices. He was at once cautious and daring; as an adolescent during World War I, he could spout patriotic gush of a kind that he abhorred. The deft, privately contemptuous witness who so thoroughly misled the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947 that its chairman, J. Parnell Thomas, could praise him for being an exemplary witness - a significant and instructive episode Mr. Hayman rather hastily disposes of in a mere three pages - had had rich practice through the years. And it was not living under the Nazi tyranny that had first taught him. Such a duplicitous character requires a sober, well- informed guide, and in Mr. Hayman it has found one. Cool and generally competent (the author's most egregious slip is having Stefan Zweig make a speech in East Berlin in 1948, six years after his suicide in Brazil; he obviously had his brother, Arnold, in mind), - Mr. Hayman has tried to narrate Brecht's unsettled existence at such a brisk trot that his book appears rather shorter than it is. With good reason, he devotes a full fifth of the biography to Brecht's early years in Bavaria, sketching in his family roots, his hometown of Augsburg, his voracious reading and his precocious, no less voracious, sexuality. The Bertolt Brecht - magnetic, boorish, manipulative, promiscuous and irresistible - that actors, writers, composers, playwrights and the rest of his shifting troop of intimates would later encounter was already in place in late adolescence. Many men and women alike yielded to his charisma even as he used them, betrayed them and took over their ideas with an unabashed, appealing vitality and a gift for words that left them speechless. Fortunately Mr. Hayman, though impressed, is not overawed by his subject; Freud's warning that biographers are likely to fall in love with their subjects does not apply here. Mr. Hayman records Brecht's homoerotic strand and charts the bewildering gyrations and reversals of his sex life in a detached and laconic style that owes much to the master himself, lacking only Brecht's genius for language. WITH all its virtues, Mr. Hayman's life of Brecht is not definitive. He ably summarizes the plays, describes their premieres and notes their reception; he chronicles Brecht's complicated and exploitative love life and finds space for Brecht's esthetic and political theories. To judge from Mr. Hayman's acknowledgments, he has talked with as many surviving family members and friends as he could find, consulted numerous archives and interviewed Brecht's earlier biographers and commentators, including John Willett, Eric Bentley and Martin Esslin. But there is, at least for my taste, too little about the poetry, doubtless hard to discuss in a biography designed for a general public, and in a language foreign to the poetry at that. Still, Brecht was a great poet, and his verse, I suspect, will outlive his plays and his prose - a conjectural eventuality for which Mr. Hayman's biography offers no house room. Beyond that, it is striking how heavily he has depended on earlier literature, not merely about Brecht, but about his collaborators, including Ronald Sanders' lively biography of Kurt Weill. Mr. Hayman may have found this inescapable - the most informative reminiscences are bound to reappear in biography after biography, and Brecht's life, though adventurous and varied, falls into a few distinct, highly publicized segments. Still, rather more independence, rather more psychological exploration, would have helped to differentiate this life from rival versions. Perhaps the time has now come for a moratorium on Brecht biographies and for further imaginative inquiry into the Brecht phenomenon, including the sources of his almost magical and in some ways incomprehensible sway over his world.

461-> COAST BATTLE FOR WATER CONTINUES ON 2 FRONTS
Nearly a century after the City of Los Angeles outraged northern farmers by grabbing water sources nearly 300 miles away, the conflict continues on two fronts. The outcome could affect water rights throughout California, where water historically has been synonymous with wealth. One battlefront is Mono Lake, an ecological wonder just across the Sierra Nevada from Yosemite National Park and 350 miles north of Los Angeles. The million-year-old lake has been shrinking as the city of Los Angeles tapped its tributaries for 17 percent of the city's water supply. The California Supreme Court recently upheld the National Audubon Society's contention that environmental values deserve consideration along with water needs. The other battlefront is the 100-mile- long Owens Valley, immediately south of Mono Lake on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada. Early Violence Over Water In the early 1900's, the City of Los Angeles began buying up hundreds of square miles of farmland in the fertile valley just to get the water rights, and it built a 250-mile aqueduct to deliver the water. That system now constitutes 63 percent of the city's water supply. Valley residents contend that Los Angeles's drafts of water from the Owens River and natural underground reservoirs in the valley are rapidly turning the area into a dust bowl. From strong-arm tactics used earlier in the century, valley residents have turned to legislation. They have managed to have passed a succession of local ordinances aimed at taxing Los Angeles's landholdings and limiting water withdrawals. Currently, officials of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and officials of Inyo County in the Owens Valley are ironing out details of a five-year ''truce'' aimed at arriving at a longterm settlement of differences. Under the truce, lawsuits on both sides would be suspended while a joint committee negotiated an acceptable level of water withdrawal each year, and the city would provide various sorts of reparations for demonstrable environmental damage. Joint Study to Be Undertaken An agreement between Los Angeles and Inyo County was reached earlier this year for a $1.5 million study on the enviromental impacts of the water withdrawals. No such accord is in prospect on the Mono Lake dispute. The lake, covering 60 square miles, with no outlet, has become two and a half times as salty as the ocean. Yet it contains a teeming population of a rare brine shrimp, three-eighths of an inch long, which provides food for a large bird population. The lake is the main nesting area of the California gull and a major resting place for 70 other species of birds on their annual migrations. Five tributary streams on the eastern slope of the Sierras feed the lake. In 1940, the state gave the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the right to tap these tributaries. Since then, the lake has shrunk from 85 square miles to its present 60. A drop in the water level of 40 feet linked one of two large islands to the shore, allowing coyotes to decimate the gull rookeries. This and numerous other ecological impacts led the National Audubon Society and other environmental groups to sue in an effort to reduce the amount of water diverted. Los Angeles officials contended, in a response, that the state's 1940 grant of water rights was inviolable. Water interests throughout the state were shocked when the State Surpeme Court last February upheld the Audubon Society's contention that the common- law doctrine of ''public trust'' of natural resources superseded the appropriation of water rights of pioneer day. The United States Supreme Court declined to review the state court's ruling, so now the litigation over what the state court called ''a scenic and ecological treasure of national significance'' is expected to proceed.

463-> Dr. George O. Abell, 57, Dies; Observer of Galaxy Clusters
Dr. George O. Abell, an astronomer and cosmologist, died of a heart attack today at his home here. He was 57 years old. Dr. Abell, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles for 17 years, was best known for his observations of clusters and superclusters of galaxies, the largest masses of matter visible to astronomers. One of his discoveries, the Abell Galaxy, was for many years the largest known object in the universe. His ''Abell Catalogue of Clusters of Galaxies'' is a standard reference. He popularized astronomy through lectures, a BBC television series, ''Understanding Times and Space,'' and five books, including ''The Realm of Universe,'' published this week. He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and two sons, Anthony and Jonathan, all of Los Angeles.

465-> ESSAY; NATO AFTER GRENADA
In the U.S., our successful action blocking Cuba's takeover of Grenada has met with the approval of all but our most die-hard doves; in Europe, however, President Reagan's decision to prevent further Communist penetration of this hemisphere has met with disapproval from what we thought were our most reliable allies. In West Germany, protected by a third of a million American troops, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher announced, ''We would have advised against the intervention.'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl - who retained Mr. Genscher, the neutralist center-party leader, instead of replacing him with anti-Communist Franz Josef Strauss - did not direct his U.N. Ambassador to support the U.S. when Nicaragua led the General Assembly to demand our ''immediate withdrawal'' from Grenada. In France, Mr. Mitterrand's Government raised its eyebrows at our ''surprising'' action, then had its U.N. Security Council representative vote to deplore our ''flagrant violation of international law.'' In Great Britain, for whose claim to the Malvinas the U.S. risked the enmity of millions of Latin Americans, Prime Minister Thatcher huffed that we should not have used force ''to walk into other people's countries.'' The British then left the U.S. isolated in the Security Council. It may be that Elizabeth II, in her role as Queen of Grenada, could not pass on to the Prime Minister of Great Britain all she had been told about requests for rescue; still, the pique of Mrs. Thatcher at the United States for protecting its own citizens where the British lacked the power and the will was the unkindest cut of all. What does this chorus of denunciation from our European allies about an action the U.S. considers to have been in its vital security interest teach us about the Western alliance? Not, as doves here say, that our allies are right about American security; and not, as apologists for Euro-isolationism say, that West German and British conservatives need to placate their leftists with anti- American rhetoric so that they can deploy U.S.-made missiles. The lesson is that our NATO partners are interested exclusively in having the United States defend Europe and are resentful of any action the U.S. takes elsewhere to protect its own security. That obsessive self-concern is why Western Europeans grow furious at our aid to anti-Communist forces in Central America. The Euro-isolationists demand the right to be protected by American troops and America's nuclear umbrella while reserving the right to undermine American security everywhere else. That removes the ''mutual'' from mutual defense. In the 50's and 60's, we agreed that Europe was ''America's first line of defense,'' but that is ancient strategic history. Our first line is now our nuclear deterrent. In today's reality, American troops are no longer in Europe to help our Western allies turn back a Soviet invasion in a war limited to that continent; our men are there as hostages, to make certain that an attack would draw us into a nuclear war between superpowers, fought over Europe's head rather than on Europe's ground. We now know that on the one-way street known as the NATO alliance, the U.S. cannot depend on diplomatic support for our non-European moves from even the most conservative and hawkish politicians in power in London and Bonn. Europe's turning away, begun with the gas pipeline deal, has now escalated to diplomatic isolation. The anti-U.S.-Grenada reaction goes beyond the normal criticism within an alliance; it reveals a profound difference of strategy about the way Soviet expansionism should be countered, and calls for a reassessment of our outdated Europe-first defense. In arms control, the Soviet Union has long sought to split Europeans from the U.S.; we have resisted that mightily, which is what the cruise and Pershing deployment is all about. But Europe's Kohl and Thatcher, in lashing at the U.S. on our Central American defense, are showing the nervousness that comes from incipient weakness; they are signaling an accommodation to Soviet pressure. If that is the case, might we not think about applying jujitsu to the force of change? The time is coming for an independent European defense, with the U.S. offering for sale the latest intermediate missiles but not the rental of our troops. In that world, the U.S. could negotiate with the Soviet Union the control of strategic nuclear arms while the Europeans negotiated limitations on intermediate-range weapons. At the superpower Start talks, we would not bear the burden of Europe's missiles; General Rowney would stay and Paul Nitze could come home. ''Wayward sisters, depart in peace,'' Horace Greeley told the seceding states. As Western Europeans turn inward, the U.S. should wish them well and look to its own vital interests.

467-> Facility Begun to Turn Waste into Glass Logs
The Federal Government has begun construction here of a $1.3 billion facility to convert radioactive waste from nuclear weapons production into glass logs for permanent storage underground. ''Today's society must not leave future generations a legacy of waste,'' Gov. Dick Riley of South Carolina said Tuesday at a groundbreaking ceremony attended by 500 Federal and state officials at the Savannah River plant. The Governor hailed the new Defense Waste Processing Facility as the start of ''a new era of faith'' in the nation's energy policy. The Savannah River plant produces most of the plutonium and other materials for the nation's atomic weapons. For the past three decades, wastes from its operations have been stored as highly radioactive sludge in steel tanks. There are now about 30 million gallons of the waste. The new facility will mix it with borosilicate glass particles and heat the mixture so that the wastes are bound with the other materials into a solid black glass inside 10-foot-long steel cylinders. The cylinders will be shut with welded seals, blasted clean on the outside with more of the glassmaking substance and then stored at the Savannah River plant for shipment later to a permanent underground storage site still to be selected. E.I. du Pont Nemours and Co. operates the plant for the Federal government. Donald Hodel, Federal Secretary of Energy, said the glassification plant would be the nation's first and the largest in the world.

468-> FORUM ON ISSUES: GLENN'S RIGHT STUFF; News Analysis
In politics, as in sports and gambling, it is sometimes as important to be lucky as to be good. And Senator John Glenn's remarkable run of political luck continued Thursday night when the seven Democratic Presidential candidates made their first joint appearance. At the issues forum conducted by the New York Democratic State Committee, Mr. Glenn seemed to wander when he was asked complicated questions on immigration and economic policy. But then James David Barber, author and political scientist, challenged the Senator's political credentials by likening his space flight in 1962, when he became the first American in orbit, to such publicity stunts as Evel Knievel's attempt in 1974 to vault the Snake River canyon on a rocket-propelled motorcycle. Bristling at the question's implied insult, Mr. Glenn snapped that his space mission ''accomplished a great deal for the country and the world.'' Then he used the opening to dispute the notion that he is a shallow ''celluloid candidate'' campaigning on celebrity rather than substance. ''As far as the celluloid charge,'' Senator Glenn said to a warm response, ''I wasn't doing 'Hell Cats of the Navy' on a movie lot when I went through 149 missions,'' referring to an old Ronald Reagan film. For those who know Mr. Glenn's political history, the moment invited comparison with his debating victory over Howard M. Metzenbaum in their 1974 Senate race. When Mr. Metzenbaum suggested that Mr. Glenn, as a military officer and astronaut, had ''never held a job,'' Mr. Glenn blew him away with a blast of patriotic oratory. Before Thursday night's meeting, Mr. Glenn had assured his advisers that he would be ready again if anyone questioned his qualifications. So, in an event that produced no big winners, Mr. Glenn appeared to have made an incremental gain for his candidacy by being lucky enough to get a chance to focus attention on his personality rather than his indistinct positions on some issues. His quick reaction to the question may also help to allay doubts about his ability to hold his own in a candidate field that includes such masterly debaters as Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. Mr. Glenn's defense of his record as an astronaut may have indicated, as well, how he intends to deal with an issue that is likely to become more prominent with the premi ere on Oct. 15 of ''The Right Stuff,'' a movie offering a heroic portrayal of the nation's seven original astronauts. But the immediate importance of the forum was that it offered a rare chance to make direct comparisons among the candidates. Rival strategists agreed that former Vice President Walter F. Mondale failed to demonstrate any dominating debater's skills. Seated at extreme stage right in the auditorium, Mr. Mondale seemed isolated from the proceedings, both in position and mood. He was much more animated earlier Thursday in a speech accepting the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement in Hollywood, Fla., but aides denied that the former Vice President was experiencing a letdown after a hard week of campaigning for endorsements. In any case, Mr. Mondale was chided on one occasion by the moderator, Edwin Newman, for giving an unresponsive answer, and he often wore a detached look as his opponents talked. Clearly less detached were the other candidates. For Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida and Senator Alan Cranston of California and Mr. Hollings, the forum provided a chance at public attention usually accorded Mr. Mondale and Mr. Glenn. Attack on the Press Applauded In a prearranged maneuver unknown to the other candidates, Mr. Cranston and Mr. Hollings conspired to drive home a message for the dark horses in the portion of the program in which each candidate was allowed to ask one question of a rival. According to several sources, Mr. Cranston told Mr. Hollings in advance that he would ask him why reporters insisted on calling the campaign for the nomination a two-man race between Mr. Mondale and Mr. Glenn. Mr. Hollings's denunciation of the press drew the strongest applause of the night. The New York forum was an ''insider'' event. The audience of 1,500 was composed mainly of political professionals and Democratic activists. Because there was no live television, the event will probably have little impact on the general public. But the event provided a means for the candidates to test themselves and their messages before their contest moved on to a larger national stage. It also represented a small step toward the kind of campaign for which Senator Hart and others have been calling. Forum on Arms Control Another step in that direction will take place in Boston next Thursday, when the seven candidates are to appear together again for a one-hour discussion on arms control. That event will be telecast live by Metromedia stations in Boston, Chicago, Washington, Houston and Seattle. It will be shown on a one-hour delay in New York. So, after a series of straw polls in which money and name recognition played the main roles, the Democratic campaign has begun a period involving face-to-face contact among the rivals. For months, Mr. Hart and others have been saying that this would bring about a ''competition of ideas'' that would be bad news for Mr. Glenn and Mr. Mondale. But the impression from the New York forum was that the joint appearances have a leveling effect, with Mr. Glenn showing less vulnerability and Mr. Mondale exerting a less commanding presence than some have predicted.

469-> DOW RISES BY 3.35, TO ANOTHER RECORD
The stock market ended one of its more successful weeks yesterday with a moderate advance in continued heavy trading. At the end of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average was ahead 3.35 points, to 1,272.15, its second consecutive record close. Thursday the blue chip index finished at 1,268.80, up 18.60 points. For the week, the average soared 39.02 points, its best weekly gain since the five days ended June 17, when it rose 46.08 points. In the overall market, gainers outscored losers on the New York Stock Exchange by 954 to 645. Rates and Budget Deficit Fueling the market's advance this week were declining interest rates and forecasts by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan of a Federal budget deficit below earlier projections. Another plus factor was the strong performance of the stock of International Business Machines, a market bellwether and institutional favorite, which rose 1/8 yesterday and closed at a record 132 1/4. In the last five sessions, the stock gained 5 3/8 points in heavy trading. Also helping the market's gain yesterday was the Government report that the unemployment rate last month fell to 9.1 percent from 9.4 percent in August. This reinforced the belief that the economy is still gaining momentum. ''The expectation of lower interest rates and higher corporate third- quarter profits should enable the market to continue its current rally and allow the Dow average to pierce the 1,300 level shortly,'' said Bernard Spilko, a managing director of Julius Baer Securities Inc. 103.6 Million Shares Traded Turnover on the exchange yesterday amounted to 103.6 million shares. On Thursday, 118.3 million shares traded, the most since May 25, when volume was 121.1 million shares. On the Big Board this week, volume rose to 491.1 million shares from 397.9 million shares the week before. This week's turnover was the largest since the week ended June 17, when 500 million shares changed hands. The two other major market indicators also finished higher. The exchange's composite index of 1,500 common stocks rose 0.28, to 98.72, while Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues advanced 0.52, to 170.80. Some of the best gains yesterday were registered by a number of technology issues. Tekronix was up 2 1/2 points, to 85 1/2; Honeywell advanced 1 7/8, to 126; National Semiconductor, 1 1/2, to 58 1/8, and NCR Corporation, 1 7/8, to 135. Sanders Associates, which was recommended by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, added 1 1/2 at 120. Kimberly-Clark was a strong performer and rose 3 1/4, to 98 3/4. A spokesman for the newsprint and paper products manufacturer said the stock was buoyed by a buy recommendation from Morgan Stanley & Company. Tosco was a big percentage loser, falling 2 3/8, to 6 3/8, in heavy trading. The company, which has a heavy debt load, says it expects to report another loss in the third quarter after losing $241 million in the first half. Puritan Fashions Down Again Puritan Fashions dropped 1 5/8, to 14 7/8, after losing 3 1/8 on Thursday, when it said that its profits this year would be more than a $1 below than the $3.25 a share it previously predicted. Several of the utility issues were also under pressure. Dayton Power lost 2 5/8 at 16 3/8; Cincinnati Gas fell 2, to 16, and Consolidated Edison, slipped 1/2, to 24 3/4. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index rose 1.20, to 232.27. Amedco, which was the subject of a favorable article in Barron's magazine, rose 1 1/8, to 18 1/8. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index was up 1.58, to 297.36. Biochem lost 1 1/2 at 7 3/4 bid after reporting that it has been unable as yet to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

470-> HOME IMPROVEMENT
GREAT improvements have been made in the development of exterior paints in the last 20 years and, according to some advertisements, many newer paints are foolproof to apply and can be used on almost any surface. Unfortunately, these claims must not be taken seriously. It is true that many house paints are multipurpose coatings that can be used on many surfaces, but there is no such thing as a universal exterior paint. Even if a store clerk tells you that the paint is good for two or three surfaces - wood, masonry and metal, for example - don't just take his word for it. Read the label carefully, not just the large print but also all the fine print. You may find that in spite of what you thought after a quick glance at the label, a closer reading of the fine print will list some restrictions and limitations the clerk didn't tell you about (or didn't know about). It may also point out the need for a primer or some other preparations required before the paint is applied over certain surfaces. One of the first decisions you will have to make when shopping for an exterior paint is whether to select one that has an oil or alkyd base and thins with turpentine or similar solvent, or to select one that has a latex base and thins with water. The latex paints are far more popular with do-it-yourself painters as well as with many professionals because of the ease of cleanup. You can wash brushes, rollers and other tools in running water and you can clean spots off your hands, clothes and other surfaces with water instead of having to use a smelly, flammable solvent that is dangerous to keep around the house. Easy cleanup is not the only advantage of latex paints. They also dry quickly, many within hours. In many cases you can put on two coats in the same day and, during the summer, there is less chance of insects sticking to the paint, a frequent problem with slower-drying oil paints. An even more important advantage in many cases is that latex paints are permeable; that is, they will allow trapped moisture in the wood or masonry to escape harmlessly through the paint film without causing the paint to blister or peel. This also means that latex paints can be safely applied over a damp surface almost immediately after it stops raining, as well as in the morning when surfaces may still be slightly damp from dew. You cannot apply a solvent-thinned paint over a surface unless it is perfectly dry, which usually means waiting many hours after it stops raining and not starting too early in the morning (or continuing too late into the evening) because of the danger of dew forming. These same qualities also make latex paints more resistant to blistering and peeling caused by moisture in the wood or masonry. Here's why: When water gets into wood or masonry behind the paint film, either from a leak on the outside or from condensation that forms inside the walls, this moisture always tries to escape to the drier air on the outside, especially when the sun shines on it. It works its way through the wood or masonry until it comes in contact with the paint film, the last obstacle between it and the drier outside air. If this paint is a latex type, the moisture can pass through without damage. However, if it is oil- or alkyd-based, the moisture cannot pass through. Instead it pushes the paint off in the form of blisters that burst and peel or flake away. As a result, latex paints are less likely to peel when moisture is the cause. However, this is true only when the latex has been applied directly to the wood or masonry, or when it is applied over previous coats of latex. If you apply a latex type over old coats of oil paint it may not help much. The oil paint can still be pushed off by moisture, and when it does come loose it will take the top coats of latex with it. In spite of the advantages of latex, many still prefer oil for certain applications. For example, alkyd trim paints come in brighter colors than latex, so for those who want brilliant colors or very dark, glossy colors, alkyd or oil will probably be better. Also, where paint must be applied over a chalky or powdery surface, oil or alkyd may be a better choice because oil types tend to soak in deeper and thus will bond more effectively. Latex paints, on the other hand, tend to lay on top of the surface, so they will let go more easily. Finally, on surfaces that get hard wear and are likely to need frequent scrubbing - doors, lawn furniture, play equipment - alkydbase trim paints are much harder and more stain-resistant, so they will probably stand up better. Although the descriptive names are often used interchangeably, as a rule coverings designed for the body of the house are called house paints. Those intended for windows, doors, shutters and so on are called trim paints. These usually have a higher gloss and a hard, enamel-like finish. House paints form a softer, more flexible film that will give more easily with expansion and contraction, while trim kinds are more brittle, which is why they should not be used on the body of the house where larger areas are involved. There are also paints designed for porch floors, patios or wood, usually called deck paints. These come in both latex and alkyd versions. The latex type dries to a dull finish and is generally best for use on concrete patios that rest on the ground, as well as wood porches and decks. The alkyd types dry to a hard enamel-like finish that many prefer for porches and wood steps, but the high-gloss finish may be slippery when wet. While most low-luster latex house paints are suitable for stucco and other masonry surfaces, there are also special masonry types designed for stucco, cement block and concrete. When a latex house paint is used, a primer may be required.

471-> BANK OF AMERICA TO CUT 220 UNITS, 6,000 OF STAFF
In a move to streamline its operations and bolster sagging earnings, the Bank of America announced yesterday that it will reduce its staff by up to 6,000 people during 1984 - primarily through attrition - and close about 220 branches throughout California. Bank of America employs about 60,000 in California and has just over 1,000 branches in the state. Samuel H. Armacost, president and chief executive, said the bank, the nation's largest, would depend more heavily on electronics to deliver banking services to consumers and small businesses. ''Evolving technology makes it no longer necessary to use conventional branches as extensively as before,'' he said. James P. Miscoll, executive vice president in charge of the bank's California operations, said the changes would save ''millions of dollars.'' He added: ''The way we see it, in the future, starting today, the customer will do two things. He will go to the bank or the bank will go to him. When the bank goes to him, it will be through electronics or mail or telephone or television.'' The decision by Bank of America underscores the cost pressures on the banking system, especially in California. Bank of America was one of the last of the California banks to make broad cutbacks; similar moves have already been taken by Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of California. Many analysts had been expecting a move by Bank of America because the profits of the bank's holding company, the BankAmerica Corporation, have dropped sharply recently. Bank of America has been agressively moving into electronic banking. It has introduced a home banking program, through which individuals can manage their accounts with their personal computers. It also hopes to have upwards of 1,200 automated teller machines in its remaining branches by the end of 1984. The bank also has plans that would allow customers to use various bank cards to get cash at supermarkets and other retailers, or to buy gasoline. The reduction in branches would be radical. If Bank of America does, in fact, close 220 branches, that would be more than the total number of New York branches of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest bank. Bank of America officials stressed that the planned moves were part of a continuing restructuring program. The changes have been made necessary, they said, by the recent elimination of Government restraints on the amount of interest banks may pay on small deposits. Bank of America's heavy reliance on low-cost consumer deposits enabled it to make large profits while supporting a high-overhead branch structure. Bank officials acknowledge, however, that there are risks that the new approach might harm Bank of America's dominant relationship with California consumers.

472-> DR. ELLIOT D. WEITZMAN, EXPERT ON SLEEP, DIES
Dr. Elliot D. Weitzman, founder and director of the Institute of Chronobiology in White Plains and a leader in studying sleep, died of lymphoma Monday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 54 years old and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y. Dr. Weitzman was also an attending neurologist in psychiatry at New York Hospital and professor of neurology at the Cornell Medical Center. He joined the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, of which the Institute of Chronobiology is part, last year. Chronobiology is the study of the biological rhythms of life processes. Previously, he had directed the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center, a diagnosis and treatment facility, at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and was professor of neurology and neurosciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, also in the Bronx. Studied Night Workers In 1961, he joined Einstein, becoming chairman of the department of neurology in 1971. He was named chief of the department of neurology at Montefiore in 1969. At Montefiore, Dr. Weitzman also directed the Laboratory for Human Chronophysiology, a research unit. In 1978, Dr. Weitzman took part in a study of sleep problems among those who worked at night. ''Sleep is a very powerful biological rhythm process, and the physiological clock can't just be turned around at will,'' he said. ''Furthermore, the kind of sleep people get when they shift to daytime is demonstrably abnormal and fragmented in its quality.'' Dr. Weitzman was awarded the Distinguished Scientific Service Award from the University of Chicago Medical Alumni Association and the 1983 Nathaniel Kleitman Distinguished Service Award from the Association of Sleep Disorder Centers. Led Professional Groups Dr. Weitzman, who was born in Newark, Dr. Weitzman graduated from the University of Iowa in 1950 and received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1955. He taught at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons before joining Einstein. Dr. Weitzman had been president of the New York Neurological Society, vice president of the Association of Sleep Disorders Clinics and chairman of the North American section on neurology of the Pan American Medical Association. Surviving are his wife, Muriel; a daughter, Ellen, and a son, Matthew; his parents, Louis and Cecele Weitzman of Tyringham, Mass., and a brother, Arthur, of Newtonville, Mass. Services will be at 10 A.M. today at Temple Israel, 1000 Pinebrook Boulevard in New Rochelle, N.Y. A memorial will be held at 11:30 A.M. tomorrow at the Westchester Division of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, 21 Bloomingdale Road in White Plains.

473-> Letter: On School Prayer ; Court Confusion Over Church and State
To the Editor: Your editorial defining ''Fine Lines Between Church and State'' (Sept. 19) misses the mark. To start with, there is nothing ''self-styled'' about the majorities who thunder for a constitutional amendment allowing prayer in public schools. A Gallup Poll released in just the last week found that 81 percent of the American people support President Reagan's voluntary school prayer amendment. That large a slice of our society includes too much diversity to be termed ''self-styled.'' Although The Times may continue to ignore this overwhelming public sentiment, I do not suspect Congress will be permitted the same luxury. Your editorial furthers the myth that the First Amendment bans Government action that may aid or benefit religion. Such an erroneous view would dictate, among other things, that municipalities would not be permitted to render police or fire protection to religious groups. Of course, police and fire protection are provided to religious persons, groups and their properties because not to do so would be discrimination against religion. Sad to say, over the past two decades, court decisions have not followed this nondiscrimination yardstick when considering the free speech and religious free exercise rights of America's schoolchildren. Your readers may be unaware of the result of this discrimination. The courts have held that students and even nonstudents may distribute ''underground'' newspapers on high school campuses, but students, no matter what their religious faith, cannot distribute religious literature. Religious study clubs that want to meet in empty schoolrooms to study the Bible, Torah or Koran have been refused permission on constitutional grounds, but secular groups, including organizations such as the Young Socialist Alliance, have been held to have a constitutional right to have such meetings. Clearly our current law would permit the Young Marxist League to meet to discuss religion as the ''opiate of the people'' on school property while a group that wanted to study the Ten Commandments would be denied permission under most court decisions. If The New York Times believes this is what the Founding Fathers meant when they drafted the First Amendment, you have elevated historical confusion to an art form. Americans will not long tolerate such a blatant deprivation of civil liberties. Several measures are currently pending in Congress, including President Reagan's constitutional amendment on voluntary school prayer, the passage of which will aid greatly in guaranteeing constitutional protection to all of our children regardless of their religious beliefs. GARY L. BAUER Deputy Under Secretary for Planning, Budget and Evaluation Department of Education Washington, Sept. 26, 1983

475-> ANDROPOV IS SPOTTED BEING DRIVEN TO WORK
American officials said today that Western diplomats had spotted Yuri V. Andropov being driven to work in the Kremlin after an absence since mid-August. The Soviet leader's limousine and security convoy were first observed going into the Kremlin one afternoon in the middle of last week, officials said. On Monday and Tuesday, they said, Mr. Andropov's convoy was again seen going in the mornings from his apartment to the Kremlin through the Borovitsky Gate, and returning home in late afternoon. Not only was the convoy seen, but Mr. Andropov was personally identified as being in the Kremlin. The United States has taken Mr. Andropov's reappearance as evidence that he has recovered sufficiently from ill health to attend a Central Committee meeting expected on Dec. 26 and a session of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament, starting Dec. 28. Some officials speculated that Mr. Andropov might meet with some foreign leader before that date as a way of appearing in public. He has not appeared since Aug. 18, when he received a group of American senators. Despite evidence that he is back on the job, Government analysts believe that his absence has diminished his political power. They contend that the health problems of the 69-year-old Soviet leader suggest he will not be able to fully gather the reins of power. A consensus has developed among officials that Mr. Andropov's ailments have thrown the Soviet leadership into a transition period that could last two or three years, at least partly because many Politburo members are in their early 70's and only a few younger men are near the top. Some officials foresee a pattern similar to the final years of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was sometimes in fairly good health and served as a fairly vigorous leader only to fall into medical relapses, paralyzing important issues and decisions. Leonid M. Zamyatin, a senior Soviet spokesman, said at a Moscow news conference on Monday that Mr. Andropov was recovering from what he implied was a cold and was ''managing in full measure party and state affairs, including questions pertaining to the Defense Council of the U.S.S.R.'' Mr. Andropov, in addition to heading this military decision-making body is also the party leader and the chief of state. American officials presume that Mr. Andropov suffered from previously known cardiovascular and kidney problems and perhaps other ailments. Mr. Zamyatin's specific mention of the Defense Council was taken a deliberate assurance to the Soviet public that the party and not the military leadership was in control. Several top military figures, including Marshal Mikolai V. Ogarkov, chief of the General Staff, and his first deputy, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, have played an increasingly public role as spokesmen on military matters such as arms control and the Korean airliner incident in early September. On Nov. 23, the Soviet weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta ran a fictionalized recollection of the Cuba missile crisis of 1962 that had President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert supposedly battling to assert civilian leadership over the American military in the National Security Council. Some American analysts have interpreted the article as a possible allusion to concerns in the Soviet party about the possible emergence of a military leader assuming authority in the Soviet Union, as has happened in Poland. In the past, Soviet commentators have used foreign settings as a disguised way of raising delicate issues. If Mr. Andropov remains alive but ailing for some years, the influence of the Soviet military hierarchy could be crucial in the jockeying for power, as it was in Mr. Andropov's own emergence as Mr. Brezhnev's successor. American analysts have asserted that they believe that a new succession struggle has probably begun in the Kremlin, brought on by Mr. Andropov's incapacitation for such a long period.

477-> Canadian Scientists Support Ottawa on Acid Rain Stance
An independent group of Canadian scientists has endorsed Ottawa's tough position on acid rain and urged Canada and the United States to take prompt abatement measures. Environment Minister John Roberts today released a study that he requested by the Royal Society of Canada of information Canada has been using in negotiations with Washington. The study endorsed Canada's abatement target and said even tougher standards may be needed, Mr. Roberts said, adding, ''It considers the target to be, if anything, on the lax side.'' Canada wants both countries to cut industrial sulfur dioxide emissions in half by 1990. The Reagan Administration has said that not enough is known about acid rain to justify the large sums it would cost to reduce such emissions.

478-> INDUSTRIAL OUPTUT UP 1.1% IN MAY
Industrial output in May rose 1.1 percent from April, the Government reported today. The rise was the sixth in a row. The Federal Reserve Board said production gains were widespread, with large advances in automotive products, business equipment and construction supplies. But the May rise was about half the 2 percent increase of April and slower than the 1.3 percent gain in March. Still, if production continued at May's pace over a 12-month period, it would show a climb of 14 percent for the year, said Robert Ortner, chief economist for the Commerce Department. ''That is on the hectic side,'' he said, ''and actually would have to slow down because the labor force is not gaining that fast.'' A Strong Start Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said the report showed ''a continuing trend of a stronger and broader'' economic rebound. He said, ''It's clear that we are talking about a much stronger recovery for the next two or three quarters, although there are serious questions about its strength beyond that point.'' The Government reported earlier this week that manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers have begun to increase inventories, after reducing them for most of the recession. ''Now inventories seem to be drawn down as much as desired, so businesses are starting to get out there and produce,'' according to David Ernst of Evans Economics Inc. 'It Does Not Look Modest' Mr. Ortner said that increases in employment and production in the last six months were altering predictions that the recovery would be modest. ''So far it does not look modest; it looks very typical for a postwar business rebound,'' he said. Utilities were the only category in the report to decline in May. Their output fell one-tenth of 1 percent. The report also made these points: - Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 6.2 million units in May, up from a 5.9 million rate in April. - Production of furniture, appliances and other home goods, ''which had surged in both March and April, advanced further in May at a somewhat slower pace.'' - Output of business equipment, the machinery to be used for later production of other items, rose 1.7 percent. Production of building and mining equipment also rose. - There was a 1.9 percent rise in the production of construction supplies, a category that has averaged 2.5 percent gains since December. - Output of military and space equipment rose 1.3 percent. The report said the Government's industrial production index rose in May to 144.3 percent of its 1967 base, still about six percentage points below the prerecession high in mid-1981.

479-> HOW TO GET STUDENTS TO ATTEND CLASSES
To the Editor: New York City high schools' dismal daily attendance figures (news story Jan. 9) will certainly cause many people to view the situation as hopeless. But the Cooperative Education Program of the City Board of Education offers one viable and highly effective solution to this serious problem. As has been proven over and over again, early, paid work experience provides the most powerful motivation for improving students' school attendance. The average daily attendance in Cooperative Education classes is 93.6 percent, with many schools reporting 100 percent continuously. At the job site, students learn that excellent attendance is a prerequisite for job success. This important work ethic transfers directly to the school situation. The stimulation of the job renews their interest in academics as they begin to understand the relationship between job requirements and courses, and this in turn is reflected in improved school attendance. In Cooperative Education classes, the high attendance rates also assure greater state revenue (conversely, non-attendance leads to a loss of such revenue). We in the business community who offer our assistance to the high schools in the management of this effort are convinced that this early connection to the world of work helps students and industry to maintain effective linkages that make young people productive and enable industry to remain in New York City. ALBERT E. BROWN, Chairman, Cooperative Education Commission, New York, Jan. 14, 1983

480-> Bank Rates Show Rise
For the 10th consecutive week, interest rates for bank money market deposit accounts rose in the week ended yesterday, The Bank Rate Monitor reported. Interest rates in the New York area, however, declined slightly. The Monitor's nationwide average, based on a survey of 50 large banks and thrift institutions in the five largest United States markets, rose to 8.44 percent, from 8.43 last week and 8.40 the week before. The New York area average dropped from 8.65 percent to 8.64 percent, but continued to lead the five major markets, The Monitor said. The New York average is based on a survey of 10 New York banks and savings and loan institutions. Rates paid nationwide on Super NOW accounts, which give customers check-writing privileges, rose to 7.12 percent, from 7.11 percent last week. The New York average was 7.14 percent, a slight decrease from last week's 7.15 percent. The Super NOW accounts are similar to the deposit accounts, but because of their unlimited check-writing privileges, they carry slightly lower interest rates. Last Thursday, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said that the money market mutual funds, which compete directly with the bank money market accounts, offered an average seven-day yield of 8.36 percent, up from 8.24 percent the week before.

481-> DAIRY FARMERS REIMBURSED IN DEFAULT OF MILK PROCESSOR
The State Department of Agriculture and Markets announced this week that 350 upstate farmers and three milk cooperatives had been paid a total of $4.1 million, almost all the money they were owed as a result of a default earlier this year by the Glen and Mohawk Milk Association of Fultonville. The latest payments, checks totaling about a million dollars, were sent out a few days ago from a court-administered account set up as a depository for funds owed the Glen and Mohawk from the sale of its processed milk. Earlier payments of $3 million came from the State Milk Producers Security Fund, which was established for the financial protection of the state's 16,000 dairy farmers. They are usually paid two weeks to a month after they deliver milk to a milk-processing plant. The farmers produce about 11 billion pounds of milk a year, with a gross farm income of $1.5 billion. That makes dairy farming the predominant segment of New York's agriculture and an important part of the state's economy. Fund Is Nearly Depleted The fund, which is made up of fees levied against milk dealers, had assets of $3.9 million before the Glen and Mohawk case, but it has now been largely depleted. At present, the fund stands at $985,000, almost all of it a reserve to cover prior claims against it, which are still awaiting decision, according to the State Department of Agriculture. The department administers the fund. ''If we had a major new claim against the fund, it would be grossly inadequate,'' said Ronald Pearce, acting director of the department's Division of Dairy Industry Services. Over the next several years, the fund will be built up again by the dealers' contributions, which come to about $50,000 a month. But the fund has no reserves on which it can draw. ''We would look for the State Legislature for backstopping,'' said Thomas G. Conway, counsel for the department. ''Perhaps they could come forth with some first-instance money, a loan subject to repayment out of future payments into the fund.'' 94% of Claims Have Been Paid At the moment, there are no bills pending before the State Legislature to aid the fund, but a legislative committee has held hearings on the subject. With the checks that went out this week, the dairy farmers affected by the Glen and Mohawk default have now been paid 94 percent of their claims, according to Joseph Gerace, the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets. They are still owed about $300,000. ''My staff will continue to work to make sure that 100 percent of the debt is paid,'' he said. The additional money is expected to come from further payments into the court-administered fund. The latest checks involve payments of $720,000 to individual farmers, $181,000 to the Eastern Milk Producers Cooperative, $81,000 to the Dairy League Cooperative and $51,000 to the National Farmers Organization. ''The objective was to pay the farmers, and we are all very well pleased that they are being paid,'' said Bruce V. Snow, an official of the Dairy League. The drain against the fund started after Glen and Mohawk sold its plant and equipment in June to the Northeast Dairy Cooperative of Syracuse. The farmers, not paid for the milk they sold to Glen and Mohawk in May and June, filed claims with the fund for payment.

482-> Corporate Future
To the Editor: Regarding Paul Lewis's review of my book ''The Cox Report on the American Corporation'' (Dec. 26), I could not agree more with him that our corporations lag behind those of Japan and West Germany in many critical areas. However, what he wanted from the book I wasn't giving. As a result, he addresses what the book isn't there to do while missing what it accomplishes. My purpose was not to concentrate on the American corporation's role in a global economy. Rather it was to answer five questions my experience leads me to believe are of vital interest to executives who work within the corporation, citizens who have an abiding curiosity about it, and students who are considering business careers. Those questions are: (1) What do corporations value? (2) How do corporations function? (3) How do corporations succeed and fail? (4) What are executives like? (5) How do executives succeed? Given that 93 percent of almost 1,200 executives in the 13 major corporations I studied completed our 400-item confidential questionnaire, the reader is assured that this group, which knows the corporations best, provides representative answers to these questions. I do not share Mr. Lewis's bleak view of the American corporation. While I devote one-fifth of the book to how the corporation succeeds and fails at social responsibility, personnel, government relations and economic achievements, I'm far more hopeful for its future. I see good signs, signs that admittedly have been brought about by the Japanese incursion, an incursion we asked for by virtue of our neglect - and got. For the American corporation to optimize its state of health, it need not copy Japan's ways. The day is not far off when Japan again will be learning from our management methods. My optimism stems from my observing that executives in increasing numbers realize that while engaging in advanced financial gymnastics, they have lost touch with the society they serve. As a remedy, more enterprising top executives are working to make sure their companies meet the two demands that will render them profitable enough to attract continued investment. These demands are: (1) providing a feeling of belonging for all their employees, and (2) maintaining an intense encounter with their customers. Meeting these demands results in social awareness and action in their broadest possible implications and assures corporate health over the greatest length of time. ALLAN COX, Chicago, Ill.

Falconbridge Ltd. said yesterday that it had lost $85.3 million (Canadian) in 1982, much wider than the loss of $3.9 million in 1981, as a result of ''substantially lower'' nickel sales, as well as lower metal prices and higher costs. It cited expenses because of shutdowns at its Sudbury, Ontario, operation, a refinery in Norway, Falconbridge Dominicana, Falconbridge Copper's Lake Dufault division and United Keno Hill Mines Ltd. The Sudbury operation, the refinery and Falconbridge Dominicana have resumed production.

486-> BRIEFING
A Question of Timing T he A.F.L.-C.I.O. is scheduled to deliver the first Presidential endorsement in its history this year, in December. But many in the labor group now believe an announcement at its October convention in Hollywood, Fla., would maximize labor's political influence with the Democrats and give its favorite candidate a lift. The rescheduling question is to come up at the labor federation's executive council meeting in Boston in two weeks, with supporters of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the strong favorite to receive the endorsement, pushing for the change. Conversely, Senator Alan Cranston of California has been urging that the December date be retained, to give him more time to develop support for his candidacy among the constituent unions. Those favoring October say that action in December would be anticlimactic. By then, they say, all the individual unions would have endorsed one or another of the Democratic hopefuls, and political reporters would long since have identified the winner. Quotation From the File P resident Reagan, in discussing his Central American policies with longshoremen in Florida last week, quoted a man better known for fighting native Americans than for spreading world peace. ''In America, a glorious fire has been lighted upon the altar of liberty,'' the President said. ''Keep it burning; and let the sparks that continually go up from it fall on other altars, and light up in distant lands the fire of freedom.'' The quotation was from one of Mr. Reagan's less quotable predecessors, William Henry Harrison. He is most remembered for laying claim to Indian territory and for winning a pyrrhic victory over Shawnee Indians at Tippecanoe Creek in 1811. His 1840 campaign for President featured no real platform, but a catchy slogan, ''Tippecanoe and Tyler too'' (John Tyler, the former Senator from Virginia, was his running mate) and lots of creative handouts, including miniature log cabins with the General swigging cider on the porch. His Presidency lasted but a month, for he died of complications from a cold. Julie Cave, who helped research Mr. Reagan's speech, said the Harrison quotation had been taken from a White House file dedicated to the topic of liberty and freedom. ''We had no reference to the original context of the quote, but we decided to go ahead and use it anyway.'' As it turns out, it was candidate Harrison, not President Harrison, who made the speech to the Whig Republican Association, on Sept. 10, 1840 in Dayton, Ohio. The Subject Is Crime I n a Rose Garden ceremony today, President Reagan plans to introduce the members of a new bipartisan commission to study the impact of organized crime on American society. Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circut, which includes New York, will serve as chairman. The commission is expected to include about 15 prominent lawyers, law-enforcement experts, journalists and scholars. Peter F. Vaira, the United States Attorney for Philadelphia, is expected to be named executive director of the commission. And Alan J. Hruska, a lawyer with Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York, is expected to be named general counsel. Small-Time PAC A nybody who's anybody seems to have a PAC these days. The newest in town is the American School Food Service Association Political Action Committee, which plans to give money to Congressmen who support restoring the $1.5 billion in Federal funds the Reagan Administration cut from the school lunch program. The PAC is soliciting $1 and $2 contributions from the association's 60,000 members, who are school dieticians, program administrators, part-time cooks and meal servers. ''I don't think we'll be the biggest PAC around, but I hope Congressmen will recognize that our members are of modest means,'' said Marshall Matz, the group's counsel.

487-> WHERE'S THE MARKET FOR FILAMENT CLOTHES?
To the Editor: Prof. Robert Reich's Op-Ed article of Sept. 30 is naive in the extreme to believe that the solution to improving competitiveness in the textile and apparel industries is to move from ''basic cotton, wool and simple synthetic textiles to carbon fibers and specially coated polyester filaments.'' More than two million Americans produce these basic textile products, and the level of sophistication involved is obviously beyond the appreciation of Professor Reich. Does he really believe that 200 million Americans are going to be clothed and covered by ''carbon fibers and specially coated filaments''? The American fiber, textile and apparel business is a $100 billion enterprise employing two million workers. There is no market now or in the foreseeable future for the highly specialized products he suggests, and it is absurd to say that the industry's foreign trade and national competitive problems can be solved by a simple transition to producing them while abandoning the basic fibers, yarns and fabrics that clothe the world. Perhaps the reason American industry has not embraced the notions put forward in Professor Reich's article is that they are clearly no better suited to producing anything real than they are to widget production.

489-> CHEAP OR FREE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION
To the Editor: Your Jan. 14 editorial ''Hiding Behind Information Fees'' presents an unfortunate and misleading characterization of the guidance recently issued by the Department of Justice on fee waivers under the Freedom of Information Act. Under the act, fees are limited to the direct cost of search and duplication, and fees charged by the agencies are estimated to be no more than 2 to 4 percent of the total direct cost to the Government in responding to requests, more than $60 million annually. The act also provides for waiver or reduction of fees where ''the agency determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.'' The new, three-page guidance does no more than reiterate the statutory standard and provide a concise enumeration of five general considerations in determining the public interest, considerations that have been developed in numerous court decisions construing the act. The prior guidance was a ponderous statement of over 22 singlespaced pages plus a cover memorandum. In particular, the three considerations relating to determining the public interest that you apparently believe to be new hurdles for those who ask for information are taken directly from the prior memorandums and from court decisions. Although those who seek information generally do not have to ''explain or justify'' why they want the records they request, people desiring a waiver of the statutory search and copy fees have always been required to explain or justify the reasons for a fee waiver. And it is extremely rare that someone would be required to pay ''tens of thousands'' of dollars, as you suggest. At 10 cents a page, $10,000 pays for 100,000 pages of documents - hardly a routine request. (Even in such instances, a waiver or reduction is granted if it is shown that the disclosure primarily benefits the general public.) In truth, most requests from individuals are far more limited in size, and most agencies routinely waive all fees for specific categories of small requests - for example, copying charges for 50 pages or less. The large majority of F.O.I.A. requests are, moreover, made by businesses and law firms that can well afford to pay the Government its copying costs. A General Accounting Office study found that only 14 percent of all requests were made by individuals, and only 1 percent by the news media. The act itself establishes as the key criterion for granting fee waivers whether the agency determines that disclosing the requested information will primarily benefit the general public. The new guidance is intended to remind all agencies of the circumstances in which Congress contemplated the granting of waivers, and to avoid, in the words of one court, ''a drain upon agency appropriations that Congress never intended.'' That is precisely what this or any other Administration should do. JONATHAN C. ROSE, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Policy, Department of Justice, Washington, Jan. 19, 1983

490-> THE MODERN MUSEUM'S NO-RISK PROJECT
To the Editor: The Jan. 7 news article on museum air rights needs clarification to describe accurately the financing of the Museum of Modern Art's expansion. here is no financial risk to the museum in connection with the sale of apartments in the residential tower above the new West Wing. The museum was paid $17 million for the air rights sold to the private developer of the tower. Thereafter, the tower project proceeded as an undertaking separate from the museum's expansion project. The museum's assets are fully insulated from any related risk. The bonds issued by the Trust for Cultural Resources to finance the expansion project are not affected by the outcome of apartment sales. Their triple-A rating comes not from a claim on museum revenues but rather from their full collateralization with museum funds invested in U.S. Government obligations. This collateral will generate sufficient income to cover all debt service on the bonds, if required. Unlike several other New York museums, the Museum of Modern Art receives no direct financial support from the city. The expansion project evolved as an innovative way for the museum, with the city's endorsement, to utilize its own resources to help itself. The project uses museum-owned tax-exempt property, and its costs will be covered by the anticipated tax equivalency payments newly generated by the project itself. The museum's expansion project, a model for cultural institutions seeking to secure their financial future, deserves correct depiction if others are to consider similarly innovative solutions. WILLIAM S. PALEY BLANCHETTE H. ROCKEFELLER New York, Jan. 10, 1983 The writers are the museum's chairman and president, respectively.

492-> JETS TO RETAIN CITY IDENTITY
''The name of the team is still, and will be, the New York Jets.'' That is what Jim Kensil said today when asked whether the club would be renamed in the wake of Thursday's announcement by Leon Hess, the principal owner, that the long-expected move to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., was a certainty for next season. The remark by Kensil, the Jets' president, served in a way to sum up what seemed to be a prevailing sentiment at camp here today: that, while some things had changed during weeks of speculation about the team's future, had remained much the same. Will Keep Practice Facility Kensil affirmed that the Jets wanted to keep their New York identity, even though departing Shea Stadium when their lease with the city expires after this season. The team's offices will remain on Madison Avenue, he said, and the training site will continue to be at Hofstra University here. In fact, the Jets plan to build a new artificial surface here, at an expected cost of more than $200,000, to better prepare their players for the Astroturf field at Giants Stadium. Val Pinchbeck, the National Football League's director of broadcasting, said that the sharing of Giants Stadium by the Giants and the Jets would not require any change ''in the patterns of television or scheduling.'' When the two teams shared Shea Stadium for the 1975 season - one year after the Giants had left the Yale Bowl and one year before Giants Stadium was completed - the Giants were forced to play two Saturday games. But Pinchbeck said that this had resulted from the presence of a third Shea Stadium tenant, the Mets. ''At Giants Stadium,'' he said, ''there is no baseball team to contend with.'' Jets' Return Not Expected Meanwhile, Simon Gourdine, the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, who is leading the city's search for a team to replace the Jets, said he was working on the assumption that the Jets would not return when their initial five-year lease at Giants Stadium expires. In the sharply worded letter to Mayor Koch with which Hess announced the move Thursday, the owner said the team would return to New York in 1989 if it was notified by 1986 that the city was building a new, ''proper'' football stadium. ''Hess's 1986 demand is an untenable position,'' said Mr. Gourdine. ''If we were to go out and look for a short- term arrangement, well, who moves into a city for five years? If we can sign a team for 40 years, we'll do it.'' Among the Jet players today, there did not appear to be any great emotional wrenching, although most of them have said they do not like to play on artificial turf. ''I don't think it will matter as far as fans, if they're true fans of ours,'' said Mark Gastineau, ''just like I'm a true Jet. I'll be there.'' Gastineau had some other thoughts: ''The Giants Stadium is one of the best in the country - I mean the Jets Stadium. They should name it for the team with the best record.'' The Jets are now 3-2, and the Giants 2-3, but Gastineau's proposal won't be realized. The Giants' long-term lease with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority requires that the stadium be named for them. Burt May Start for Giants EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 7 - Jim Burt of the Giants, who had not practiced all week because of back spasms, worked out today and will probably start at nose tackle here Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. Jerome Sally is the only other nose tackle on the Giants' roster.

496-> DR. JULIAN H. GIBBS, 58, DIES; PRESIDENT OF AMHERST COLLEGE
Julian H. Gibbs, the president of Amherst College since 1979 and a leading figure in the field of physical chemistry, died of a heart attack yesterday at Bay State Medical Center in Springfield, Mass. He was 58 years old. Dr. Gibbs was stricken while skiing at a resort in Charlemont, Mass., on Saturday and was taken to the Franklin County Public Hospital in nearby Greenfield. Later, he was transferred to the medical center where he died, according to an Amherst spokesman, Carl Vigeland. Dr. Gibbs was the 15th president of Amherst, a 162-year-old private college in western Massachusetts with 1,500 students and a $114 million endowment. In a tenure of less than four years, Dr. Gibbs completed the school's transition to coeducation, broadened curriculums, strengthened a commitment to research, initiated a $42 million fund-raising campaign and began a $3.1 million mathematics and computer science center. Ordered Fraternity Change In nonacademic areas, Dr. Gibbs ordered Amherst fraternities to accept women. The transition to coeducation began in 1975. He also continued his own research in statistical mechanics, applying statistical methods to his study of the structure and properties of solids, liquids and gases. The author of many articles in scholarly journals and the editor of several professional journals, Dr. Gibbs was well known for his work in physical chemistry, which was supported for two decades by the National Institutes of Health. In 1967, he won the High Polymer Physics Prize of the American Physical Society. The prize, which is the society's top award in its field, was given to Dr. Gibbs for his research into how the basic chemistry of large molecules determines their shapes and how, in turn, those shapes influence the structure and function of large molecules, according to Prof. Richard Fink, chairman of Amherst's chemistry department. Before succeeding John W. Ward as president of Amherst in July 1979, Dr. Gibbs taught for 20 years at Brown University in Providence, R.I., where he was chairman of the chemistry department. Doctorate From Princeton Julian Howard Gibbs was born in Greenfield, Mass., on June 24, 1924, the son of the founder of the Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, Mass. He grew up in Albany and attended the Albany Academy. He entered Amherst as a student in 1942, but his education was interrupted for Navy service in World War II and he graduated in 1947. He obtained a doctorate in chemistry from Princeton University in 1950, studied at Cambridge University in England under a Fulbright Fellowship, taught for a year at the University of Minnesota and then spent eight years in private industry, working with the General Electric Central Research Laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., and the American Vicose Corporation in Pennsylvania until 1960. Dr. Gibbs is survived by his wife, the former Cora Lee Gethman, whom he married in 1946; a daughter, Judith Gibbs Shaw of Barrington, R.I.; three sons, Jonathan, of Barrington, James of Portland, Ore., and Jeffrey of St. Paul; his mother, Judith Martha Bassett Webber of Albany; two sisters, Nancy Gibbs Zucker of New York City and Mary Webber Nason of Albany, and a granddaughter.

497-> E.P.A. ADMINISTRATOR SAID TO ASK INQUIRY ON MISS LAVELLE'S ACTIONS
The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has asked the Justice Department to determine whether a former subordinate, Rita M. Lavelle, had acted improperly, according to high agency officials. They said the administrator believed Miss Lavelle had met with officials of two companies without notifying Government lawyers at a time when the Government was negotiating with the companies on cleaning up hazardous waste in the harbor at Waukegan, Ill. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the administrator believed that Miss Lavelle's actions might have violated Federal law. Illegality Is Denied The agency's counsel, Robert M. Perry, said the actions were ''not necessarily illegal.'' And Miss Lavelle's attorney said that even if the meetings had occurred, there would have been nothing illegal or improper about them. The agency sources who reported on the request to the Justice Department have sided with the administrator, Anne M. Gorsuch, in a dispute with Miss Lavelle. Mrs. Gorsuch, who was married today to Robert Burford and said she would take his last name, had Miss Lavelle dismissed Feb. 7. Miss Lavelle, who was head of the Federal hazardous waste cleanup program, met with the officials of the Outboard Marine Corporation of Waukegan and with executives of the Monsanto Company of St. Louis, without telling Government lawyers, the sources said. The companies were said to be involved in polluting the harbor at Waukegan with hazardous waste. The cost of cleaning up the harbor has been estimated at $40 million. One high E.P.A. official, who asked not to be identified, said having such contacts outside the presence of Government lawyers violated a longstanding agency rule. The official said the rule was reiterated in a memorandum last year. Richard Mays, an attorney in the agency's enforcement division, said today that Miss Lavelle had met with Monsanto. He said he had been told of this meeting by E.P.A.'s regional counsel in Chicago. Mr. Mays said he also thought, based on his discussion with the counsel, that Miss Lavelle had met with Outboard Marine officials. Outboard Marine's associate general counsel, Hugh Thomas, said in a telephone interview today, ''I am not aware that O.M.C. has had any substantive meetings or discussions of any kind with Rita Lavelle.'' Dan R. Bishop, di-rector of environmental communications for Monsanto, denied his company had had any meetings with Miss Lavelle regarding the cleanup of Waukegan's harbor. Mrs. Burford's request for the Justice Department to conduct an inquiry appears to be the latest salvo in the feud between her and Miss Lavelle. Dismissal Is Explained In television interviews broadcast Saturday and today, Mrs. Burford said she had sought Miss Lavelle's dismissal because she ''no longer had confidence in her ability to run'' the waste cleanup program. In the interview, broadcast by the Cable News Network, Mrs. Burford also said she was aware of one instance of ''minor'' wrongdoing by Miss Lavelle. She did not elaborate, but she was believed to be referring to Miss Lavelle's reported discussions with Monsanto and Outboard Marine. According to the E.P.A. sources, a memorandum prepared by Eugene Ingold, one of Miss Lavelle's top aides, prompted Mrs. Burford to contact the Justice Department. In the memorandum, Mr. Ingold said the Outboard Marine Corporation and Monsanto ''were persuaded'' by Miss Lavelle ''that E.P.A. might seriously consider a new settlement offer.'' The memorandum said Mr. Perry, the agency's general counsel, had ''rejected the first proposal and had seriously alienated the companies (according to them).'' The memorandum concludes that the agency's regional office ''has now managed to have the Assistant U.S. Attorney make another request for a new offer.'' Outboard Marine, the country's largest manufacturer of outboard motors for boats, used hydraulic fluids containing PCB's in its manufacturing processes from the late 1950's to the early 1970's. Monsanto was a supplier of the fluid. PCB's are suspected of causing cancer. According to an E.P.A. report, Outboard Marine dumped up to 1.7 million pounds of PCB's into Waukegan harbor on Lake Michigan. Under Federal law, Monsanto and Outboard Marine are potentially responsible for cleaning up the chemicals. The Government and the companies, in the talks that occurred over the last few months, were trying to reach a settlement that would avoid the time, expense and uncertainty of litigation. These settlements, called consent decrees, are signed by the companies and by lawyers representing the E.P.A. and the Land and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice, Mr. Perry, the agency's lawyer, explained. Mr. Perry said today that he was aware of the Justice Department's investigation. But he said Miss Lavelle's meetings with the companies at the time of the Waukegan negotiations were ''not necessarily illegal.'' ''At most there would be an appearance of impropriety,'' he said. No Agreement With Companies Mr. Perry said the Government and the companies had still not reached an agreement on the cleanup of Waukegan harbor. He added that the Government would begin the cleanup with money in the agency's $1.6 billion ''superfund,'' which was originally set up to allow the Government to move ahead with cleanup operations and to later bill or sue companies liable for the contamination. Miss Lavelle could not be reached today for comment regarding the reported meetings with Outboard Marine and Monsanto. But her attorney, James Bierbower, said he did not know whether there had been any such meetings. He emphasized that there would have been nothing improper or illegal for his client, as a public official, to have met with the companies. Dispute Over Memorandum On other controversies that have engulfed the E.P.A. recently, the agency sources said Miss Lavelle provided Mrs. Burford and a reporter with inconsistent and erroneous accounts about a memorandum that set off most of the recent furor about the agency's handling of the toxic waste program. The memorandum criticized Mr. Perry for ''systematically alienating the primary consitituents of this Administration, the business community.'' According to the sources, Miss Lavelle first responded ''absolutely not'' when Mrs. Burford asked her if she or anyone on her staff had written the memorandum. But the next day, according to the sources, Miss Lavelle admitted that she had dictated the memorandum but added that she intended to deny publicly its existence. A few days later, she informed Mrs. Burford, according to the sources, that she had told a reporter who asked about the memorandum that it did not exist. ''I lied to him,'' the sources quoted Miss Lavelle as saying. Eugene Ingold, one of Miss Lavelle's top assistants before he was also dismissed by Mrs. Burford, has publicly said he wrote the memorandum. Chafee Criticizes Reagan WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (AP) -Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said today that President Reagan should not have ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to withhold files sought by Congress. ''I think it was a mistake for the President to have made so much out of it,'' said Mr. Chafee, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ''I think the House committees are sensible. They're not going to race around and peddle that stuff. It would have been better to hand over the documents.'' Mr. Chafee's comments came the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''

498-> DOCTORS AND INSURERS PRESS FOR LIMITS ON MALPRACTICE AWARDS
With jury awards in medical malpractice suits soaring into the millions of dollars in recent years, cries of alarm from the medical profession have stirred a debate about New York State's malpractice insurance system and the quality of health care. For physicians, insurance companies and hospitals, the malpractice insurance system has engendered a ''crisis'' in health care. For some lawyers, it is simply the consequence of a free market. And for some consumer groups, it is a quagmire in which the only victim is the consumer. A key element of the debate is the medical profession's contention that the larger jury awards and the accompanying rise in the cost of physicians' insurance are fueling the rapid increase in the cost of medical care. ''The current system threatens the quality of medical care in the state,'' said James R. Tallon Jr., a Democratic Assemblyman from Binghamton and the chairman of the Assembly Health Committee. ''Last year, there was an effort to find an alternate source of funding for malpractice awards. This year the pendulum has shifted back toward fundamental reform.'' Major Effort to Rewrite Laws Among those pushing for such change is a new group of physicians, insurance companies and hospitals called the New York Medical Reform Coalition, which is mounting a major effort in Albany to rewrite the state's malpractice laws. In the State Senate, a comprehensive bill, written by the coalition, and a constitutional amendment have been introduced. Both are intended to make it more difficult to sue for malpractice, to limit the size of jury awards and to reduce fees that lawyers can earn from taking on malpractice suits. In addition, with the appointment of James P. Corcoran as the state's new Insurance Superintendent, Governor Cuomo will begin reviewing the entire area of medical malpractice insurance, an administration spokesman said. However, the proposed legislation has drawn sharp criticism from consumer groups and lawyers who specialize in medical malpractice cases. The consumer advocates argue that the issue of rising awards has clouded the real problem, which is medical malpractice itself. And trial lawyers assert that the proposed legislation would deprive the public of the right to sue. Amid the discord, there is general agreement on these matters: - Jury awards in malpractice suits have soared in recent years. Last October, a Brooklyn jury awarded $29.2 million to a 5-year-old girl, unable to walk, see or talk. Her lawyer had argued that her condition developed because of a careless diagnosis. In 1981, the average award in New York State was $85,691, compared with $35,977 in 1976. Malpractice awards are frequently reduced upon appeal. - The cost of malpractice insurance has risen steadily in the last decade, so that some doctors - those in such specialities as neurosurgery and anesthesiology - are now paying upwards of $50,000 a year for coverage. - In 1982, the cost of medical care rose 11 percent nationwide, or at nearly three times the rate of inflation. In New York, two insurance companies cover virtually all the state's 60,000 physicians: the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association, an insurance pool in which all personal injury liability insurance companies must participate, and a physician-owned company, the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company. Since 1976, according to Donald J. Fager, the assistant treasurer and assistant secretary of Medical Liability Mutual, the number of malpractice cases reported in the state has risen from 3,180 to 4,268 in 1981. And the total amount paid out by both insurance companies jumped from $23.5 million to $91.7 million. Limit for Noneconomic Damages The legislation would limit to $100,000 what a jury could award for noneconomic damages, that is, for pain and suffering. Awards for economic losses - loss of earning power and medical expenses - would not be limited but would be spread over the patient's lifetime. The proposal would also sharply curtail the fees that lawyers can earn from malpractice suits; narrow the definition of an expert witness; require plaintiffs to post a bond sufficient to pay all defense costs, including lawyers' fees, incurred by the defendant doctor or hospital, and create regional boards of doctors to hear complaints. Because the coalition is uncertain whether the bill's provisions dealing with jury awards and lawyers' fees are constitutional, it has also had introduced in the State Senate a proposed constitutional amendment that would permit the Legislature to enact laws in those areas. Among the critics of the legislation is Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, the director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer group and a Ralph Nader affiliate. A Question of Liability ''One way of looking at the problem is to look at malpractice as a question of product liability,'' said Dr. Wolfe. ''Here, instead of controlling doctors' behavior, you try hurt consumers by taking it out on them. The major cause of the medical malpractice problem is medical malpractice.'' Another critic of the coalition's proposed legislation is Richard Shandel, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney for plaintiffs in malpractice suits. ''I do not think it is reform the coalition is seeking,'' said Mr. Shandel. ''What insurance companies want is to be able to collect premiums and not pay out claims. Secondly, doctors are interested in reducing their premiums, and that is not necessarily reform as I understand the word. That is just saving money for doctors.'' He also attacked the idea that lawyers' fees and jury awards be limited. ''The jury is representative of the community,'' he said. ''They don't give out doctors' money lightly.'' Cost of 'Defensive Medicine' To Douglas W. Barnert, a supporter of the Medical Reform Coalition, ''The fundamental problem with health care costs is that they are rising at three times the rate of inflation.'' Mr. Barnert is vice president of the Eastern region of the Alliance of American Insurers, one of the 18 member groups of the coalition. ''We can identify two elements in that problem: the premiums that doctors and hospitals pay and the cost of defensive medicine.'' Mr. Barnert defined defensive medicine as the practice of ordering every conceivable test on a patient. Indeed, physicians in New York pay sizable insurance premiums. However, these vary from specialty to specialty and region to region, said Mr. Fager. A neurosurgeon in Great Neck, L.I., for example, can expect annual premiums of about $46,000 for malpractice insurance. On the other hand, a family practitioner in Rochester can anticipate paying about $2,700. But despite these hefty premiums, malpractice insurance nationwide consumes only 3.5 percent, on average, of a doctor's gross income, according to the journal Medical Economics. Office payroll, which takes 12.8 percent of a doctor's gross income, and office space, 4.9 percent, are the two largest expenses faced by most doctors. For mid-eastern states, which include New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, malpractice premiums take 3.7 percent. The insurance companies have taken in far more in premiums than they have paid out in claims. Claims in Years to Come An example is Medical Liability Mutual, the company that covers about 80 percent of the state's physicians. From 1976 to 1981, the amount collected in insurance premiums has risen steadily from $84.2 million to $163.2 million. Over the same period, the amount paid out by the company has also climbed, from $347,000 to $35.5 million. But the companies say they need to collect the higher premiums to protect them against claims that may not be settled for years to come. For example, Mr. Fager of Medical Liability Mutual said the company's actuaries predicted that a total of $350 million would eventually be paid on malpractice incidents in 1981. Because that money would be paid out over the course of many years - as claims against that year were filed - the actuaries said the company would need the $163.2 million collected in premiums, which in turn would earn sufficient income from being invested to meet the total claims of $350 million. Melvin L. Goldberg, a staff lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, disputed the notion that such high premiums were warranted. He said it was unnecessary for companies to predict what claims would be filed 10 years in the future. Instead, he said, the companies might shift to ''the claims-made method of coverage'' - in which the insurance company pays its claims from premiums collected in a given year. He said the method follows the practice of other types of insurance. Estimating the Income Mr. Goldberg also said the companies consistently underestimated the amount of investment income they would earn from the premiums they collect. ''In 1981, when they asked for increases in premiums of 210 percent and 52 percent, they said they would earn only 8.5 percent on investments. That is ridiculously low,'' he added. Medical Liability Mutual indicated to the state in 1981 that it had substantial investments earning up to 19 percent. In October 1981, the Insurance Superintendent, Albert B. Lewis, granted Medical Liability Mutual a 21.3 percent increase in premiums, as well as a supplemental 5 percent increase. Medical Malpractice was granted a 27.8 percent increase. ''The bottom line,'' said Dr. Wolfe of the Public Citizen Health Research Group. ''is that they seem to be accumulating assets at an extraordinary rate and at a rate beyond what is necessary to cover their losses.'' However, Dr. Edward Siegel, the executive vice president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, finds such arguments unpersuasive. His group is a member of the Medical Liability Reform Coalition. ''The central problem is we are living in a consumer-oriented litigious society,'' said Dr. Siegel. ''That means that the people of this country and the people of New York feel that if things don't go right - whether with product liablity or with a doctor - they have to sue somebody.''

499-> AROUND THE NATION; Townsfolk Rally for Aid As Fire Below Burns On
Church bells rang, sirens blasted and flags waved in the smoky air as residents rallied today for government help to ''Set Centralia Free'' from the perils of a 20-year-old underground fire in abandoned coal mine shafts. ''What Centralians are really saying,'' said Mayor John Wondolowski, is 'We want to preserve our community and we want to have some input in its destiny.' '' More than 30 families have relocated since 1969 to escape the fire and the carbon monoxide it emits. The Federal Government has invested $850,000 in a drilling project to determine the location and intensity of the fire. A consulting firm's recommendations are due in June.

501-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
The Real Toy Buyers T he snow began in Madison Square yesterday as a hundred children broke their huddle and marched - following a promotion director as if a Pied Piper - to ''welcome'' buyers to the annual 10-day market at the Toy Fair Building at 200 Fifth Avenue. ''I'm freezing!'' came like a chorus through chattering teeth. The little parade was brave with pink, blue and yellow balloons. Banners praised the Madison Square Boys Club, which lent the most youngsters. There were also Boys Scouts and Pixies - ''younger than Brownie Scouts'' - from the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, who explained that they were ''honoring the toy manufacturers.'' Asked just why, 6-year-old Samantha Sternberg said, ''I don't know,'' but her brother Timothy, 12, responded, ''Because they make toys for us.'' Connie Binghieri of the boys club said it was ''to give my children an experience - to know a little bit about promotion and toys and New York.'' The youngsters were given lunch and a toy, but they didn't get to welcome any of the buyers, who are expected by the thousands beginning today. Carl Eisenberg, a toy-company executive, said, watching the children, ''These are the toy buyers.''

502-> BLATTY SUE TIMES ON BEST-SELLER LIST
William Blatty, author of ''The Exorcist,'' filed a $9 million suit Friday against The New York Times, claiming the newspaper has damaged sales of his new book by negligently leaving it off its best-seller list. The Superior Court suit, which asks $4 million in actual damages and $5 million in punitive damages, charges that enough copies of the novel ''Legion,'' published by Simon & Schuster, have been sold to warrant its inclusion on the list. Mr. Blatty's lawyer, John Farrell, said that more than 84,000 copies of the book have been distributed by the publisher, but the lawyer did not have current retail sales figures. The New York Times best-seller list is based on weekly sales reports obtained from a scientifically selected sample of bookstores throughout the United States. The sales figures represent books that have actually been sold to the public. Elliot Sanger, manager of corporate relations for The Times, said, ''I haven't seen the complaint. Even if we had seen it, we have a policy of not commenting on pending litigation.''

503-> MUSIC: MINNESOTANS PLAY AT CARNEGIE HALL
GIVEN the snowy weather, the Minnesota Orchestra's concert last Friday evening was not badly attended. Still, it is a pity that all the windy howling outdoors seemed to have kept so many people away from the civilized sounds emanating from the stage of Carnegie Hall. The Minnesota played like a solid, highly professional orchestra - managing well the bright colors and high-powered emotions of Barber's ''Medea's Dance of Vengeance,'' accompanying with grace in Mozart's B flat Piano Concerto (K. 456) and, in the Brahms Second Symphony, demonstrating a sturdy horn section and strings that could play with power, and respond to moments of delicacy as well. Neville Marriner, the Minnesota's conductor, gave all three pieces a buoyant yet unforced momentum. The first movement of the Brahms was never rushed, but the finale had great force. Radu Lupu, the soloist in the Mozart concerto, placed his sophisticated technique at the service of simplicity; and his relaxed elegance and Mr. Marriner's equally elegant conducting made the finale a pleasure. In the first movement, these two high-quality ingredients had more trouble coming into balance - Mr. Lupu's tempos tending always to push slightly ahead of his accompaniment and forcing Mr. Marriner to follow at the piano's heels in uneasy pursuit. One more rehearsal might have made this a collaboration to remember.

504-> BERKELEY DIVIDED BY A NEW DISPUTE OVER FREEDOM OF SPEECH
A civil rights dispute evoking the Free Speech Movement of 19 years ago has gripped the University of California campus here since a demonstration interrupted a lecture by Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nations. Mrs. Kirkpatrick's lecture on Feb. 15, on the subject of ''Human Rights and Wrongs in the United States,'' was disrupted by demonstrators organized by Students Against Intervention in El Salvador. When she felt she could not be heard above the uproar of such chants as ''U.S. out of El Salvador'' and ''Genocide in Guatemala,'' Mrs. Kirkpatrick left the rostrum. Jesse Choper, dean of the Boalt Hall Law School, attempted to restore order, admonishing, ''You children should be ashamed of yourselves.'' After a delay, Mrs. Kirkpatrick returned to finish her lecture. Second Lecture Canceled But overnight she announced that ''urgent business'' in Washington required cancellation of her second address the next day. Later she said, ''I have not seen a group so interested in denying free speech and discussion.'' Just as in 1964, when students organized the Free Speech Movement to contest campus rules barring political activity, the issues have divided faculty and students. But the issues are much different. Then the students were perceived as fighting to open the campus to discussion of current issues. This time, in the view of the demonstrators' critics, the students and their off-campus supporters have frustrated free discussion to force an audience to hear their slogans. A spokesman for the demonstrators defended their actions. ''I think it was right,'' said Robert Bryzman, a law student active in the group. ''The purpose was to show that people are angry. We've got to look at what is going on in Central America. The purpose was not to stop her from talking, but when you have a demonstration like that, you are not going to have exact control. To me it is important that we boo. ''And when a Government official comes on campus,'' he added, ''we have a right to be heard. We were saying something horrible is going on in Central America.'' Plans for Handling Disruptions Roderic B. Park, vice chancellor of the Berkeley campus, said, ''We have to have some way to deal with those who do not want the university to be a marketplace of ideas, who want to oppress anything they do not want to hear.'' He said that the university had made plans to deal with future disruptions but that to discuss them ''would be like a quarterback announcing his plays.'' An undercurrent of unhappiness over the lack of any disciplinary proceeding against student demonstrators runs through talk with faculty members. Mr. Park said that campus officers had provided names of some students whom they recognized among the demonstrators, but that the administration had decided against disciplinary proceedings. The student senate has twice refused to take any significant action to criticize the demonstrators and their organization. First the senate rejected a proposal to examine the organization's accounting of the $1,250 it was allotted this year from student fees. Then, on Wednesday night, it rejected a firm letter of apology that was to be sent to Mrs. Kirkpatrick, choosing instead to send a letter stating that some students disapproved of the demonstration but that ''the intent was to register a vocal dissent against the human rights policy of the Reagan Administration and not to prevent the audience from hearing.'' The faculty Committee on Academic Freedom called on the chancellor, Ira Michael Heyman, to ''assure the campus community expeditiously'' that he intended to maintain free speech on the campus. This resolution will be debated at the March 14 meeting of the Academic Senate, to which all faculty members belong. Several faculty members have already expressed support for the demonstrators in letters to editors, but majority faculty sentiment seems to oppose what they did. One off-campus sentiment was expressed by Mayor Eugene Newport of Berkeley, who wrote to The Daily Californian, the campus paper, ''I am heartened to see that students are once again taking their role as the conscience of society seriously.''

505-> GEORGE ZAZOFSKY DIES AT 69; RETIRED VIOLINIST AND TEACHER
George Zazofsky, a retired assistant concertmaster and first violinist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, died Friday at the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 69 years old and had homes in Stockbridge, Mass., and Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Zazofsky, a native of Boston, graduated from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He started his performing career with the All-American Youth Symphony, conducted by Leopold Stokowski, before joining the Boston Symphony in 1941. He was a member and later director of the Zimbler Sinfonietta, an ensemble of the Boston Symphony's string players. A New York Times critic, lauding the group after its 1954 Town Hall debut in New York, wrote that Mr. Zazofsky ''impressed as a thoroughly dependable musician.'' After his retirement from the orchestra, Mr. Zazofsky taught the violin at the University of Miami in Coral Gables for 10 years until 1978. He also taught at Brandeis University, the New England Conservatory of Music and, at the time of his death, at the Boston University Tanglewood Institute. He was founding chairman and past president of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, an organization of union musicians. Mr. Zazofsky is survived by his wife, Edyth Gombert Zazofsky; two sons, Eugene F. and Peter A.; a daughter, Erika Goldberg; two brothers, and three sisters.

506-> GOOD NEWS OFTEN BRINGS MORE NEWS
WASHINGTON Feb. 20 - There hasn't been much good economic news in recent months. But when there has been, President Reagan has often managed to take full advantage of it, to the point that a pattern seems to be emerging. Since December, Mr. Reagan has held seven news conferences, two formal evening affairs and five impromptu minigatherings. Four of the seven have fallen on days when the Government has reported some distinctly positive economic news. Last week, the President's formal evening news conference came on the day it was announced that housing starts in January had soared 36 percent, to the highest level since September 1979, and that industrial production had risen nine-tenths of 1 percent, the first significant increase since July 1981. All of that allowed Mr. Reagan to say in the East Room, before a national television audience, that ''The recovery is beginning to flex its muscles.'' On Feb. 4, taking the other route, the President held a mininews conference the day the January unemployment rate was announced. Observing that the rate had dropped to 10.4 percent from the previous month's rate of 10.8, the first decline in 17 months, the President declared, again with television cameras zeroing in, ''America is on the mend.'' 'A Certain Correlation' ''There is a certain amount of correlation,'' Larry M. Speakes, the deputy White House press secretary, said of the scheduling of news conferences and the release of good news. ''But it is not 100 percent.'' Noting that except for inflation, there had been very little encouraging news on the economy until last month, he said, ''If we waited for good news to have a press conference, there would have been some months we wouldn't have done anything.'' Since Mr. Reagan took office, he has held 27 formal and mininews conferences, according to the official White House count. Of these, 10 were held on a day that major economic news was reported. But in 1981 and 1982, the news wasn't positive very often, and Mr. Reagan struggled to put it in a better light. The President, though Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is informed of all major economic data the day before it is released officially. But Mr. Speakes said that the White House staff did not often learn the news until the meeting of the senior staff on the morning of the release date. ''We can't go to bed knowing there is good news,'' he said. Mr. Speakes added that formal news conferences were generally planned far enough in advance that the possibility of good economic news did not figure in the decision. But the mininews conferences, he said, often were held in response to such news. When the unemployment figure came out, he reported, ''We said, 'Let's get the President out on that one.' ''

507-> Col. William J. Walsh; Led New York Regents
Col. William J. Walsh, retired, who served as Chancellor of the State Board of Regents in the 1940's and as executive assistant director of the New York City Selective Service Administration from 1940 to 1942, died Sunday at the West Palm Beach-Martin County (Fla.) Hospital. He was 84 years old, and had homes in Hobe Sound, Fla., and Greenwich, Conn. As a major in the National Guard, he served as an executive assistant in the administration of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia until 1934, when he was named executive secretary of the Armory Board of New York City. In 1940, he left his post as executive secretary of the city's Department of the Comptroller to direct Selective Service in city. He was called to active duty in 1942, commanding antiaircraft artillery units in the United States with the rank of colonel. He later became a member of the War Department Manpower Board. Colonel Walsh began his public service career working in W. Arthur Cunningham's successful campaign for city comptroller in 1933. In 1937, he was named chairman of the Speakers' Bureau for Mayor La Guardia and his running mates. The following year, he was campaign manager for James H. Fay, who was elected to New York City's 16th Congressional seat. He left Princeton University in 1917 to enlist in the Army, attaining the rank of second lieutenant. After World War I, he attended Columbia University and New York Law School. He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Wilshire; a son, W. James Jr., of Princeton, N.J.; two sisters, Anne, and Mary Gamache, and three granddaughters.

508-> Who Shall Head the Fed?
President Reagan said recently he had not yet thought about whether to reappoint or replace Paul Volcker when his term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board expires in August. This is probably the most important appointive decision Mr. Reagan still faces in his own term. It's time to think about it, and here's how: The Fed's chairman has enormous authority over America's economy and currency, and thus over world economic conditions. His office manages the nation's money supply, largely by buying and selling Government securities and by regulating bank reserves; it expands the money supply when the economy is slack and cuts it back when inflation threatens. Its monetary policies can be more flexible than Congress's slow legislation of tax and spending policies, and they can be above politics, since board members are not elected. Indeed, the United States' central bank is nominally ''independent'' of the Administration of the day. But it has to adjust to a President's strategies and usually does. Most recent chairmen of the Fed have been skillful leaders of the board and effective diplomats in coaxing action out of the Bank of England or the West German Bundesbank - to bail out Mexico by sundown, for example. Presidents, understandably, worry about the compatibility of a Fed chairman, usually inherited from another Administration. They wonder if he can be counted on to wield his exceptional power in politically desirable ways. But it is more important that they first ask whether he can be trusted professionally. Mr. Volcker has met these tests as well as any likely replacement, but Mr. Reagan may nonetheless see profit in making a change. In the public's eye, Mr. Volcker has been uniquely responsible for the high interest rates that prolonged the recession. Although the Administration explicitly endorsed his policies, and contributed at least as much to keeping interest rates high, it may be tempted to make him the scapegoat and claim for itself his success in driving down inflation. With hindsight, it is clear that the Fed did pursue its restrictive course too long and too hard, but it has now reversed course. If interest rates hang high and choke the recovery, the basic fault will be the reckless budget deficits projected by the Administration. But Mr. Volcker would be a convenient culprit, all the more so because some Reagan people don't like hearing how smart he's been in saving the country from even worse consequences. Mr. Volcker has acquired a stature and experience that justify reappointment. But if he is to be replaced, the decision ought to be made well before August and before the shape of the 1984 electionyear economy is known; anything that looks like a political invasion of the Fed could truly alarm the financial markets. And any replacement will need to be a person with impressive credentials, neither a strict, tight-money monetarist nor a loose reflationist. The President will have to move with care, which is why it's time to get moving.

511-> WHAT SAM ERVIN THINKS WOMEN WANT
To the Editor: Sam J. Ervin Jr.'s attitude (''E.R.A.'s Time Is Gone,'' Op-Ed Aug. 1) is representative of the thinking that prevented the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment originally. Women unfamiliar with the ''beguiling and deceptive'' wording of the amendment - equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex - were led to believe that a parade of horrors would result, rather than the inherent gains to which women are entitled. As a result, women are now denied equal protection under the law, a fact that Mr. Ervin neglected to mention. Nothing in the E.R.A. says that women will be drafted or that coed bathrooms will be installed in public schools. Why should a change like this be imminent? Does the right to equality presuppose the loss of the right to privacy? Separate but equal bathrooms (Brown v. Board of Ed.) would meet the middle level of scrutiny needed in gender classification cases, whereas it was insufficient for the strict scrutiny necessary in racial classifications. Mr. Ervin's argument regarding support obligations is clearly outdated: Laws that impose the financial burdens on the husband solely on account of sex have eroded. Most states today look to the earning capabilities of both spouses in determining the party responsible for the family's maintenance. And we can hardly envision the desegregation of sexes in hospitals, jails, schools and prisons in a society that has yet to fully implement desegregation by race. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has had final jurisdiction over the Constitution since Marbury v. Madison. Why should women's rights be any different? Still, what is most shocking about Mr. Ervin's attitude is that he presumes to understand what women want and concludes that, rather than equal treatment, women would prefer pampering or protection.

512-> SHARON WILL STAY IN ISRAELI CABINET; DUTIES UNCERTAIN
Ariel Sharon, who submitted his resignation as Israel's Defense Minister on Friday, said today that he would accept Prime Minister Menachem Begin's offer to remain in the Cabinet as a minister without portfolio. The Cabinet accepted the arrangement. Mr. Sharon announced his decision in a two-sentence letter formally notifying Mr. Begin of his resignation as Minister of Defense. The Prime Minister is to assume the Defense post temporarily upon the approval of Parliament Monday. But Mr. Begin ''does not wish to hold the Defense portfolio for long,'' a Cabinet official said, ''and he will shortly appoint a Defense Minister.'' Arens Called 'Preferred' Moshe Arens, an aeronautical engineer who has been Ambassador to the United States for a year, is ''the preferred candidate,'' the official said. In allowing Mr. Sharon, who is struggling to retain a political role, to remain in the Cabinet, Mr. Begin appeared to have salvaged his coalition Government, which would have suffered several defections from right-wing members if the Defense Minister had been dismissed entirely. Such defections could have eroded Mr. Begin's majority in Parliament to the point where new elections would have been unavoidable. New elections were not necessarily a danger for Mr. Begin, who has been making a good showing in the public-opinion polls, but they would be unwelcome for the smaller parties on which he depends for the stability of his coalition. In backroom bargaining last week, Mr Begin reportedly told the National Religious Party that in return for its loyalty and its promise not to switch into a coalition with the opposition Labor Party, he would take no action that would bring down the Government. Attorney General Sees No Conflict To forestall charges of political expediency, however, the Cabinet called Attorney General Yitzhak Zamir into its session today for an official opinion on how the moves met the recommendations of the state commission that investigated the Beirut massacre. The Attorney General said he could find no conflict between Mr. Sharon's remaining in the Cabinet and the commission's recommendations. The commission, finding that Israeli leaders bore ''indirect responsibility'' for the killings of hundreds of Palestinians by Lebanese Christian Phalangists last September, called on Mr. Sharon to ''draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office.'' Or ''if necessary,'' the commission recommended that the Prime Minister ''consider whether he should exercise his authority under Section 21-A(a) of the Basic Law: the Government, according to which 'the Prime Minister may, after informing the Cabinet of his intention to do so, remove a minister from office.' '' 'One Cannot Say' Mr. Zamir concluded that while the recommendation was equivocal in that it could refer either to resignation from the post of Defense Minister or dismissal from the Cabinet entirely, ''one cannot say that when the Defense Minister gives up his position as Minister of Defense - which is the position to which the commission was referring when it deliberated - he has not drawn personal conclusions.'' The Cabinet voted last Thursday, 16 to 1, with Mr. Sharon opposed, to accept the commission's recommendations, which also called for three top generals to leave their posts. The panel, headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Yitzhak Kahan, concluded that Israeli leaders should have realized the probability of a massacre when they sent the Phalangists into the Palestinian refugee camps and should have moved quickly to stop the militiamen once they began to receive reports of the killings. Education Minister Zevulun Hammer of the National Religious Party said, ''I think the Cabinet showed moral and political strength by establishing the inquiry commission and by deciding to accept its recommendations.'' A Liberal Wants Sharon Out But Dror Zeigerman, a Liberal in Mr. Begin's Likud bloc, demanded Mr. Sharon's departure from the Cabinet. ''He is not fit to be a member of the Government,'' Mr. Zeigerman said. He said, however, that he would vote with the Government when Parliament considers two no-confidence motions Monday. A former Energy Minister, Yitzhak Berman, who resigned last September to protest the Government's initial refusal to establish an inquiry commission, said he would also vote with the Government. Shimon Peres, head of the Labor Party, urged that the Government resign. So did Mordechai Ben-Porat, a minister without portfolio. ''I told the Prime Minister and the Cabinet that the entire Government is responsible for the conduct of the Defense Minister,'' he said. ''The Government must draw conclusions and resign.'' He proposed a government of national unity, including Labor. Mr. Sharon's letter was brief. ''Dear Mr. Prime Minister,'' it said. ''Subsequent to our telephone conversation of Friday, 11 February 1983, and in light of the Cabinet decision of Thursday, 10 February 1983, I declare once more that I will honor the Cabinet decision to transfer the post of Defense Minister from me. I would like to make it clear that I have no intention of resigning from the Cabinet and I will continue to serve in it as minister. Sincerely yours, Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister.'' No Resignation, Technically Technically, Mr. Sharon's departure as Defense Minister was not a formal resignation, since legally a minister cannot resign and remain a Cabinet member; he must resign from the Cabinet entirely, or remain in his post. Mr. Sharon agreed to be transferred from one position to another, from Defense Minister to minister without portfolio. This placed the matter under Article 17 of the Basic Law, which reads: ''The Government may change the distribution of functions among the Ministers. The change shall require the approval of the Knesset.'' There was no indication that there would be any problems in getting Parliament's approval. Mr. Sharon met with Prime Minister Begin for an hour today to discuss changes in the army as a result of the commission's recommendations, which called for the Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen.Rafael Eytan; the Director of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, and the Beirut division commander, Brig. Gen. Amos Yaron, to leave their posts. General Eytan is scheduled to retire when his term ends in April. Israel radio said candidates to succeed him included Maj. Gen. Moshe Levy, now Deputy Chief of Staff, and Maj. Gen. Avidor Ben-Gal, a former head of Northern Command who was summoned back from a leave in the United States last summer to command a division in Lebanon. Israel radio said General Eytan had recommended that Maj. Gen. Uri Simhoni, now director of the training branch, become intelligence chief and that General Yaron become head of training.

513-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Coin-Toss Suspense
At 6 P.M. last Thursday, Ray Patterson, the president and general manager of the Houston Rockets, left the lobby of the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, where general managers, coaches and owners were gathered for yesterday's National Basketball Association All-Star Game. ''I have to go to my room and watch the Virginia and North Carolina game,'' Patterson told several general managers he had been talking with. With the possibility of having the first two selections in the college draft, his own and the Cleveland Cavaliers', Patterson had a large interest in the game - Ralph Sampson, Virginia's 7-foot-4-inch center. Philadelphia had owned Cleveland's top draft choice, but the Rockets received the pick from the 76ers in the trade that sent Moses Malone to the 76ers. Houston and Cleveland currently have the worst records in the Eastern and Western Conferences, respectively. If they finish that way, there would be no need for the usual coin toss to determine who gets the first draft pick. Patterson has said Sampson would be his top choice. Watching Sampson dunk the ball during the game, Patterson said: ''Absolutely fantastic. He's going to be even more fantastic in the pros when he isn't bothered by all those zone defenses.'' At halftime of the North Carolina-Virginia game, it was announced that Cleveland had won its third straight game by defeating the Indiana Pacers. It was news that Patterson did not enjoy hearing. ''The Pacers are only three and half games behind Cleveland for the worst record,'' Patterson said. ''If you look at the schedule it favors Indiana finishing last. The Pacers have more road games and have to play more above-.500 teams. We have already beaten the Pacers twice but haven't played the Cavaliers yet. I wonder who the second best player in the country is? I think we will be in the coin toss. It was only a 50-50 chance when we got Kareem.'' Patterson was alluding to 1969, when he was the president of the Milwaukee Bucks and they were involved in a coin toss with the Phoenix Suns for the first choice. The Bucks wound up with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor. ''Actually, the Suns guessed wrong in the coin flip,'' Patterson said. ''Do you know who the second pick in the draft was - Neal Walk. ''If we get into a coin toss this time, I would think our owner would do the calling. I would want him to. With Ralph Sampson, the stakes are high and he should make the decision. But if we get lucky, maybe there won't be a coin toss.''

514-> MUSIC: SCRIABIN'S 'FIRE'
SCRIABIN planned to transform the universe with his ''Mysterium'' - a composition that would make of his music a new religion. The audience would be devotionally robed in white, worshiping at the composer's own temple. The event would dwarf Wagner's music dramas. Sound and light and taste and touch and smell would combine to stop the movement of time itself. Scriabin died in 1915, having finished only some sketches for his revelatory musical gospel. World War I would have outdone his spectacle in any case. But Scriabin's 1911 work ''Prometheus: Poem of Fire'' could have served as an adequate prelude. It too called for colored lights to accompany the music and told a mythic tale of man, cosmos and fire. The work never received an adequate performance in Scriabin's lifetime, because of the lack of video apparatus. But the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, bringing with it the latest in technological illumination, presented the work in Carnegie Hall on Saturday night, under the direction of Sergiu Comissiona. A laser-light-projection system, developed by Lowell Cross at the University of Iowa School of Music - and bearing the unmythical name Video-Laser III - was meant to realize the composer's intentions. Scriabin had called for a ''clavier a lumiere,'' a keyboard that would link colored lights with sounds. According to his theories, there was a direct connection between musical and optical frequencies. This work was meant to bring both to the apocalyptic pitch of fire itself. This performance was far from the first in recent years, as the taste for ''performance'' art has grown. In another, more than 10 years ago at Yale University, for example, in the era of the ''light show'' and the ''happening,'' the concert hall was flooded with smoke, and colored stage lights were set up in the aisles and balconies. Each listener was provided with a metallic strip of reflective Mylar so the shafts of light would scatter against each body into the smoky mists. That performance didn't make the music any more profound, but it at least had the virtue of spectacle. The Baltimore Symphony performance, far from providing a hint of ''mysterium'' was more an ode to the electric light than a poem of fire. A movie screen was hung above the orchestra, just below the arch of the Carnegie stage. Blue, red and green laser patterns swirled about, either in a haze of pulsation, or in fine-lined oscilloscopic vibrations. A few halfhearted streams of smoke emerged from the balconies, and the sketchy color patterns amateurishly extended off the screen onto the curtain and ceiling. Meanwhile, Mr. Comissiona, assisted by Jeffrey Chappell at the piano, James March at the ''clavier,'' and by the vocalizations of members of the Baltimore Symphony Chorus, gave a stolid, respectable performance. But more tastelessness, recklessness, passion, devotion and fanaticism would have helped. There was even an assurance in the program notes of the lighting system's ''design criteria for audience safety.'' This fire was tamed before it was let loose. Much of the rest of the program, though well played, suffered from the same defects. Mr. Comissiona built his program around the French and Russian schools, including a flashy but slightly unclear performance of the Introduction and Cortege from Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Le Coq d'Or'' and a somber version of Debussy's ''Nocturnes.'' Saint-Saens's Violin Concerto No. 3 in B minor received an elegantly polished and perfectly proportioned performance by the soloist, Cho-liang Lin. He made the work's fires seem sweet and lovely - but they gave off little heat.

515-> N.C. STATE BEATS VIRGINIA FOR TITLE
If you looked at the records, the talent and the history, it seemed obvious North Carolina State had no business winning the 30th annual Atlantic Coast Conference basketball tournament. Obviously, the Wolfpack never looked. A day after eliminating North Carolina, the defending national and conference champion, in the semifinals, North Carolina State beat Virginia, the nation's second-ranked team, 81-78, today in the final. The outcome surprised most of the capacity crowd of 16,723 in the Omni. It certainly surprised Virginia, an 8 1/2-point favorite here and one of the favorites in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, which starts later this week. By winning, North Carolina State qualified automatically for that 52-team competition. Three hours after the final ended, Virginia and North Carolina were chosen for at-large berths in the tournament. So was Maryland, which was eliminated in the first round here by Georgia Tech. North Carolina State had a difficult road reaching the final, beating Wake Forest by a point and North Carolina by 7 in overtime. Meanwhile, Virginia routed Duke by 43 points and Georgia Tech by 29. 'Family-Type Situation' But North Carolina State has a fiesty coach in 37-year-old Jim Valvano. It has three starting seniors in Sidney Lowe, Dereck Whittenburg and Thurl Lee Bailey who took up their coach's challenge to accept leadership. ''We have a family-type situation,'' said Bailey. The family had a great day. North Carolina State took the lead for good at 67-65 with 7 minutes 2 seconds remaining and held off Virginia's strong finish. Bailey scored 24 points and kept Ralph Sampson, Virginia's 7-foot-4-inch all-America center, in check despite Sampson's 24 points and 12 rebounds. Sampson had only 6 points in the second half and was stripped of the ball as he was going up for a basket with 30 seconds to play. Virginia trailed at the time, 78-75, and after Terry Gannon took the ball away from Sampson, Bailey hit a free throw for a 4-point lead. Othell Wilson cut the deficit to 79-78 with 20 seconds to go, but Whittenburg hit two free throws with 6 seconds remaining. Wolfpack Guards Excel Most of the North Carolina State scoring was handled by the guards -Lowe with 18 points, Whittenburg with 15 and Terry Gannon with 12. Gannon made four of six 3-point field-goal attempts, Lowe four of seven. Lowe was named the tournament's outstanding player. Jim Miller started at forward for Virginia and scored 16 points. He replaced Tim Mullen, a sophomore from Ridgewood (N.J.) High School, who sprained a ligament in the right knee against North Carolina. Pending a medical examination Monday, Virginia officials said Mullen was probably lost for the playoffs. The game started horribly for Virginia and Sampson. After Sampson had opened the scoring with a free throw, North Carolina State raced to a 12-1 lead. In that stretch, Lowe twice stole the ball and dribbled down the court and scored. Meanwhile, Sampson drove for the basket and missed his shot, then traveled, then threw away the ball, then missed a turnaround jumper. Virginia turned over the ball five times, and a disgusted Coach Terry Holland yelled an obscenity at his players. Sampson Has Problems Virginia quickly scored 9 straight points, and it seemed inevitable that the Cavaliers would pull away. Besides, North Carolina State often used three guards to provide speed, so Sampson was guarded one on one and should have had many scoring opportunities. Still, Sampson did not bury the Wolfpack. He did not even score in the last 7:48. In that period, he missed three shots, he had the ball stripped from him once and he twice saw passes intercepted before they reached him. ''You can never stop Ralph Sampson,'' said Bailey. ''You try to control him.'' North Carolina State was helped by a technical foul against Jim Larranaga, a Virginia assistant coach, with 5:11 remaining. Whittenburg made both free throws, North Carolina State gained posession and Whittenburg sank a 16-foot off-balance jumper. That 4-point surge stretched North Carolina State's lead to 75-66, and it held on from there. 'We Lost It' Virginia closed its deficit to 79-78 on Othell Wilson's 3-point field goal with 20 seconds remaining. Then Whittenburg sank two insurance free throws with 6 seconds left, and North Carolina State won. ''I think we lost it,'' said Sampson, who did not win an A.C.C. conference tournament in his four years at Virginia. ''I don't think they beat us.'' ''We won,'' said Lowe, ''because Coach is a dreamer. He said something good was going to happen to this club. He tells us his dreams, and the dreams came true today.''

516-> COSMOS TRIUMPH, 3-1, IN RAIN
The weather was foul and the play often matched it tonight as 19,868 rain-drenched people saw the Cosmos defeat the Tampa Bay Rowdies, 3-1, at Giants Stadium. The victory gave the Cosmos a 21-8 record and a 5-point lead in the race for the league championship over the Vancouver Whitecaps, who beat the Seattle Sounders, 3-2, in overtime tonight. ''Forget this game,'' said Franz Beckenbauer of the Cosmos, making a face that expressed disgust. ''Just remember that we've won seven in a row - that's a good sign.'' The game was odd in many ways - from the storm that prevailed throughout, to the violent play of the normally gentlemanly Rowdies, to the goal scored by the player who covets assists, not goals, Vladislav Bogicevic. A thunderstorm struck just as the players lined up for the start of the game, hurling down torrents of rain. Within 10 minutes, lightning knocked out several banks of floodlights, leaving semi-darkness, and sweeping sheets of rain turned the artificial turf into a giant puddle. Lightning Interferes Soccer is usually played regardless of rain, but the lightning was considered dangerous, so the referee sent the players back to their locker rooms. The game started 1 hour 19 minutes late at 8:25 P.M. The Rowdies finished with 28 fouls to the Cosmos' 16 and with five yellow cards to 1 for the Cosmos. ''Tampa played very rough tonight, always kicking you no matter if you had the ball or you didn't have the ball,'' said Bogicevic, who got no assists and remains three shy of tying the North American Soccer League record of 30 in one season. ''I'm really surprised. We always play nice games with Tampa - hard games, but very clean, very fair. Tonight was like war. I don't understand it - they are out of the playoffs, so why?'' Perhaps the frustration of their most dismal season might explain the Rowdies' behavior. They have a 7-21 record - only 1-12 on the road - and have missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Bogicevic Scores Bogicevic, who is pursuing the assists record set by Alan Hinton of Vancouver in 1978, expressed his frustration: ''It just doesn't go,'' he said. ''I gave passes tonight that were 100 percent sure goals; they must be goals. I told the other players, 'You guys are gonna pay one day, you're gonna want the ball and I won't give it. I'll score myself.' '' And he did score tonight in the 30th minute, showing as much creativity as he had on many of his artful assists. At the edge of the penalty area with the ball, Bogicevic suddenly shifted his weight left, as if to pass across the area, and a defender shifted the same way. Instantly Bogie straightened and lashed the ball with his left foot, driving it just beyond the reach of the defender and into the lower right corner. With 2:27 left in the first half, Roberto Cabanas, gave the Cosmos a 2-0 lead with his 23d goal of the season. This one was a gift. A centering pass by Steve Moyers skimmed just beyond the diving grasp of the Rowdies' goalie, Jurgen Stars, and Cabanas was alone as the ball rolled invitingly across the empty goalmouth. He tapped it in. David Brcic, who started in goal for the Cosmos in place of Hubert Birkenmeier for the first time in 13 games, lost his shutout with only 6:02 left, when a substitute, Michel Lacevic, scored on a header.

517-> WHERE'S THE LEGISLATION TO HELP COMBAT VIOLENT CRIME?
VIOLENT crime continues to spill over into Nassau County at an ever-increasing rate. The atrocities last year at the Sea Crest Diner in Old Westbury and the brutal robbery and murder of Leon Stern, an attorney, at his home in Roslyn Harbor are some of the most publicized incidents of terror in our county. Invariably, the vicious and depraved acts of violence are committed by people with long criminal records, predominantly from the city, who should have been removed from society a long time ago. Had these criminals been handled appropriately the first time they served notice on us that crime would be their avocation, many of their victims would still be alive. Although most experts and professionals in the criminal justice establishment agree that the system is disjointed and in dire need of more coordination and cooperation, they will invariably point to outdated and ineffective laws under which they must operate. However, the increased numbers and the violent nature of recent crimes simply cry out for comprehensive legal reforms. There is no longer a valid excuse for continued nonaction, political complacency or explanations that dismiss law abuses as a sign of our times. There are remedies that are pragmatic, affordable and accepted as such by officials with whom I have spoken. Once in a while, these measures find their way to Albany and occasionally even find sponsorship by ranking legislators in both houses. When that happens, these sponsors invariably see to it that their efforts are given sufficient publicity. But what happens to these bills? Why are their sponsors so content to see them bottled up in committee? Described are some of the more pressing issues and more recent bills that were put together only to be allowed to die in committee. 1. Parents and legal guardians are supposed to be responsible for the acts of minors in their charge. Acts of vandalism and burglary, in an amount up to $1,500, are supposed to be covered under three statutes on the books now. There have been legislative efforts to increase the amount of restitution to $5,000, but these attempts have not succeeded. And under the existing statutes, a judge is allowed discretionary powers to allow for ''hardship'' for these parents and legal guardians that all too often results in inordinately small, if any, restitution to the victims. Where does such ''justice'' leave the victims? Our way of dispensing justice leaves them frustrated and disillusioned. Who can blame them, especially when there are such remedies as placing liens on the property of people who have been neglecting their children at the expense of their neighbors? 2. Occasionally, there are bills sponsored by legislators that are supported, indeed demanded, by professionals in the criminal justice system and the public at large. One such action was recommended by the Task Force on Vandalism of Nassau County, on which I have been serving as legislative chairman. This much needed measure, which was sought by Nassau County District Attorney Denis E. Dillon, deals with opening of the files and records of repeat juvenile offenders. It would give the prosecutor and the court the ability to properly evaluate the criminal record of a particular offender, to treat, in fact, a person with an extensive record of antisocial behavior differently from a first-time offender. Why should a youngster with a record of more than 10 burglaries be treated the same under the law as a youngster who was peer-pressured into his one and only brush with the law? The fact that this youngster was allowed to continue to commit these burglaries before he was even 16 years of age shows the utter ineffectiveness of our Family Court system. One might even call it a contributing factor in the criminal career of this young offender. What happened to this bill, which might have deterred many criminally inclined youngsters from becoming criminal adults? The bill was not allowed out of committee, either in the Assembly or in the Senate. 3. Another example of inaction in Albany that was against the best interest of the people is the failure to amend the statute under which an offender who commits any number of violent felonies may serve no more than 15 to 30 years for all of them. The bill was passed in the Senate but was not allowed out of the Assembly committee. If passed in both houses and signed into law, these bills would have taken the ''cap'' off the length of time an offender might serve. Who is powerful enough in Albany to hold back legislation that would allow people like the ''Sea Crest Diner gang'' to be put away for life instead of becoming eligible for parole after just a few years? Is any sentence, short of life imprisonment with hard labor, adequate for the inhuman acts committed by those criminals with lengthy records of similar offenses? Any legislators who allow such meaningful measures to be suppressed, shielded from publicity and discussion on the house floor, ought to be at least identified for the benefit of their constituents, so that they might be judged at the next election. Under present law, the ''Sea Crest Diner gang,'' who pleaded guilty to more than 800 felonies and were sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison, could well get away with being punished for just two of their crimes, because of the ''cap'' on sentences. What about their victims, who have been damaged psychologically or otherwise? Our lawmakers have been entrusted with the collective power to do something. They can, if they choose, see to it that measures are taken to deter future predators from dehumanizing innocent people. How can our leaders sleep at night, knowing that they failed to do what is so badly needed to deter such horrible acts in the future? In 1979, 3,150 offenders in New York City were allowed by our system to commit a total of 107,000 crimes - 34 crimes per average offender in one year! There is no doubt that there is something terribly wrong with our system that allows that to go on. These statistics were given to me by Judge Sol Wachtler of the New York Court of Appeals. Everything points to the unwillingness of the legislators to address the issue seriously. We cannot afford to sit by any longer and allow ourselves to be turned over to the whims of the criminal element. Since the matter of survival is everyone's business, the demand for action must come from the public. That demand must be supported by our local officials, both elected and appointed. We can no longer stand by and watch our elected representatives shift their responsibility to any of the others - ''that is not my department'' or ''this is not a town matter'' or ''that cannot be done on the Federal level.'' The time has come for all of us, the public and its elected and appointed officials, to work together for the common good, to stop making excuses and ''passing the buck.'' We are in grave danger of losing our very way of life to the criminals among us. If we have stopped caring for ourselves, we surely owe it to our children not to leave them a heritage based on crime, fear and lawlessness. The time is now, or there will be no hope for our children's tomorrow.

518-> Topics; Sporting With the Law; Buttoned Lips
The hottest button in town is a two-inch metal shield bearing the word JUROR in one-inch characters. These treasures are handed out to those who have answered the New York County Clerk's call to jury service. The buttons are not ornamental and have no honorific status. In fact, they are the modern equivalent of a leper's bell. Jurors waiting to serve, and wandering the courthouse halls while trials are in preparation or recess, are expected to wear the buttons. They warn away litigants, lawyers and witnesses from inadvertently saying something to a juror that could cause a miscarriage of justice, a mistrial or a misunderstanding. Even a grudging ''Good morning'' looks compromising if spoken by one side's attorney to a juror just near enough to be recognized, but far enough away to be out of earshot of the other side's attorney. The practice of so buttoning jurors may have unintended fallout. All over New York County, we imagine, children are getting their hands on JUROR buttons brought home by parents. Imagine the pleasure of giving your parents written notice that you are sitting in judgment on them - and letting them know that their attempts to communicate, particularly with admonitions subject to misinterpretation, are entirely unwelcome.

519-> RANGERS GET A LIFT IN MORALE FROM VICTORY OVER THE FLAMES
At first glance, the Rangers' 4-1 victory in Calgary Saturday night was fairly insignificant - an isolated triumph, small compared to the four straight losses that preceded it, and smaller still in light of the team's 8-17-9 record on the road this season. And the victory did not come against one of the league's top five teams but against a team of comparable rank to the Rangers in the standings. Tonight's game against the Philadelphia Flyers in Madison Square Garden will be a more significant test. Yet there were some other victories in Calgary Saturday night, subtle ones perhaps, but significant nonetheless. Glen Hanlon won an important internal battle with the spirits of doubt, which, just a few days earlier, had threatened to conquer him and perhaps even end his career. Ron Duguay finally won the right to feel good about himself after a game. And the players on the fourth forward line - Robbie Ftorek, Nick Fotiu and Kent-Erik Andersson - got far more ice time than they usually do and won respect for their solid play. But the most talked about Ranger Saturday night was Hanlon, the high-strung, redhaired goaltender. Five days earlier, in Vancouver, he had been removed from the nets after allowing four first-period goals in a game the Rangers went on to lose, 7-3. He took his failure so hard that his teammates grew concerned about his emotional stability, and wondered if he could recover. With their help, he did. In Calgary he played aggressively and sharply, stopping 28 shots. ''The guys on this team did more for me than guys I played with for five years, and I've only been here for two months,'' Hanlon said afterward, describing the efforts various Rangers had made to console and reassure him. ''When you can pull someone up who's so down, when all 20 guys do that, well, it's just something I'll never forget.'' The Garden fans recently have been booing Hanlon vehemently, something he had never experienced. He now thinks he took it too personally. ''The other guys told me about their experiences, and I read some articles about other Rangers who'd gone through it,'' Hanlon said. ''I also never thought much about the fans' frustrations of going 40 years without winning anything. The torment in Duguay's mind was eased a bit after he scored his first goal in seven games, and assisted on a goal by Barry Beck. ''I had almost forgotten what it was like to score a goal, and to feel like you helped the team,'' said Duguay, who has 19 goals and 24 assists in 65 games. His line - Duguay and Mikko Leinonen on the wings with the rookie center Chris Kontos - was the Rangers' most productive in Calgary, with 5 points. Ftorek, who is frustrated in general by the lack of ice time he gets, was frustrated in particular by a brilliant save that robbed him of a goal Friday night in Edmonton, where the Rangers lost, 3-1. On Saturday night, Ftorek made up for it with an excellent backhand shot for New York's first goal - a significant goal, because the Rangers are 24-4-2 in games in which they score first and only 5-27-7 in games in which the opponent has scored the first goal. Playoff Tickets The Rangers are conducting a limited public sale of tickets for the first two rounds of their National Hockey League playoff games through a postcard selection system. Applicants are advised to mail standard-sized postcards to the New York Rangers, Box 59, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10116, for delivery by Wednesday. Each postcard, which must be typed or printed, should include the following information: name, mailing address including zip code and the day telephone number of the applicant. Applicants whose cards are picked in a random selection will be notified by mail.

520-> BOOK FAIR OF THE OLD, FINE AND RARE
Of the thousands of first editions, old-master drawings, prints, maps, atlases, manuscripts, autographs and incunabula (books printed before 1501) from all over the world included in the New York Antiquarian Book Fair at the Seventh Regiment Armory, which opened last night and continues today and tomorrow, perhaps the most poignant piece of Americana is a tantalizing antebellum poster (from David Bauman, bookseller) put up by a master seeking a runaway slave. It reads in part: ''$100 Reward. - Ranaway from the subscriber, living near Akakeek Church, Pr. George's Co., on the night of the 26th ult., my NEGRO GIRL, calling herself SUSAN MITCHELL! taking with her a bright mulatto child, about nine months old. ''- I will give the above reward of $100 if taken in this State, Washington, or Georgetown; or $200 if taken in a Free State, and delivered to me. My address is 'Piscataway, P.O., Prince George's County, Md.' P.T. CHANDLER, April 1, 1857.'' Such posters and advertisements appeared regularly before the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery. There is an extensive collection of documents, broadsides and books relating to slavery and blacks at the fair. Occult to Orientalia More than 100 exhibitors from this country and abroad are participating, and the categories of their books and other material cover the thematic waterfront: history, children's literature, art, architecture, science, medicine, cooking, gardening, the occult and magic, travel and exploration, Orientalia and, of course, Americana. Last year, about $5 million worth of books and manuscripts were offered. The prices this year range from about $25 for some modern American first editions to $25,000 for a 1450 manuscript of a medieval poem, ''The Romance of the Rose'' (offered by Laurence Witten). This year, the fair's 23d in New York, libraries, dealers and collectors are displaying material worth a similar amount, according to the chairman of the book-fair committee, Raymond M. Wapner of Justin G. Schiller. Among the manuscripts at the fair is a collection of 75 letters written to the publisher Frank Nelson Doubleday and to his wife, Florence (the dealer is Suzanne Schlossberg). In one letter, Christopher Morley, who was a Doubleday author, writes of Doubleday as a man of foresight, helping an obscure novelist, Joseph Conrad, at a time when there was little faith in the Polish writer's ability to sell. Another letter discloses that Rudyard Kipling was so distraught when his friend Doubleday died in 1934 that he could not bring himself to write a letter of condolence, but assigned the task to his wife. There are also eight typed, signed letters from Helen Keller to Doubleday in which she addresses him as ''Effendi'' - a term suggested by his initials F.N.D. The Indian title of respect had been bestowed upon him by Kipling and was later used by those who knew him well. A somewhat different view of the publisher emerges in the biography of George Doran, a onetime partner of Doubleday, who depicted him as a benevolent despot who worshiped ''the Almighty Dollar.'' Pope Joan to Adam Smith Other highlights of the fair include works on feminism (Leona Rostenberg-Madeleine Stern, dealers), including an 18th-century French tract favoring divorce; two works on Pope Joan; two works on Joan of Arc, one of them a first edition of a history of her life by Baudot de Juilly, 1697; the first American edition of John Stuart Mill's 1869 feminist landmark, ''The Subjection of Women''; a feminist Who's Who of 1879 in French, and the 1792 edition of Mary Wollstonecraft's ''Vindication of the Rights of Women.'' There is also a first edition of Adam Smith's ''Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,'' published in London in 1776 (Rostenberg-Stern); a publication issued by the underground Pilgrim Press established at Leyden, the Netherlands, in 1617, by William Brewster, before the Pilgrims embarked for America (Rostenberg-Stern), and an autographed manuscript with notes for corrections of Beethoven's ''Emperor'' Concerto (Op.73), published in Vienna, circa 1811 (the dealer is James Cummins). In addition, there is the first English edition (1913) of Freud's ''Interpretation of Dreams'' (dealer, John Gach); the first book on tennis, by Antonio Scaino, published in Italy in 1555 (dealer, Arkway); a first edition of Rousseau's ''Social Contract,'' Amsterdam, 1762 (dealer, Jeremy Norman); a wood engraving by William Blake for an 1821 edition of ''Pastorals of Virgil'' (from Zeitlin & Ver Brugge), and ''Ornithological Drawings of the Birds of Brazil'' by William Swainson, 1841 (The Book Chest). Dogs to 'Decameron' Among other literary finds is a book believed to be the first about dogs, ''De Canibus Britannicus'' by J. Caius, London, 1570 (from Clifford Hubbard); John Keats's first book, ''Poems,'' 1817 (dealer, Black Sun); a first edition of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' from Shakespeare & Company, 1922 (dealer is Heritage), and a Spanish Chronicle of King Juan II, with woodcuts, 1517 (Richard Ramer). Also, Robert Frost's ''North of Boston'' (1914) inscribed by Frost: ''Happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length'' (the dealer is Strand); a 1525 Cortes letter, containing the conquistador's account of the city of Mexico and his campaign against the Aztecs (dealer, William Reese), and a first edition of Hemingway's first book, ''Three Stories and 10 Poems,'' published in Paris in 1923, and inscribed ''To Edmund Wilson from Ernest Hemingway. Toronto 1923'' (from Bell, Book & Radmall). The fair is open today from 1 to 9 P.M. and tomorrow from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M., at the armory, Park Avenue and 67th Street. Admission is $5 for each day.

522-> AROUND THE NATION; Conviction Is Reinstated For Ex-Gov. Blanton
A Federal appellate court today reinstated the convictions of former Gov. Ray Blanton of Tennessee and two of his former aides in a case involving conspiracy to sell liquor licenses. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit also granted a hearing before the entire court on defense motions that the convictions should be overturned because of improper jury selection. No hearing date was set by the court. A three-member panel of the appellate court overturned the convictions Feb. 11 on the ground that the jurors were improperly chosen at the trial. Mr. Blanton, his 1974 campaign manager, James Allen, and Mr. Blanton's administrative aide, Clyde Edd Hood Jr., were convicted June 9, 1981, of conspiracy and mail fraud in the issuance of 12 Nashville liquor licenses. Mr. Blanton also was convicted of extortion.

523-> FISSURE AT PLANT UPSETS SCHEDULE
A CRACKED crankshaft stole the show from Long Island's long-running seminar in nuclear economics - the ongoing debate over who should pay for the Shoreham nuclear power plant, and how much. In refocusing their attention on safety and workmanship at Shoreham, many Long Islanders were reminded last week that the Shoreham debate involves questions of technology as well as economics and that some of the plant's biggest technological headaches are nonnuclear. What happened was that the 20-foot steel crankshaft in one of Shoreham's three diesel generators split during what the Long Island Lighting Company described as a routine test required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Lilco initially described the fracture as being about eight inches long, but later reports from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission indicated that the crack ran the entire length of the shaft. Only weeks before, Lilco had replaced the cylinder heads in the generator where the incident occurred. And in April the N.R.C. fined Lilco $40,000 for following improper procedures in a similar sequence of tests. Given the generator's troubled past, the breakdown prompted some Shoreham- watchers to speculate that the unit might be an Achilles heel that would at least delay the plant and, in the minds of some Shoreham opponents, serve to keep the plant from opening altogether. The diesel generators are a vital component because they would supply the electricity to keep Shoreham's control room functioning in case unforeseen events interrupted its regular power supply. They would also provide power to make the valves and switches inside the reactor continue to work in an emergency. By the end of the week, Lilco was still saying what its spokesmen had said when the crack was first discovered - that it was too soon to say how long it would take to repair the generator, or whether the plant's opening would have to be delayed. Lilco had hoped to begin low-power testing - a vital step toward commercial use of the 809- megawatt reactor - within a matter of weeks and full commercial generation next spring. But N.R.C. officials said the broken crankshaft could take weeks to remove, and the low-power testing is contingent on a license from the N.R.C. that Lilco has not yet obtained. Each day Shoreham's cost increases by slightly more than $1 million in financing charges. In the meantime, Lilco postponed a major electrical test of the generators and asked the N.R.C. to postpone a Shoreham- related hearing that was to begin this week. There were also these other developments last week: - In the wake of the generator breakdown, the Governor asked the panel headed by John Marburger, the president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, to look into safety issues - specifically, the adequacy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's supervision of safety at the plant itself. The Governor had directed the Marburger panel to assess evacuation planning - ''off-site'' safety - and the economic factors by the end of the month. Michael Del Giudice, the secretary to the Governor, said the latest charge was a mandate to decide whether an independent review of on-site safety was warranted and ''what kind of on-site inspection should be conducted.'' - The Suffolk County Executive, Peter F. Cohalan, called for the creation of a ''Shoreham abandonment council.'' He told the Governor's Shoreham task force on Wednesday that such a council should ''terminate the Shoreham project and forge an equitable solution to the economic mess which Lilco has created.'' Mr. Cohalan did not say who should appoint his proposed council, or to whom it should be responsible. - Richard M. Kessel, the self-styled consumer activist, petitioned the State Public Service Commission to limit the amount of money Lilco could recover through rate increases to $3.2 billion. Mr. Kessel asserted that if Shoreham's costs continued to climb, Lilco's proposed 56.5 percent rate increase could climb, too. Mr. Kessel said he believed that Lilco's latest cost estimate was ''understated'' and predicted that the actual price would be between $3.85 billion and $4.05 billion. Mr. Kessel also urged the commission to hire an independent auditor to measure the actual cost of the plant. - Last Wednesday's ''Pull the plug on Lilco'' protest - a daylong campaign that urged Lilco customers to curtail their use of electrical appliances - had virtually no effect on the utility, but livened up the day at Lilco hedquarters in Mineola. At a rally there, protesters pulled a symbolic outsized plug from a huge socket to dramatize their opposition to the company's proposed rate increase. The group also carried a stage-prop-size check marked ''insufficient funds'' and handed it to a security guard in the lobby of the company's headquarters. Ken Simons, a spokesman for the company, said that the amount of power provided by Lilco was normal for a warm midsummer day. At 3 P.M., usually Lilco's peak hour, the company supplied 2,475 megawatts to its customers, up from 2,351 megawatts the day before. Between 9 and 11 A.M. on Wednesday, Mr. Simons said, demand increased 393 megawatts, up from 362 megawatts on Tuesday.

525-> DEMOCRATIC NOVICES VIE FOR NEW DISTRICT
BEDFORD has been added to it and Briarcliff Manor sliced off. Croton-on-Hudson will vote in it this fall; Ossining villagers no longer may. Reapportionment has given the Second Legislative District, which Sandra R. Galef has represented in White Plains for three years, some new faces and boundaries this fall as the campaign for the Board of Legislators heats up. Mrs. Galef, a Democrat of Ossining, was thrown by the Republicandrawn redistricting plan into an electoral confrontation with a Republican incumbent, William R. Crosbie of Tarrytown, in the Ninth District. That development has left the Second District as one of three in the county with no incumbent and a scramble among three candidates, only one of whom has won an elective office before. The other two districts are the l6th in Yonkers and the 13th in Mount Vernon. Two upcounty political novices, both Democrats, will face each other in a primary on Sept. 13 for the chance to run against Robert D. Hazzard, the two-term Republican Supervisor of the town of Bedford. The general election, in which all 17 Board seats are at stake, is Nov. 8. One of the Democrats is Matthew H. Garrity of Bedford, 42 years old, a reinsurance underwriter in Pleasantville who specializes in self-financed health plans. His opponent will be 26- year-old Robert A. Fertik of Croton, a computer consultant who helped to found People Outraged With Energy Rates, or Power, a consumer group. There are 8,050 Democrats enrolled in the district, which includes the towns of Bedford, New Castle and Mount Kisco, the village of Croton-on- Hudson and the unincorporated portion of the town of Ossining but not its village. The total population stands at 49,600. Democratic organizations in all of those communities but Croton have endorsed Mr. Garrity, but Mr. Fertik has gathered enough petitions among Democrats to ensure a line on the ballot that he said last week he will not relinquish. The Croton Democrats, split, have made no choice between the two men, the village Democratic chairman, Patricia Wood, said last week. Using the dining-room table in his father's Scarborough home, Mr. Fertik has scanned alphabetical and geographical lists of Democrats. ''I'm going to meet the voters who are likely to vote,'' he said. Who are they? ''That's one of the tricks up my sleeve,'' said Mr. Fertik. He estimated that he could win with only about 900 votes. One result of redistricting was to eliminate Mr. Fertik's family home from the district in which he wished to run. So the young bachelor rented an apartment in Croton, which was added to the district under the same plan. Mr. Garrity did not have to move from Bedford where he, his wife, Judy, and their four children have lived for five years. Bedford, which used to be part of Legislator John E. Hand's Fourth District, was added to the Second. Both candidates have started canvassing door to door, but Mr. Garrity has spent about $2,500 so far, he said, about five times the $541 Mr. Fertik said he has spent through the first week in August. Mr. Garrity was born into a Yonkers political family that included his father, Harold Garrity, a County Democratic leader and then County Judge, and his grandfather, State Senator James A. Garrity, who represented a Hudson River constituency in the 1930's. A former New Rochelle resident, Mr. Garrity said last week that his former home, along with Mount Vernon and Yonkers, are ''losing development, industry and jobs where there is the infrastructure to support them while the northern end is choking on brand new development that's taking place in areas that don't have the roads, utilities and labor to support it.'' Mr. Garrity mentioned Somers, where, he said, Pepsico is planning to build a major office complex. ''I don't hold that against Somers,'' he said, ''but the county as a whole is suffering.'' Mr. Garrity and Mr. Fertik agreed in separate interviews that Consolidated Edison electric rates were too high, and Mr. Garrity placed on them much of the blame for forcing industry to move north to the area served by the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation. Indeed, Mr. Fertik joined Power, the consumer-advocacy group, in March 1981 soon after a Con Edison rate increase and has since become co-chairman with Estelle Katz of Yonkers. ''Rate increases are unconscionable as long as Con Ed is running the system because they have no incentive to be efficient,'' Mr. Fertik said. Mr. Fertik, who was a halfback on the Irvington High School football team, holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Yale. Mr. Garrity graduated from the Hackley School in Tarrytown and attended the University of Notre Dame and Manhattan College. He is studying for a bachelor's degree in professional studies at Pace University, with a major in insurance. Mr. Hazzard, the Republican, faces no primary and holds the Conservative Party endorsement as well as that of his own party. The Right-to- Life Party candidate is Patricia A. Vasta. A total of 10,464 Republicans, 371 Conservatives and 55 Right-to-Life Party members are enrolled in the Second District, in addition to the 8,050 Democrats, according to Tina Berte of the County Board of Elections. A key element will be the 6,960 voters who chose no party affiliation. ''I don't get the picture they're either Republicans or Democrats in disguise,'' Mr. Hazzard said last week of the independents. ''I plan the same approach to all: my experience and proven record.'' Last January, Mr. Hazzard decided to step down after four years as Town Supervisor in Bedford, which has about 120 full-time employees and a budget of about $7 million. Then came reapportionment and the realization that there would be no incumbent standing in the way of his becoming a ''little fish in a big pond'' - the County Board. So the White Plains lawyer said he thought he could have ''the best of both worlds'' of private practice and public service. The 199 Main Street offices of his law firm, which his father helped to found in 1934, are a short walk from the County Office Building where the Board meets every other Monday afternoon. Married and the father of three, Mr. Hazzard is a former captain of the Cornell University football team and a graduate of its law school. The only other elective office he has won was secretary-treasurer of the Katonah Fire District. ''I got 31 votes,'' he said. Mrs. Vasta, the Right-to-Life candidate, is a 54-year-old mother of nine who has lived for 32 years in Croton. She has done volunteer fund-raising work for church and Parent-Teacher Association programs and the Croton Blood Donor organizaion. She said last week that she helps her husband, Salvatore, a mason, with the paperwork in his independent contracting business. Mrs. Vasta also has never won an elective office. ''I'm not known at all,'' Mrs. Vasta said in a telephone interview, ''so I don't think I'm going to win, but but we'll show poeple we have a strong party.''

526-> 2-GALLERY SHOWS ARE CATCHING ON
A NEW tradition may be entrenching itself in the art world, that of the two-gallery show. Initiated by the dealers Mary Boone and Leo Castelli, with whom most of such shared exhibitions have taken place, it goes like this: A ''hot'' artist produces so much work, or work of such a size, as to require his dealer to find more than one space - usually that of another dealer - in which to show it. What this provides for the artist, of course, is more impact; the cachet of a double exhibition, and twice the publicity. As for the viewer, he or she gets to see a larger slice of the artist's effort, while at the same time developing a possibly exaggerated idea of his importance. And the dealer? Ah, the dealer. His artist (and he) may benefit from the extra fanfare, but on the other hand, the double show not only requires more arranging; it also involves the risk of ''sharing'' him with another gallery. Nevertheless, the concept may be here to stay, taking off from the two-gallery shows already racked up this year by Julian Schnabel, David Salle and Robert Morris, among others. Two such exhibitions are on the boards this week, that of the Italian Neo-Expressionist painter Francesco Clemente and of the American sculptor Bryan Hunt, who actually is being shown in two spaces by the same gallery. But first, Mr. Clemente, whose work is divided between the Mary Boone Gallery, 417 West Broadway (through April 30) and Sperone Westwater Fischer, 142 Greene Street (through May 10). Born in Naples 31 years ago, he's one of the Italian superstars (known as the three ''C's,'' the others being Sandro Chia and Enzo Cucchi) who surfaced in the wave of European Neo-Expressionism that broke on these shores two years ago. Of the three, Mr. Clemente does the most autobiographical work (he uses himself as a model). And - although, like that of the others, his work reinvents past art and culture, particularly the great frescos of Giotto and Fra Angelico - it tends to be more involved with personal myth and private reference. The more focused and powerful Clemente presentation is at Mary Boone, comprising nine paintings, two rather sportively decorated screens and a large ''found'' theatrical backdrop of arches framing a landscape, which the artist has re-embellished. The backdrop, a conceit, conveys a stagy, Italianate ambience that seems out of key with the rest of this very poetic show. All of the nine paintings, eight hung ecclesiastically high on two facing walls, are of faces, some very bizarre indeed. There's a large one in each of whose apertures - mouth, nose, eyes and an ear - appears a tiny but expressive face; another one blank of features except for a tiny but coarse male face imposed on its forehead like a Cyclops eye; a third whose human countenance is overlaid by a fierce cat face, and a fourth, actually witty, of an innocent young woman wearing a troubled expression, bedeviled as she is on either side by small, nude figures of men in classical poses. The dreamlike character of these heads, limned with crude but expressive brushwork, doesn't enhance their accessibility to the viewer. But enigmatic as they are, the best of them have a haunting intensity. Meanwhile, a much more abundant, if shallower, Clemente sampling is on view at Sperone Westwater Fischer, where the artist has even installed around a doorway a wall of two panel sequences painted on the spot in tricky fresco. Both apparently relate to childhood (in one panel a baby engagingly binds himself and a parental couple in mummy bandages). There's also a mural whose sole female figure might be kneeling at a cemetery wall; a number of delicate self-portraits, including a poignant one of a vulnerable male nude hunkered down in a cell; a group of found objects playfully embellished with narrative imagery, and a big, arresting canvas in which a large-headed figure, perspectivally distorted in Renaissance fashion, floats catatonically, arms outstretched, in a void of bare linen canvas. A human before human actualization (the title of the work is ''Semen''), the figure is the most arresting work in this very uneven show. There's too much of a muchness here, and the result is confusion. What's to admire is the control with which Mr. Clemente lets it all hang out. When he's good, he's very. For those who harbor postmodernist suspicions that tradition is creeping back into sculpture, Bryan Hunt's show at the Blum-Helman Gallery, 20 West 57th Street and 112 Greene Street, gives ample confirmation. Working in bronze, that most hallowed of materials, whose surface Mr. Hunt manipulates with an expressive energy worthy of Bourdelle, he produces pieces that refer to such natural imagery as water and the human figure. He even brings back the time-honored pedestal; this after 20 years in which we thought we'd seen that passe footing fade away. And the work, mainly vertical, has for all its Minimal spareness an old-fashioned monumentality that brings Rodin to mind. Three very impressive standing bronzes, in the range of 12 feet high, and a wall piece of welded steel and plaster board, inhabit the downtown space. In the three occur the typical Hunt juxtaposition: flattish planes played off against vibrant linear elements, the bronze worked like clay for richness of surface effect. In ''Triad,'' for example, two long ''lines,'' a tall straight ''male'' one broken at two-thirds of its height by a biomorphic joint, and a curvilinear ''female'' one, meet - by means of a long curve that joins them at their top ends - a sturdy, flat bronze plank. That takes a waterfall plunge by means of two geometric bends, then a straight run almost to the floor, ending in a small cascade of bronze ''water.'' The more Minimal wall relief, ''Corridor,'' wipes out the surface richness, presenting a stunningly composed arrangement of narrow verticals and horizontals inflected by a single curvaceous line. Uptown, Mr. Hunt almost proves that scale is simply a state of mind. He works large, in a ''Charioteer'' inspired by the classical Greek sculpture at Delphi, whose flattish body form, subtly modeled to suggest both falling water and the lines of the athlete's robe, extends an arm toward the ghost of a chariot. And he works small, as in the tensile (and very topical) ''Roebling,'' whose spidery lines evoke a man squatting with hands on knees and also a pointed arch reminiscent of the Brooklyn Bridge. It has the effect of a work 10 times its size and proves, as does everything else in this impressive showing, that Mr. Hunt is a talent to reckon with. The uptown exhibition, through April 30, downtown through May 14. Also of interest this week: Elizabeth Murray (Paula Cooper Gallery, 155 Wooster Street): Few artists handle the shaped canvas, that flat strategy between painting and sculpture, better than Elizabeth Murray. The imagery, a mating of abstract and figurative elements, is exuberant; the colors snap energetically at one another, the separate shapes of her canvases hold together with thrilling tension. In general, the format here is a two-part work, each part a simple biomorphic shape that carries a freight of imagery. The parts rush together, overlapping at points, sometimes with the force of collision. And though the rollicking, klunky forms that disport from one to the other seem abstract, on closer scrutiny they often form parts of a figurative whole. In ''Fire Cup,'' for instance, four roughly circular shapes connected by a stem lie on a cutout field of brushy red, whose own form partly contains, partly counters them. The circular motifs turn out to be an inverted goblet, whose center spouts an inverted blue flame. The cometlike tail of the flame, taking off from the maw of the cup, begins a separate canvas that, burgeoning into the form of a comma, closely contains the flame's blobby contour, that of a Matisse cutout paper. In ''Simple Meaning,'' we can conjure a comic-strip landscape out of two crescent forms with jagged bellies that seem to lock horns, the whole they form rife with tree shapes, table shapes, a sail shape and a smoke shape, topped by what could be a violently riven yellow moon. From this playful, ''Krazy Kat'' vocabulary, Miss Murray manages to make, like that comic strip, poignant comments on the struggles and tensions of a larger world. (Through April 30.) Jedd Garet (Robert Miller Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street): A campy Surrealism prevails in these paintings by Jedd Garet, regarded as one of the hot young painters of the now-not-sonew figuration movement. Working sometimes with bold theatrical flourish, at other times in loose, lackluster fashion, he deploys an obsessive vocabulary of motifs: bare, lopped-off tree trunks and branches; stairways; sphere, snail and volute shapes, and blandly androgynous renderings of the human figure. He can put them together in snappy compositions, such as ''Breathing Water,'' a beautiful blue snail shape found on an ocean bottom of baroque, bad-taste red, and ''Swirl on a Staircase,'' a lurid red painting in which a menacing, biomorphic volute slithers snakelike up a flight of steps. But these very decorative forms tend to lose their pizazz in a number of unfocused arrangements, such as ''Plants That Eat Insects,'' a mishmash of branch, cylindrical cone, rock and vaporous shapes. Nor does this show present Mr. Garet's figure compositions at their strongest; certainly not the weak, shaped canvas called ''Heaven'' in which a pair of tiny androgynes pose balletically in a paradisiacal mist. Still, for those who like painterly rhetoric, there's much in this show worth seeing, not excluding several good black-and-white drawings and a splendid abstract pastel. (Through April 23.)

527-> 145 DOWN-AND-ACROSS FANATICS BATTLE IN TOURNEY
Nature abhors a vacuum and so does Alice Kaufman. ''When I see that empty crossword,'' said Mrs. Kaufman, who lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., ''I just have to fill it in.'' Today 144 others shared her competitive obsession for crossword puzzles. They gathered here - minds attuned to rum cocktails and Iraqi leaders, Albanian currency and Moorish percussion - to battle in the sixth annual nationwide Crossword Puzzle Invitational at the Marriott Hotel, sponsor of the event. The lure was a chance for the top three contestants to go on to the U.S. Open Crossword Puzzle Championship, sponsored by Games magazine in New York City on Aug. 20. In this crowd one need not have been an archeologist to know that the Egyptian sun god (two letters) was Ra. Most of the contestants have completed so many puzzles in their lives that when they see those cliched clues - ''Celebes ox,'' say, or ''Assam silkworm'' - they write in ''anoa'' and ''eria'' almost as a reflex. Wide Range of Talents There was Ellen Ripstein, who once had crossword puzzle toilet paper in her Brooklyn home. There were Wallace Krupenevich of Bloomfield, Conn., who has solved crosswords in a Navy submarine, and Gayle Eisenberg of Westbury, L.I. who has scrawled away in the Nairobi airport. Trudy Powell of Brooklyn does crosswords to help her fall asleep. And Howard Gross of Manhattan dreams about being atop the world of Down and Across. ''In my dream,'' said Mr. Gross, a stock transfer analyst, ''I'm up there in the finals. I can see the faces of the winners from the other years. And I'm beating them. They're shocked. They're saying, 'Who's he? We know him, but how's he winning?' '' Such fantasies are not surprising. Normally, to hear the crossword contestants tell it, theirs is a solitary lot. They attack puzzles clad in bathrobes or gym shorts, nestled under the covers or at the kitchen table, but almost always alone. ''The most exciting thing I do,'' said David Rosen, a high school teacher from Amherst, N.Y., ''is see if I can beat 10 minutes on the Sunday Times puzzle.'' Speed and Accuracy Count But here the ''speed solvers'' - as Henry Hook, a contest judge, has called them - had the chance to shine in public. All of Saturday and early today they worked eight puzzles, their pencils moving like predators, tracking errant puns and obscure trivia. Some finished puzzles in as little as seven minutes. Will Shortz, the editor of Games magazine, said one contestant had completed a crossword puzzle at the rate of 1.9 letters per second. The competitors were rated on speed and accuracy. Their computerized rankings were posted in the hotel lobby. At 11 A.M. the top three - Miss Ripstein, Mr. Rosen and Stanley Newman - mounted a stage to work four-by-four puzzles in front of all they had vanquished for the title. Besides competition, the tournament gave the contestants camaraderie. For two days, they did not need to explain themselves. ''I can sit down in the lobby and do my puzzles, and no one asks why,'' said Judy Ross, a concert harpist and tap dancer from Winthrop, Mass. ''Everyone's doing their own puzzle.'' ''One of my causes,'' said Mr. Newman of Brooklyn, a bond analyst for Merrill Lynch, ''is to bring crossworders out of the closet. Fifty million people do them. Do that many people bowl? But it's something you're afraid to brag about to your friends.'' Success May Be Rejected Mrs. Kaufman, an office clerk, knew just what he meant. ''Once, this man invited me to his house at the shore,'' she said. ''And I asked if I could do the Double Crostic puzzle. He said, 'Could you do it without references?' I said, 'Oh sure.' ''I did it in 20 minutes,'' she continued. ''He never invited me back.'' In this contest crowd, though, conversation was no problem. ''If you see a stranger across the bar,'' said Mr. Krupenevich, ''you talk about puzzles.'' After the rigors of competition yesterday, everyone broke into two teams and relaxed with a few recreational games of ''Crossword Relay'' and ''Trivia Baseball.'' And this morning, before the competiton began, everyone went to pick up The New York Times to work the Sunday puzzle for a little fun. ''Unbelievable,'' said Laura Burgado, the cashier of the hotel's newsstand. ''I've never seen it so packed. We open at 8, and there was a line at 8:05. We sold out at 8:30, and we usually don't do that until midafternoon.'' Also in awe were the families of contestants. ''I started worrying about my mother last night when she couldn't get to sleep and took out her book of puzzles,'' said Daniela Varon of Boston. ''She sort of sat there in bed with this benign smile doing it. When she was done, she looked bereft.'' Down to the Wire ''You can't talk to my mother at breakfast,'' said Judy Raphael of Fairfield, Conn., ''because she has her crossword and her stopwatch out.'' It did not help today. Miriam Raphael, Judy's mother, slipped out of second place before the final round. She watched as Miss Ripstein, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Newman went at a puzzle entitled ''Watch Your Step!'' Miss Ripstein, who entered the finals in first place, never finished. She stalled on ''30 days in Montreal,'' writing in the Spanish ''Abril'' instead of the French ''Avril.'' Mr. Newman completed the puzzle with three errors. And Mr. Rosen, with one error, won. Besides a chance to compete in the U.S. Open, he got $400. For a moment, he looked like a star, standing next to his puzzle as flashbulbs clicked and a dozen reporters asked his strategy, his profession, even if he was married. But Mr. Rosen was still thinking about the ''100'' he had put in, instead of the correct ''000,'' for ''Part of 1,000.'' ''That,'' he said of his lone error, ''makes me so mad.''

Bruins Keep Rolling BOSTON, Feb. 13 (AP) - Rick Middleton scored two goals and Pete Peeters moved to within one game of a National Hockey League record for goalies tonight as the Boston Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks, 3-1. The victory was Boston's fifth in a row and extended its unbeaten streak to 17 games. Peeters, beaten by a power-play goal by Stan Smyl early in the second period, checked the Canucks the rest of the way and lifted his unbeaten streak to 31 games. The record of 32 was set by Boston's coach, Gerry Cheevers, when he led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup in the 1971-72 season. Since a 3-2 loss to Quebec on Nov. 11, Peeters has won 26 games and been in five ties. Boston, which leads the league with 84 points, spotted Vancouver a 1-0 lead on Smyl's 24th goal. Mike Krushelnyski tied the score midway through the second period, cutting across and firing a 30-footer past John Garrett. Middleton put the Bruins in front to stay four minutes later, as he got his 28th goal from close up on a pass from Barry Pederson. Kings 5, Flyers 4 PHILADELPHIA (UPI) - Marcel Dionne scored his 34th and 35th goals, helping the Kings end a nine-year drought against Philadelphia. They had last beaten the Flyers in October 1974, going 0-26-6 since. The loss was the first in 10 games for the Flyers and their goaltender, Pelle Lindbergh. Nordiques 5, Hawks 4 CHICAGO (AP) - Anton Stastny scored his fifth game-winning goal in Quebec's last eight victories. His 25th goal of the season, a shot from the crease midway through the final period, came 28 seconds after Denis Savard had moved the Hawks to a 4-4 tie. Capitals 6, Jets 1 LANDOVER, Md. (AP) - Ken Houston scored in the opening minute and the Capitals breezed the rest of the way in setting a club record for season victories at 28. They gained a second-place tie with the New York Islanders in the Patrick Division. Pat Riggin stopped 27 shots, but the Jets spoiled his shutout bid with Dale Hawerchuk's 29th goal at 17:32 of the second period. Whalers 5, Leafs 3 HARTFORD (UPI) - Blaine Stoughton of Hartford scored three goals, passing the 30-goal mark for the fourth straight season, and assisted on one goal. Pierre Lacroix, a defenseman, got two goals for the Whalers, who have now won two games after a 13-game winless streak.

A Weekend's Nosh H e had lunch Saturday at Katz's Delicatessen, the corned beef and pastrami palace on the Lower East Side, and then ate bagels and lox while browsing through Zabar's on the Upper West Side. James S. Brady, an enthusiastic cook, noshed like a politician on the campaign trail during his weekend visit from Washington. The White House press secretary also bought takeout roast chicken and duck at Zabar's as Murray Klein, a co-owner, helped steer his wheelchair through the Saturday crowds. It was Mr. Brady's first trip to New York since he was shot during the 1981 attempt to assassinate President Reagan. Mr. Brady and his wife, Sarah, came from Washington by train Friday along with his secretary and a pair of Secret Service men. The party saw ''Dreamgirls'' on Broadway Friday night. Saturday they went to the King Cole Room of the St. Regis-Sheraton Hotel for dinner and its salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein, ''Some Enchanted Evening.'' Mr. Brady, in bright spirits, was introduced, got a standing ovation and responded with a ''V'' sign. Also at his table was Kenneth L. Adelman, who is awaiting Senate confirmation as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, succeeding Eugene V. Rostow.

535-> Kite Wins Crosby By Two With a 73
Tom Kite floundered today on the home stretch with three consecutive bogeys, but he came through to win the Bing Crosby National Pro-Am by two strokes. As late as the 14th hole, Kite had held a five-shot lead. ''I hated to finish the way I did,'' Kite said after his one-over par 73 for a four-round total of 276. ''I guess I was getting complacent with a five-shot lead. I got a little carried away. I guess I was a little anxious to get my name on the crystal trophy. But I'd like to think I'm a good enough player to hang on to a fiveshot lead.'' In a way, Kite has Rex Caldwell and Bob Gilder to thank. Caldwell, who now has been runner-up in his last three starts, missed two short putts on the 17th and 18th holes that could have forced a tie. Gilder, winner of the Phoenix Open a week ago, was only one shot behind Kite until he came to the par-5 18th, where he sliced his drive out-of-bounds for a double bogey. As so often happens here in the winter, the weather was miserable, with cold rain falling intermittently. Good Location for Ocean Under these conditions, contestants were permitted to play preferred lies. This means a player can lift and clean the ball and, delicately with his fingers, replace it on the turf within a club length of the original lie. As each group left a green, workmen scraped water off the green with rubber blades mounted on the ends of poles. It was a struggle to stay dry and warm. Kite wears eyeglasses, and he had to wipe them dozens of times. When was Kite sure he had won? ''On the 18th tee,'' he answered. ''All my bad shots today went right, and here the Pacific Ocean was on the left side.'' He played the 18th in regulation, three shots and two putts for par. Kite, who scored a record 62 Saturday on the Pebble Beach Golf Links, was 12 under par for the combined courses on which the tournament rotated - two rounds on Pebble Beach and one each on Cypress Point and Spyglass Hill. Nicklaus Passes $4 Million While Gilder, Kite's primary pursuer, lost his chance on the 72d hole, Caldwell and Calvin Peete, the most accurate player on the tour, held on to tie for second place at 278. Caldwell shot 73 and Peete 70. Peete's biggest shot was from the fairway on the par-5 15th. He holed out a wedge for an eagle. Gilder's 72 dropped him to nine under par, where he was tied for fourth with Danny Edwards, who scored 71. Jack Nicklaus, a three-time winner of this tournament, scored 72-280 for sixth place. His share of the purse, $11,700, sent his career earnings to $4,006,633, making him the first golfer to surpass $4 million. Tom Watson, the winner here in 1977 and 1978, shot the only score of the day below 70. His 69-281 placed him in a tie with Ken Green, who shot 76. Green had excellent rounds the first two days with 66 on Spyglass and 68 on Pebble. His Goals Are Private This was the most prestigious of Kite's five victories on the PGA Tour. The odd thing about Kite's career is that he has won a lot of money - $1.7 million without winning many tournaments. He won one event in each of the years 1976, 1978, 1981 and 1982. The key to his success has been consistency, with repeated placements in the top five or top 10. Kite was the leading money-winner in 1981 with $375,700. Last season he was third on with $341,081. Kite said he had set certain goals for himself this season, but he said they were ''fairly private.'' ''What I can say is that today is a stepping stone, but not close to the goals,'' he said. ''It's a nice start, but I have a long way to go.'' Kite's purse of $58,500 raised his season's winnngs to $62,888. His only previous starts this year have been the Bob Hope Desert Classic, where he tied for 19th, and the Phoenix Open, where he missed the cut. Staying in the Hunt For a fleeting moment today, Caldwell tied Kite for the lead. He started the day at 11 under and Kite started at minus 13. Kite bogeyed No.1 and birdied No.2 to stay at 13 under. Caldwell birdied both those holes to reach 13 under, but he double-bogeyed the third and bogeyed the 7th and 8th. He recovered one of those shots with a 12-foot birdie putt at the 14th. Coming in, Caldwell barely missed a 9-foot birdie putt at the 17th and a 4-footer for birdie at 18. Had he made those putts, he would have forced a playoff. Caldwell, who has not won once in his eight years on tour, earned $28,600 for a total of $95,233 in the three events in which he has run second - the Hope, Phoenix and here. ''I know I can win now,'' he said. ''Every day for three weeks I've been in the hunt. I've never felt any pressure in those three weeks.'' How did Caldwell like his image as the sport's favorite underdog? ''A lot of people have been pulling for me,'' he replied. ''That gets me pumped up. I feel great about it.'' Hooks Like a Duffer Kite's round consisted of six bogeys against five birdies. He played the front nine in one under par on four birdies and three bogeys. When Kite birdied No.12 on a 20-foot putt, he went to 15 under par, five shots ahead of Gilder, Caldwell and Peete. After two more pars, he ran into trouble. On the 15th he hooked so severely that his only shot was a chip to the fairway. He hit a terrible approach to the 16th, 60 feet short of the pin, and he three-putted. On the par-3 17th he drove into a poor lie in a bunker, blasted out to the opposite edge of the green, 20 feet from the stick, and took two putts. Then he was 12 under, at a time when Gilder was minus 11. When Gilder sliced out of bounds and Caldwell missed on 17, that was it.

536-> THE REGION; Water Rate Rise Upheld by Court
A state appellate court today upheld a $4.18 million increase in rates for the Hackensack Water Company. It ruled that state agencies could rely on their own experts instead of taking the word of those proposing or contesting rate changes. The ruling, voted 3 to 0 by the Appellate Division of Superior Court, approved the rate increase authorized by the State Board of Public Utilities two years ago. The water utility originally sought a $10.29 million increase. Representatives of the Public Advocate's office and lawyers for Bergen County contended that the rate increase should have been $1.57 million. The staff of the Public Utilities Board originally recommended that the rate increase should be $3.9 million. An administrative law judge had recommended a $1.58 million increase. The appellate court found that the state board had adequately considered the cases of the utility and opponents of the rate increase before relying on its own expert staff to determine a proper rate for customers.

538-> ABOUT REAL ESTATE; THE NINE-YEAR EFFORT TO BUILD A JERSEY CONDOMINIUM
The Admiralty, a 162-apartment condominium in this small beachfront community 55 miles from New York City, is nearly a decade old. But only last August did it open for occupancy. The 14-story tower's construction was nearly scuttled by the financial difficulties of its first two owners, and it was finally completed by the present owners, Cofas Associates. The story of the Admiralty is one that, to some extent, embodies that of the real estate industry as a whole during the last decade: the extravagrant hopes of the boom years of the early 1970's, the sharp reversals of the mid-1970's, the slow recovery of the late 1970's and the cautious optimism of the current period. Construction of the building, on a four-acre site at the ocean's edge at 55 Ocean Avenue, began in 1973. But its original developer foundered in the mid-decade recession, leaving the superstructure as an unsightly counterpoint to the borough's two other high-rise condominiums. Financial difficulties also vanquished the real estate investment trust that had sought to complete the building. ''It had become known as the 'skeleton of Monmouth Beach'; I'm sure some people thought it would never be built out,'' Bruce Colen said recently. But Mr. Colen and his partners -his twin brother, Jay; Arthur Fastenberg, and Samuel Mindel - saw possibilities and bought the structure in 1978. The total development cost is about $24 million, with construction and permanent financing by the Mercantile Bank of Canada and the Midlantic Bank of New Jersey. ''What we saw when we looked at the property and the surrounding community,'' Bruce Colen said, ''was a good real estate opportunity. Sure, the building effort had been sidetracked, but the reasons for that were financial, not because the original site decision was a bad one.'' The Cofas group believed the site had two particular advantages: one was the sweeping views a tall building would afford seaward or inland across the New Jersey coastal plain; the second was the virtual assurance that the Admiralty would remain the area's only condominium tower directly on the beachfront. Louis Soldano, Monmouth Beach's Mayor, said that most of the 4,000 residents of the borough believed that three condominium towers were enough in a community that consists predominantly of single-family homes, and that only low-rise development should be encouraged. The community's oceanfront is lined with stately, rambling homes, and its riverfront has been sculptured to permit the clustering of modern homes. In addition, it is felt that few developers could profitably meet the stringent environmental requirements of the state's Coastal Area Facilites Review Act, which covers the construction of 25 or more housing units along the state's shoreline. The law took effect in 1973, but the Admiralty was excused from meeting its requirements because the original construction had begun before the act was passed. However, Jay Colen said that Cofas had installed windows able to withstand hurricane winds, repaired a jetty and built a reinforced bulkhead. Bruce Colen said that Cofas had taken a long time to complete the Admiralty because the partnership decided to have the layout redesigned. David Kenneth Spector of New York City was the architect. Sunset Marketing and Sales of Monmouth Beach is the selling and managing agent. Mr. Spector designed a different floor plan for each of the 12 types of apartments in the Admiralty. The one- and two-bedroom apartments, of 1,177 to 1,702 square feet, feature washers and dryers, eat-in kitchens, individually controlled heat pumps and airconditioners, as well as security systems that are controlled from the apartment or the concierge desk. Terraces in each apartment range from 118 to 312 square feet. About 60 percent of the units, which cost from $99,900 to $268,900, have been sold, according to Jay Colen. The building has a 190-car enclosed garage, with additional outside space, locker rooms with saunas, a gym room with exercise bar and treadmill, a whirlpool room that overlooks the outdoor swimming pool, two tennis courts, a putting green and a 600-foot promenade deck along the ocean. Like many shore towns, Monmouth Beach, traditionally a resort area, has attracted a significant influx of year-round residents in the last decade. Mr. Colen believes that as long as overbuilding is avoided, highrise apartment buildings can be advantageous to these communities because their residents generally are at either end of the family cycle - just-marrieds or empty-nesters who have little impact on the public schools -and because high-rise buildings have a lesser impact on such services as garbage collection, and fire and police protection.

540-> Dow Chief Says Washington Pressed for Report Changes
Paul Oreffice, president of the Dow Chemical Company, said today that pressure to delete material criticizing his company from an E.P.A. report on dioxin contamination had come from Washington, not from Dow. Mr. Oreffice, interviewed on the NBC News program ''Today'' and the ABC Entertainment Division program ''Good Morning America,'' also said that ''there is no health problem'' in the Midland, Mich., area around a Dow plant where dioxins are generated in manufacturing. He said Dow learned of the report by the Environmental Protection Agency when it was disclosed to a Canadian newspaper. The Acting Administrator of the agency, John W. Hernandez Jr., is accused of letting Dow delete portions of the report. ''People started calling us about it,'' Mr. Oreffice said. ''We asked the E.P.A. for some information about it. They sent us a draft and asked us for a scientific opinion. ''Most of the technology in that report was developed by Dow scientists,'' he said, adding that such reviews by companies are common as ''peer review.''

541-> ISRAELI COLONEL, AFTER BRUSH WITH MARINE, IS REPORTED HURT IN RAID
The army said today that the Israeli tank commander who was involved in a confrontation last week with a United States Marine captain was slightly wounded this morning in an attack by terrorists who appeared to have escaped into Marine-held territory near Beirut. At the same time, an Israeli newspaper carried a report in which the Israeli officer was quoted as saying that, at the time of the incident with the American, he smelled alcohol on the marine's breath. The Israeli officer, a lieutenant colonel who was identified only by his first name, Rafi, was said to have been grazed by shrapnel when two explosive charges planted along a road in the Beirut suburb of Shuweifat were detonated, possibly by remote control, as his unit passed by. ''Troops began searching,'' an Israeli Army spokesman said, ''and the tracks of those who detonated the charges led westward in the direction of the area under multinational force control.'' Interviewed later on army radio, the officer said the site of the attack was 300 to 400 yards from a position under the command of the Marine Corps contingent of the international peacekeeping force. Defense Minister Ariel Sharon has contended that the Marines have been acting unwittingly as a shield behind which Palestinian guerrillas were operating against Israeli troops. Since Dec. 22, an army spokesman said, two Israeli soldiers have been killed and 30 wounded in what one officer described as ''a very volatile and dangerous area, dotted with bushes and trees, a most congenial environment for terrorism.'' Weinberger Tells of Incident As a result, the Israelis have activated vigorous patrols, which have taken them into disputes with the Marines on six reported occasions. The most recent incident occurred last Wednesday about 9 A.M., when three tanks commanded by Colonel Rafi were halted by Capt. Charles B. Johnson, commander of Company L, Third Battalion, Eighth Marine Regiment. The original account of the incident, from Secretary of State Caspar W. Weinberger in Washington, had the tanks approaching a Marine position and stopping a foot from Captain Johnson. But Israeli officials contend that the tanks were well within a previously agreed Israeli zone. The Israeli officer told reporters last week that Captain Johnson had not been approached but had raced toward the tanks in a jeep, then drawn his pistol and run across a stretch of terrain in pursuit of the Israeli patrol. Colonel Rafi was quoted today by the newspaper Haaretz as telling Israeli reporters that he had smelled alcohol on Captain Johnson's breath. ''The fact was not published previously to prevent harm to the Marine officer and not to exacerbate the incident,'' the newspaper reported. But it concluded: ''It is clear that he had drunk an alcoholic beverage while he was on duty and it had influenced his judgment.'' 'Maybe It Was Mouthwash' Another Israeli officer confirmed that Colonel Rafi had made the allegation, but said the Israeli Army was trying to play down the matter. ''Maybe it was mouthwash,'' the officer said. Haaretz also quoted ''military sources'' as reporting that the residents of the Hai Salum quarter, known for its drug trade, were selling hashish to the Marines, sometimes in exchange for American military uniforms, which local civilians could be seen wearing. The Cabinet decided in its weekly meeting today to avoid issuing a statement on the situation. But Israeli newspapers, even those vehemently opposing the Government and its policies on Lebanon, lined up against the United States. The Jerusalem Post mocked the Marine captain's action, suggesting sarcastically that a new stanza be added to the Marines' hymn, glorifying them not only ''from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli,'' but also in the ''streets of Beirut.'' Surprise Over Reagan Statement Privately, Israeli officials expressed amazement that President Reagan, at a news conference on Friday, had defended the Marine captain by saying that he ''did the only thing that he could do.'' The President's statement came after a meeting between Israeli and American representatives in Beirut at which the Americans were said to have acknowledged that the marine made an error and that the tanks were well within an Israeli-controlled area. The area is east of a railroad line mutually agreed upon as the western boundary of Israeli control, according to military officers here. Within that Israeli-controlled zone, the Lebanese Army was invited by Israel several months ago to set up an enclave of Lebanese control on the Reihan University campus. After doing so, the Lebanese then invited the Marines to join them, the Israeli officers explained. Captain Johnson's unit, then, was deployed in the Reihan University enclave, which is about 600 yards from the railroad line, well inside the Israeli zone. Tank Is Ordered to Halt In addition, the Israelis say, Colonel Rafi's tanks were 400 yards from the university enclave. They were headed for high ground, from which they could observe the western side of the tracks, the colonel said. The Marine captain chased the lead tank until it stopped, according to the Israeli colonel's account. The colonel said he asked the captain to get a superior officer and the captain refused. He then asked the captain to climb onto the tank to show him where he thought the boundary was between the zones. When the Marine officer was on the tank, the colonel said, he saw another tank moving, grabbed the colonel's arm and ordered the tank to stop. At one point, the captain said the tanks would proceed only over his dead body. The colonel said he then pushed the marine slightly, ordered him off the tank, completed his observations and left the area. Since the incident, white-painted barrels have been placed as boundary markers. But Deputy Foreign Minister Yehuda Ben-Meir expressed surprise today that the Americans had refused to allow direct discussions between Marine and Israeli officers in the field, which he said could reduce misunderstandings. The United States has insisted that diplomats be present for any meetings with Israeli officers. Report Denied in Beirut BEIRUT, Feb. 6 (AP) - A Marine spokesman here, Lieut. Col. Walt DeForest, described the Israeli newspaper report that Captain Johnson had alcohol on his breath when he stopped three Israeli tanks last week as ''absolutely false.'' Colonel Deforest said Captain Johnson himself declined comment. He said the captain was in a remote location without a telephone. Another Marine spokesman in Beirut, Dale Dye, asked for a more detailed response to the alcohol accusation, said: ''We are not going to dignify such charges with a statement.'' In a telephone interview from her home in Neenah, Wis., Captain Johnson's mother, Millie, said that the alcohol story was ''ridiculous.'' She added: ''There's absolutely no truth to it. Chuck is not a drinker.''

542-> MUSIC NOTED IN BRIEF; King Sunny Ade Band In New York Debut
King Sunny Ade and his African Beats have been making popular and influential albums in Nigeria for more than a decade. Island Records, the company that was largely responsible for popularizing the Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley in the United States, signed Mr. Ade to a recording contract last year and issued his first American album, ''Juju Music.'' And late Friday night, Mr. Ade and 18 of the 22 musicians in his band introduced themselves to New York City with a dazzling two-and-a-half-hour performance to a packed house at the Savoy - a performance that will surely be remembered as one of the most significant pop music events of this decade. The juju music Mr. Ade and his band play is firmly rooted in the traditional drumming and choral singing of Nigeria's Yoruba people, but the featured solo instruments include electric and pedal steel guitars as well as the Yoruba talking drum. It is a dense, tightly woven mesh of melodies and cross-rhythms, fiendishly complex compared with most other pop music, but with enough gently lyrical melodies and familiar guitar sounds to appeal to many rock listeners on first hearing. The large band is divided into sections - four electric guitars, each with its own distinct rhythmic role; a vocal chorus; a large section of drums and percussion instruments playing rhythms that are syncopated against basic patterns played on an iron bell and, instead of a single bass part, a tightly interlocked four-voice bass-range counterpoint for bass guitar, bass drum and two traditional Yoruba talking drums. The sound of each section, indeed of each player, is robust and richly textured, a reflection of the density and wealth of detail in traditional Yoruba music, dancing, weaving, religion and social life. But the individual voices tend to subsume themselves into the surging, oceanlike rhythms, which manage to be powerfully propulsive and utterly relaxed, hot and cool, at the same time. Sunny Ade makes three albums a year in Nigeria, and he has enough hard-core fans there to guarantee sales of at least 250,000 for each one. He doesn't really need to win an American following or build a worldwide reputation. But he has arrived on the American pop scene at a propitious moment. The Talking Heads, David Bowie, and a number of American and British new wave bands have been heavily influenced by African and especially Nigerian pop music during the last few years, and they have been teaching their fans to hear and respond to complex rhythms and densely woven ensemble counterpoint. And since Bob Marley's death in 1981, adventurous pop music listeners the world over have been waiting for the third world to produce another international star and innovator of Mr. Marley's caliber. Sunny Ade's album suggested he might be the man. After his show at the Savoy, there can be little doubt that the crown is his for the taking. Robert Palmer

544-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Peddlers, Then and Now
Some people still have ''fond and colorful memories of the pushcarts,'' said Jacob Tuchman, who sells fish and chips on the sidewalks of New York. ''We are all that remains of that day.'' Linda Vilissidis, who sells pretzels, said many street peddlers had come to the city ''not to find a better life but to make one.'' But Michael Grosso of the Fifth Avenue Association told Mayor Koch that there were as many as 16 peddlers on a single corner. ''Give the sidewalks back to the people.'' Some peddling is already illegal in parts of the city. Many merchants object to peddlers, arguing that they have no overhead and no taxes. Mr. Grosso was one of three witnesses yesterday in favor of a new limitation on food vendors: 5,500 permanent licenses and 1,500 temporary. Thirteen witnesses testified against it. Mr. Koch, recounting again that his father and grandfather had peddled vegetables before coming to this country, signed the bill. He said it would be carefully monitored and, if necessary, amended. ''I believe that legal food vending will continue to thrive and be part of our New York scene,'' the Mayor said.

546-> Economic Scene; The Industrial Policy Issue
DOES the economics discipline really know what ails the economy and how to fix it? One sign that economics either may not have all the answers - or that people think it does not - is the attention being paid to proposals for a Federal policy to aid industry. The proposals start from the premise that traditional economics has failed to explain or to solve America's economic problems, and that more attention must be paid to policies that will compensate for weaknesses in America's business and labor institutions. But while these ideas have attracted much attention, they have not been embraced by mainstream economists. For one thing, the new theories do not fit within the context of modern economic analysis; they tend to dwell on institutional behavior, an area that the economics profession largely left behind 20 or 30 years ago. For another, the industrial policy proposals have not yet been subjected to the analytical tests that economists require before they are willing to believe that a theory holds water. Many economists concede that they have had a difficult time diagnosing and curing America's economic ills. But for the most part, they still maintain that economics does have the answers. ''There may be a grain of truth in what the industrial policy advocates are saying,'' says Robert Solow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But at best, it is a grain, because there are too many other obvious economic explanations which contribute to explaining the current economic malaise.'' But if economists see the glass as half full, industrial policy advocates see it as half empty. ''You do want to get the macroeconomics right; it is a necessary condition to economic health,'' says Robert B. Reich, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and author of the recently published book ''The Next American Frontier.'' ''But,'' he adds, ''it is not sufficient.'' Mr. Reich, a leading proponent of industrial policy, studied economics as an undergraduate at Dartmouth and as a graduate student at Oxford before going to Yale Law School and working as chief of policy analysis at the Federal Trade Commission. He explains, however, that his frame of reference is really politics, law and institutions, rather than economics, per se. ''I'm conversant with economics,'' he says, ''but I'm just more interested in the peculiarities of 20th century America than in abstract theory.'' Since the industrial policy ideas fall outside of traditional economics, is there any way to subject them to the rigorous tests for validity that more economic theories are held to? Mr. Reich rightfully points out that much of what concerns him would be difficult to fit into the mold of standard econometric analysis. ''When it comes to messy politics and real world institutions, much of that does not lend itself to formal economic modeling,'' he said. Nonetheless, even he agrees that further, more rigorous analysis may be useful, though he is willing to leave that to others. What kinds of testing might be appropriate is an open question. William Baumol, a professor of economics at Princeton and New York Universities, notes that certain types of tests may be less appropriate than others. ''Our analytical methods can be bent and stretched to fit almost anything, but sometimes it is not worth the effort,'' he says. ''You might get an equation that tells you, for example, that a man, M, is walking a dog, D, on a leash, L. But that does not necessarily help.'' Even so, Mr. Baumol notes that a range of research tools - statistics, case studies, controlled experiments - are available, and one or another might be suitable. Mr. Reich agrees that his theories, and others, on industrial policy, could be offered in a more structured manner, more acceptable to economists. He says: ''If I were doing this as a Ph.D. candidate, my first chapter would review the literature, and point out that all the productivity studies say that economists cannot explain more than 50 percent of the slowdown in productivity growth. My second chapter would explain my hypotheses. My third chapter would present my data - the growth in the layers of management in corporations, the number of paper mergers, and so forth. My fourth chapter would present all my regression analyses. And the fifth chapter would present the first tentative conclusions.'' ''But I didn't want to do it that way,'' Mr. Reich said. I love writing, and I would just have found it tedious. It seems to me terribly important that these ideas get out. And since my frame of reference has never been the economics community, I never felt a need to put it in those terms.'' Leonard Silk is on a special assignment.

549-> ADVISERS PUSH REAGAN TO DECIDE ON 1984 RACE
A few weeks ago President Reagan was startled to hear a member of his Administration interrupt a meeting in the Oval Office with a plea that he run for re-election. With a smile, Mr. Reagan gave his characteristic noncommittal reply. Then James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, looked at the floor and observed, ''You know, Mr. President, we really are going to have to decide by Labor Day.'' To the consternation of his political advisers, Mr. Reagan now seems determined, in fact, to wait until the last possible moment to make his re-election intentions known, if only by establishing a committee to explore his prospects. An actual announcement would come months later. Earlier this year Mr. Baker and others were pushing the President to authorize such a committee by June, laying the necessay groundwork in fund-raising and organization. Now the timetable seems to have slipped to the fall, largely because of Mr. Reagan's own instincts that a premature re-election effort might hinder his image, but possibly because he really has not decided what he wants to do. Many political experts think Mr. Reagan is wise to delay, but several of those likely to be at the center of a Reagan re-election effort disagree. 'He Is Creating Doubts' ''I think the President is hurting himself,'' said one. ''He is creating doubts on Capitol Hill and doubts around the country about his intentions. Those Senate Republicans are far less inclined to follow their leader because they don't know what he's going to do. And his supporters need a positive sign so they can begin to march behind him.'' Another consequence of Mr. Reagan's delay is that the polite jockeying between Mr. Baker and Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, general chairman of the Republican Party, has become a subject of gossip in political circles. So has the jockeying between Mr. Baker, who joined the Reagan entourage in mid-1980 after working first for George Bush, and longtime Reagan supporters led by Lyn Nofziger. Mr. Nofziger was the White House political affairs director until he quit last year, annoyed at feeling shut out by Mr. Baker and others. He has made clear to associates his view that the ''Reaganites'' will not work for the President's re-election if Mr. Baker is in charge. For the record, all these players say they get along fine. But everyone expects either Mr. Baker or Mr. Laxalt to emerge eventually as the No. 1 director of the re-election effort, even though neither is expected to take the actual title as campaign manager. The question of who gets the title has also become the focus of gossip. One interesting aspect is that it is a job virtually no one wants, at least at first. Drew Lewis Declines Post ''I predict they'll go through two or three campaign managers before they settle down,'' said one man close to Mr. Reagan, noting that Mr. Baker was himself the third man to run the re-election campaign of President Ford in 1976. Mr. Laxalt and Mr. Baker have asked Drew Lewis, the former Transportation Secretary, to run the campaign, but Mr. Lewis is said to have begged off. Mr. Lewis, now chairman of the Warner Amex Cable Communications, is said to be willing to join the campaign part time next year. Many say Mr. Nofziger would like the manager's job, but that he has little chance to get it because of bad feelings with Mr. Baker. But because of his ties to the so-called Reaganites, the scores of people around the country who worked for Mr. Reagan from the start, he is almost certain to play a key role. Other names mentioned are Edward J. Rollins, the White House political director, and Richard S. Williamson, a Presidential assistant who is close to Mr. Laxalt and who was recently named United States Representative to International Organizations in Vienna. Whoever has the actual title, Mr. Baker and Michael K. Deaver, the White House deputy chief of staff, are hoping that Stuart K. Spencer, a longtime Reagan associate, will serve as the campaign's chief strategist. Some Unwanted Publicity Their plan, according to several officials, would be for decision on the scheduling and use of the President himself to remain at the White House, which is another reason the actual manager's job is less than attractive to some. If Mr. Spencer does get the key strategist's job, it will be seen by most insiders as a key sign of Mr. Baker's primacy, and a diminution of the importance of Senator Laxalt. Mr. Spencer, however, has had some unwanted publicity lately because he has become a lobbyist for South Africa. That news offered yet another twist in the Byzantine positioning of the pre-campaign period, since Mr. Nofziger has reportedly been spreading the word that the South Africa connection might make it hard for Mr. Spencer to play the primary role envisioned by Mr. Nofziger's nemesis, Mr. Baker. Mr. Reagan's aides all say that, despite the President's public reticence, it is obvious to them that he is running. They cite any number of clues, including the selection of Mr. Laxalt, a longtime friend, as the Republican chairman. Also cited are a series of recent asides in speeches indicating that Mr. Reagan feels he needs six more years to finish the job. 'I Think He's Going to Run' In addition, the White House is holding periodic meetings between the President and key 1980 political supporters and contributors. Today, for instance, Mr. Reagan had lunch with his 1980 regional political directors, who then received briefings from Mr. Baker and Mr. Deaver, as well as from Edwin Meese 3d, the White House counselor, and William P. Clark, the national security adviser. Later the visitors heard from Mr. Rollins and Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''Everybody was talking in terms of six more years,'' said one former field director. ''I think he's going to run.'' Also Mr. Rollins, Mr. Nofziger and top Republican officials have been holding regional meetings around the country to convey the message, according to one aide: ''We can't tell you to organize, but do everything you can.'' Despite all this activity, not a single associate of Mr. Reagan's is able to report that the President has said flatly that he will run. Veterans of the 1980 and 1976 Presidential races recall that Mr. Reagan kept his intentions cloudy then too, even when his people were raising money and organizing the campaign. Some associates go so far as to say they have a nagging fear that Mr. Reagan will walk away from the race. They say Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, truly enjoy the Presidency, but that the President might well find it unappetizing to run at the age of 74. Much more troubling to those who want Mr. Reagan to run, however, is the fact that the President has yet to sit down with his advisers to discuss re-election strategy and to do certain things in the travel and personnel area indicating that he is going to run. There is a feeling among many Republians, for example, that Mr. Reagan's trips have yet to be tailored to the need to strengthen his political support among such key groups as blue-collar workers and women. In addition, several potential campaign aides said, only half in jest, that they'll be sure Mr. Reagan is running when he dismisses Interior Secretary James Watt. At the White House, staff aides say they're sure Mr. Reagan is running. But they also say their life will be a lot easier after it becomes as clear to the public as it is to them.

550-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Esiason Won't Start
Boomer Esiason , Maryland's highly rated senior quarterback, will not start against Pittsburgh today and may not play at all, Coach Bobby Ross said yesterday. This would be the first time Esiason had failed to start for the Terrapins since he won the job in the second game of the 1981 season. The left-handed quarterback, hailed as a Heisman Trophy candidate before the season began, strained a ligament in his right shoulder against West Virginia last week.

551-> One Man, One Vote - and One City
For a time, it looked as though New York City would be spared the chaos that might result if its unusual Board of Estimate were subject to the one-man, one-vote rule. A Federal district court said the rule did not apply because the board is administrative, not legislative. Not good enough, a Federal appeals court now says; the distinction won't wash because the board performs general governmental duties. But that needn't mean chaos. The higher court calls on the district court to probe deeper into the applicability of one-man, one-vote to this board. To apply it at all would strain arithmetic and ignore history. The Board of Estimate was established as part of a pioneering effort to create a regional city. The original 1899 charter promised that each of five boroughs would have an equal voice on the board while the legislative body, now the City Council, would generally be apportioned by population. That's the way things stand. The Council is now being reshaped by a special commission that will deal with the at-large seats the courts find unconstitutional. The borough presidents each have one vote on the Board of Estimate; the Mayor, Comptroller and City Council President divide the other six. To try to alter the board now according to the population of each borough would be immensely complicated, with no obvious benefit for democracy. It's hard to see how weighted voting could produce more efficient zoning variances, city contracts or franchise grants. Those are the kind of activities, after all, that constitute the major business of the Board of Estimate. There's another reason to hope the Federal district court maintains the present structure. Now to annul this vehicle of unity might well tempt people in Staten Island, the smallest but fastest-growing borough, to see advantage in independence. The appeals court implicitly recognizes the importance of the board in the establishment and perpetuation of New York as a regional city. It's the same kind of historical and political importance that produced the two houses of Congress, one principally apportioned by population and the other by political geography. The Congressional precedent does not make the Board of Estimate composition constitutional. Still, as the appeals court went out of its way to say, other judges have ruled that the Constitution does not require mathematical exactitude; indeed, local government requires great flexibility in organization. New York City included.

552-> THE REGION; New Offer Averts Strike at Casinos
New concessions from the casino industry 30 minutes before a scheduled strike vote helped avert a weekend walkout by the city's largest casino workers' union, officials said today. Frank Gerace, president of Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union Local 54, said 360 shop stewards had voted unanimously to accept a new contract offer from management. It grants wage increases of 50 cents an hour or 8 percent, whichever is higher. For some employees, that would mean raises of up to 81 cents an hour, according to Mr. Gerace. He said the offer would be submitted to members of the union's rank and file, who will mail in their ballots.

553-> VIBRANT JOURNAL FOR THE ELDERLY
Articles deal with things such as how a former spy is working with the hard of hearing and how a puppy or parakeet can help fight loneliness. Advertisements tilt toward arthritis rubs, Florida condominiums and salt-free foods. Letters from readers wonder about steadying loose dentures and contributing one's body to science. It does not sound like a magazine that is going to drive Time or Newsweek off the stands. Maybe not, but Modern Maturity, surprisingly enough, enjoys the fourth-largest circulation of all American magazines, trailing only Reader's Digest, TV Guide and National Geographic. The bimonthly already reaches more than 8.3 million readers and soon expects to eclipse the 9 million mark, which would bring it within striking distance of the Geographic. The overwhelming majority of Modern Maturity's readers are comfortably into their 60's and 70's, a reality that puts the magazine in the bizarre predicament of having to round up a million or so new readers each year just to stand still. It annually loses a million readers. They die. An Official Journal To be sure, people are not plucking Modern Maturity off the newsstand or mailing in subscription orders. Anybody who pays $5 to join the American Association of Retired Persons - open to those who have celebrated their 50th birthday - gets the magazine. For 25 years now, ever since Ethel Percy Andrus, a retired teacher and principal, hatched both the association and the magazine, the A.A.R.P. has been publishing Modern Maturity as its official journal. Even though readers get the magazine automatically, Modern Maturity's executives say that their surveys show that people adore it, spending on average 81 minutes flipping through each issue. Thanks to marketers waking up to the dimensions of the aging population, ad revenues for Modern Maturity, which is nonprofit, jumped by 46 percent last year, to $9.9 million, good enough to place the periodical fifth on Adweek's ranking of the year's hottest magazines. This year, Modern Maturity expects another tidy advance, to $15.2 million. While old age has not entirely shed its image of frail bodies lying in hammocks, the people who put out Modern Maturity exude great pride in being able to serve those heading down the final stretch. 'These Are Terrific People' ''Our median age is 68 years old,'' said A. T. Sutherland Jr., the magazine's advertising director. ''I'm not going to deny that at all. I'm not going to apologize for that. Because these are terrific people.'' Articles in Modern Maturity are an upbeat mix of self-help accounts, profiles, travel pieces and the sort of tales grandfather might tell the kids over hot chocolate. Income and health are the top concerns of older people, and so the magazine is full of ways to fatten the nest egg, and tips on keeping the body and mind humming. One recent article, for instance, explored ''25 Ways to Beat the Blues.'' Among them: Plant some favorite flowers; live out a daydream; call two favorite people and tell them how much you love them. Another article looked at remarriage in later life. One newlywed exclaimed: ''I'm 64 and I feel 16.'' Older people love to regale listeners with reminiscences, and so the magazine runs a fair share of ''I was there'' articles. Joe Curreri wrote about a Sunday in 1944 when an aircraft he was in was gunned down over the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. On a smaller scale, Blake Bellows told about an episode driving his father's first car, a 1920 Dort. The hapless Mr. Bellows struck a shoulder of sand and his father was hurled into a ravine occupied by two cows. No Birth Control ''We think of ourselves as a broad general-interest magazine,'' said Hubert Pryor, who edited the magazine for 15 years and is now the publishing coordinator. ''We don't talk about birth control. That's about the only thing.'' ''If anything, I think the menu has become a little more active-oriented recently,'' said Robert Wood, the magazine's publishing director, who works out of editorial offices in Long Beach, Calif. ''A lot of readers play golf or tennis or go dancing, so we plan to do more on the sporty areas.'' The magazine also tries to keep its readers up on what is going on in Washington. Since the A.A.R.P. is nonpartisan, it does not endorse political candidates. But it does use columns in Modern Maturity for officers of the group to sound off. They have pressed for regulation of funeral industry pricing, criticized efforts to slash Social Security benefits and encouraged containment of health care costs. ''I think the magazine's great,'' said Virginia Marquardt, a retired secretary who has been reading it since 1966. ''I like the fact that they give us legislative news. I like the fact that they highlight individuals who have done something outstanding. I always go through the whole thing.'' President Reagan Doesn't Get It Incidentally, a notable nonrecipient of Modern Maturity is Ronald Reagan. As A.A.R.P. tells it, an admirer offered the President a gift membership, but he had to say no because he just did not have the time to participate actively. Despite its 25 years, Modern Maturity only began to take ads in 1980. It needed the money. The A.A.R.P. allots $2 out of the $5 dues to Modern Maturity, along with all ad revenues. But the magazine still runs a deficit. With ad growth, though, the journal is costing the association less and less money. Down the road, presuming ads keep picking up, Mr. Wood would like to transform Modern Maturity into a monthly. Modern Maturity is endlessly fussy about how products are pitched in its pages. ''We want to portray a positive image of aging,'' Mr. Sutherland explained. ''All old people are not infirm. They don't all have arthritis or clacking teeth.'' He went on: ''Some analgesic ads will have a headline that says 'Pain' and show a person racked in pain. We won't take pain as a headline. We won't take people racked in pain.'' Hearing Aids Taboo The magazine also will not take ads for cigarettes, wheelchairs, incontinence products, hearing aids or self-defense weapons. Hearing aids are taboo because readers have groused that makers do not always fit them properly. Not just any pretty face can turn up in a Modern Maturity ad, either. ''I'll give you a good example,'' Mr. Sutherland said. ''We had an ad for a stair slide. And it had a pretty young thing sitting in that stair glide with her legs showing up to her elbows. That wasn't appropriate. We had them change it to an older woman.'' Even though Modern Maturity officials are quick to note that the over-50 crowd is growing twice as fast as the American population, has $500 billion worth of spending power, buys 41 percent of the nation's coffee and 30 percent of room air-conditioners, they have to acknowledge that selling Madison Avenue on consumers in the golden years remains a struggle. Steadily, though, the magazine finds that marketers are waking up to the size of the aging population. ''I think that there is a growing acceptance that people do live beyond the age 49,'' Mr. Sutherland said. ''When you're carrying Jell-O advertising - which for years has been aimed at kids - and we're carrying Jell-O, then you know the message is getting across.''

554-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
A Haven on Verdi Square On the north of Verdi Square, where Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue meet, infamous years ago as ''Needle Park,'' a man sleeps in the middle of the sidewalk. Not against the building, where street people usually huddle, but right out in the middle. It has become a familiar sight to people passing the Apple Bank for Savings there. One raggedy bundle of bags and boxes looks pretty much like another, and, it turns out, the sidewalk is home not just to one man but to a succession. Buddy Gore, who was there the other night, explained. ''Cripes,'' he said, ''the other guy stayed and stayed. I had to wait for hours.'' Then it was his turn to doze in the middle of the sidewalk, a grizzled gnome with a pulled-down cap, a nondescript sweater, gear in twine-tied bags. He has been a street person a couple of years now. He said he does all right with some Social Security money, some from a veteran's pension, some odd jobs. Doesn't he ever feel menaced by riffraff from the park? ''They know better,'' he said, showing a slight flash of menace himself. It did not seem necessary to press for an answer why that might be. The answer to why he - and other street people - use the middle of the sidewalk was easy. There is a grating there that wafts warm air from a heating shaft.

Profit Reported By Genentech Genentech Inc., a leader in making recombinant DNA products for pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical markets, said it earned $340,000, or 2 cents a share, in the third quarter, in contrast to a loss of $1.2 million a year earlier. Revenues of the California company rose 76.4 percent, to $12.7 million, from $7.2 million. ''Human growth hormone is progressing well, on its way toward market,'' said Robert A. Swanson, Genentech's president and chief executive officer. ''During the third quarter, we filed the new drug application for marketing clearance by the Food and Drug Administration.'' Human growth hormone will be the first Genentech product to be sold under its own label. It is intended for treating short stature caused by a hormone deficiency.

558-> NATO ALLIES SEEM TO FAVOR CURB ON FLIGHTS TO MOSCOW
The United States and many of its allies moved today toward suspending for at least a week to 10 days air travel from their countries to the Soviet Union in response to the Soviet downing of a South Korean airliner. After a breakfast meeting between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers, spokesmen for various allied delegations said there was general agreement on the need for early action to demonstrate what the Canadian Minister of External Affairs said today was ''outraged public opinion around the world.'' The ministers were among the 35 attending the windup session of a conference on East-West security and cooperation. Mr. Shultz, who led the discussion, told the ministers that a show of allied indignation over the airliner incident and the ''unacceptable'' Soviet responses so far was needed. What was important, he said, was a demonstration of universal action, with the various countries taking steps they could accept without provoking dissension within the alliance. A Session With Gromyko On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Shultz is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union in what is likely to be a frosty session. Mr. Shultz said on the way here that he would refuse to discuss with Mr. Gromyko anything except Soviet human rights violations and ''particularly the shoot-down of the Korean airliner.'' An aide to Mr. Gromyko said this morning in a bantering way in the conference coffee shop: ''I heard on the Voice of America that Mr. Shultz is planning a short meeting. That's O.K. with me. It means I'll have fewer notes to write up.'' The United States had suggested through diplomatic channels last weekend that various countries suspend landing rights of Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, as well as flights by their own national airlines to Moscow for 60 to 90 days. Canada announced a 60-day ban on Soviet flights to and from Montreal on Monday. The United States had already banned flights of Aeroflot to the United States after the imposition of martial law in Poland in December 1981, and no American carrier currently flies to the Soviet Union. Spokesmen said that as a result of this morning's session a suspension of seven to 10 days was more likely than a 60- to 90-day ban. A British official said he expected action to be announced by early next week in advance of a special meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization called to consider a South Korean complaint against the Soviet Union. More Than Verbal Condemnation After the breakfast meeting with Mr. Shultz, West German, British and Canadian officials said there was a discussion of the kinds of steps that could be taken that went beyond merely verbal condemnation. ''We all agreed that it was vital to have a common position and not to have a repetition of the Olympic boycott fiasco or the pipeline debate,'' a British official said. He was referring to previous efforts by the United States to organize sanctions against the Soviet Union that produced more damage within the alliance than against the Russians. In 1980, after the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, President Carter called on United States allies to join in not sending athletes to the Moscow Olympics, causing a rift in the alliance between those that did and those that did not. Last year, President Reagan ordered a ban on the sale of American-made technology to the Soviet Union, even by foreign companies, causing deep divisions in the alliance until the ban was lifted. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Secretary, told a news conference that there was agreement among the allies this time to find ''as united, broadly supported, effective and swift'' an action as possible. Shorter Period Suggested Jean-Luc Pepin, the Canadian Minister of External Relations, said that after much discussion within the group it was agreed that it would be difficult for many governments to join in aviation suspensions for as long a period as suggested by Washington and begun by Ottawa. But he said that several ministers agreed that a period of a week to 10 days was feasible and would be sought. The West German spokesman said that Bonn agreed strongly on the need for a common approach, but that Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had pointed out some of the problems in suspending Lufthansa or Aeroflot service. Sir Geoffrey said that the suspension of air travel to and from Moscow was discussed in various options. He said it was important to get joint action quickly. But all spokesmen agreed that no announcement would be made here by NATO ministers.

559-> G.M. Planning A Job Cutback
The General Motors Corporation announced that about 1,350 hourly and salaried workers will lose their jobs by late summer next year when engine production at Chevrolet's Flint manufacturing complex is halted. G.M. said the L6 six-cylinder engine built at the Flint motor plant in the complex will not be offered on G.M. vehicles after the 1984 model year, which ends next Sept. 30. The L4 four-cylinder engine also built there can be assembled at a Tonawanda, N.Y., motor plant, G.M. said. About 1,100 autoworkers and 250 salaried employees will be affected, but another 300 workers in the motor plant's valve manufacturing and truck fleet operations will retain their jobs, the company said.

Keck Resigns From Superior Howard B. Keck, 69 years old, yesterday resigned from the board of directors of Superior Oil, the Houston-based oil company his father founded. Mr. Keck also resigned as chairman of the company's nominating committee, member of the executive committee and consultant to the company. Although Mr. Keck had resigned as chairman of the company in 1981, he continued to wield a great deal of power, controlling about 12.3 percent of Superior's stock. Earlier this year, Mr. Keck's sister, Willametta Keck Day, charged in a proxy fight that her brother and his colleagues at Superior were acting in their own best interests instead of looking out for the other shareholders.

562-> 'Drug Czar' Appended To Senate Money Bill
The Senate today approved legislation to create a Cabinet-level ''drug czar'' to run the Government's narcotics enforcement campaign, even though President Reagan vetoed a similar proposal in January. The voice vote came after the Senate rejected by a vote of 53 to 40 a motion to set aside the measure, which had been attached to a supplemental appropriations bill by Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, and Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolilna, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senators Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, and John C. Stennis, Democrat of Mississippi, ranking majority and minority members on the Appropriations Committee, opposed inclusion of the bill but were outvoted. ''This is not the place for it,'' Mr. Thurmond said. Mr. Reagan vetoed an anti-crime package in January because it contained clauses settting up a top drug official.

563-> ESSAY; TWO-FRONT PEACE
American military power is winning a victory in the Caribbean after suffering a humiliating defeat in Lebanon. The Grenada operation was well- conceived militarily (enough force in a contained area, with adequate reserves ready to conclude a clear mission) and well-planned diplomatically (with a request for action by neighboring islands, and their local Caribbean forces participating). The justification given was imminent danger to a thousand Americans after a Communist clique murdered the Government leaders, but a better reason became apparent after we landed: The resistance put up by hundreds of Cuban soldiers shows that Grenada was already under the military domination of another country, with more troops probably on the way. That island (its name from the Latin granum , meaning grain, which led to ''pomegranate'' and then to the similarly shaped ''hand grenade'') had already been invaded; our objective, as in Lebanon, is to get foreign forces out and leave. The only lapse of judgment apparent in this necessary regional defense was in the Pentagon's unprecedented decision to bar reporters from covering a U.S. invasion. That stamps every move after the initial landing as secret, makes suspect every Pentagon press release, and plays into the hands of the defeatists and isolationists horrified by every use of fire to fight fire. ''We don't have enough men to protect television cameramen, lighting crews and the like,'' Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger tells me. ''I don't want to do anything that weakens the ability of our men to do the job.'' Asked if the presence of reporters weakened General Eisenhower on D-Day, the unflappable Cap says: ''It's not a matter of censorship. I just don't second-guess our commanders in the field.'' In this case, the commander who preferred freedom from the press seems to have been Adm. Wesley McDonald. Otherwise, the operation to free Grenada is worthy of respect, in contrast to the anger that should be directed at the Defense Department for the incredibly complacent and tragically incompetent planning for U.S. Marine security at our base in Beirut. After a car bomb destroyed the U.S. Embassy there, and with our forces under sniper fire, it was logical to assume that Syrian-directed forces would try to blow up our headquarters with their usual technique. Instead of dispersing our men within a ''hard'' defense perimeter and setting up adequate barriers at entry points, as Americans learned to do in Vietnam, we relied on mere chain- link fences and wrought-iron gates that never could stop a truck. There are reports that our guards were told not to carry loaded weapons. We paid for this bungling with over 200 lives. The smoothover began with Secretary Weinberger's statement that ''nothing can work against a suicidal attack like that,'' and his dispatch of the Marine commandant to inspect Marine security. As expected, Gen. Paul Kelley arrived in Beirut spouting the party line that ''if you have a determined individual who is willing to . . . give up his life,'' the terrorist will succeed - ''so let's not blame the security measures.'' Asked about this rush to no judgment by the investigator, the Secretary of Defense snaps: ''If you're asking if I have a court-martial proceeding under way to get some of the men who weren't killed, the answer is no.'' He adds, less testily, ''I'm not prejudging anything, but I'm not interested in a sensational procedure. We will put into effect several recommendations he brings back.'' Proof that the security measures were to blame, along with the Syrian controllers of Iranian and Libyan terrorist groups, will be seen in those new security measures, including armored cars blocking entry points. Did we really have to wait for a military defeat to become prepared? The bombings of U.S. and French headquarters were not senseless, cowardly attacks on civilians; on the contrary, they were deliberate military actions directed at military targets with a mission of driving non- Arabs out of Lebanon. If the Department of Defensiveness cannot recognize its own failures, and is unwilling to correct the top brass responsible, then Congress should step in.The victory in Grenada is taking place after the defeat in Beirut; the ability demonstrated by the U.S. to react to provocation militarily will not be lost on the Syrians. In Lebanon, our mission should not be to find a fig leaf of a decent interval to withdraw our forces, as the fainthearted wish us to do. Instead we should be ostentatiously realigning ourselves with our only reliable Mideast ally, Israel, to serve warning to the users of terrorists that bloodshed will not go unpunished nor further buildup for occupation tolerated. That is when our easy victory in Grenada will help us redeem our terrible defeat in Beirut.

564-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Principals' Union Starts Campaign for City Schools
''Give the Kids a Hand'' reads a billboard at Broadway and Houston Street (and three others around the boroughs). ''Support Public Schools.'' The signs, to be supplemented by newspaper ads and radio spots beginning next Monday, the first day of school, are part of an unusual campaign by the Council of Supervisors and Administrators. The council, the union representing the city's 4,000 public school principals and administrators, hopes to encourage parents to send their children to public schools - and to encourage the government to restore cuts in education budgets. Getting the message across is costing $15,000, paid by the union. ''We believe in the schools and believe in the kids,'' Ted Elsberg, council president, said yesterday. ''And we're willing to put our money where our beliefs are.''

565-> PLAYS; DEATH OF A NO-HITTER
O ver the first seven innings, 27 Baltimore Orioles went to bat against Richard Dotson of the Chicago White Sox Wednesday night. Nineteen were retired routinely, seven walked and another hit into a double play. Going into the eighth inning of a scoreless game, no Oriole had managed a hit against the White Sox right-hander, and Dan Ford, the Baltimore right-fielder, had struck out twice and walked. Dotson struck out Al Bumbry, the Orioles' leadoff hitter, to open the eighth. Then Ford, a right-handed batter with a wide-open stance, stepped in, took a strike and drove the 0-1 pitch for an oppositefield home run, inside the right-field foul pole near the 309-foot mark. That run not only ended Dotson's no-hitter and shutout, but it also wound up giving the Orioles a 1-0 victory, the seventh triumph in their last eight games. The White Sox, who have not scored in 24 innings, lost their eighth game in the last nine. ''Ford has been hitting the ball pretty good,'' the 24-year-old Dotson said yesterday by telephone from Kansas City, the White Sox's next stop. ''I had gotten him the other two times on a fastball and a curve. I pretty much was throwing fastballs. I had a pretty good heater going, and there was no sense throwing anything else. I probably threw 10 breaking pitches all game. ''This time I just went at Ford. I wanted to throw him a pitch off the plate. It was a hard fastball, something like the pitch I got him with the second time. The pitch was not a mistake. It was a strike, and I put it where I wanted it. It was on his fist, and he just got around on it. He hit it pretty good, but it was to the shortest part of the park, and I suffered the consequences.'' It was the third homer and fourth game-winning run batted in for the 31-year-old Ford, who came to the Orioles from the California Angels two years ago in a trade for Doug DeCinces. Ford, who is batting .346, leads Baltimore in doubles (12) and hits (47). ''Although I wasn't thinking about a no-hitter,'' said Dotson, whose season mark dropped to 4-4, ''everybody wants to pitch a nohitter. I know I do. But losing the no-hitter didn't bother me as much as losing the game. When Ford lined the ball, my only thoughts were that his hit might beat me, and it did. I want to win. It's nice to pitch well and know you've pitched a one-hitter. But what we need is some hitting and to score some runs. ''I lost the game and a loss is a loss. There is never satisfaction in losing. I thought I pitched a pretty good game against the Yankees and lost that one, too. That's two complete games that I have pitched well in and lost.'' The White Sox have had only three complete games this season, two by Dotson. ''He was pitching real good,'' Ford said. ''He was throwing a tough fastball, but it was pretty straight. I just wanted to make contact in that situation. When I hit it, Dotson just looked down. You could tell it really hurt. I know how he feels. The guy pitched a good game and still came up short.''

567-> GOING OUT GUIDE
THE BALI WAY Before performing classical dance from their native Bali at the Asia Society this afternoon, Suarni and Suarti, who are sisters, will demonstrate its basic patterns and movements. The young women mastered them in training that began at the ages of 3 or 4, when their grandmother, a dancer in Bali, stood behind them, placing their hands this way or that - the fingers must be bent back far sometimes - and moving their bodies just so. For instance, there are special ways to go sideways, to use a fan to show agility and to be a butterfly or monkey. There are eye movements indicating love, sadness and anger, and uses of the fingers to express emotions and to suggest a bird. The audience will be invited to try out some of these things. During intermission, there will be demonstrations of gamelan instruments, Balinese painting and the making of a gebogan, which is an offering of flowers, fruit and incense. Gde Artha, who specializes in masked dance characters, will be a guest artist in the program, which starts at 2:30 P.M. and which begins a series of Saturday family dance events at the society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street. Tickets: $7 ($5 for children). Credit-card reservations: 288-6400, ext. 286. BACH IN BROOKLYN A Brooklyn Heights church that serves as a performing-arts center as well as a house of worship - the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, at Clinton and Montague Streets - opens its performance season tomorrow at 4 P.M. with the first of three Bach Cantata Sundays. Members of the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble and guests, conducted by the cellist Fred Sherry, will play Bach's Cantata No. 147 - the one with the chorale ''Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring'' - with the Saint Ann's School Choir. Dancers will perform a rarely performed court ballet by Monteverdi, ''Tirsi and Clori,'' with modern choreography by Matthew Diamond. Purcell's Sonata in D for trumpet and strings is also on the program. The concert begins a multimillion- dollar project to restore the church. Tickets: $10; subscription to all three concerts - the two others are Dec. 18 and March 18 - is $20. Reservations: 834-8794. TWO SMITHS Another church performance season - the Heavenly Jazz series at the Church of the Heavenly Rest, Fifth Avenue and 90th Street - gets under way on tomorrow at 5 P.M. with Carrie Smith singing mostly gospel songs and some spirituals in a tribute to Mahalia Jackson. Miss Smith's rich deep voice has reminded people of a famous namesake - Bessie Smith (no relation) - since she sang Bessie Smith songs at Carnegie Hall in 1974, and she says she doesn't mind. ''It's an honor if people think I'm doing something Bessie did,'' she said the other day. ''I never knock it.'' But, she added, ''I don't try to sound like anybody or look like anybody except me.'' Tickets: $7 ($5 for students and over-65's). Reservations: 369-8040.

568-> McCarthy Is Listed as 'Fair' At a Hospital in Washington
Eugene J. McCarthy, a former Senator and challenger for the Democratic Presidential nomination, was transferred to Georgetown University Hospital today, where he was listed in fair condition after a heart attack. Mr. McCarthy, who is 67 years old, was stricken Sunday night at his home in Woodville, Va., and was taken to a hospital in Culpeper, Va. ''The Senator is here for recuperation and observation,'' said Dr. Albert delNegro of Georgetown. ''He is in relatively stable condition.'' He said it was too soon to tell whether Mr. McCarthy would need surgery. Mr. McCarthy has experienced an accelerated heartbeat three times since entering the hospital, he said, something not uncommon in heart attack victims. Mr. McCarthy, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota who opposed the Vietnam War, left the Senate in 1970 after 22 years in Congress. He challenged President Johnson in 1968, and tried again for the Presidency in 1972 and 1976. He has been lecturing, teaching and writing for several years while living in Woodville, a rural community 60 miles southwest of Washington.

569-> 4 COWBOYS NAMED AS COCAINE USERS
Four members of the Dallas Cowboys - Harvey Martin, Tony Dorsett, Ron Springs and Larry Bethea - have been involved in discussions with Federal authorities after their names surfaced in a cocaine investigation, according to Federal law enforcement officials and the Cowboys' president. The officials said that the four players had been mentioned on an F.B.I. wiretap as users of small quantities of cocaine and that their lawyers had since been negotiating, and perhaps plea-bargaining, with the authorities. It could not be determined whether the players had been named or heard on the wiretap. Tex Schramm, the Cowboys' president, said that he was unaware the players had been implicated as users but that he had been informed by the National Football League's security office that they had been named in an investigation and had ''volunteered to give whatever help they could.'' Martin's attorney declined to confirm or deny that his client was talking to the authorities. Dorsett said by telephone from Shreveport, La., that he had been traveling and knew nothing of such an investigation but that ''I'm sure if I'm questioned I'll cooperate.'' He declined to comment on the report that he had been identified on the wiretap as a cocaine user. Telephone calls to the Dallas homes of the two other players failed to locate them yesterday. Martin's name surfaced in another drug matter yesterday when he and Tony Hill, another Cowboy, were subpoenaed to appear as defense witnesses at the trial in Dallas of a man accused of being a cocaine smuggler. It could not be determined if the two cases were related, but the prospect of the testimony by Martin and Hill was termed ''real interesting'' by Christopher Milner, the assistant United States attorney who is prosecuting the smuggling case. According to Martin's attorney, Dan Guthrie, the lawyers for Lauriberto Ignacio, the defendant in the smuggling case, want Martin to testify because, Mr. Guthrie said, he is implicated in a Drug Enforcement Administration report that will be presented as prosecution evidence at the trial, scheduled to begin next month. Telephone calls to the Dallas office of the D.E.A. were not returned. ''It will basically be to refute certain allegations contained in the D.E.A. report,'' Mr. Guthrie said, ''and show the untrustworthiness of certain witnesses. It will be to testify that Harvey Martin had nothing to do with cocaine transactions and did not have personal knowledge of the cocaine transaction on trial, contrary to statements to the D.E.A.'' Hill, like two of the Cowboys who are reportedly involved in negotiations with the authorities, could not be reached yesterday, and it could not be determined if he had retained a lawyer. Mr. Milner declined to confirm the existence of any D.E.A. report, but he called Mr. Guthrie's account plausible. ''If any of the Cowboys are coming to testify under oath as defense witnesses, that's real interesting,'' the prosecutor said, explaining that cross-examination in Federal Court can go well beyond the scope of direct examination and explore the witness's own involvement. Mr. Milner has not yet subpoenaed any witnesses for the prosecution, but when asked whether his list might also include some Cowboys. ''I have no comment on that subject,'' he said, ''but it's one of the best questions I've heard today.'' Mr. Ignacio, 39 years old, who lives in Texas, was indicted by a Federal grand jury in April on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine from Brazil to Texas for distribution purposes. The prosecutor said the charges against Mr. Ignacio were part of a larger investigation into Brazilian cocaine smuggling that began last year with the arrest of Elias Murbank, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and agreed to cooperate with investigators. Martin's name was brought up in another Dallas drug trial, last January, when a witness, Danny Stone, said he had used cocaine with the player. In a subsequent interview, Martin accused the witness of lying. Martin has repeatedly denied being a drug user, most recently last month after he had spent a week at a Minnesota drug rehabilitation center. Martin said he had been sent there to evaluate the facility for Tom Landry, the Cowboy coach. Of the four players identified as being involved in negotiations with the authorities, three are starters: Dorsett, a running back; Springs, a fullback, and Martin, a defensive end. Bethea is a backup defensive lineman.

Dome Petroleum Ltd. said its Dome Canada Ltd. affiliate and Hiram Walker Resources Ltd.'s Home Oil unit had agreed on a major three-year exploration and development program. Under the program, Dome Canada will spend about $1.1 billion and Home and its 88.5 percent owned Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd. unit about $390 million on work on Dome Petroleum lands. The Dome exploratory lands agreement between Dome Petroleum and Dome Canada has been amended to extend it until july 1, 1986, and its scope has been expanded to allow for delineation drilling on Dome Petroleum's semi-proven lands, Dome said. Home will participate in the agreement to the extent of 40 percent in western Canada and 25 percent in the Beaufort Sea region, excluding significant prior discovery areas. Dome Petroleum said the agreement would insure continued exploration and development work on its lands with a minimal capital investment.

574-> IMPACT OF FIGHT TO HALT DRUG FLOW CALLED NEGLIGIBLE
The Reagan Administration's efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country are having little impact so far, in part because of interagency rivalries and the failure to prosecute arrested drug traffickers, an investigative arm of Congress reports. The General Accounting Office, in a 94-page draft report given to President Reagan on Friday, said that only a small percentage of the illegal drugs entering the country were being seized despite the much publicized efforts of the Administration. The agency recommended establishing a single authority to coordinate and direct efforts now spread among the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service and the Coast Guard. The draft report was presented to Mr. Reagan at a meeting with Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, a sponsor of a bill passed by Congress that would establish a Cabinet-level official responsible for combating illegal drugs. Senator Biden and other sponsors urged Mr. Reagan to sign the measure. Opposition in Administration The legislation has been opposed by the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Customs Service and Coast Guard are branches of the Treasury Department. Though cooperation among the agencies is increasing, the General Accounting Office said, interagency conflict is built into the system because of the agencies' different priorities. The G.A.O. said the current arrangement also made Congressional tracking of drug enforcement efforts ''extremely difficult.'' The accounting agency said that more than 60 percent of those arrested as a result of offshore patrols by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard were never prosecuted in Federal courts. ''Double counting of drug seizures makes it impossible to get an accurate count of the drugs seized,'' it added. It noted that the largest cocaine seizure ever made in this country, 3,246 pounds last March at Miami International Airport, was counted twice, once each by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service. Special joint projects such as a law-enforcement group established by the Reagan Administration in south Florida last year might be the most effective approach to curtailing the flow of illegal drugs, the agency said, but it added that these were expensive and might have a limited impact. The Congressional agency estimated that the Florida group spent $62 million in 1982 and noted that the Administration was budgeting $127 million for similar efforts around the nation. But the report noted that Coast Guard officials said $2 billion in additional resources would be required to stop 75 percent of the marijuana coming into the country from the Caribbean. Reducing the flow of heroin and cocaine by the same amount would require billions of dollars more, the agency said.

575-> FROM THE POETS IN THE KITCHEN
SOME years ago, when I was teaching a graduate seminar in fiction at Columbia University, a well-known male novelist visited my class to speak on his development as a writer. In discussing his formative years, he didn't realize it but he seriously endangered his life by remarking that women writers are luckier than those of his sex because they usually spend so much time as children around their mothers and their mothers' friends in the kitchen. What did he say that for? The women students immediately forgot about being in awe of him and began readying their attack for the question and answer period later on. Even I bristled. There again was that awful image of women locked away from the world in the kitchen with only each other to talk to, and their daughters locked in with them. But my guest wasn't really being sexist or trying to be provocative or even spoiling for a fight. What he meant -when he got around to examining himself more fully - was that, given the way children are (or were) raised in our society, with little girls kept closer to home and their mothers, the woman writer stands a better chance of being exposed, while growing up, to the kind of talk that goes on among women, more often than not in the kitchen; and that this experience gives her an edge over her male counterpart by instilling in her an appreciation for ordinary speech. It was clear that my guest lecturer attached great importance to this, which is understandable. Common speech and the plain, workaday words that make it up are, after all, the stock in trade of some of the best fiction writers. They are the principal means by which a character in a novel or story reveals himself and gives voice sometimes to profound feelings and complex ideas about himself and the world. Perhaps the proper measure of a writer's talent is his skill in rendering everyday speech - when it is appropriate to his story - as well as his ability to tap, to exploit, the beauty, poetry and wisdom it often contains. ''If you say what's on your mind in the language that comes to you from your parents and your street and friends you'll probably say something beautiful.'' Grace Paley tells this, she says, to her students at the beginning of every writing course. It's all a matter of exposure and a training of the ear for the would-be writer in those early years of his or her apprenticeship. And, according to my guest lecturer, this training, the best of it, often takes place in as unglamorous a setting as the kitchen. He didn't know it, but he was essentially describing my experience as a little girl. I grew up among poets. Now they didn't look like poets - whatever that breed is supposed to look like. Nothing about them suggested that poetry was their calling. They were just a group of ordinary housewives and mothers, my mother included, who dressed in a way (shapeless housedresses, dowdy felt hats and long, dark, solemn coats) that made it impossible for me to imagine they had ever been young. Nor did they do what poets were supposed to do -spend their days in an attic room writing verses. They never put pen to paper except to write occasionally to their relatives in Barbados. ''I take my pen in hand hoping these few lines will find you in health as they leave me fair for the time being,'' was the way their letters invariably began. Rather, their day was spent ''scrubbing floor,'' as they described the work they did. Several mornings a week these unknown bards would put an apron and a pair of old house shoes in a shopping bag and take the train or streetcar from our section of Brooklyn out to Flatbush. There, those who didn't have steady jobs would wait on certain designated corners for the white housewives in the neighborhood to come along and bargain with them over pay for a day's work cleaning their houses. This was the ritual even in the winter. Later, armed with the few dollars they had earned, which in their vocabulary became ''a few raw-mouth pennies,'' they made their way back to our neighborhood, where they would sometimes stop off to have a cup of tea or cocoa together before going home to cook dinner for their husbands and children. The basement kitchen of the brownstone house where my family lived was the usual gathering place. Once inside the warm safety of its walls the women threw off the drab coats and hats, seated themselves at the large center table, drank their cups of tea or cocoa, and talked. While my sister and I sat at a smaller table over in a corner doing our homework, they talked - endlessly, passionately, poetically, and with impressive range. No subject was beyond them. True, they would indulge in the usual gossip: whose husband was running with whom, whose daughter looked slightly ''in the way'' (pregnant) under her bridal gown as she walked down the aisle. That sort of thing. But they also tackled the great issues of the time. They were always, for example, discussing the state of the economy. It was the mid and late 30's then, and the aftershock of the Depression, with its soup lines and suicides on Wall Street, was still being felt. Some people, they declared, didn't know how to deal with adversity. They didn't know that you had to ''tie up your belly'' (hold in the pain, that is) when things got rough and go on with life. They took their image from the bellyband that is tied around the stomach of a newborn baby to keep the navel pressed in. They talked politics. Roosevelt was their hero. He had come along and rescued the country with relief and jobs, and in gratitude they christened their sons Franklin and Delano and hoped they would live up to the names. If F.D.R. was their hero, Marcus Garvey was their God. The name of the fiery, Jamaican-born black nationalist of the 20's was constantly invoked around the table. For he had been their leader when they first came to the United States from the West Indies shortly after World War I. They had contributed to his organization, the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), out of their meager salaries, bought shares in his ill-fated Black Star Shipping Line, and at the height of the movement they had marched as members of his ''nurses' brigade'' in their white uniforms up Seventh Avenue in Harlem during the great Garvey Day parades. Garvey: He lived on through the power of their memories. And their talk was of war and rumors of wars. They raged against World War II when it broke out in Europe, blaming it on the politicians. ''It's these politicians. They're the ones always starting up all this lot of war. But what they care? It's the poor people got to suffer and mothers with their sons.'' If it was their sons, they swore they would keep them out of the Army by giving them soap to eat each day to make their hearts sound defective. Hitler? He was for them ''the devil incarnate.'' Then there was home. They reminisced often and at length about home. The old country. Barbados - or Bimshire, as they affectionately called it. The little Caribbean island in the sun they loved but had to leave. ''Poor - poor but sweet'' was the way they remembered it. And naturally they discussed their adopted home. America came in for both good and bad marks. They lashed out at it for the racism they encountered. They took to task some of the people they worked for, especially those who gave them only a hard-boiled egg and a few spoonfuls of cottage cheese for lunch. ''As if anybody can scrub floor on an egg and some cheese that don't have no taste to it!'' Yet although they caught H in ''this man country,'' as they called America, it was nonetheless a place where ''you could at least see your way to make a dollar.'' That much they acknowledged. They might even one day accumulate enough dollars, with both them and their husbands working, to buy the brownstone houses which, like my family, they were only leasing at that period. This was their consuming ambition: to ''buy house'' and to see the children through. THERE was no way for me to understand it at the time, but the talk that filled the kitchen those afternoons was highly functional. It served as therapy, the cheapest kind available to my mother and her friends. Not only did it help them recover from the long wait on the corner that morning and the bargaining over their labor, it restored them to a sense of themselves and reaffirmed their self-worth. Through language they were able to overcome the humiliations of the work-day. But more than therapy, that freewheeling, wide-ranging, exuberant talk functioned as an outlet for the tremendous creative energy they possessed. They were women in whom the need for self-expression was strong, and since language was the only vehicle readily available to them they made of it an art form that - in keeping with the African tradition in which art and life are one - was an integral part of their lives. And their talk was a refuge. They never really ceased being baffled and overwhelmed by America - its vastness, complexity and power. Its strange customs and laws. At a level beyond words they remained fearful and in awe. Their uneasiness and fear were even reflected in their attitude toward the children they had given birth to in this country. They referred to those like myself, the little Brooklynborn Bajans (Barbadians), as ''these New York children'' and complained that they couldn't discipline us properly because of the laws here. ''You can't beat these children as you would like, you know, because the authorities in this place will dash you in jail for them. After all, these is New York children.'' Not only were we different, American, we had, as they saw it, escaped their ultimate authority. Confronted therefore by a world they could not encompass, which even limited their rights as parents, and at the same time finding themselves permanently separated from the world they had known, they took refuge in language. ''Language is the only homeland,'' Czeslaw Milosz, the emigre Polish writer and Nobel Laureate, has said. This is what it became for the women at the kitchen table. It served another purpose also, I suspect. My mother and her friends were after all the female counterpart of Ralph Ellison's invisible man. Indeed, you might say they suffered a triple invisibility, being black, female and foreigners. They really didn't count in American society except as a source of cheap labor. But given the kind of women they were, they couldn't tolerate the fact of their invisibility, their powerlessness. And they fought back, using the only weapon at their command: the spoken word. Those late afternoon conversations on a wide range of topics were a way for them to feel they exercised some measure of control over their lives and the events that shaped them. ''Soully-gal, talk yuh talk!'' they were always exhorting each other. ''In this man world you got to take yuh mouth and make a gun!'' They were in control, if only verbally and if only for the two hours or so that they remained in our house. For me, sitting over in the corner, being seen but not heard, which was the rule for children in those days, it wasn't only what the women talked about -the content - but the way they put things - their style. The insight, irony, wit and humor they brought to their stories and discussions and their poet's inventiveness and daring with language - which of course I could only sense but not define back then. They had taken the standard English taught them in the primary schools of Barbados and transformed it into an idiom, an instrument that more adequately described them -changing around the syntax and imposing their own rhythm and accent so that the sentences were more pleasing to their ears. They added the few African sounds and words that had survived, such as the derisive suck-teeth sound and the word ''yam,'' meaning to eat. And to make it more vivid, more in keeping with their expressive quality, they brought to bear a raft of metaphors, parables, Biblical quotations, sayings and the like: ''The sea ain' got no back door,'' they would say, meaning that it wasn't like a house where if there was a fire you could run out the back. Meaning that it was not to be trifled with. And meaning perhaps in a larger sense that man should treat all of nature with caution and respect. ''I has read hell by heart and called every generation blessed!'' They sometimes went in for hyperbole. A woman expecting a baby was never said to be pregnant. They never used that word. Rather, she was ''in the way'' or, better yet, ''tumbling big.'' ''Guess who I butt up on in the market the other day tumbling big again!'' And a woman with a reputation of being too free with her sexual favors was known in their book as a ''thoroughfare'' - the sense of men like a steady stream of cars moving up and down the road of her life. Or she might be dubbed ''a free-bee,'' which was my favorite of the two. I liked the image it conjured up of a woman scandalous perhaps but independent, who flitted from one flower to another in a garden of male beauties, sampling their nectar, taking her pleasure at will, the roles reversed. And nothing, no matter how beautiful, was ever described as simply beautiful. It was always ''beautiful-ugly'': the beautiful-ugly dress, the beautiful-ugly house, the beautiful-ugly car. Why the word ''ugly,'' I used to wonder, when the thing they were referring to was beautiful, and they knew it. Why the antonym, the contradiction, the linking of opposites? It used to puzzle me greatly as a child. There is the theory in linguistics which states that the idiom of a people, the way they use language, reflects not only the most fundamental views they hold of themselves and the world but their very conception of reality. Perhaps in using the term ''beautifulugly'' to describe nearly everything, my mother and her friends were expressing what they believed to be a fundamental dualism in life: the idea that a thing is at the same time its opposite, and that these opposites, these contradictions make up the whole. But theirs was not a Manichaean brand of dualism that sees matter, flesh, the body, as inherently evil, because they constantly addressed each other as ''soully-gal'' - soul: spirit; gal: the body, flesh, the visible self. And it was clear from their tone that they gave one as much weight and importance as the other. They had never heard of the mind / body split. As for God, they summed up His essential attitude in a phrase. ''God,'' they would say, ''don' love ugly and He ain' stuck on pretty.'' Using everyday speech, the simple commonplace words -but always with imagination and skill - they gave voice to the most complex ideas. Flannery O'Connor would have approved of how they made ordinary language work, as she put it, ''double-time,'' stretching, shading, deepening its meaning. Like Joseph Conrad they were always trying to infuse new life in the ''old old words worn thin ... by ... careless usage.'' And the goals of their oral art were the same as his: ''to make you hear, to make you feel ... to make you see.'' This was their guiding esthetic. By the time I was 8 or 9, I graduated from the corner of the kitchen to the neighborhood library, and thus from the spoken to the written word. The Macon Street Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library was an imposing half block long edifice of heavy gray masonry, with glass-paneled doors at the front and two tall metal torches symbolizing the light that comes of learning flanking the wide steps outside. The inside was just as impressive. More steps - of pale marble with gleaming brass railings at the center and sides - led up to the circulation desk, and a great pendulum clock gazed down from the balcony stacks that faced the entrance. Usually stationed at the top of the steps like the guards outside Buckingham Palace was the custodian, a stern-faced West Indian type who for years, until I was old enough to obtain an adult card, would immediately shoo me with one hand into the Children's Room and with the other threaten me into silence, a finger to his lips. You would have thought he was the chief librarian and not just someone whose job it was to keep the brass polished and the clock wound. I put him in a story called ''Barbados'' years later and had terrible things happen to him at the end. I was sheltered from the storm of adolescence in the Macon Street library, reading voraciously, indiscriminately, everything from Jane Austen to Zane Grey, but with a special passion for the long, fullblown, richly detailed 18th-and 19th-century picaresque tales: ''Tom Jones.'' ''Great Expectations.'' ''Vanity Fair.'' BUT although I loved nearly everything I read and would enter fully into the lives of the characters - indeed, would cease being myself and become them - I sensed a lack after a time. Something I couldn't quite define was missing. And then one day, browsing in the poetry section, I came across a book by someone called Paul Laurence Dunbar, and opening it I found the photograph of a wistful, sad-eyed poet who to my surprise was black. I turned to a poem at random. ''Little brown-baby wif spa'klin' / eyes / Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.'' Although I had a little difficulty at first with the words in dialect, the poem spoke to me as nothing I had read before of the closeness, the special relationship I had had with my father, who by then had become an ardent believer in Father Divine and gone to live in Father's ''kingdom'' in Harlem. Reading it helped to ease somewhat the tight knot of sorrow and longing I carried around in my chest that refused to go away. I read another poem. ''Lias! ''Lias! Bless de Lawd! / Don' you know de day's / erbroad? / Ef you don' get up, you scamp / Dey'll be trouble in dis camp.'' I laughed. It reminded me of the way my mother sometimes yelled at my sister and me to get out of bed in the mornings. And another: ''Seen my lady home las' night / Jump back, honey, jump back./ Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight ...'' About love between a black man and a black woman. I had never seen that written about before and it roused in me all kinds of delicious feelings and hopes. And I began to search then for books and stories and poems about ''The Race'' (as it was put back then), about my people. While not abandoning Thackeray, Fielding, Dickens and the others, I started asking the reference librarian, who was white, for books by Negro writers, although I must admit I did so at first with a feeling of shame - the shame I and many others used to experience in those days whenever the word ''Negro'' or ''colored'' came up. No grade school literature teacher of mine had ever mentioned Dunbar or James Weldon Johnson or Langston Hughes. I didn't know that Zora Neale Hurston existed and was busy writing and being published during those years. Nor was I made aware of people like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman - their spirit and example - or the great 19th-century abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth. There wasn't even Negro History Week when I attended P.S. 35 on Decatur Street! What I needed, what all the kids - West Indian and native black American alike - with whom I grew up needed, was an equivalent of the Jewish shul, someplace where we could go after school - the schools that were shortchanging us - and read works by those like ourselves and learn about our history. It was around that time also that I began harboring the dangerous thought of someday trying to write myself. Perhaps a poem about an apple tree, although I had never seen one. Or the story of a girl who could magically transplant herself to wherever she wanted to be in the world - such as Father Divine's kingdom in Harlem. Dunbar - his dark, eloquent face, his large volume of poems -permitted me to dream that I might someday write, and with something of the power with words my mother and her friends possessed. When people at readings and writers' conferences ask me who my major influences were, they are sometimes a little disappointed when I don't immediately name the usual literary giants. True, I am indebted to those writers, white and black, whom I read during my formative years and still read for instruction and pleasure. But they were preceded in my life by another set of giants whom I always acknowledge before all others: the group of women around the table long ago. They taught me my first lessons in the narrative art. They trained my ear. They set a standard of excellence. This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them; it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen.

576-> TOURING OLD STONE HOUSES OF HUDSON VALLEY TOWN
In 1777, as British forces advanced up the Hudson River, the Council of Safety, the governing body of New York State, moved to Hurley in the central Hudson Valley and established a temporary capital. For about four weeks, the council met in the large dining room of Jan van Deusen's stone house, hiding the state records in a secret room, accessible only through a trap door in the kitchen. Since then, local historians have called Hurley the capital of New York State for a month. Tomorrow, from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., the van Deusen and 10 other stone houses in Hurley, some dating from the early days of Dutch settlement,will be opened. It is the only day of the year that the houses, which are privately owned and occupied, can be seen by the public. First Buildings of Wood When the village was established in 1661, the first Dutch and Huguenot settlers built their houses of wood and called the site Nieuw Dorp, Dutch for ''new village.'' But after Indians burned the houses, they were replaced by sturdy stone structures. In 1669, five years after the British took possession of Dutch New York, the town was renamed Hurley for the ancestral birthplace of the new governor. More than 300 years later, the stone houses in the settlement, some with walls 18 inches thick, stand as good as new, some perhaps better for having been restored by generations of people who bought, added to and improved them. But many of them still bear a Dutch imprint - gabled roofs, Dutch doors, sloping dormers and square shuttered windows. The tour is being sponsored by the Reformed Church of Hurley, which was built in 1853 with stones from the original 1801 church. Visit to 'Spy' House The tour will include the Dumond, or ''spy,'' house, built before the American Revolution, where Lieut. David Taylor, a British spy, was confined after his capture in 1777 and from which he was led to his execution; the Ten Eyck house, built in 1780 by Dr. Richard Ten Eyck for his bride, Janet Baker of New Jersey, with a bull's-eye in the dining-room door to keep out evil spirits and a gunhole in the shutters on the stone porch to shoot at marauding Indians, and the Jonathan Elmendorf house, built between 1783 and 1790, with hand-hewn beams and wide ceiling boards. In addition, the 1735 Polly Crispell cottage, with a ''witchcatcher'' of iron spikes in the chimney; a Wynkcop house, which is said to have been started by Cornelius Wynkcop, who died in 1676; the Houghtaling house, built in the late 1790's, with massive hand-hewn beams in the living room, and the Ten Eyck Bouwerie, built before 1750, a 10-room farmhouse. Also, the Hurley Patentee Manor, the hub of a 92,000-acre Hurley patent, or land grant, built by Cornelius Cool, with the original cottage dating from 1696, and to which a Georgian wing was added in 1745, and the Johannis DuBois house, built before 1739, with the original fireplace still in use. Free Bus Service The house tours will start at the church. Most of them are within easy walking distance, but the sponsors are operating a free bus service to and from the outlying buildings. Tickets are $3.50; $1 for children. Besides the tour, the program includes a country fair in the lower level of the church, an antiques show and book sale on the library grounds, a strawberry shortcake booth in the parsonage backyard and lunch made by local cooks served at the church. The best way to Hurley by car is to take the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway to Exit 19 at Kingston, then Route 28 west a short distance and Route 209 south.

577-> ISRAEL'S TESHUVAH MOVEMENT SHOWS A WAY TO ANCIENT ROOTS
Many students at the Ohr Someyach (Happy Light) yeshivah here have fresh, wispy attempts at beards and wear bright unfaded skullcaps that stick out like new tennis shoes. They may be found asking embarrassingly basic questions about belief in God and the meaning of life, or committing religious gaffes - such as trying to turn on lights on Saturday - that display ignorance of the most fundamental rules of Orthodox Judaism. If these students remain long enough, however, they will become full-fledged ''born-again'' Jews, known in Hebrew as ''Baalei Teshuvah,'' literally those who repent or return. Since the 1960's, an estimated 10,000 Jews, mostly Americans from Reform, Conservative or completely nonreligious backgrounds have gone the route through Israeli institutions like Ohr Someyach. They come out as practicing Orthodox Jews who pray at least three times a day, study the sacred Jewish text with fervor, request arranged marriages and often settle in the Holy Land. The Teshuvah movement has slowly begun to overcome its reputation as a cult phenomenon that absorbs basically normal, somewhat lost young adults and molds them into black-garbed zealots who refuse to eat at their parents' home if the food is not kosher. Its numbers have grown to the point that Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek has wryly dubbed it ''the biggest industry we have.'' According to Janet Aviad, a sociologist and author of ''Return to Judaism: Religious Renewal in Israel,'' the Jews who have gone through Baalei Teshuvah yeshivas have ''put Orthodox and Ultra-orthodox Judaism on the agenda.'' This Jewish revivalism fits into the same general framework as the Christian born-again movement, she said, but differs in that it promotes direct return to more rigid, traditional forms of worship, rather than exploration of new ones. Ohr Someyach students, asked about their reasons for being there, sound reminiscent of the alienated, antimaterialist young people on the eastward trek to spiritual fulfillment who became the yeshiva's first members in the early 1970's. The word every student and rabbi used was ''meaning.'' ''There is a purpose and meaning to life when you acquire Torah that you just didn't have before,'' said Aaron Tobin, 22, a recent communications graduate from Michigan State University. ''At Michigan State they taught me how to earn money; they don't teach you how to live your life.'' Dr. Dovid Gottlieb, who grew up in Manhattan and Scarsdale and is now a popular teacher at Ohr Someyach, ''converted'' in the 1960's when the modern Teshuvah movement was still in its infancy. ''I was considering becoming a lawyer,'' he said, ''and I pictured what my tombstone would look like: 'He left 4200 contracts; he argued 3500 cases.' And I thought: 'That's what I'm leaving behind me?' It wasn't rich enough, it wasn't productive enough, it wasn't good enough.'' In accepting the entire body of Judaic scripture, the students often find preformulated answers, hammered out over thousands of years, to mankind's major questions. ''Or at least,'' one student said, ''we know where to look for them.'' After a year or so, said Laibel Shugarman, formerly of Baltimore, ''You don't ask the serious questions anymore. Like 'Why do I live?' Americans ask that all the time. Yes, there are still things to learn, but the fundamentals are settled.'' Rabbis at Ohr Someyach, which is by far the largest of the Baalei Teshuvah yeshivas, with almost 1,000 students (about 700 of them American) and a $2.5 million annual budget, say that students are never forced to follow the religious laws. They are free to leave the modern campus in northern Jerusalem whenever they wish - and many do after a few days or weeks. Visitors are allowed, shorts, sandals and tee-shirts are acceptable. The only hint of coercion, students said, comes from overzealous peers eager to initiate newcomers. Rabbi Nota Schiller, a former Brooklyn resident who is dean at Ohr Someyach, said that if a student leaves after a short time and remains unreligious but, because of his experience there, refrains from marrying a non-Jew, then the yeshiva is satisfied, having at least prevented further assimilation. When it first began, Ohr Someyach got most of its students ''off the wall.'' Trained recruiters approached awestruck young American Jews at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall and invited them to share a meal, try a course in a yeshivah, explore their Judaism. Now its outreach network in the United States, England and South Africa has become so extensive that, according to Rabbi Schiller, recruitment provides only about 20 percent of the students. Outside donations make up three-quarters of the yeshiva's budget, with the rest coming from the Israeli Government. He said students come from all over America, with a slightly higher proportion from ''Middle America'' - smaller cities in the Middle West and West - than warranted by the distribution of the Jewish population. Although Ohr Someyach runs short seminars on Judaism around the United States and special courses at its American branch in Monsey, N.Y., Rabbi Schiller said that Teshuvah activity in America remains ''peanuts'' compared to Israel. It took Americans to spark the Teshuvah movement, he said, but it never could have caught fire without ''the mystique of the Jewish land.''

579-> IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES
The Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music takes on an international flavor when the Carolyn Carlson Dance Theater of La Fenice makes its American debut on Thursday at 8 P.M. Experimental in its aims, the company is based at La Fenice, Venice's elegant opera house, and Miss Carlson, an American, is a former soloist with the Nikolais Dance Theater. After leaving that company to choreograph in 1971, she has repeatedly brought new ideas to old institutions. In 1974 she was appointed a choreographer at the venerable Paris Opera and since 1980 she has been associated with La Fenice. She returns to her native land with ''Underwood,'' a full-evening work with music by Rene Aubry. International in its own way is ''Artificial Horizon,'' the work for two drummers, six dancers and two multilingual speakers that Jane Comfort will present at the Bessie Sch"onberg Theater, beginning Thursday at 8 P.M. Miss Comfort, who is interested in language rhythms, as well as choreographic rhythms, has prepared a text, to be spoken in English, French, German and Portuguese, that reflects her concern with the inconsistencies of speech and its potential for misinterpretation. There will also be a percussion score by Auchee Lee.

Cluett, Peabody & Company, a New York-based apparel concern, said it would sell Boyd's, the last of its specialty store group, and said it had begun discussions with a group of investors interested in the eight Boyd's stores. Cluett said it would provide a reserve of six cents a share in the second quarter to cover combined costs of the disposal, the recent withdrawal from its Young Quinlan store in Minneapolis and the discontinuance of its Retail Stores division. The company said the operations did not project a near-term potential for reaching target levels of return on investment.

582-> COMPLETION DATE IN MID-'86 SEEN FOR CONVENTION CENTER
New York City's troubled Convention Center will probably not be completed until the summer of 1986, two years behind schedule, and will cost $125 million more than originally planned, according a report prepared for Governor Cuomo and released yesterday. The cost figure of $500 million is $50 million higher than the largest previous estimate of overruns. The completion date is several months later than the longest past estimate of delay. The report, written by William J. Stern, chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation, estimates, however, that a section of the center with more than 400,000 square feet can be open by mid-1985. Officials of the Convention Center Operating Corporation, which was created by the State Legislature to manage the more than onemillion-square-foot center, have said that more than 100 conventions and shows with the potential to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of business into the city have reserved dates in the hall in 1984 and 1985. Overhaul of Management As expected, Mr. Stern, who took office in March, recommended that the center's problems be tackled through an overhaul of its management structure, private management of the building and an investigation into a sales lease-back plan in which private investors would buy the building and lease it back to the state. In a separate letter, Richard Ravitch, whom Mr. Cuomo had asked to work on the report with Mr. Stern, said, ''I essentially agree'' with much of the Stern recommendations. But Mr. Ravitch, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, took issue with Mr. Stern's criticism of construction decisions made at the start. Mr. Cuomo, in a statement on the oft-delayed report, which he had requested in late March for delivery within 20 days, said that for all the center's problems, ''Mr. Stern and Mr. Ravitch nevertheless conclude, and I agree, that the 1979 decision to proceed on the project was correct.'' ''The need for and potential benefits of a New York City Convention Center were great then and are even greater now,'' the Governor said. The center, which is more than half complete, is rising between 11th and 12th Avenues and 34th and 38th Streets. Although some concern about costs always surrounded the center, it became critical last summer when small cracks were detected in the metal nodes being fabricated for its Tinkertoy-like space frame. Agreement With Contractor On-site work on the frame, which was supposed to begin last fall, still has not begun, but, according to Mr. Stern's report, a tentative agreement has been reached with the frame's contractor that would allow on-site work to begin by October. The agreement must still be approved by the four-man board of the Convention Center Development Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation. In the report, Mr. Stern, however, said the problems at the center extended beyond the problems with the nodes. He said a decision to ''fast-track'' construction on the project -that is to begin work before final design plans and working drawings for the center were complete - led to ''an entire 'mind-set' on the part of the previous management directed at pushing the project along quickly.'' ''The subtle costs of bad decisions associated with this method of project management are largely incalculable,'' he said. Barring Unforeseen Problems Mr. Stern estimated $500 million for the total cost, barring unforeseen problems. He started with a $425 million estimate that had been suggested to him in a memo by Robert Jacobs, a former vice president of construction for the Urban Development Corporation. To this he added a $55 million contingency fund, $10 million for additional furniture, fixtures and equipment, and $10 million to complete a block-square plaza in front of the center's entrance that had been scrapped in an economy move. Two organizations, which often feud, are involved in the project - the Convention Center Development Corporation, which is building it, and the Convention Center Operating Corporation, which is marketing it and was designated to run it when it is complete. John C. Lankenau, a board member of the Convention Center Operating Corporation, which has recently skirmished with Mr. Stern, said: ''I think they've taken a worst-case estimate in order to avoid a backend problem. I think it's self-protective in part on Mr. Stern's part.'' 'Damaging to the City' ''It's very harmful to leasing the center,'' he said. ''It's going to be very damaging to the city and the state to have the date extended for those kind of reasons.'' Mr. Stern, who has recommended that the two corporations be replaced by a single organization responsible to the Governor, declined to respond to Mr. Lankenau's comment. He said that while the agreement with the space frame contractor could be approved in short order, it could take a year and a half to work out a sale and leaseback of the center. Under this sort of an agreement, the state would sell the center to private investors who would be able to claim a large depreciation tax credit on the property. In turn the investors would provide enough money to complete the project and would lease the center to the state in a way in which tax benefits would be shared through lower lease payments. While such an arrangement is being worked out, Mr. Stern said, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is financing the project, might have to float a new bond issue to cover costs. Preserving the Value Mr. Ravitch cautioned in his letter that ''care should be taken to preserve for the public the residual value of the property if a sales lease-back comes to fruition.'' Some critics of such agreements have been wary about how a state or local government can guarantee that it would regain ownership of a property when a lease expires. He also pointed out that the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, of which he is chairman, had not made an independent projection of costs and he defended the ''fast-track'' construction decision as ''a reasonable one at the time it was made.'' Mr. Stern said that work would begin shortly on a backup construction system that does not involve a space frame in case there are further problems with the system.

584-> FORT WAYNE MOBILIZES TO AID THOSE LEFT JOBLES BY TRUCK PLANT'S CLOSING
As the final shift ended at International Harvester Company's truck-building plant here today, an era came to a close. That point is best understood by the 2,200 workers whose jobs were lost with the closing. ''I know things are going to be different,'' said Jerry DeLeon, as he walked into Harvester's sprawling, red-brick factory this morning for his final day's work after more than 21 years with the company. ''I'm not bitter about it. That's life,'' the 48-year-old engine repairman said. What does concern Mr. DeLeon, and many colleagues who are joining him on the unemployment rolls, is the uncertainty of trying to find jobs in a community that already has an unemployment rate of 10.3 percent in a work force of about 165,000 people. These workers also know that the skills they learned in truck manufacturing are not the skills needed by business and industry today in an economy shifting toward high technology and away from heavy manufacturing. Dim Prospects for Graduates Gone are the days of full employment, or nearly full employment, in Fort Wayne, when a high school graduate could land a good-paying job that offered security and stability by simply applying at the factory gate. None are more painfully aware of that change than Mr. DeLeon and his fellow workers, many of whom have worked only at Harvester throughout their adult lives. ''All I can say is, I've been looking for a job,'' Mr. DeLeon said. ''I've been watching the ads in the newspaper, which aren't much.'' Walter E. Stroup, a 46-year-old worker in the plant's axle and transmission division, thought he had a job lined up to replace the one he lost today after 25 years with the company. ''But business fell off,'' and Mr. Stroup no longer knows if the second concern will hire him. Earl S. Peters, a 29-year veteran employee, counts himself among the lucky. He will spend the next several weeks along with several hundred other workers shutting down the plant, and then Mr. Peters, a 47-year-old shipping freight scheduler, will move to the company's Parts Distribution Center in Fort Wayne. An estimated 300 jobs at the Parts Center and about 500 mostly white-collar jobs at the company's Engineering and Design Center, both separate from the truck factory, will be all that remains of the more than 10,000 jobs Harvester once contributed to the economy, said William H. Greenhill, Harvester's manager of corporate communications. Down to 'a Couple of Guards' ''Six weeks out, you'll be down to a couple of guards, and that will be about it,'' said Mr. Greenhill. The company opened the plant, which has nearly 2 million square feet of assembly area under one roof, in 1923. Harvester had been lured to the community with an incentive package that included utility hookups, a trolley line, the construction of railroad tracks for the plant and a promise to build 1,000 homes for workers. Just such an incentive package figured in Harvester's decision last September to phase out truck production in Fort Wayne and consolidate it in Springfield, Ohio, as part of the ailing truck and agricultural equipment manufacturing concern''s effort to stave off bankruptcy and return to profitability. Last summer Harvester asked the two communities to offer it financial incentives to consolidate truck production in the two areas, to save jobs. The request set off a bidding war, and Springfield, with help from Ohio's state government, offered Harvester $27.6 million in incentives. Fort Wayne, with help from Indiana and county governments, put together a package valued at $31 million. Springfield the Final Choice Although Fort Wayne won the bidding contest, Harvester announced it was moving production to Springfield and closing the Fort Wayne plant, a decision that jolted this community of approximately 172,000 people. But, according to Bruce K. Hetrick, a city government spokesman, significant strides have been made toward recovering from the loss of Harvester. Mr. Hetrick points to the conversion of the incentives package for Harvester into similar programs to lure other businesses to Fort Wayne. In addition, the city has provided social service agencies with added resources to help the newly unemployed and continue aiding those already laid off. The city won an All-America City award from the National Municipal League as well as a City Livability Award from the United States Conference of Mayors and Philip Morris that, Mr. Hetrick said, would help in national advertising campaigns, also designed to bring in new business. ''Those were important parts of a national public relations effort to put Fort Wayne on the map for something besides a flood,'' Mr. Hetrick said, referring to the flooding in Fort Wayne in March 1982 that brought the community national attention. But, so far, the public relations effort has brought Fort Wayne no new major employers.

588-> DE GUSTIBUS; NEVER EAT AT 'MOM'S,' AND OTHER RULES OF THE ROAD
The peak vacation season is upon us, as is apparent by the number of overloaded station wagons on the highway with children crammed in the back waving and mugging at other drivers. Anyone who has partaken in this annual ritual knows that it usually isn't long - 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the ages of the children -before the initial glee of escape dissolves into the grumbles of hunger, and the frightful question must be faced: Where do we eat? We are never so vulnerable, gastronomically speaking, as when we are on the road during vacations. The highway is replete with culinary land mines disguised as quaint local restaurants that carry such reassuring names such as Millie's, Pop's and Capt'n Dick's. Around every corner lurk greasy Fisherman's Platters that give children nightmares, Naugahyde minute steaks that put tofuburgers in a favorable light and all those ubiquitous fast-food indigestion huts. Smugness Turns to Horror The smugness we feel upon seeing visitors to our own town wander into the most outrageously priced restaurant - the one that specializes in gray slabs of meat substance and changes owners every three months - turns to horror as we contemplate falling prey ourselves. Guidebooks aren't much help. High-class publications usually list enchanting places 40 miles out of the way, while America's counterpart to Europe's Guides Michelin, the Mobil Travel Guides, are hardly a gastronome's bible. They have been accused of being more concerned with restroom sanitation than food. Calvin Trillin, the New Yorker magazine writer and author of several books, once postulated that Mobil's restaurant critic was promoted to that position ''as a reward for initiative and efficiency he demonstrated as a service-station attendant.'' This circumstance leaves one pretty much to fend for himself. Seasoned travelers usually compile over time their own rules for judging restaurants. The late Fernand Point, the reknowned chef of Pyramide in Vienne, France, used to go into a restaurant's kitchen before eating to shake the chef's hand. If the chef was thin, he had second thoughts about eating there; if the chef was thin and sad, he fled. I have assembled my own specific if fallible rules of the road, which will soon will be retested on the battlefield. - The Pepper-Mill Law: The disparity between a restaurant's price and food quality rises in direct proportion to the size of the pepper mill. Upon entering a restaurant, discreetly ask the manager or maitre d'hotel if you could take a look at the pepper mill (do so in a jocular, offhanded way to avoid suspicion, perhaps mentioning that you have a collection of unusual pepper mills from around the world and want to see what they've got). If it is a utilitarian instrument no larger than your fist, eat there. If, however, it resembles a deftly turned Louisville Slugger, tell the manager you think you left your car keys in the trunk and scurry out. - The Billboard Law: When a restaurants mounts an expensive and repetitive billboard campaign that reads ''30 Miles To Injun Joe's...20 Miles to Injun Joe's...5 Miles to Injun Joe's...'' accelerate upon reaching Injun Joe's. - The Barnyard Law: You will never go hungry in a restaurant that features a huge plastic barnyard animal out front or on the roof. Waitresses are generally pleasant at these places and the milk has a frothy head. - The Altitude Law: The quality of food is in inverse proportion to a dining room's altitude, especially atop bank and hotel buildings (airplanes are an extreme example). There are some notable exceptions to this rule, of course, but I stand by it in general. - The Chinese Law: Never eat Chinese food in Oklahoma. - The Dishwasher Law: Contrary to popular notion, truck drivers know nothing about good restaurants. If you want a reliable tip, drive into a town, go to the nearest appliance store and seek out the dishwasher repair man. He spends a lot of time in restaurant kitchens and usually has strong opinions about them. - The Law of Velocity: Bad food eaten at 60 miles per hour tastes better than bad food eaten in the restaurant that prepared it. This is a twist on the ''Hot dogs taste better at the ball park'' law. If you fall prey to a bad restaurant, ask the waitress for doggie bags so you can eat in the car. - The Canine Law: Never eat in a restaurant that has a dog napping on or near the front stoop. It is probably this town's version of your gray meat steakhouse. - The Law of Volubility: Your chances of getting an expensive platter consisting mainly of potato chips, pickle wedges and shredded iceberg lettuce is greatest in restaurants with (A) a long, poignant story on the menu decribing how the restaurant's name came about; (B) cute names for mundane dishes (''Davy Jones's Platter,'' for example); (C) excessive macrame in the dining room. - The Local Color Law: If time permits, scan local weekly newspapers for church suppers, fund raisers and events such as Daughters of the American Revolution picnics. The price will be right for a family meal, and while the food may not be three-star, it will be copious and you won't have to leave a tip. - The Survival Law: Never eat at a place called Mom's. Ever.

589-> 90 YEARS AFTER AMERICANS TOOK CHARGE, SOME HAWAIIANS STILL DISTRUST U.S.
Ninety years after Queen Liliuokalani was deposed by an American diplomat backed by marines and working with American businessmen, native Hawaiians' distrust still affects their relationship with the United States. That distrust was intensified two weeks ago by a commission report that advised against Federal reparations for native Hawaiians despite the actions of American officials in the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. The three Hawaiian members of the Native Hawaiians Study Commission, which was created by Congress in December 1980, were outvoted by the six mainland members in recommending against reparations. A native Hawaiian is considered to be anyone who had an ancestor living in Hawaii in 1778, when Capt. James Cook, the English explorer, first visited the islands. Past Causes Mixed Feelings ''I have very much mixed feelings about my Americanism,'' Tom Manapau, a Hawaiian history scholar and language teacher, said last week at a public meeting here when the report was discussed. ''When I was growing up we never talked about our history,'' said former State Representative Kinau Kamali'i. ''We knew something was wrong, but not what it was. It has always been emotional. Hawaiians were embarrassed. Now people have learned about our history.'' ''We are victims of American occupation,'' said Hayden Burgess, a lawyer who is one of nine native Hawaiians elected by native voters as trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency created to deal with concerns of native Hawaiians. He wants Hawaii to become a separate nation again. A state census of the nearly one million residents of Hawaii found 190,000 native Hawaiians, 320,000 Caucasians and 240,000 Japanese-Americans. The remaining 200,000 people, including Filipinos, Chinese, Koreans and Samoans, make Hawaii one of the nation's most ethnically diverse states. Drop in Native Population When the first Europeans arrived two centuries ago, about 300,000 Hawaiians were on the islands, but infectious diseases introduced by the newcomers and, later, intermarriage reduced the native population. ''Hawaiians, including myself, are emotionally tied to the land,'' said Lieut. Gov. John Waihee, a 36-year-old lawyer who is threequarters native Hawaiian. ''Some people express their concern by saying Hawaii must have political independence. Others see it in different ways.'' ''For myself, the common thread runs much deeper as a compelling commitment to the islands, to what is best for the people and the land,'' Mr. Waihee added. ''I guess we must do the best we can as we find ourselves on the threshhold of the 21st century.'' Many native Hawaiians do not do so well in this outwardly easy land of palm trees, pineapple, sugar cane, beaches, tradewinds and tourists. Serious Economic Problems While finding no ''ethical or moral grounds'' for reparations to Hawaiians, the commission said, ''The social and economic problems of native Hawaiians deserve immediate action.'' A 1975 study showed 41,500 native Hawaiians living below the poverty level. Last year that group, which makes up about 18 percent of the population, accounted for 30.8 percent of the caseload in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. The proportion of native Hawaiian juveniles arrested was twice their percentage of the population. Only 4.2 percent of native Hawaiians 25 years or older have completed college, as against 14 percent statewide. Unemployment for native Hawaiians is 11.6 percent, as against 6.5 percent for the state as a whole. Comparative figures show life expectancy for native Hawaiians to be 10 years lower than that for for Japanese-Americans and 6 years lower than that for Caucasians. Native Hawaiians say programs to benefit them have been mishandled. Their protests about a program designed to provide land on which native Hawaiians could live have led to a joint Federal-state study of the Hawaiian Homes program. Few Homesteads Granted In 62 years, only about 3,100 homesteads have been granted; 80 percent of the 188,000 acres set aside for native Hawaiians in 1921 is still unavailable to them, much of it leased to non-Hawaiians. More than 7,000 applications for homesteads are pending. Some have been pending for 30 years. The Federal Government's dubious role in the history of Hawaii contributes greatly to the current resentment by native islanders. In 1893, Hawaii was governed by Queen Liliuokalani and the United States was represented by John L. Stevens, a Maine newspaper executive. Mr. Stevens was named Minister to Hawaii by his friend, James G. Blaine, Secretary of State in the Benjamin Harrison Administration. Agitation for constitutional reform led to the January 1893 overthrow of the Queen, who had ruled since 1891. Mr. Stevens, who called in 100 marines from the U.S.S. Boston, ostensibly to keep order, helped set up a provisional government, proclaimed the area a United States protectorate and sought annexation. Queen Makes Concession In conceding her throne, the Queen said, ''I yield to the superior force of the United States of America, whose minister plenipotentiary, His Excellence John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the said provisional government.'' Grover Cleveland, who began his second term as President in March 1893, opposed the annexation proposal. A special investigation he ordered found that most Hawaiians had not supported the coup and that Hawaiians and Americans in the sugar and pineapple industries had played a leading role in deposing the Queen. Cleveland told Congress he would try to restore the Queen to her throne in return for clemency for those who organized the coup. Both the Queen and the provisional government refused the deal, however, and Cleveland abandoned the idea. In 1894, the United States recognized the Republic of Hawaii with Sanford B. Dole as its president. Four years later, when William McKinley was President, the islands were annexed by the United States. In 1959, Hawaii was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Basis for Decision In its June 23 report, the Native Hawaiians Study Commission advised Congress against reparations, saying that Mr. Stevens had acted without Federal authority and that Hawaiians did not qualify under Federal law as aboriginal owners of the islands. Hawaiians replied with documents predating the Queen's overthrow showing four decades of official American interest in acquiring Pearl Harbor as a Pacific naval base. And if the native Hawaiians did not own the islands, they asked, who did? The commission divided on geographic grounds. The mainland members, consisting of five sub-Cabinet appointees of President Reagan and a business executive, voted against the three Hawaiians. In their minority report, the Hawaiian commissioners asserted the United States was responsible for the 1893 coup that deprived the islanders of the government of their choice. They also asked for Congressional hearings to find ''a just and equitable resolution of compensable claims by native Hawaiians for losses of domain and dominion.'' Campaign May Continue Mrs. Kamali'i, who headed the commission and was Mr. Reagan's 1980 campaign chairman in Hawaii, is organizing Hawaiian groups to continue the campaign for Federal recognition of their claims. The Hawaiians' complaints have been building since the early 1970's. Some elements of Hawaii's racially complex society look on the native Hawaiians' talk of reparations as a proposal to raid the Federal Treasury and contend it was inspired by the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. That settlement gave Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians nearly $1 billion and extensive tracts of land. Even some Hawaiians who strongly support political independence say they do not want Federal money. Mr. Burgess, the Hawaiian separatist lawyer, questioned the idea of payments. ''We're getting sucked into adopting an American method, which is not consistent with the Hawaii cause'' of independence, he said, 'We Don't Want Money' ''Many of us will not agree to taking money for surrendering dominion,'' Louis K. Agard Jr., a writer and scholar, said last week at the meeting convened by Mrs. Kamili'i of leaders of 45 groups that belong to the Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs. ''We don't want money.'' ''What happens if Congress says, 'Forget it' '' to proposals for reparations or a political settlement, Ed Harbottle asked at the meeting. ''Where does that leave us?'' ''We go to court,'' Mrs. Kamali'i replied. ''We take it one step at a time.'' She added that ''there may come a time when I will want to take up the spear myself'' by appearing on the picket lines with Hawaiian activists. A current protest target is the state attempt to block Hawaiian families from moving back onto a remote Oahu beach, where their shacks were destroyed last November by a hurricane. State officials, who are planning a park for the area, have charged some who tried to return with criminal trespass. Past Protest a Success Three years ago a similar protest succeeded at Hilo airport, which is built partly on land that was set aside for native Hawaiians. The Federal Department of Transportation now pays $500,000 a year in rent, which goes to native Hawaiian programs. The Polynesian ancestors of the native Hawaiians first arrived in Hawaii about A.D. 400. When Cook reached the islands in 1778, they were ruled by warring native kings under a feudal system. Native priests enforced the ''kapu,'' a system of taboos that subjugated the commoners and slaves. In 1810, Kamehameha I became the sole sovereign of all the islands and, in the peace that followed, agriculture and commerce were promoted. However, Kamehameha's reign was also a period of decline. Besides bringing the diseases that greatly reduced the native population, the Europeans and Americans also introduced a Western culture that contributed to the decline of native traditions. The period also saw a breakdown of the traditional Hawaiian religion, and was followed by years of religious unrest. Heritage an Emotional Issue Many native Hawaiians, including Mr. Waihee, the Lieutenant Governor, say they are torn by feelings of loyalty to their past and loyalty to the nation they believe killed the Hawaiian monarchy. ''I have no problem with loyalty to the United States,'' Mr. Waihee said. ''I think secession might actually be bad for us. It is very easy to get lost in ideological rhetoric.'' As for reparations and the realities of politics, he said, ''I can appreciate that in these times there would be those who would balk at making payments.'' But, referring to the study commission's majority report, he said: ''What I am frustrated about is that they did not even recognize the need for an apology. That would be free.''

590-> IDEAS & TRENDS; MURDOCH BUYS INTO CHICAGO
Rupert K. Murdoch owns a few newspapers that don't exactly reflect journalism's noblest instincts. He also owns a few that do. Last week the Australian media tycoon paid $90 million for The Chicago Sun- Times, a tabloid that many in the business might rank on the high end of the scale. Mr. Murdoch purchased the paper and the Field Newspaper Syndicate from Marshall Field 5th and his half- brother, Frederick, who are dissolving their family-owned company. ''To be perfectly frank,'' Marshall Field said, ''my brother felt that he wanted to maximize what he got for the paper.'' The decision appeared to be a disappointment to Sun-Times publisher James Hoge, who had assembled a group of Chicago investors to offer $63 million for all the properties except the Field syndicate. Mr. Murdoch said he would strive to maintain The Sun-Times's ''high standards and its reputation.'' Under Mr. Hoge, the paper has won five Pulitzer Prizes. Murdoch acquisitions in this country include The New York Post, The Boston Herald, several Texas newspapers, The Village Voice, New York magazine and The Star. His American properties made about $14 million last year, with losses from The New York Post and The Boston Herald more than offset by profits from The Star and the Texas dailies. Asked if the politically conservative Mr. Murdoch would enhance The Sun-Times, Marshall Field said ''I have nothing to go on, but he is going to give The Tribune hell,'' referring to Chicago's dominant daily. Mr. Field's grandfather started the paper in 1941 as a liberal challenge to The Tribune's morning monopoly and its aggressive criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

591-> British Pensions Get Rampac Stake
Two pension plans of the National Coal Board of Britain have purchased a 10.4 percent interest in Rampac, a California real estate investment trust, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pension plans bought a total of 333,800 shares as an investment, the document said. But the pension plans said they might make a tender offer, seek a merger or propose the sale of assets of Rampac in the future. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, Rampac closed at 34 1/2, up 1/2. Rampac was formerly known as Realty and Mortgage Investors of the Pacific. The filing did not list the price for the shares, nor did it indicate when the pension plans purchased the shares in the Oakland, Calif., concern. The New York investment banking firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company proposed forming a company to acquire the Rampac trust for $34 a share, or $112.2 million, on Sept. 30.

593-> VERDI DREW FROM HUGO
''Ernani,'' Verdi's fifth opera, was a tremendous success at its premiere and carrried his reputation beyond Italy for the first time. Based on Victor Hugo's ''Hernani,'' it had its first performance in Venice in 1844. It reached London in 1845, but a production planned for Paris that year had to be delayed because Hugo objected that the libretto misrepresented his novel. A year later, however, Paris heard the work disguised as ''Il Proscritto ossia Il Corsaro di Venezia.'' In 1847, ''Ernani'' arrived in New York, at the Park Theater, and that same year was the first production of the Astor Place Opera House. The first Metropolitan staging came in 1903, with a cast that included Marcella Sembrich, Mathilde Bauermeister, Emilio de Marchi, Antonio Scotto and Edouard de Reszke. ''Ernani'' next appeared at the Met in 1921, with Rosa Ponselle, Minnie Egener, Giovanni Martinelli, Giuseppe Danise and Jose Mardones. It returned in 1922 with another formidable cast: Ezio Pinza, Miss Ponselle, Mr. Martinelli and Tito Ruffo. In 1956, Dimitri Mitropoulos conducted a revival with Leonard Warren, Zinka Milanov, Mario del Monaco and Cesare Siepi. Most recently, the Met presented ''Ernani'' as the opening production of the 1970-71 season, with Sherrill Milnes as Don Carlo, Ruggero Raimondi as Silva, Martina Arroyo as Elvira and Carlo Bergonzi in the title role.

594-> 85 YEARS OF A FAMILY CRAFTS WORKSHOP
BEHIND a purple painted door on West 13th Street is a rare sort of business. Rambusch Studios is a family-run company where for 85 years, craftsmen and designers have shared workshop space. Tomorrow, at the Parsons School of Design, an exhibition of their work will open. ''The Oeuvre of an American Arts and Crafts Workshop: The Rambusch Studios 1898 to the Present'' is a retrospective of 150 drawings, blueprints, photographs and diverse objects. The business was founded at the turn of the century by a Danish master painter and decorator, Frode C. V. Rambusch. During its first 20 years, it specialized in church design and decoration, and early commissions were St. Raphael's and St. Rose of Lima, both in Manhattan. Rambusch later integrated the crafts of metal working, stained glass and painted decoration in custom- made products and designs. Their assignments included the interior decoration of the Jefferson, New York's first elegant movie theater and the old Roxy Theater. The murals in Horn & Hardart automats were done by Rambusch craftsman. The painting and silver- leaf work in the lobbies and restaurants of the Waldorf-Astoria were Rambusch commissions. Its artisansand craftsman left their mark on the Stork Club and Radio City Music Hall. In the early 1900's, the company began to design and manufacture lighting fixtures. Rambusch holds a patent for a special recessed light that is effective in large-scale high- bay interiors. It has done the lobby lighting for Lever House, for the grand concourse of Grand Central Terminal and the Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. More recently, Rambusch designed the new Art Deco light fixtures for the main floor of Macy's. The retrospective was organized by Catha Rambusch, with Mario Locsin. She is a third-generation Rambusch by marriage (the president of the company is Viggo Rambusch, grandson of its founder, Frode). ''Film aficionados will appreciate the original rendering of the Roxy movie theater,'' she said. ''Light people and the technology oriented will enjoy the range of light fixtures on display, and others will be interested in the part of the exhibit that shows the evolution of American decorative arts.'' The exhibition, at the Parsons School of Design Exhibition Center, 2 West 13th Street, will continue through Thursday, Dec. 29. Admission is free and hours are 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Mondays through Fridays and 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturdays.

595-> CUOMO VETOES BILL ON USING BULLETPROOF VEST FOR A CRIME
Governor Cuomo today vetoed legislation that would have made it a crime to wear a bulletproof vest during the commission of a violent felony. Mr. Cuomo said he supported the idea, but called the legislation flawed because it would not have imposed additional prison time. Under the legislation, he said, the sentence for wearing such a vest would have run concurrently with any other sentences. ''I believe the objective is a desirable one,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''but, unfortunately, the bill will fail to achieve this objective.'' At the same time, Mr. Cuomo signed eight other measures, including one that would close what legislators considered to be a loophole in the rape law. Another measure would allow the Long Island Rail Road and other rail lines to sell liquor and wine from carts on platforms in major stations in New York City. A Compromise on Vests The bulletproof vest legislation grew out of the 1981 Brink's armored-car robbery in Rockland County and other cases in which suspects were found to be wearing such clothing. The sponsors of the legislation said they had originally wanted to impose a sentence of one to three years, that would run in addition to any other sentence, so that felons would spend more time in prison. They said they adopted a compromise after the chairman of the Assembly Codes Committee, Melvin H. Miller, a Democrat of Brooklyn, objected to the imposition of consecutive sentences. ''The Assembly would under no circumstances accept consecutive sentences,'' said Senator John E. Flynn, a Republican of Yonkers. Veto Called 'Bad Mistake' Mr. Flynn said that, even so, the Governor had ''made a bad mistake'' in his veto. Mr. Flynn said the extra felony of wearing a bulletproof vest could have influenced a parole board to return to prison a felon who had been convicted of another offense after being paroled. The sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, John P. Dearie, a Democrat of the Bronx, said he would continue to press the Codes Committee for a change. He said that in an 18-month period the New York City Police Department had logged more than 50 instances in which such vests were used during a crime. The problem with the rape law developed last year when the Legislature dropped a requirement of ''earnest resistance'' by rape victims and added a provision that force used must cause a ''fear of immediate death or serious physical injury'' in the victim. The change was approved in an attempt to make the prosecution of rape cases less difficult. A Question of Fear In a Brooklyn case last fall, a 19-year-old college student said she had been raped twice, resisting her attacker fiercely. But she said she had not feared death or physical injury because the accused attacker had lived with her family for five years. As a result, the case was nearly thrown out. Under the change signed into law today, the prosecutor has only to show physical force was used. In cases in which force was threatened but not actually used, the prosecution would have to show that the threat caused a fear of death or ''physical injury'' rather than ''serious physical injury.'' District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn said the Brooklyn case is due for trial Sept. 22. She also said that an appellate court in Manhattan had ordered a new trial in another rape case because of the loophole in the law. Bill on Hotel Rents Under another measure signed today, new restrictions would be placed on hotels covered under rent-stabilization law. Hotels had been able to charge whatever they wanted each time a room became vacant. Under the new provision, rent increases would be set by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Democrat of Manhattan, said the measure woud remove an ''incentive for landlord harassment.'' Mr. Cuomo also signed legislation setting a new standard for wages paid workers on public-works projects. The legislation had long been sought by construction unions. Wages under such contracts are based on the prevailing wage paid on private projects. Under the new standard, computation of the prevailing wage would exclude wages paid to nonunion employees. Another measure signed today will improve disability benefits for correction officers. Correction officers were excluded from a new, improved pension plan for state workers. According to Mr. Cuomo, the change will give them the same disability benefits as other state workers.

596-> WILSON P. FOSS
Wilson P. Foss, a conservationist and a former president and chairman of the New York Trap Rock Corporation, producer of crushed stone for roads and other construction projects, died of cancer Monday at his home in Katonah, N.Y. He was 68 years old. He also had homes in Naples, Fla., and Nantucket, Mass. In 1965, Mr. Foss sold the Trap Rock company, which his grandfather had founded. He was active in conservation efforts in Nantucket and the Katonah area, where he established the Marion Yarrow Nature Preserve in memory of his mother. He is survived by his wife, Mae Chandlee Foss; a daughter, Nannette Orr of Katonah; two sons, W. Perkins Foss 4th of Hanover, N.H., and Ned C. Foss of Albany, and four grandchilden.

598-> CONCERT: BROOKLYN ORCHESTRA IN 'MEET THE MODERNS' SERIES
Everyone with an interest in contemporary music owes a debt of gratitude to Lukas Foss. As the music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Foss has devoted considerable time and energy to the propagation of the new. Their ''Meet the Moderns'' series is one of the most continually interesting showcases in town. That said, it must be admitted that not all of the orchestra's Friday program at Cooper Union, entitled ''Carter, Cage and New Americans,'' was on the same level. Our Zeitgeist puts a disproportionately high premium on novelty and idea; as such, much of Friday's bill seemed comprised of gestating theories, rather than fully realized statements. Rocco Di Pietro's etudes from ''The Youth's Magic Horn'' proved a rough- hewn aggregate of distinct events, pieced together, block by block, in deliberately constructivist fashion. Michelle Di Bucci's ''Voice and/or Volumes: Verbing the Un-Mind'' was better than its title: a glossary of plucks, shivers and squeals that showed most promise when, as in the subdued closing, it was at its least ambitious. David Stock's ''Triple Play'' was a sporadically agreeable exercise in jazz fusion; Friday's concert featured some splendid piccolo playing by Robert Dick. John Russo's ''Jaded Garden'' was built on the contrasts between the percussive sounds of a piano's insides and lyrical passages for flute and saxophone. The most engaging piece in the first half of the program was Peter Gena's ''McKinley,'' an irresistibly invigorating minimalist combination of cocktail piano, barn-dance fiddle, and tabla- style percussion. John Cage's ''Hymn and Variations,'' brilliantly performed by the Long Island University Singers, under the direction of Jerry Forderhase, was based on two works by the American colonial composer William Billings. The work transcends a simple-minded concept, based on the I Ching and systematic deletions of the original score, and manages, almost in spite of itself, to create a mood of ethereal purity. The evening closed with two early compositions by Elliott Carter. ''To Music'' is turgid juvenilia, but ''Musicians Wrestle Everywhere'' represents the composer at his most direct and immediately expressive. Mr. Foss and his forces gave these works their due and were rewarded by a sustained ovation.

599-> ANTON DOLIN, 79, BALLET STAR AND CHOREOGRAPHER, IS DEAD
Sir Anton Dolin, whose early career in Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes led him to become the first internationally acclaimed British male ballet star and who was a founding member of major ballet companies in Britain and the United States, died Friday in Paris. Friends in New York said he had died of a heart attack in the American Hospital after becoming ill on his way to stage a ballet for the Ballet The^atre de Nancy. He was 79 years old and lived in London. As a choreographer, teacher, coach and lecturer, Sir Anton continued in later years to be a familiar figure on the American ballet scene. On Nov. 10, he took part in the Houston Ballet's gala honoring the defunct Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. On Sept. 3, at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Lee, Mass., he performed in a one- man show about Diaghilev, the famed impresario who had launched his career. Authority on the Classics In 1939, Sir Anton became a charter member of Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater. Although he had first attracted attention for his athletic and acrobatic prowess in avant-garde Diaghilev ballets such as ''Le Train Bleu,'' he gained considerable experience in the 19th-century classics in later years. It was as an authority on the classics that Ballet Theater engaged him in 1940 as ballet master, choreographer and premier danseur. Sir Anton staged Ballet Theater's productions of ''Giselle'' and ''Swan Lake'' in the company's debut season. One of his most famous stagings was ''Pas de Quatre,'' a look back at 19th- century Romantic ballet in his own choreography for dancers portraying four celebrated ballerinas. Later he choreographed a modern counterpart for male dancers in his virtuoso showpiece ''Variations for Four.'' As a dancer, Sir Anton repeatedly found himself the male star in ballet companies that were launched under his auspices or in which he played an influential role. When British ballet was in its infancy, Dame Ninette de Valois asked him to dance in her productions for the Camargo Society, which he helped form in 1930. When she founded what is now the Royal Ballet, Sir Anton and Dame Alicia Markova were its stars. The two young Diaghilev alumni formed one of the great partnerships of classical ballet. In 1935, both dancers left the Vic-Wells Ballet to form their own company, the Markova-Dolin Ballet, which continued until 1938. From 1945 to 1948 they headed a touring unit. In 1949, they established a new British troupe, which became London's Festival Ballet in 1950. As its artistic director and principal dancer until 1961, Sir Anton promoted an eclectic repertory and touring policy that made Festival Ballet the popular British company it is today. He was knighted in 1981. A Native of Sussex Sir Anton was of Irish descent and was born on July 27, 1904, in Sussex, England. His real name was Sydney Francis Patrick Chippendall Healey- Kay. His friends called him Pat. A child actor who studied ballet in Brighton and then in London with the Russian ballerina Serafima Astafieva, the young dancer first adopted the pseudonym Patrikeyev. After dancing in the corps de ballet in Diaghilev's 1921 London production of ''The Sleeping Princess,'' he changed his name to Dolin. He became a soloist with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1924. Leaving the company in 1925, he rejoined it for its final years in 1928 and 1929. ''He does possess a true style,'' Diaghilev wrote to his secretary, Boris Kochno, in 1924. In 1980, Ninette de Valois defined that style as follows: ''In the mid- 1920's, his dancing brought a spark of virility to the male classical dance picture. It was Bronislava Nijinska who first brought out his particular virtuoso form of attack; it had nothing in common with the purer form of accepted classical virtuosity.'' Sir Anton became known as an excellent partner in the many companies in which he was a guest artist. A witty raconteur, he was the author of six books, including several memoirs.

601-> CO-OPS GET GOOD NEWS AND ADVICE
PARTICIPANTS in a conference on the operation of cooperative apartments were told last weekend that the opening of a national secondary market for co-op loans should make it easier in the months ahead to buy co-op apartments. Anita Miller, a trustee of the Lincoln Savings Bank and a member of the advisory committee of the Federal National Mortgage Association, said in a workshop discussion that lending to cooperatives had been put ''in the mainstream of the national mortgage market.'' Among other benefits, she said, this will mean that mortgage money will be more available to buyers and buildings even in times of tight mortgage credit. The Federal National Mortgage Association, known also as Fannie Mae, announced Oct. 20 that it would purchase from lenders their loans on cooperative buildings and individual apartments, in the same manner that it purchases loans on single-family houses or condominiums. By making it possible for lenders to package and resell their loans, the secondary market maintains liquidity in the mortgage market, which ultimately helps consumers. In time, this should mean that lenders' practices will become more standardized, that a more varied ''package'' of mortgage instruments should be available for cooperative buyers and perhaps that any price differential between a cooperative loan and a loan on a single-family house or a condominium will shrink or disappear, Fannie Mae spokesmen said. The incomes required to qualify for loans will in many cases be reduced, the spokesmen said, and down-payment requirements may decline as well. ''We're trying to put co-ops on the same wave length as other types of mortgages,'' said Russell Clifton, Fannie Mae vice president for mortgage programs. Miss Miller addressed one of 23 workshops at a daylong conference on cooperatives at Tisch Hall, on the New York University campus. The sponsors were the Real Estate Institute of New York University and the Council of New York Cooperatives, established eight years ago by the boards of directors of Manhattan buildings that converted to co-ops. Members share financial, legal and maintenance information and expertise. Companies that offer products and services to multifamily buildings displayed their wares, and workshop participants raised many of the perennial questions of cooperative management: What are the responsibilities of a cooperative board as landlord when the building's services are interrupted for repairs or improvements? How can rental tenants in a co-op who are unruly or in whose apartments there are health or fire hazards be legally evicted? How much of a co-op's legal and financial business do rental tenants have a right to know about? In the workshop on dealing with rental tenants, Wayde Harrison, the moderator, noted that as noneviction plans become the main conversion route, buildings can expect a higher percentage of renters. Norman B. Seidman, a panelist and vice president of Herbert Charles & Company, a real-estate management concern, noted that disputes frequently arise between shareholders and rental tenants over improvements that will mean increases in monthly maintenance costs and stabilized rents. He advised shareholders to keep renters well-informed about capital-improvement projects and the reasons for them. ''I do not mean that tenants are entitled to all details or verbatim reading of the minutes,'' Mr. Seidman said, ''but a well-informed tenancy is usually a more cooperative tenancy.'' NORMAN WEIL, president of a 114-unit cooperative in the Riverdale section of the Bronx that was converted last year under a noneviction plan, told of his board's problems with a rent strike when a $1 million building-improvement plan was announced. As part of a discussion on tenants who rent apartments belonging to nonresident shareholders, Oliver Rosengart, a lawyer in the Real Estate Financing Bureau of the Attorney General's Office, criticized an aspect of the law that governs noneviction conversions. The law says that a conversion can occur under noneviction terms if 15 percent of the apartments are sold to tenants in occupancy or to ''bona fide purchasers who represent that they or one or more members of their immediate family intend to occupy the unit when it becomes vacant.'' Mr. Rosengart said that this rule was difficult to enforce. ''The only solution may be to strengthen the law,'' he said. The mailing address of the Council of New York Cooperatives is Box 18, 110 Riverside Drive, New York, N.Y. 10024.

602-> COMMODITIES; Grains, Soybeans Drop; Livestock Also Down
Prices of grain and soybean futures were lower at the close of trading yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Sources at the floor said trading was slow and there were few new features to affect prices. Bob Lekberg, a grain analyst in Chicago with Shearson/American Express, said traders were reluctant to take on new positions until the release on Wednesday of the Agriculture Department's updated crop forecast. But some selling by producers emerged yesterday, Mr. Lekberg said, as farmers were making rapid progress on the harvest and selling at least some of their grain. Livestock and meat prices were lower in moderate volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The primary source of pressure was the red meat supply, said Robert Saathoff, vice president for commodity research with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Pork Supply Cited He noted that the total supply of red meat was 9 percent greater than a year earlier. In addition, the hog slaughter was estimated at 369,000 animals, which is sufficient to keep a more than ample supply of pork available, he said. Steady prices on cash markets overnight prompted some light buying that supported prices across the board early in the session, but the heavy supply of meat pushed prices back down later in the session. ''You cannot get a bull market started with that kind of meat supply,'' Mr. Saathoff said. Prices of precious metals advanced moderately on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Buying early in the session was a follow-through from Thursday, said Jack Boyd, director of commodity research in New York with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

605-> COFFEE'S DRINKERS SAID TO RUN RISKS
Heavy coffee drinking may raise the risk of heart disease by raising levels of cholesterol in the blood, according to a study conducted in Norway. The researchers found that coffee drinkers whose consumption was ''heavy,'' nine cups or more a day, had 14 percent more cholesterol in their systems than people who drank one cup or less. Many scientists believe high cholesterol levels contribute to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which is a major cause of heart attack and stroke. A decade ago other researchers reported that drinking coffee doubles the risk of heart attack. However, critics said that study was flawed because it had not allowed for the fact that coffee drinkers are also more likely to smoke cigarettes. Heart-Disease Finding Contrary The Framingham Heart Study, a continuing sampling of heart disease among the residents of Framingham, Mass., begun in 1949, has found no evidence that coffee contributes to atherosclerosis. The authors of the Norwegian report said most experts seemed to accept the findings of the Framingham study and that they themselves were at first suspicious of their own findings to the contrary. However, they said, their work showed that the coffee drinkers had more cholesterol in their blood even when such potential complications as smoking, exercise and alcohol use were taken into account. ''The relation seemed to withstand all adjustments,'' they wrote. Published in New England Journal The study was conducted by Dr. Dag S. Thelle, Dr. Egil Arnesen and Dr. Olav H. Forde of the University of Tromso. It was published in the June 16 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. The National Coffee Association in New York commented that the study was designed to observe cholesterol levels, not heart disease. It said, ''In the past 15 years, a number of human studies examining the effects of coffee drinking have failed to establish a correlation between coffee drinking and heart disease.'' The researchers conceded that the dispute over the link between coffee and heart disease had not been settled. But they said the ''magnitude of the cholesterol-raising effect, which suggests at least a doubling of the risk of coronary heart disease, warrants further investigation.''

607-> APPEALS COURT VOIDS AWARDS TO TEACHER HURT BY STUDENT
A teacher who said he suffered a disabling injury while breaking up a fight in a junior high school cannot recover damages from New York City, the State Court of Appeals has decided. The court, the state's highest, said the city did not owe the teacher, Peter Vitale, a ''special duty'' in connection with injuries he suffered breaking up the fight in the Bronx's Junior High School 123 on Oct. 17, 1975. One of the students in the fight turned on Mr. Vitale during the fight, the Court of Appeals noted, and dealt him several injuries. Mr. Vitale's attorney, Anthony Pirrotti of Dobbs Ferry, said the most serious injury was a herniated disc, which he said forced his client to stop teaching. Mr. Vitale had argued that the principal of the school and officials of the New York City Board of Education had failed to have an adequate security plan in place at the school, as required by law. According to Mr. Vitale, more security personnel would have prevented the milling of students in the hallways, which prompted the eruption of the fight, during which the industrial arts teacher had been hurt. The teacher, who still lives in the Bronx, also maintained that he had been an ''integral'' part of the security plan since teachers are generally expected to step in and prevent students from injuring one another or teachers. Mr. Vitale had been awarded $1 million in damages by a lower court. The middle-level Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, though troubled by the size of the award, affirmed that Mr. Vitale had a right to collect damages from the city. However, the Court of Appeals unanimously reversed the decisions and dismissed the case. It decided that Mr. Vitale had failed to establish the ''special relationship'' necessary to show that the city should pay for damages. Counsel Criticizes Ruling ''Nothing in the adoption or content of the plan warrants a finding that it was designed or intended specially for his benefit or that of other teachers in the school,'' the court said, referring to the security plan. ''We reject his contention that because the teachers had a role to play in the implementation of the plan they were somehow thereby converted into its special beneficiaries,'' the court added. Mr. Pirrotti, Mr. Vitale's attorney, said that the Court of Appeals, in this case, was ''the court of last resort'' and that its ruling ''means that after eight years of litigation he will not win.'' ''It is a very sorry commentary on our system, which states that teachers have an obligation to quell a disturbance,'' Mr. Pirrotti said. ''He does his job, he's injured and he doesn't have the right to collect damages. It's a terribly unfair decision.'' Leonard Koerner of the New York City Corporation Counsel's office maintained, however, that the ruling does not in all cases absolve schools in the city from liability if teachers are injured. ''All it means is that you don't have to have 82 people in every school'' guarding entrances and patrolling hallways, he said. ''You can't prevent every incident from occurring. These things happen in real life.'' Mr. Koerner said it was the job of the superintendent of education and the principal of each city school to make sure an adequate security plan was in place.

Down the Stretch Cam Fella, the 4-year-old pacer who has won 24 straight races and 26 of 32 in 1983, will make his final racing appearance in New York tonight when he is expected to be a 1-9 favorite in a field of six for the $30,000 Silver Streak Pace at Roosevelt Raceway. If he wins, Cam Fella would break the world record for consecutive victories by a pacer that he now shares with Brett Hanover, his grandsire, who set the record in 1964. Cam Fella has not lost since he finished third to Perfect Out at the Meadowlands on May 12. Cam Fella, who has won $1,031,566 in purses this year and $1,928,867 in his career, will race three more times - Nov. 26 at Maywood Park in Chicago, Dec. 3 at Pompano Park in Florida and Dec. 10 at Greenwood Park in Toronto - before retiring to stud. ''He could probably make another $1 million racing next year, but he'll make more than that standing at stud,'' said Pat Crowe, the trainer who for the last two years has driven the son of Most Happy Fella out of Man Cam by Brett Hanover. ''He's all heart, the greatest pacer I've ever seen. At times he has done things that we didn't think he was capable of. I'm going to miss racing him. He was a once in a lifetime for me.''

609-> HOME CLINIC; A VAPOR BARRIER IS A FRIEND DURING THE HEATING SEASON
THE importance of having a vapor barrier installed in insulated walls, ceilings and floors has been widely written about in newspapers and magazines, so most homeowners are by now well aware of the value of such barriers. However, many letters received here indicate that numerous homeowners still do not know why, or even if, a vapor barrier is important. They are not certain why it is needed to help protect the house or how it can help in lowering heating costs. All air contains moisture in the form of invisible vapor, but there is a definite maximum amount that any given quantity of air can hold. When the air is fully saturated and can hold no more, it is said to be at 100 percent relative humidity. When the air contains only half as much as it can actually hold (at that temperature), it is said to be at 50 percent relative humidity. The amount of moisture vapor that this same quantity of air can hold is dependent, as just indicated, on its temperature. The warmer the air, the more moisture vapor it can hold; the colder it is, the less it can hold. This means that if warm air inside the house that is at about 50 percent relative humidity is suddenly chilled, and the amount of moisture in the air remains the same, its relative humidity will actually be much higher - for example, instead of being at 50 percent relative humidity it may now be fully saturated (100 percent relative humidity). This is in spite of the fact that the actual quantity of moisture in the air is still the same. If the quantity of moisture doesn't change and the temperature drops still lower, then the already saturated air will not be able to hold any more, so some of the vapor will start to condense out and will form drops of water. Outside, this can take the form of dew or fog; inside, it takes the form of ''sweating'' or condensation that forms on colder surfaces - for example, on the exterior of a pitcher of ice water in warm weather, or windows and the inside surfaces of outside walls in cold weather. This condensation or ''sweating'' can cause a problem in heated houses - especially when weatherstripping, caulking and storm windows are added to help seal the house against cold air drafts and stop heat leaks to the outside. Most building materials such as wood, plaster, gypsum board and most paints are relatively permeable to moisture vapor - that is, they will allow moisture vapor to pass through them quite easily. As a result of washing, cooking, bathing and so on, the air inside most homes contains a fair amount of moisture vapor. Relative humidities of 40 to 60 percent are fairly average during the heating season. Since moist air always tends to seek out drier air (the moisture vapor tries to ''spread'' to air that has a lower relative humidity), much of this moisture vapor passes through the inner wall surfaces in winter and tries to find its way to the outside (the outside air, being much colder, will always be drier -at a lower relative humidity). When the moisture first passes through the interior plaster, gypsum board or wood paneling, nothing much happens - the temperature of the air is not lowered by much since these inner wall surfaces are also warm. However, after the moisture-laden air passes through the hollow spaces inside the wall, and through any insulation that is inside those spaces, it comes in contact with the exterior siding or sheathing, which is much colder. These cold surfaces chill the air and cause some of the moisture vapor to condense out in the form of drops of water that drip down the back side of the sheathing or siding, as shown in the drawing. This water saturates the wood and the insulation, and this can cause several unpleasant results. It can cause extensive peeling of paint on the outside, as well as peeling and staining of paint and wallcoverings on the inside; it can lead to eventual rotting of the siding or other structural members; it can soak into and saturate the insulation - and wet insulation loses most of its effectiveness as a barrier to heat loss. A vapor barrier on the warm side of the insulation (on the side that is heated in cold weather) will prevent all this. As indicated in the drawing, the barrier will stop the moisture vapor from ever penetrating the hollow spaces of the wall, and thus will stop it from coming in contact with the cold surfaces on the other side. Ideally, a vapor barrier should be installed inside the wall when the insulation is installed - either as part of the original insulation, or as a separate plastic film that is stapled up over it. However, in many older houses that were not originally insulated, the insulation was added afterward by pumping in loose fill or foam, so there is no vapor barrier in place. Nevertheless, steps can be taken to create a vapor barrier on the inside wall surfaces. One way to do this is to a use a vapor-barrier (nonpermeable) paint such as one of the new latex flat paints that are specifically designed to serve as vapor barriers. A high-gloss alkyd enamel or an aluminum paint can also be used. Another way is to hang a nonpermeable wallcovering, such as one of the vinyl materials or one of the foil-backed decorative papers. Most of these are also effective as vapor barriers. Answering the Mail Q. I just purchased a good oak coffee table, and a careless person let a cigarette fall out of the ashtry onto the table top, leaving an unsightly cigarette burn. How do I go about removing this burn mark without leaving telltale signs of the damage? - P.B., Valhalla, N.Y. A. You should be able to remove the burn mark - or at least most of it - but some signs may still remain when you are done. First, scrape off the scorched material with a small pocket knife, holding the blade almost parallel to the surface with its cutting edge facing down - as though you were going to slice down through the burn mark. Scrape back and forth with careful strokes until all of the blackened finish has been removed. To fill in and color the slight depression that remains, you can use a colored wax stick or touch-up stick (sold in most paint and hardware stores). These come in a range of wood tone colors, and are used much like a crayon -by rubbing back and forth over the area. A piece of stiff plastic helps in smoothing the material down. The resulting patch will have a dull finish, but you should be able to restore the luster with paste wax. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Questions about home repair problems should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

610-> HUMANITIES FUNDS RECEIVE SCRUTINY
Projects in Oregon, Idaho and Arizona have come under criticism from Federal officials who question whether they are appropriate recipients of funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Two of the projects involve discussions of Soviet culture, and the third, the Arizona project, is a film made for public television on energy and environment in the Southwest. The latest debates are similar to disputes in the past year over how state humanities councils disburse Federal funds. In most cases, Federal money is added to state grants and locally raised funds to finance programs. Humanities officials in the three states denied that their use of the Federal grants was inappropriate. In the Oregon and Idaho cases, two members of Congress have asked the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to conduct audits to determine the appropriateness of the use of Federal funds. An aide to one of the two, Representative Denny Smith, Republican of Oregon, said Mr. Smith had objected to the use of Federal funds in an Oregon project, entitled ''What About the Russians?'' ''It looks to me like spending your Federal tax dollars for programs that are clearly political advocacy programs is no better than spending $593 for a $3 washer or $1,118 for a 50-cent diode over at the Pentagon,'' Mr. Smith said. Outside the Realm of Humanities' Mr. Smith's office said the Russian project used $11,000 in Federal humanities funds and that such things as bilateral relations and the nuclear arms race were discussed, subjects that an aide to the Congressman said were clearly outside the realm of the humanities, which generally includes such areas as history, philosophy, religion, language and literature. The aide to Representative Smith said the project on Russia had led him to look into other humanities projects in Oregon and to raise questions about past programs as well. Carolyn Buan, an official of the Oregon Committee for the Humanities, defended the Russia project, which was made up of a series of three discussions. ''Denny Smith has chosen to talk about three of 122 projects that we have funded in the past year, so he is being rather selective,'' Mrs. Buan said, noting that the three programs cost $10,056 of her agency's budget of $365,807. ''Those three programs provided three weeks of solid programming, cultural, historical and intellectual, about the Soviet Union,'' Mrs. Buan said. ''The people involved were scholars in the humanities, not politicians.'' Chairman Troubled by Scheduling The chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, William J. Bennett, said in a letter to the Oregon humanities committee that an inquiry by his office into the programs showed they ''were reasonably balanced and scholarly in nature.'' But he added that he was ''troubled'' that the program had been placed between two weekends of political activities not financed by the humanities committee. ''The conference taken as a whole seemed designed to further a particular set of views, that is, the disarmament views of the conference organizers,'' he said. Since becoming chairman of the endowment as an appointee of President Reagan, Mr. Bennett has criticized projects that have received humanities grants but were not, in his view, clearly within the humanities. The complaint regarding Idaho came from the office of Senator Steven D. Symms, Republican of Idaho, who asked the General Accounting Office to determine whether a program in Boise called Russian Awareness Week was an appropriate vehicle for Federal humanities funding. Tom Rybus, associate director of the Association for the Humanities in Idaho, defended the program, saying: ''The majority of the people at the conference were scholars in the humanities. I think the Senator misunderstands. The purpose of the conference was to talk about the history of Russia. It was unavoidable that there were slight references to current affairs.'' Guidlines Have Changed The Arizona project at issue is a film financed partly by the Arizona Humanities Council and scheduled to be broadcast on public television on Nov. 15. According to Lorraine Frank, director of the council, her organization provided $35,000 toward the project, most of it having come from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Mrs. Frank said that the appropriateness of the film had been questioned by a staff member of the National Endowment for the Humanities, but she asserted that when the project was approved in 1979 it fully satisfied the guidelines in effect at the time. The project, Mrs. Frank said, raised important value questions in history and anthropology. Because of the strictures being enforced now by Mr. Bennett insisting that a clear case be made that the humanities are the pre-eminent focus, Mrs. Frank said, ''It is possible that if it were raised today it would not be funded.'' Mrs. Frank said that the film, ''Four Corners: A National Sacrifice Area?'' concerned the impact of development on four ethnic groups, Hopi and Navajo Indians, Mormons and Anglos, in the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah come together.

611-> WINE TALK
Pity the poor Bordelais. Let someone so much as mislabel a case or two of table wine in that part of the world and the fact turns up in the press as ''the latest Bordeaux scandal.'' Of course, there have been a couple of Bordeaux wine scandals in recent years, juicy ones at that. But that doesn't make every new flap in the wine trade a scandal. Take the current brouhaha: a good story but not really a scandal. It might better be called ''The Mystery of the Phantom Chateaus.'' What happened is this: Francois Pallu, a grape grower with 22 acres out beyond St.-Emilion, has gone to court charging that some of the big cooperatives in the Bordeaux region are putting chateau names on cheap wines that are not entitled to them. Before going further, it might help to understand that a chateau in Bordeaux doesn't necessarily have to be a grand country house in the style of Mouton, Lafite or Haut-Brion. Any farmhouse where wine is made from vines on the property, so long as it is within the legal limits of the Bordeaux region, can request and invariably receive permission to call itself a chateau. Some of the most illustrious properties, such as Ch^ateau Petrus in Pomerol, are little more than modest farmhouses compared with the great wine estates of the Medoc. But, of course, all the farmhouse- chateaus are not as fortunate as Petrus. With good reason. There are hundreds of tiny marginal properties, making good to indifferent wine, many of them with grandiose chateau names. In good times, some of them can afford to bottle their wines, age them and then sell them, either through the mail to customers of their own, or to shippers in Libourne or Bordeaux itself. The shippers handle the merchandising from that point on. In bad times, these little chateaus have problems. They cannot afford to do their own bottling, and they can't afford to keep the wine around long enough to age it. Even the negociants - the shippers - are not interested. Enter the cooperatives. Most of Bordeaux wine is made and marketed by cooperatives. Even the hallowed communities such as Pauillac, mostly noted for their famous chateaus, have cooperatives. The owners of small properties, usually members of the cooperatives, bring in their grapes, get paid, and forget about the rest of the wine-making process. The cooperatives, in turn, crush all the grapes together and produce a uniform wine entitled to the appellation of the region. That is, a cooperative in St.-Emilion will crush grapes from dozens of properties in the region, and the resulting wine will be called, legitimately, St.-Emilion. The law also says that if the cooperative chooses to do so, it can keep the grapes of a particular property separate, vinify them separately and bottle the resulting wine as a chateau wine. The chateau is whatever the man who grew the grapes happens to call his farmhouse. Mr. Pallu's complaint is that the cooperatives are dipping into the common wine to make their so-called chateau bottlings. His suit does not specify how much wine is involved. Claude Tribaudeau, president of the Union of St.-Emilion Wine Producers - the cooperatives in Mr. Pallu's region - has noted only that the law also says the cooperatives must blend all their wines. Ironically, the once-powerful negociants, the wine shippers in Bordeaux itself and in Libourne, near St.-Emilion and Pomerol, can mix wine they buy, and sell it under what are sometimes fanciful chateau names. (The chances of any of this wine being exported to the United States are negligible, according to members of the Bordeaux wine trade.) Apparently there is a vagueness in the law that Mr. Pallu's complaint may help to clarify. His complaint may also serve to point up the problem of the ''petits ch^ateaux,'' whose wines emanate from cooperatives or from the properties themselves but are perhaps not worthy of the designation ''chateau,'' which puts them, in a sense, on the same level with Mouton, Figeac, Cheval-Blanc and La Mission Haut-Brion, among others. Under the present law they are entitled to call themselves chateaus, although many of these properties have little more than patches of vines here and there that must be farmed separately and very inefficiently. Often the wine-making process is rudimentary and the resulting wine indifferent at best. But to the consumer, the wine comes from a Bordeaux ''chateau.'' There are those in the Bordeaux wine trade who would like to see the laws tightened and the designation ''chateau'' reserved for more qualified wine properties. But no one has any illusions about the difficulty of effecting any changes that would deny French farmers the fruits of their patrimony. There is yet another group of chateaus, which while they are not exactly phantoms do not exist in the same way the better-known Bordeaux wine properties exist. They are names reserved for the second wines of a property. Thus, Ch^ateau Clairefont is the second label of Ch^ateau Prieure-Lichine. There actually is a Ch^ateau Clairefont. It is a small manor house about two miles from Prieure-Lichine in Margaux. It adjoins some of the Prieure vineyards but has no vineyards of its own. Thus, depending on how each year's vintage works out, some of the wine may appear under the Clairefont label. In very good years, almost none of the wine will come out as Clairefont. In lesser years, much of the the Prieure production may be sold as Clairefont. Most of the better Bordeaux properties have secondary labels, although not all of them use the term chateau. Ch^ateau Latour has Les Forts de Latour; Ch^ateau Haut-Brion has Bahans Haut-Brion. Often it is not secondary wines that turn up in the secondary label, but just the wines from new, young vines. Every chateau is continuously replanting some of its vineyards, and when these young vines first begin to produce, the wine is usually far below the chateau's standards for its best wine. At the same time, these wines are often great buys. Les Forts de Latour, for example, is a superb wine from the Latour cellars. It may not be Latour, but it is one of the great wines of Bordeaux. It is cheaper than Latour, but it is by no means cheap. Mr. Pallu's complaint would have no effect on the secondary-label chateaus. His charges involve only the cooperatives. Many people in the Bordeaux trade seem to agree that changes are needed in the law. Mr. Pallu's suit may not bring all these changes about immediately, but if it causes people to think about the problem, it will have served a useful purpose, both to the trade and to wine consumers.

613-> BUSES GET OWN 5TH AVE. LANE IN A NEW BID TO EASE TIE-UPS
Fifth Avenue will get a ''red zone'' bus lane today that officials hope will help unsnarl traffic congestion there. The effect the lane will have on the avenue's commerce, however, remained an open question. The western-most lane of the avenue will be reserved for buses from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M., from 34th to 59th Street. Other vehicles may use the lane to make right turns, but those that stop or travel in the lane will be subject to fines of up to $100. The avenue becomes the 11th of the city's major thoroughfares to get a bus lane of this type. Fifth Avenue was not in the city's original bus-lane plan, announced a year ago, but was added after a merchants' group dropped its opposition. Many merchants on Fifth Avenue -especially the west side of the avenue -had expressed concern that the bus lane would make it more difficult for patrons, especially those with limousines, to shop at their stores. But last fall, the Fifth Avenue Association endorsed the bus lane concept. Michael B. Grosso, executive vice president of the association, said his group was satisfied that the red zone idea had helped speed traffic on other city thoroughfares. ''We hope it will bring more discipline to Fifth Avenue,'' he said. Since the red zone bus lanes began operating a year ago, according to a City Transportation Department report, the average speed of buses on the 10 thoroughfares increased by 17 percent, to 5.5 miles an hour from 4.7 Mayor Koch has scheduled a news conference for this morning on the avenue at 50th Street, where he is expected to announce the program and several other initiatives to speed midtown traffic. The bright-red eight-inch plastic strip that outlines the red zone lane had been placed on Fifth Avenue in recent days. Traffic enforcement agents, using megaphones, warned drivers to move out of the bus lane. One agent said he was ''prepping'' the lane in anticipation of the formal opening. No tickets were given out yesterday, he said. Formal enforcement is expected to begin today. Even before the ticketing began, the lane appeared to be effective. According to one No. 5 bus driver, who identified himself only as ''Badge No. 4196,'' the red line is the law, and it is working. ''Anywhere you see that,'' he said while driving down the avenue in the afternoon, ''there is no standing. You're liable for a fine of $100, one hundred pesos.'' ''It's so clean,'' he said, lifting his chin toward the open lane before him. Traffic clogged the rest of Fifth Avenue to his left. Usually, he said, ''this is bad in the afternoon, because there are a lot of trucks, a lot of merchandise moving here. So every street, every intersection, becomes a problem.'' Program a Year Old At several places along the avenue there were cardboard signs showing the back of a city bus, with the legend, ''It's This Bus or Fifty Cars,'' an allusion to how many cars would be needed to carry a busload of passengers. ''Keep New York Moving,'' the sign continues, ''Stay Out of the Red.'' At one site, there was a new large rectangular sign on a lamp posts covered with brown paper that had been taped down. Although no one was sure, one traffic agent speculated that beneath the paper was the Mayor's favorite sign, ''Don't Even THINK of Parking Here.'' Perhaps it will be unveiled at today's news conference, he said. It was just one year ago this week, on June 14, 1982, that Mayor Koch held aloft one such sign and announced the start of the red zone program. Since then, the program has gone into effect on stretches of eight thoroughfares in midtown - First, Second, Third, Eighth and Lexington Avenues; Avenue of the Americas and crosstown on 42d Street and 57th Street - and two in lower Manhattan - one on Broadway and one on Church Street. In addition, there is a double bus lane on Madison Avenue that began the year before. Some of the bus lanes are in effect in the morning, some in the evening and others all day long.

614-> AROUND THE WORLD; London and Dublin Pledge to Improve Ties
Britain and Ireland announced a new effort today to improve relations and foster peace. The statement came during a visit by the Irish Foreign Minister, Peter Barry. The two Governments pledged financial and moral support for a new British-Irish body to promote mutual understanding and good relations, seen in Ireland as necessary to a solution of the Ulster conflict. The initiative was announced after Mr. Barry, here to smooth relations soured by the Ulster conflict and friction over last year's war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands, saw the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, and the Minister for Northern Ireland, James Prior.

615-> Bridge:; Seattle Is Picked as the Site Of the '84 Team Olympiad
The World Bridge Federation, at a meeting of its executive committee in Geneva last week, endorsed a decision by the American Contract Bridge League that seems destined to be quite unpopular around the world. The 1984 World Team Olympiad, originally scheduled for Mexico City, will now be held in Seattle. Mexico would not undertake to admit South Africa or Taiwan, with which it has no diplomatic relations. The selection of Seattle will be sad news for countries that had been hoping that Miami Beach, one of the sites under consideration, would be picked. Travel to Florida would be very much less expensive, not only for teams from Central and South America but also those from Europe, which could take advantage of charter and package arrangements. The site, and unresolved political complications relating to South Africa, make it certain that the attendance will fall well below the 58 countries that gathered in Valkenburg, the Netherlands, in 1980. The number of contestants might even fall below the 39 that attended when North America was last the host, in Miami Beach in 1972. On that occasion the diagramed deal proved to be very irritating for a Polish declarer. Grand Slam in Mind Sitting South, and playing a normal contract of six spades, was Wlodzimierz Stobiecki. Once he had heard his partner open the bidding and raise spades, he could well have bid the slam immediately. Since he would surely have bid the slam if his partner held an ace, his sequence suggests that he had a grand slam in mind and a change of heart. A diamond was led and the ten won in the dummy. Stobiecki now led a trump to his ace, intending to continue with the king. That would insure success with a three-two trump break. But he had to think again when the nine fell from West. He now had to allow for the possibility that the nine was a singleton. With this in mind, he led a low trump from his hand at the third trick. This play would indeed have set up an eventual finesse against East if he began with Q J 7 4, but, as it was, disaster struck. West won, and played another diamond for his partner to ruff with the last missing trump. The attempt to guard against the hypothetical four-one trump break was a little risky, for the declarer would have had some problem in making his 12th trick with a three-two trump split. In the replay the Taiwanese declarer did not concern himself with the possible bad break. He simply played his top trumps and claimed the slam, announcing that the defenders would score their trump trick eventually.

618-> CHAD SAYS REBELS ARE RAIDING CITY IN NORTH WITH LIBYAN AID
Chad said today that 3,500 or more Libyanbacked rebel troops had attacked its northern city of Faya-Largeau but that its garrison was still in control despite Libyan air support for the attacking force. The assault, by forces loyal to the exiled former President of Chad, Goukouni Oueddei, was reported here by the Chadian Embassy. Speaking for the Government of President Hissen Habre, Ahmad Allam-Mi, the charge d'affaires, said the garrison at Faya-Largeau, about 460 miles northeast of the capital, Ndjamena, was strong enough to repel the attack. He added, ''Chad has received guarantees from friendly nations in case of massive intervention by Libya.'' Fierce Fighting Reported The diplomat said fierce fighting continued. He said the force, consisting of Libyans or Libyan-recruited mercenaries from other African countries as well as rebels loyal to Mr. Goukouni, had massed for three weeks. The rebel forces are based in the northern Chadian desert town of Bardai, near the Aozou strip, a vast stretch of mountainous desert on the Chadian-Libyan border that has been claimed and occupied by Libya for more than a decade. President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday in Cameroon, which borders on Chad, that France ''cannot accept'' foreign intervention in Chad. The statement was welcomed by the United States. 'Foreign Intervention Plot' Adoum Yacoub, an adviser to Mr. Goukouni, told Agence France-Presse in Paris that the insurgents ''categorically deny'' that they have received any air support or that there is any ''foreign presence'' among them. He charged that the reports of air support were aimed at justifying a ''foreign intervention plot being hatched in Paris and Washington.'' President Habre, former President Goukouni and other factions in the landlocked country have been battling for power since shortly after France granted it independence in 1960. Chad is one of the world's poorest nations, with an annual per capita income of $112. Reserves of oil and gas have been found, and there is believed to be uranium in the northern area of Tibesti, but none of the mineral wealth can be exploited because of the civil war. From 1968, French armed forces at various times supported the Ndjamena authorities, usually dominated by southerners, against rebellions in the Tibesti and other northern and eastern desert areas, led by Mr. Goukouni, Mr. Habre and other northerners. But former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing disengaged French troops in 1979 after 11 military and political factions then in Chad signed a cease-fire and set up a transitional Government. ---- Chad Informs U.S. WASHINGTON, June 23 (AP) - The Chadian Government has informed the United States that Libyan-supported dissidents had attacked Faya-Largeau, the State Department said today.

621-> DEALER GOT GOLD SENT RECENTLY
Alan David Saxon, the gold dealer whose suicide last week touched off a search for $60 million in precious metals presumed missing, did actually take regular delivery of gold and other investment bars, and was doing so as late as Sept. 26, according to an international bullion wholesaler. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles police commander disclosed some of the contents of a suicide tape left by Mr. Saxon. Detective Lieut. Tim McBride, paraphrasing the tape's message, said Mr. Saxon ''said he had hurt too many people'' and that ''life wasn't worth living.'' He said also that Mr. Saxon, who recently had paid $680,000 in cash for a beachfront condominium, had remarked that he had ''always wanted to live at the beach.'' Lieutenant McBride, commander of the detective division heading the investigation, said he was speaking on behalf the detective in his command who had listened to the tape, whom he would not identify. He said it was 35 to 40 minutes in length and was mainly a general ''lament'' to his wife, Susan, that things had not gone well. Mr. Saxon mentioned money problems but made no specific references, he said. Good Payment Record Cited An official of Johnson, Matthey Ltd. of Toronto said Mr. Saxon's company, Bullion Reserve of North America, had done business with the company since 1980 and had throughout been a reliable customer with a good payment record. The company is the Canadian subsidiary of Johnson, Matthey Ltd. of London, manufacturers of precious metal products. The company official, who did not want his name used, said the company had processed a transaction with Mr. Saxon as late as Sept. 26, two days before Mr. Saxon was found dead here of apparently self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning in the sauna of his condominium in Venice. Bullion Reserve is under investigation for possible fraud by the authorities in both New York and California after an auditors' report showed that an estimated $60 million in gold, silver and platinum bars supposedly being stored for customers in Rocky Mountain vaults could not be found in the company's storage vaults. New York's Attorney General, Robert Abrams, said he understood that the 39-year-old gold dealer, in his suicide message, had said he was going to kill himself because of recent financial losses. However, any financial straits he got into were not with the metals supplier, which takes payment before delivery. Deliveries to Perpetual Storage ''He took delivery on product,'' the company official said, although he would not disclose the volume of business. ''We delivered it directly to Bullion Reserve, and they did their own deliveries'' to their clients, he added. He said deliveries were made both to Perpetual Storage Inc. of Salt Lake City, the Rocky Mountain vaults advertised to Bullion Reserve customers, and to Bullion Reserve's offices here on Sunset Boulevard. There were also indications today that some of Bullion Reserve's 30,000 customers would be unaffected by its situation. A telephone tape recording at the company's office in Dallas today informed customers that ''holders of Johnson, Matthey registered receipts'' and ''holders of leverage loans with West Coast Bank are not at risk.'' The Johnson, Matthey official confirmed that to be the case. It was unknown, however, how many clients both groups included. The beachfront dwelling that Mr. Saxon had apparently long coveted is a two-story, two-bedroom apartment in a cream stucco building with a 20- foot-high window facing the Pacific and a wide expanse of beach. He purchased the apartment last spring from Dr. Nick Diaco, a physician who said Mr. Saxon had paid the $680,000 in cash. ''He closed the deal within an hour,'' Dr. Diaco said, describing Mr. Saxon as ''very shy, low-key, but amiable.'' The physician said Mr. Saxon had told him he bought and sold gold for people, and they stored it in his company. He said a cash transaction was not unusual in the prime real estate market of Venice and Marina del Rey. One of Mr. Saxon's neighbors, who asked that her name not be used, said she noticed a few weeks ago that Mr. Saxon, who customarily dressed in designer jeans, button-down shirts and cowboy boots, had armed himself with a revolver in a holster. He told her he was licensed because of his business, she said, adding that he did not seem particularly troubled.

622-> JUDGE ORDERS U.S. TO PUT MOST OF FORT WADSWORTH IN GATEWAY AREA
A Federal judge ruled yesterday that the United States Interior Department must accept most of Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island for inclusion in the Gateway National Recreation Area. The Defense Department has ended military use of all but 50 acres of the 226-acre site, but the Interior Department has said it does not want to accept any part of the fort unless it can have all of it. Interior Department officials have held that the continued Defense Department use of the 50 acres - for an Army reserve center, Navy offices and military housing - was not compatible with a park and would cause problems of public access and other difficulties. But, in a ruling on a two-year-old suit brought by environmental advocates, the judge, Edward R. Neaher of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, said the fact that the Defense Department had need ''for a relatively small portion of the fort is not a valid reason for rejecting 176 acres that are available, especially when they contain historical fortifications which Congress has recognized as major attractions in the area.'' The fort, at the Staten Island end of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, is on a site that has served as a military post since the 1660's and has been described by Army historians as the oldest active permanently occupied military post in operation in the United States. Judge Neaher, however, rejected the claim of the environmentalists that in continuing to use 10 of the 50 acres it has retained, the Defense Department was violating the 1972 legislation in which Congress authorized development of the Gateway National Recreation Area, the urban national park being developed around New York Harbor. Those 10 acres and the buildings on them were transferred from the Army to the Navy in 1981 for use as headquarters for the Navy's Resale and Support Office, which oversees commissary and supply operations. Fort Wadsworth had been an Army facility. Ross Sandler, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups involved, said the plaintiffs were ''delighted that Judge Neaher ruled that 176 acres of Fort Wadsworth must be public park land.'' He said the plaintiffs were ''less happy'' with the portion of the ruling that upheld the Navy's use of the 10 acres. He said the environmentalists were studying the matter to determine whether to appeal this part of the decision. A spokesman for the National Park Service, the branch of the Interior Department that administers the Gateway area, said officials of the service had not yet seen Judge Neaher's ruling. ''When we review it, our attorneys will make a determination as to whether we will acquiesce or appeal it,'' the spokesman, George Berklacy, said. Judge Neaher said the Interior Department should take steps by Sept. 16 to gain custody of the 176 acres no longer used by the military. The overall area designated for Gateway development totals more than 26,000 acres of land, water and marshes in several noncontiguous sections extending from Sandy Hook in New Jersey to the Jamaica Bay and Rockaway peninsula areas in southern Queens.

623-> AROUND THE WORLD; 2 U.S. Pilots Reported In Sicilian Air Incident
The pilots of two United States Air Force fighter- bombers almost hit an Italian airliner last month because they disobeyed ground control instructions, an Italian Air Force officer said today. One of the two F-111's based in southern Italy came within two or three yards of a DC-9 airliner with 84 passengers as it approached Catania in Sicily, the officer, Col. Giuseppe Capizzano, said at a news conference. Quoting an Italian Air Force report on the Sept. 26 incident, he said that after naval exercises were canceled because of bad weather, the pilots, rather than returning directly to base, made a detour over Catania and ignored air control attempts to keep them and the DC-9 apart.

624-> THE CONTEST FOR DR PEPPER
Castle & Cooke Inc., the Honolulu- based food, real estate and manufacturing conglomerate, wants Dr Pepper for its summertime earnings and management expertise in the soft- drink industry, company officials and securities analysts say. The Hawaiian company made its $560 million bid for the Dallas-based Dr Pepper Monday through a new investment group, the DPCC Acquisition Corporation. The initials stand for Dr Pepper and Castle & Cooke. It was undeterred by a definitive takeover agreement for $512.5 million that Dr Pepper had signed with another investment group the day before. And it apparently was not put off by a decline in Dr Pepper's earnings in the last year, as it slipped from third to fourth place nationally behind Seven- Up, Pepsi and Coke. Sam Schneider, a spokesman for Castle & Cooke at its Honolulu headquarters, said the company was interested in Dr Pepper for the same reason that it had been interested in the A&W root beer business, which ''was acquired through a similar type of arrangement in August.'' Mr. Schneider said Dr Pepper would help to provide ''a steady flow of year-round earnings, particularly in the summertime when our earnings have tended to be weakest.'' For its part, Dr Pepper is not saying no. It indicated that the leveraged buyout agreement it had with a group led by the Wall Street investment firm of Forstmann Little & Company was not enough to stop it from considering the new offer. ''Virtually every definitive agreement has certain outs that, if another proposal is better for the shareholders, you can go ahead and study that offer and the first offer becomes null and void,'' said L. Dan Thompson, Dr Pepper's treasurer. DPCC said yesterday that it had obtained nearly all of the financing for the deal, which amounts to $24 a share, from six unidentified banks. The offer expires next Monday. The Forstmann Little agreement amounts to $22 a share. Dr Pepper closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $22.125, up 87.5 cents. Forstmann Little did not indicate whether it might submit a higher bid, instead attacking what it called the ''highly conditional and incomplete nature'' of the DPCC plan. Theodore J. Forstmann, a general partner, cited ''the uncertain nature of virtually every element in their financing scheme.'' If DPCC is successful in acquiring Dr Pepper, its bid could be even more costly because of a provision in the Forstmann Little agreement. That contract gives the investment firm the option to buy 4.15 million shares of Dr Pepper at $22 a share under certain conditions. If Forstmann Little were to exercise its option and then resell the stock to DPCC for $24 a share, it would make a profit of $2 a share, or $8.3 million. DPCC said that Drexel Burnham Lambert, the securities firm, was one of the investors in the venture, but declined to identify any of the other participants. Castle & Cooke said that it would own 40 percent of Dr Pepper if the leveraged buyout transaction went through. In such a buyout, assets of the company being acquired are used to secure financing for the purchase. Commenting on Dr Pepper's attraction for Castle & Cooke, Lawrence Adelman, a securities analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said: ''Somebody approaching Dr Pepper has to take into consideration that it has the marketing prowess, financial resources and belief that can drive the volume up.'' An official of Drexel Burnham, who requested anonymity, asserted that Ian R. Wilson, Castle & Cooke's president and a former senior official of the Coca-Cola Company, ''is widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable people in the beverage business.'' The official added, ''We believe he can make Dr Pepper a very exciting thing for us to be owners in.'' For the first nine months of 1983, Dr Pepper earned $14 million on volume of $423.5 million, compared with net income of $16.5 million on sales of $392.4 million in the period a year ago. In the first quarter of its fiscal year ended Oct. 8, Castle & Cooke earned $3.2 million on revenues of $472.6 million, compared with a loss of $64.6 million on revenues of $401 million in the comparable period a year earlier.

625-> HELEN HAYES HONORED AS THEATER IS RENAMED
Helen Hayes's name returned to Broadway yesterday when the Little Theater on West 44th Street was renamed in her honor. It was the second time Miss Hayes has been honored with the naming of a Broadway theater. But the other Helen Hayes Theater was torn down in the spring of 1982, after impassioned demonstrations to save it, to make way for the Marriott Marquis hotel now going up near Times Square. Yesterday's dedication ceremony, which took place in the 499-seat playhouse before an audience of producers and other members of the Broadway community, was both a moving tribute to Miss Hayes's distinguished career and a reminder of the lingering bitterness over the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theater on West 46th Street. ''When the other theater was torn down, I pretended very hard I didn't mind, but I really did,'' said the 82-year-old Miss Hayes, who made a point of showing her disdain for microphones in the theater by standing to one side of the lectern and speaking in her own strong voice without amplification. Hope for Long Theater Life ''Even though I couldn't be on the stage, I took comfort that I was still represented on Broadway,'' she said. ''The theater has been my whole life. It has given me every great thing I ever had. I hope this theater will have many long runs and outlive me. I don't want any more tragedies. I don't want to be reduced to bathroom weeping anymore. We learn in the theater you only cry on stage and in the bathroom.'' A popular actress for more than 50 years, Miss Hayes ended her theatrical career in 1971 because of chronic asthmatic bronchitis, which she said was aggravated by the dusty environment of the theater. She had been acting professionally since the age of 5. Among her Broadway triumphs were the title roles in ''Mary of Scotland'' (1933) and ''Victoria Regina'' (1935), in which she played 80 years in the life of Queen Victoria. She also gave memorable performances in ''What Every Woman Knows,'' ''Ladies and Gentlemen,'' which was written by Charles MacArthur, her late husband, and Ben Hecht; ''The Show-Off'' and revivals of ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' ''A Touch of the Poet'' and ''Harvey,'' in which she appeared with James Stewart in 1970. She won a Tony Award in 1947 for her performance in ''Happy Birthday.'' Yesterday, Miss Hayes was surrounded on the stage by leaders of the fight to save the Helen Hayes Theater last spring. Among the speakers were Joseph Papp and Colleen Dewhurst, who were arrested during a demonstration to stop the wrecking ball; and Ellen Burstyn, president of Actors Equity, which was a leader of the save-thetheater campaign. Koch Cited for 'Bravery' Mayor Koch, who supported the hotel project and was criticized for permitting the demolition of the theater, made a brief appearance. He was introduced by Miss Burstyn, who said: ''On behalf of the 32,000 members of Actors Equity, I would like to congratulate Mayor Koch for his bravery in coming here today.'' Mr. Koch mentioned that Miss Hayes had been asked about the use of her name on the 1,500-seat theater that is to be built in the hotel. ''She said she did not want her name on a large theater,'' he noted. ''She said she wanted a small theater. That is the mark of an extraordinary person.'' Donald Tick, an owner of the Helen Hayes Theater, said that before he and Martin Markinson bought the playhouse three years ago there were plans to turn the property, at 240 West 44th Street, into a restaurant. ''If Mayor Koch hadn't intervened,'' he said, ''we'd be sitting here having breakfast.''

''With the continuing evolution of the financial services market, Merrill Lynch is centralizing the management of its global lending and credit activities,'' the company said in a statement. Mr. Urciuoli said, ''This is not some revolutionary change for Merrill Lynch; rather it is a grouping of businesses that we've been slowly building up into one unit.'' Nevertheless, the announcement served to underscore the broadening competition among banks, broker houses and other financial services companies. ''We all overlap to a far greater extent than we used to,'' Mr. Urciuoli said. ''What we're doing now in a sense is looking to 1990 and asking ourselves what will the financial firmament look like and what will be the needs of our customers.'' Merrill Lynch, Mr. Urciuoli said, first got into banking 10 years ago when it formed the Merrill Lynch International Bank in London. Mr. Urciuoli, who is 45, has been chairman of that bank since 1980. In addition, he said, Merrill Lynch has banks in Singapore and Panama, and all have representative offices in New York. In the United States, Merrill Lynch is involved in lending, leasing and financing through Merrill Lynch Capital Resources. Mr. Urciuoli is a graduate of St. Lawrence University and Georgetown Law School, as well as the advanced management program at the Harvard Business School. He left the practice of law in 1968 to join Merrill Lynch. Mr. Urciuoli said the upheaval in financial services was customerdriven, causing markets to evolve to fill needs. ''But I don't think we are going to look like a bank or an insurance company or a Sears, Roebuck,'' he said. ''We are going to look like Merrill Lynch.''

629-> GERMAN CATHOLICS DEBATE ATOM ARMS
The Roman Catholic Church in West Germany is being pulled, with misgivings and reluctance, into a national debate on nuclear weapons, a debate in which until recently Protestant voices have been the most audible. Pressure on the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which generally supports the ruling Christian Democratic Party, is emerging from dissident lay organzations in West Germany and from statements by American and East German bishops questioning the morality of nuclear warfare. The timing of the debate is awkward for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose Christian Democrats, during the campaign for national elections March 6, are committed to defending the stationing of American medium-range missiles. Letter May Be Kept Secret The debate is so sensitive that a pastoral letter from the country's bishops on war and peace, which is expected to be completed at the end of next month, will probably be kept secret until after the elections, according to church sources. In October a draft pastoral letter by American bishops that denounced the first use of nuclear weapons as immoral and questioned the ethics of nuclear deterrence created a stir among West German Catholics. ''It was always said that the peace movement was anti-American,'' said Harald Pawlowski, editor of the leftist Roman Catholic weekly Publik Forum. ''And now here were the American bishops - or some of them at least - siding with the peace movement.'' The American bishops' letter, which contrasted with the West German bishops' studied avoidance of the nuclear issue, was widely read in Roman Catholic circles here. In just two weeks Publik Forum sold 10,000 reprints, and another press run has been ordered. West German Catholics were also struck by the willingness of the American bishops to hear numerous lay experts and to express their own differences publicly. 'Altogether Different' Culture ''We just have an altogether different political culture from the United States,'' said Mariele Shulz-Berndt, a member of a lay group called Church From Below, which was founded two years ago by young Roman Catholics caught up in the antinuclear cause. Miss Shulz-Berndt, a doctoral student at Cologne University, operates out of a drafty building in Bonn that was once a women's prison. Her chapter, which spreads its message through a van that is often seen at antiwar demonstrations, recently printed excerpts from the American bishops' pastoral using a bogus letterhead of the Cologne diocese. The joke was explained at the end of the leaflet, joined with an appeal for ''solidarity with the American Catholics'' and opposition to the stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in West Germany at the end of this year. The diocese was not amused. The fledgling Church From Below group survives independently of the church, but many of its followers were, or are, members of Pax Christi, a church-financed organization that has become involved in the nuclear weapons debate. Convention Is Transformed In September in Dusseldorf, these two organizations, as well as activists from the League of German Catholic Youth, managed to transform an annual national Roman Catholic convention into a major debate on Christian attitudes toward war. Pax Christi invited Msgr. Leroy Matthiesen, the Bishop of Amarillo, Tex., who is an antinuclear advocate,to speak to a working group, and in a much applauded speech Bishop Franz Kamphaus of Limburg took issue with a Christian Democratic Member of Parliament who had argued the right of the state to use violence to defend its citizens. Bishop Kamphaus, who has become something of a spiritual father to the church antiwar dissidents, stunned his listeners by disclosing that he would most likely have been a conscientious objector in his youth. The emergence of figures like Bishop Kamphaus has encouraged young militants in Pax Christi, which began at the end of the war as an organization working for French-German reconciliation and only in the last few years has turned to issues like the export of weapons to the third world. ''We cannot give up our chance to work within official German Catholicism,'' said Ansgar Koschel, 39, the secretary general of Pax Christi. He said that the goals of Pax Christi and Church From Below were similar and that only their methods differed. Step-by-Step Approach Pax Christi supports a gradualist, step-by-step approach to disarmament by the United States and the Soviet Union, and so far it has not openly condemned the stationing of cruise and Pershing-2 missiles in West Germany. But Mr. Koschel said it was ''conceivable'' that if the Soviet-American arms-reduction talks in Geneva remained stalemated, Pax Christi would come out against the missile deployment. For the Roman Catholic Church in West Germany, such a step would for the first time put one of its organizations foursquare among Protestant pacifist groups. Last Sunday the debate was joined when East German bishops issued a pastoral that criticized the militarization of school programs and said that ''a war with modern mass-annihilation weapons is in itself immoral.''

631-> CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR STILL WITHOUT A MANSION
George Deukmejian remains a Governor without a home in California's capital city after nearly a year in office. Instead of moving into the mansion built for governors, as he had hoped, Mr. Deukmejian and his wife, Gloria, are looking around for a private residence to rent. Meanwhile, Mr. Deukmejian lives in a two-bedroom condominium in downtown Sacramento and commutes to his home and family in Long Beach on weekends. Mr. Deukmejian, a Republican, said before he was elected in November 1982 that he would like very much to move his family into the 10-bedroom, Spanish-style mansion built for governors on 11 acres overlooking the scenic American River about 15 miles from his Capitol office. Construction of the mansion by the state began when Ronald Reagan was Governor but was not completed until after Edmund G. Brown Jr. became Governor in 1975. Brown Called It Taj Mahal Mr. Brown, a bachelor, refused to move into it, calling it a Taj Mahal, and chose instead to live in a modest apartment near the Capitol. Before Mr. Brown left office after eight years as Governor, the Legislature passed a bill requiring that the mansion be sold. The Legislature refused in its tense 1983 session to rescind the law calling for the sale of the mansion. Matt Franich, a developer in the Los Angeles area, bought the mansion on Oct. 18 on a bid of $1,350,000, saying he wanted to make sure the Governor had a home in which to live. But Mr. Deukmejian's hopes to make the mansion his home were immediately dashed when Mr. Franich asked for $18,000 to $24,000 a month in rent, far exceeding the $5,000 a month the Legislature appropriates to the Governor for rental. New Rent Demand Rejected This week Mr. Franich, who still insisted he wanted the Governor to live in the mansion, reduced his rent demand to $5,000 a month. Mr. Deukmejian indicated that what Mr. Franich termed his ''final proposal'' also would be unacceptable because Mr. Franich did not intend to take care of the ''tremendous amount of work and expense to be done to make the residence habitable and livable and in proper condition for the uses for which a governor's residence would be properly used.'' ''I would also have to say,'' the Governor added, ''that I think it's out of the question that anyone, the state or anyone else, is going to put in all of that money into some property that's owned by an individual, in this case Mr. Franich. ''It would enhance the value of his property a lot, but I don't think that it's reasonable to expect either the state or other individuals to contribute large sums of money like that, that are going to go, you know, directly to the benefit of an individual.'' Mr. Franich said later this week that as a ''shot in the dark,'' he had sent a telegram to Edwin Meese, a Presidential adviser, at the White House asking that the mansion be considered as a location for a Presidential museum and Ronald Reagan library.

632-> AS TURKEY TAKES A 'CAUTIOUS STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION'
To the Editor: Jeri Laber's shocking article depicting the forthcoming elections in Turkey as a farce, published under a morbid picture of skull and bones (Op-Ed Oct. 19), was a source of deep disappointment for those concerned with constitutional rights and liberties in that country. Having spent three months traveling in Turkey recently, and having closely followed the political life of that country for the last 20 years, I have to disagree with Mrs. Laber's judgment. Mrs. Laber claims the terrorism that preceded the 1980 coup has been ''replaced by a new terrorism waged by the Government against its frightened people.'' After the tragedy of the more than 200 deaths in Beirut, Americans may be in a better position to sympathize with Turks who, before the military took over, were suffering 200 deaths every day owing to terror. In my own travels, talking to people from every walk of life, from Silvan in the east to Datca in the west, I did not come across any of these ''frightened'' citizens. The vast majority of the populace is grateful that the madness has been ended and that there is again firm government at the center. The worry is not at all that the populace is frightened, but that on the contrary it has become too complacent in handing over a great deal of power to the President. The concerns of the intellectuals about constitutional liberties do not appear to be shared by the general public. For better or worse, there has been such disillusion with the performance of both the old democratic parties in public life - such unhappiness over their inability to stem the tide of terror - that there is real anxiety as to what an open political system may hold in store. How can we forget that Lebanon, too, was a ''democracy'' before outside powers started meddling? Outside meddling in the form of billions of dollars' worth of smuggled armaments from the Soviets and their proxies was a major, indisputable feature of the Turkish political landscape before the Evren intervention. The elections on Nov. 6 must be seen not in some idealized vacuum but in the long shadow of terrible events. Turkey within NATO remains a critical target for Soviet planners, and conditions in Greece and Cyprus, in Syria, in Iraq and in Iran are not conducive to complacency. Given the gravity of the international and national scene, an election with three contending parties under the eye of the military is hardly what one would wish for Turkey, but this is surely no farce, only a cautious step in the right direction. Unlike Jeri Laber, who appears totally out of touch with Turkey, I believe that much will depend on the actual conduct of the elections. Encouraging the electoral process is a vital matter for Turkey and the entire region. Suggested remedies like cutting off military aid are likely to be counterproductive. The loss of a large and vital country to anarchy and thence to the Soviets (which is the new scenario, like Afghanistan) would have devastating repercussions in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East.

634-> AROUND THE WORLD; Turkish Cypriot Urges Review of U.N. Role
Rauf Denktash, leader of the self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot republic, called today for a review of the deployment of United Nations troops in Cyprus and said United States coercion had stopped Islamic nations from recognizing his state. Mr. Denktash told reporters in the Turkish sector of Nicosia that he would seek changes in the deployment agreement covering the 2,350-strong United Nations force in Cyprus when its mandate comes up for renewal in the Security Council on Dec. 15. ''We are not telling the U.N. to leave our territories immediately,'' he said. ''But we are seriously considering the taking of sides by the countries which contribute'' to the force. He added, ''We want them to stay impartial in the Cyprus dispute.'' Mr. Denktash asserted that the United States had called on Islamic countries not to recognize the independent nation proclaimed by the Turkish Cypriots in the northern third of the island. ''Had there been no American coercion, 10 or 15 Islamic governments would have recognized us,'' he said.

635-> 5 Palestinians Criticize Bombing of Israeli Bus
Five Palestinian leaders from the occupied West Bank published a condemnation today of a bus bombing the day before in Jerusalem that killed four Israelis and wounded 46 others. It was the first time since Israel captured the West Bank of the Jordan River 16 years ago that Palestinian leaders openly allied with the Palestine Liberation Organization have condemned an anti-Israeli terrorist act. The anti-Arafat faction of the P.L.O. has claimed responsibility for the bus explosion. The five are: Kerim Khalaf, former mayor of Ramallah who lost a foot in a car-bombing three years ago; Mustafa Natshe, ousted by the Israelis last summer as mayor of Hebron; Paul Ajlouni, publisher of the East Jerusalem Al- Fajr newspaper; Hana Seniora, managing editor of the Arabic-language paper, and Nawar Nuseiba, a former defense minister of Jordan.

636-> IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES
Who ever said that the art world's Neo- Expressionist bandwagon had passed photography by? Not Allan Chasanoff, whose love of the medium was manifested first as a passionate collector and now as a photographer. His hotly colored still lifes look like photographs to which a runaway Neo-Expressionist painter has added a kind of freewheeling scribble. In fact, though, the oil paint we see is not on the photographs but within them, which is to say that Mr. Chasanoff is as much responsible for the pigmented strokes as for the teapots, mugs and pieces of fruit that can still be glimpsed through the glaze. Just where the paint is, however, remains something of a mystery in these photographs, which can be seen at Marcuse Pfeifer Gallery, 825 Madison Avenue, through Nov. 25. It seems to be located on a plane somewhere between the surface of the print itself and the objects depicted, but just where and how is part of the fun of the exhibition. The colors are jazzy, the painting is done with just the right touch of insouciance, and the end results - the photographs - are devilishly delightful.

637-> ISLANDERS WIN 5TH IN ROW, 4-0
The Islanders, on the mend from a sluggish start this season, won their fifth straight game tonight, beating the Buffalo Sabres, 4-0, and diverting for the moment talk that this will be the season of their dethroning. Billy Smith recorded the 17th regular-season shutout of his career, and Denis Potvin stretched his streak of having scored at least one assist in a game to 13. He is only one game from tying the National Hockey League record, held by four players, including Wayne Gretzky of the Edmonton Oilers. ''I know everyone is looking for signs that this is the end of the road for us,'' said Potvin. ''But as long as we are the Islanders, that will be the case. People will see signs everywhere.'' The Sabres provided a compelling contrast to the four-time Stanley Cup champions, a team of sturdy veterans, who view the regular season as an extended tuneup to the playoffs. The Sabres have seven players under the age of 22. One of their goaltenders, Tom Barrasso, who did not play tonight, is only 18. ''Sure we think about things like age,'' said Potvin. ''We know this will not go on forever.'' Arbour Still Cautious The Islanders' winning streak, coming after four consecutive losses, has failed to convince their coach, Al Arbour, that the team's early problems are over. Two of the Islanders' victories in the recent stretch have come over the New Jersey Devils, who have dropped 10 in a row, including a 6-1 loss Friday night to the Islanders. And by defeating the Sabres, the Islanders improved their home record this season to 4-4-0. Last season they lost only 11 games at home. ''Tonight was maybe our best game of the year,'' said Arbour. ''We made the big defensive plays. Our forwards came back to help out to break up plays that Buffalo was developing. But we've got to do this for a little bit more, before I'll really be happy.'' Potvin received his assist for setting up the Islanders' third goal, scored by John Tonelli with 9:13 gone by in the third period. He passed from just in front of the blue line to Tonelli, who forced the puck between the pads of Bob Sauve, the Buffalo goaltender. Mike Bossy scored the last goal of the game with 9:35 remaining. The Islanders were aggressive in the first period, sending 15 shots on goal to 6 for Buffalo. But the Sabres returned the pressure in the following period, outshooting the Islanders 14 to 8. Three times, Smith barely batted away loose rebounds of shots taken close to the goal. The Elusive Puck Despite Buffalo's hard work in the second period, it was by accident that they came closest to scoring. With 5:24 remaining in the period, Mike Foligno, a right wing, shot weakly against Smith's skates. The puck trickled between the goaltender's legs, stopping just inches from the goal line. Smith knew he had the puck in his possession, but he did not know where it was resting. Foligno tried barreling past Smith, but in doing so, he pointed Smith to the puck, and the goaltender fell on it before any damage was done. The Islanders took the lead only 44 seconds into the game, when Greg Gilbert, skating into the slot position in front of the goal, took a pass from Duane Sutter. Gilbert brought his stick up as if to shoot. The Buffalo goaltender, Bob Sauve, and two Sabre defenders went down instinctively, but Gilbert moved to his left and around the jam-up and placed the puck softly over Sauve, who was entangled on the ice with his teammates. With 6:28 remaining in the first period, Potvin made it 2-0 with his fourth goal on a power play. Before the game, Scotty Bowman, the Sabres' coach and general manager, said that Sauve had shown a weakness with his glove hand. But Potvin, as Gilbert had done earlier, faked in front before skating left and exploiting Sauve's stick side. The Islanders exerted pressure right to the end. As the crowd of 15,549 counted down the final seconds of the game, the Islanders were still bearing down on Sauve. In fact, the crowd's chant was interrupted with just a second to go, when the puck landed on top of the Buffalo net. Still, Arbour would only credit his team with ''a good 38 minutes.'' 2 Islanders Hurt Two Islanders suffered minor injuries. Bob Bourne, the left wing, left late in the game with a charley horse in his left leg. Anders Kallur, a right wing, was cut on the chin in the first period and required nine stitches. He returned in the second period and played the rest of the game.

639-> JETS GIVE CREDIT TO DOLPHINS' DEFENSE
Sunday night, after the Dolphins defeated the Jets in the American Conference championship game, 14-0, Richard and Lulu Todd went out to dinner with Bob Baumhower. Todd is the Jets' quarterback. Baumhower is the Dolphins' nose tackle. They have been friends since the early 1970's, when they played for the University of Alabama. Now they are partners in a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale. ''Richard was down,'' Baumhower said today, before a Dolphin team meeting and the trip to Pasadena, Calif., where they will play the Washington Redskins Sunday in Super Bowl XVII. ''He was saying that the Jets came down here real confident, figuring that they were going to the Super Bowl, but we had shut them down. He said our defensive backs were jamming their receivers so well at the line of scrimmage that they couldn't run any of their patterns and were never where they were supposed to be. And that confused him. He said for me to tell our secondary that they are the best he's ever played against.'' Todd had ample opportunity to assess the Dolphins' secondary. Because of a muddy field in the Orange Bowl and the Dolphins' defensive front, the Jets' running game was largely ineffective, gaining only 62 yards and forcing Todd into many obvious passing situations. He threw 37 times: The Jets caught 15 of his passes, the Dolphins five. All-Important First Down Most football teams consider first down the most important. If the offensive unit gains 6 yards or more on first down, it has more options on the next two downs. Conversely, an offense faced with a second-and-long will usually pass. The Jets had 19 second-down plays Sunday, and on 15 of them they needed 7 yards or more to make a first down. ''That's what we mean by controlling the line of scrimmage,'' said Baumhower. ''We haven't had the kind of success on first downs all year that we had Sunday.'' The Dolphins' defensive game plan was, essentially, to prevent the Jets from gaining big yardage on first down. That meant stopping Freeman McNeil, whose 786 yards led the league in rushing this season. McNeil ran 17 times for 46 yards, and on the 11 times he was called upon to run on first down, he gained 22 yards and only once as many as 9 yards. In the Jets' previous playoff victories, over Cincinnati and the Los Angeles Raiders, he had run for 202 yards and 101. ''When they were forced into a second-and-long, there were only a few things they could do,'' said Kim Bokamper, the Dolphins' right defensive end. ''It not only took away their running game, it takes away the play-action pass.'' Shutting Down McNeil The Dolphins controlled the Jets on first down by using, for the most part, their customary three-man defensive front of Doug Betters, Baumhower and Bokamper. With the help of the outside linebackers, Bob Brudzinski and Larry Gordon, they tried to make McNeil run wide, where they prevented him from turning the corner. ''Basically, we're a three-man line team,'' Coach Don Shula said. ''We have our stunts. For example, Baumhower does not always go straight into the center. He'll go one way or the other, our defensive ends will step in or out, and our linebackers will compensate with their 'games.' Those are all parts of the sophistication of the three-man line you have in your game plan.'' On other downs, the Dolphins confused the Jets with their use of the linebacker A.J. Duhe, a former defensive lineman, and Bokamper, a former linebacker. Duhe, who had three interceptions, sometimes lined up as a linebacker, sometimes as a lineman. Bokamper sometimes dropped back into the pass coverage after beginning the play in his usual three-point stance. ''That caused some indecision on the part of the offense,'' Shula said, alluding to the Dolphins' various defensive looks. ''When they're looking at a three-man line, and at the snap we're doing different things, like three, four, even five guys rushing. We can get some pretty good things going for us.'' Miami's other major concern was the wide receiver Wesley Walker. In 10 previous games against the Dolphins, Walker caught 42 passes for 785 yards and nine touchdowns. In the two games this season, he had caught nine for 130 yards and three touchdowns. Miami's secondary had given up only seven touchdown passes all season. Yet Sunday, Walker caught one pass for zero yards. Three other passes were thrown to him. One was overthrown, one he caught out of bounds and one was intercepted by Gerald Small. 'Zoning Him Some' ''We were zoning him some,'' Shula said. ''Other times we used six defensive backs to make sure we had some double-coverage on him, either short and deep or in and out.'' During the nine-game regular season, the Dolphins' defense, which was ranked first in the league over all and first against the pass, allowed an average of 147 yards of rushing and 119 yards of passing. In playoff victories over New England, San Diego and the Jets, the averages are 71 and 135. Perhaps more significantly, the Dolphins gave up an average of 14.5 points a game during the season; in the playoffs, it is 8.7. ''Defensively, we wanted to continue to improve,'' Shula said. ''We have played pretty well all year. But in the last two weeks, in particular, we have been outstanding.''

640-> HALVERSON NAMED TO ACT AS HEAD OF CITY SCHOOLS
Richard F. Halverson was named yesterday to be Acting Chancellor of the New York City schools after Frank J. Macchiarola, the Chancellor, confirmed that he was giving up the post to be president and chief executive officer of the New York City Partnership, a coalition of business groups. Mr. Halverson, who is 40 years old and is now the school system's Deputy Chancellor, will hold the top post while a search is conducted for a successor to Mr. Macchiarola, who said he expected leave the job by March. The appointment of Mr. Macchiarola to head the Partnership was formally announced yesterday by David Rockefeller, chairman of the organization and a leader in its founding in 1979. 'We Can Do Something Exciting' ''With his outstanding qualities of leadership, we can do something exciting,'' Mr. Rockefeller said of Mr. Macchiarola, at a crowded news conference at the Partnership's headquarters at 200 Madison Avenue. ''What we need at the Partnership is a person of Frank Macchiarola's quality to pull it all together,'' Mr. Rockefeller said. The Partnership was formed for the purpose of increasing the influence of the business community by having a single organization speak for many groups on public issues. Its various projects have dealt with youth employment, mass transit, public safety, housing and education. Mr. Macchiarola, who is 41 years old and has headed the school system since 1978, is leaving at a time that the Board of Education is struggling to close a $37 million deficit. The Chancellor said earlier this month that as many as 1,800 teachers could be laid off in February. Leaving at Critical Time Asked why he was giving up his position at so crucial a juncture, Mr. Macchiarola said: ''We've had lots of difficult times. There really is no 'right' time to leave.'' Mr. Macchiarola spoke passionately of the school system and repeatedly voiced the hope that the gains of recent years would continue. Though his speeches in the past have almost always been given without notes, he read from a prepared text yesterday, thanking the teachers of the school system and members of his personal staff for their assistance. ''A 'thank you,' too, to Mayor Koch, whose support was necessary for any of our achievements,'' Mr. Macchiarola said. ''I owe him a debt I can never repay.'' At City Hall, meeting briefly with reporters yesterday, Mr. Koch had good words to say, in return, about Mr. Macchiarola, talking of the Chancellor's ''five years of superb service.'' Search Committee to Form Joseph G. Barkan, the president of the Board of Education, said in an interview that he expected to form a search committee at a meeting Wednesday, and that it probably would consist of all seven members of the board. ''If I know my colleagues, they will all want to get in on the act,'' said Mr. Barkan, adding that candidates throughout the country would be contacted, with the hope of naming a Chancellor by June. Presumably, the selection of a new Chancellor will affect the dozens of high-ranking officials on the headquarters staff whom the Chancellor appoints. In the interim, Mr. Halverson will be a leader with whom the staff is familiar. Responsibilities Were Broadened He came to the school system with Mr. Macchiarola in 1978 as the top financial aide, and increasingly assumed broader responsibilities. Mr. Halverson had been at City Hall on the staff of David Brown, the Deputy Mayor for policy. Mr. Halverson assumed the Chancellor's duties for more than a month a year ago, when Mr. Macchiarola was acting principal of Jamaica High School. Mr. Halverson received his doctorate in a joint program in political science and education at Columbia University and Teachers College.

641-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; PAX AFRIKAANSA
Leaders of neighboring black states and resistance movements have a clear idea of what they believe to be South Africa's current strategy. In their analysis, it is to weaken their countries and make them submit to a kind of Pax Afrikaansa - enforcing permanent economic dependence and military vulnerability that will leave South Africa's regime unchallenged at home and easily dominant in the region. It would be like the Soviet Union's satellite-nation system. South African officials vehemently deny this. ''Why should we want to destabilize our neighbors?'' said one. ''They are inherently unstable without anything we do.'' Probe a little more, and the aim is defined as ''our right to deal with our own problems (race relations) without interference.'' Some officials are more precise. They put the goal as total elimination of ''all terrorist bases,'' by which they mean not only militants of the African National Congress, which tries to infiltrate South Africa, and Swapo fighters opposing South African dominion in Namibia, but also agitation, propaganda, any support for South Africa's repressed black majority. The argument offered in justification is that South Africa needs time to move toward political settlements and to sort out its nightmare of apartheid, the impossible notion of total separation of the society by race. But what then? What does Pretoria envisage at the end of this exercise of force? No Government supporter seems to have an answer beyond vague, awkwardly named notions such as ''consociation'' or ''some kind of federalism, but not based on territorial states.'' Majority (black) rule in a unified state is firmly ruled out, but so is straightforward partition. It is a strategy without a goal. Leaders are quoted as saying, in private, that they are determined to maintain things for another generation. ''After that, our children and grandchildren can look after themselves.'' U.S. policy accepts, even encourages, the idea that reform must be carefully dosed and go hand-in-hand with repression to prevent a sudden, dramatic explosion. Though distasteful, that could make hardheaded sense if there were a visible goal. Since there isn't, U.S. policy echoes the hope that one will somehow emerge in the process. But as one South African official considered to be among the most open-minded put it: ''We want to show that we want peace in the region, we want to contribute and we can help a lot. But we also want to show that if we are refused we can destroy the whole of southern Africa.'' There is is, in a nutshell. Government jargon makes much of the ''total onslaught'' of Marxist forces against the West in Africa, of the ''Soviet threat.'' But when pushed for details, nobody seems to take it seriously except Washington. Even Jaap Marais, leader of the most extreme right-wing party, pooh-poohs a ''Soviet threat'' and makes clear his concern is preservation of lily-white rule. Defense Ministry officials, acknowledging South Africa's overwhelming military and economic superiority in the region for the foreseeable future, said: ''But don't you believe the Russians want to run the world? Who knows, if we don't show our strength maybe one day they'll be in a position to do it.'' The officials conceded that was a limp reason for stepping up raids into Lesotho, Mozambique and Angola. They do not deny that the South African Army remains in control of a large part of southern Angola, coming and going as it pleases despite the public claim of withdrawal. Zimbabwe is grievously hurt by repeated attacks on storage tanks at the Mozambique port of Beira containing oil destined for its use, and on the oil pipeline from those tanks. South Africa denies responsibility but does not deny that it supports and helps arm Mozambican rebels who plant the explosives. South Africa has offered alternate supplies, but on condition that Zimbabwe negotiate a contract at cabinet level. That would make Zimbabwe more dependent on South Africa; Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, feels it would imply recognition of Pretoria's regime and his own failure to make a multiracial society work. Added up, the overt and covert South African military action and the absence of a credible South African explanation of strategic aims make the neighboring states' analysis look right. The result is that the impact of South Africa's domestic dilemma is spreading to engulf its neighbors. This is the opposite of what the Reagan Administration's policy of ''constructive engagement,'' smiling to wheedle reform instead of glowering at South Africa, was intended to achieve. It engages the U.S. in a broadening, increasingly destructive conflict. My column last Friday contained a transmission error. The third paragraph from the end should have begun, ''The absence of open hostility is surprising, and no one can explain it.''

643-> HOMELESS GET PLACE TO SLEEP ATOP NOB HILL
Fifty-four homeless people, waiting for their new shelter to open, lined up outside Grace Cathedral in the Nob Hill district, where imposing mansions were built from Gold Rush fortunes. ''At least you're not likely to get jumped in this neighborhood,'' said Jessie Marcel, who was planning to stay at the cathedral's shelter for four days. ''Here they've even got a security guard on the door.'' Grace Cathedral is the first Episcopal church in San Francisco to open its doors to the homeless. The cathedral, an imposing Gothic structure built in 1910, shares Nob Hill with the Fairmont Hotel and the Pacific Union Club. The shelter was opened in the cathedral's gift shop area Jan. 1, two months after Mayor Dianne Feinstein began a campaign to provide shelter for the homeless in San Francisco. Although it is not the oldest Episcopal church in the city, Grace Cathedral is the most prestigious. The congregation includes some of the city's wealthiest corporate leaders; Caspar W. Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, was treasurer of the diocese. David Gillespie, the dean of Grace Cathedral, said the shelter was ''an important symbol that a church situated in the middle of opulence can still reach out and help the poor.'' The Rev. Bill Barcus, who set up the cathedral's shelter program, said that despite the exclusiveness of the neighborhood, the church had received no complaints about the lines of homeless. ''On the contrary, the neighbors are bringing us warm blankets and sweaters,'' Father Barcus said. ''They're mostly from Brooks Brothers.'' Funds for the program, which costs $10,000 a month, come from a special city emergency fund.

The loan consists of 1.5 billion S.D.R.'s under a 15-month standby arrangment and the remainder under the agency's compensatory financing facility. The I.M.F. said that, as a condition of the loan, Argentina had agreed to reduce its budget deficit from more than 14 percent of gross domestic product in 1982 to 8 percent in 1983 and 5 percent in 1984.

A 16-year-old girl was shot to death Saturday night in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn by one of two men who had become embroiled in an argument with her father. Prior to the argument, the men refused the father's pleas for assistance in freeing the family's stalled car. The girl, Victoria Senquez of New Britain, Conn., was killed in front of 350 Keap Street, where the car was stalled in the snow, said Detective Michael McCann of the 90th Precinct. The family was on the way to visit relatives. The girl's father, Carlos Senquez, 40, of Port Chester, N.Y., asked for aid from two passers-by. The police described them as Hispanic men in their early 20's. When the men refused, an argument ensued and the suspects departed, returning several minutes later with guns. ''According to the family, four shots were fired,'' Detective McCann said. A bullet passed through Miss Senquez's left arm and then entered her chest. She was dead when Detective McCann arrived at 10:15 P.M. When the shooting occurred, the victim was standing alongside the car with her brother, Steven, 14, also of New Britain, and a cousin, Margarita Martinez, 18. The police are searching for witnesses.

650-> Money Belts
To the Editor: Although many people use money belts to protect valuables when traveling abroad, I use a vest instead. Many years ago while traveling in Afghanistan, I had a vest made with inside pockets just large enough for my passport, health card, currency and traveler's checks. These inside pockets each have zippers. On the outside I had open pockets made large enough to stuff maps and train schedules and guidebooks. The vest is an attractive piece of clothing, provides some padding when you are carrying your stuff in a pack, and is much more comfortable than a money belt, especially in warm weather. Besides, no money belt I have ever seen has enough room for all the valuables one needs to protect. CHUCK LUDLAM, Washington

651-> E.P.A. Aide Was Told To Resign, Report Says
Anne M. Gorsuch, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, summoned her top aide, Rita M. Lavelle, to her office late Friday and angrily ordered her to resign, agency sources said tonight. The sources said Mrs. Gorsuch was upset over a memorandum in which Miss Lavelle criticized the competence of the agency's general counsel, Robert Perry, and its enforcement counsel, Michael A. Brown, in the handling of toxic waste cases. In a statement late Friday, the E.P.A. announced that Miss Lavelle, assistant administrator in charge of the agency's toxic waste cleanup program, had resigned and planned to return to California, having accomplished what she had set out to do. But the sources disclosed that Miss Lavelle returned from a meeting on Capitol Hill late Friday, was called into Mrs. Gorsuch's office and ''found out she had resigned.'' Miss Lavelle's name has come up frequently in investigations by two House subcommittees. Allegations have been made that she perjured herself in sworn testimony about her handling of an outspoken agency critic and for what her critics said was a conflict of interest in her role in the handling of a California waste dump.

652-> Hotel Memo
To the Editor: In her ''Memo To Hotel Managers'' (Travel, July 10), Enid Nemy suggests that women travelers are simply tired of being treated as second-class citizens and they want no more than what men take for granted: ''What we want at the front desk and in the dining room is the same treatment as men, no more and no less.'' I think they want a lot more. One woman wants a small dressing table with a mirror and stool, another would like the mirrors relocated: ''When the mirror is over the washbasin, you have to lean over three feet to see yourself and particularly if you're nearsighted, it's impossible.'' One woman complains that hotels have inadequate lighting for proper application of make-up. Another is afraid of long, winding corridors and wonders why more rooms can't be placed by the elevators. Almost everybody complained that closet hangers can't be removed. Never mind that hangers are permanently attached so they can't be stolen: ''At the rates today, such things should be built into the prices of the room,'' chirped one interviewee. Ladies, ladies! You want equality? What you want is a sorority house. C. RICHARD WILLIAMS, New York

653-> BRIEFING
Money's Warm Glow T hose who raise funds are themselves one of the great hidden assets of modern Presidential politics. Although their names are largely unknown to the public, those with the persistence and contacts to keep $1,000-per-person contributions rolling in, right up to convention time, are among the most highly-prized acquisitions that a candidate can boast. There is, accordingly, a warm glow emanating from Mondale headquarters just now because the former Vice President has signed up Marvin S. Rosen, a Miami lawyer, for a major role in financing the Minnesotan's drive for the 1984 Democratic nomination. The frosting on the Mondale cake is that Mr. Rosen is best known for his fundraising efforts in behalf of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, in both his 1980 Presidential primary campaign and his Senate re-election effort last year. The 42-year-old Mr. Rosen, one of three vice chairmen for finance of the Democratic National Committee, was Florida chairman of Senator Kennedy's challenge to President Carter in 1980. Confirming reports of his decision, he said he had received no detailed assignment as yet but hoped ''to be helpful at whatever they want me to do.'' Photographers' Complaint W ashington is one of the most widely photographed cities in the world, but the Government doesn't make it any easier for professional practitioners to stem the tidal waves of camera-carrying tourists that regularly flood the monuments and parks. At the Lincoln Memorial, amateur photographers swarm the premises at will, yet the Park Service requires press photographers to obtain a permit to shoot in and around the building. Pleas for equal treatment have thus far gone unheeded. On the Hill, Capitol police still enforce an ancient ordinance requiring written permission to use a tripod on the grounds. It goes back to the time when there were so many itinerant tintype artists in the area that they were a nuisance. Current application tends to force latter-day professionals to use hand-held cameras for the night shots that require longer exposure. Refund Suggestion T he University of Maryland Terrapins are probably the Washington area's most closely followed local college football team, so it was perhaps inevitable that their promotion would become intertwined with government. With each Maryland income tax refund being mailed out these days, the authorities are enclosing an application form for tickets to the university's 1983 gridiron season that is still eight months away. Obviously the state officials are trying to intercept found money as early as possible and re-invest it in a serious cause, something the government-conscious residents of the Maryland suburbs can surely appreciate. Pass the Pasta I n his 14 years as a Senator, Alan Cranston has rarely been known to devote excessive concern to his personal appearance. But now that he is an announced Democratic Presidential candidate, image has become a matter of real political consequence. Senate colleagues report that the lean and bony Mr. Cranston, an avid runner, has gone on a reverse diet, happily ladling in cream soups, pasta and gooey deserts at both luncheon and dinner, determined to give himself a more rounded and presumably more pleasing mien. With a similar goal in mind, a longtime Cranston adviser has proposed that the candidate grow a beard, which would not only soften his facial contours but theoretically distract voters from the sparsity of hair at the other end of his head. A New Young in Town A ndrew J. Young Jr., who left Congress in 1977 for the United Nations and became Mayor of Atlanta in 1981, has a new listening post on Capitol Hill. His oldest daughter, Andrea, is joining the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, as a legislative assistant. She was graduated from Swarthmore College in 1976 and Georgetown Law School in 1979 and has worked for her father's international consulting firm. Senator Kennedy is not unaccustomed to dealing with mayors' daughters. His mother, Rose, is the daughter of John F. (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Mayor of Boston. Consider the Zucchini O ut of the endless babble of Washington conversation, there occasionally surfaces a fascinating bit that has no connection with diplomatic intrigue or political maneuver. Joseph C. Goulden, the author, reports overhearing the following exchange between two welldressed young women near Dupont Circle the other day: First: ''What I can't handle about Sue is how she uses reality as a crutch.'' Second: ''Yes, but you've go to admit she did wonders with the zucchini last summer.'' Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr.

654-> Concealing the Boss's Pay
Full disclosure was the heart of the New Deal legislation that established regulation of securities and their markets. Let the markets rise and fall, but let no pertinent information be hidden from the investor. It has proved its worth over 50 years, yet this concept would now be whittled down by a proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The precise subject is executive pay - the salaries and bonuses of ranking officers that publicly held companies must report to stockholders and in other filings with the S.E.C. The commission would keep this basic rule but would void much of its value by relaxing the form for reporting non-cash compensations, like stock options, ''golden parachutes'' and extra apartments. Putting a cash value on non-cash items can be burdensome, confusing and not very important, the commission says. It would accept narrative descriptions without dollar figures and drop some information altogether. Burdensome, maybe, and confusing, certainly, as the rules are now written. But not, therefore, dispensable. Privacy, not efficiency, seems to be the motive for changing this rule. Some executives thrive on having everyone know how much they earn; most, like the rest of us, are skittish about it. Large salaries are privately gratifying but publicly embar-rassing, all the more so as publications compile those yearly lists of who's paid the most. Managers are also edgy about revealing top salary scales because comparisons can create pressure for raises or expose companies to personnel raids. But all that is a necessary byproduct of fair public dealing, a small price for the protections that corporate managers enjoy. Some executives aim to break that bargain by concealing salary supplements they've arranged for themselves, and the S.E.C. proposal would help them. If anything, the rules could stand tightening. As now reported, some non-cash compensation is beyond deciphering even by experts. Rendering these figures in comprehensible subtotals might add paperwork, but it would also add to the investing public's knowledge and confidence. The S.E.C. has been energetic if not always wise about deregulation. On disclosure issues, its record is mixed. New rules require more disclosure of corporate officers' and directors' dealings with members of their families. But they permit less disclosure of personal dealings with customers, suppliers and law firms. Now comes the proposal to shed less light on executive compensation. Deregulation is supposed to create freer markets. When it curbs information, it has precisely the opposite effect.

655-> LAWYER CONFIDENTIALITY V. DISCLOSING CRIMES-TO-BE; News Analysis
The American Bar Association's meeting here this week sent a clear message: It is more important for lawyers to preserve confidential relationships with their clients than to prevent themselves from being used as shields for ongoing crime and fraud. The A.B.A.'s 383-member House of Delegates carried this theme to the point of voting to prohibit lawyers from disclosing their clients' illegal plans even when silence could implicate the lawyers in civil or criminal liability as accomplices. That was a move in the opposite direction from what was sought by the leaders of a special commission that spent nearly six years developing a proposed model code of legal ethics. The commission's defeat was, to some extent, a victory on a breadand-butter issue for small-town, small-firm and lone practitioners. They feared that the proposed rules might subject them to legal liability for their clients' illegal activities, and they saw a threat to their livelihoods, to their ways of doing business and to the adversary system of justice itself. The commission, on the other hand, was dominated by lawyers from large, prestigious firms, such as Robert J. Kutak, who headed it from 1977 until his death last month, and professors from top law schools, such as Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr. of Yale. Moral Standards a Concern They thought their mission was to raise the moral standards of a profession in which single-minded pursuit of clients' objectives too often crowds out concern for truthfulness and the public interest. The commission's most significant proposals were designed to prevent the traditional confidentiality between lawyer and client from being used as a shield for fraud. These proposals would have encouraged lawyers to reveal clients' secrets, as a last resort, if necessary to prevent serious frauds or to rectify frauds in which the lawyers' services had been used. But these proposals were buried under a landslide of amendments in two days of voting. Some members and supporters of the commission seemed drained and depressed after watching their most significant proposals being dismantled for two days. One such supporter was Dean Norman J. Redlich of New York University Law School, who said in an interview here that the voting represented ''a major step backward,'' not only from what the Kutak Commission proposed, but from the existing state of ethical standards and the law. ''The practice of law, if done by sensitive people, creates financial risks and moral dilemmas,'' Dean Redlich said. ''These votes reflect a strong desire to eliminate those moral dilemmas by self-imposed rules that narrow or eliminate the choices a lawyer has.'' Courts' Approval Needed At its meeting in Atlanta in the summer, the A.B.A. is expected to adopt the amended rules as its model code of legal ethics. It would have no binding effect unless adopted by state courts as the basis for disciplining lawyers. There was general agreement among the delegates that when a client comes to a lawyer and confesses a completed crime or fraud, the lawyer should keep the confession in confidence and try to help the client avoid or minimize any punishment or liability. The dispute was about what the lawyer should do when he learns that his client is planning to commit new crimes or frauds, or that the client has lied to the lawyer and used his services in a past crime. The tenor of the meeting here was probably best represented by the delegates' 188-to-127 vote to adopt one amendment, despite a warning by Robert W. Meserve, Mr. Kutak's successor, that it ''lets the client conscript the lawyer into supporting the client's misrepresentation and makes the lawyer an accessory to fraud.'' The issue was whether, as the Kutak Commission proposed, lawyers should be ethically obliged to disclose clients' secrets to others when ''necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client.'' The amendment, offered by the American College of Trial Lawyers, turned the proposed rule upside down: Instead of being required to disclose the client's secrets in such a case, the lawyer would be ethically prohibited from doing so. One supporter of the amendment, Justice William H. Erickson of the Colorado Supreme Court, said that nearly absolute confidentiality between lawyer and client, even in such a case, was essential for ''the protection of the adversary system.'' He and his allies said clients would not give lawyers the information needed to represent them adequately unless they could be confident the information would be held inviolate. Other supporters of the amendment said a rule requiring lawyers to keep their lips sealed was needed to insulate them from liability for failing to blow the whistle on clients' frauds. Difficult Dilemma for Lawyer But if it was adopted as a binding ethical rule by state disciplinary bodies, the amendment would create a difficult dilemma for a lawyer who learns his services have been used in a fraud that is continuing. If he alerts the authorities to stop the fraud, the lawyer would risk disbarment or other professional discipline for violating the ethics code. If he keeps silent and lets the fraud continue, he would risk being held liable in a lawsuit to pay damages to the victims. The amendments adopted this week recognize only three narrow exceptions to the confidentiality requirement. A lawyer would be required to disclose client secrets if necessary to correct false or perjured evidence he has introduced in court, to prevent an ''imminent'' crime of violence, or to establish a defense or a claim in litigation, for example, in suing a client for nonpayment of a fee. But a lawyer would be ethically prohibited from blowing the whistle if the client was using his services, say, to defraud investors of millions of dollars, to loot a corporation, or to cheat someone of his life savings. Justice Erickson said such situations present ''a different picture entirely'' from cases involving use of false evidence in court, because ''candor to the tribunal,'' which he said outweighed confidentiality, is not involved in out-of-court frauds. He and other proponents of a sweeping confidentiality said lawyers could avoid entanglement in illegal schemes by persuading their clients to obey the law or by resigning if the clients refuse. But representatives of the commission pointed to cases in which such steps had failed. Most often mentioned was the $215 million fraud by O.P.M. Leasing Services Inc. in New York. The corporation's lawyers quietly resigned after learning in 1980 that it had used their services to swindle lenders of more than $100 million. Their silence enabled O.P.M. to hire other lawyers and steal millions more. Professor Hazard said in an interview after this week's ethics debate that he hoped a compromise, tempering the prohibitions on whistle-blowing, could be worked out before final action at this summer's convention. The code also covers dozens of other issues, such as advertising by lawyers and conflicts of interest. He said he was astonished to learn in private talks this week that some critics of the commission's proposals on confidentiality might not be as hostile to its objectives as the heat of the debate and the language of their amendments suggested. But barring some new, unexpected reversal, what started as an effort by Mr. Hazard, Mr. Kutak and others to encourage lawyers to be more truthful about their clients seems likely to end by producing the opposite result.

656-> Deadly Poisons, Lifeless Enforcement
The search for dioxin dumped in Missouri provides a specific drama. Beneath it, a Congressional report now demonstrates, lies a generalized tragedy: laws intended to prevent such environmental disasters are in many places poorly enforced, leaving the public largely unprotected. The report arises from hearings held through last April by a House subcommittee on energy and commerce. It explored the shortcomings of an interagency force organized to pursue illegal dumpers of hazardous waste in New Jersey and heard testimony on alleged involvement of organized crime in the dumping business. The subcommittee also probed months of apparent foot-dragging at the Environmental Protection Agency. The report found ''disregard or indifference by top agency officials regarding their enforcement responsibilities.'' Federal and New Jersey officials, stung by such conclusions, own up to past problems but complain that the subcommittee overlooked recent improvements. The E.P.A. acknowledges that it changed its policy from confronting violators to seeking ''voluntary compliance,'' but adds that its Administrator, Anne Gorsuch, has lately emphasized the need for strong enforcement. The agency also points proudly to a new investigative unit that pursues criminal cases. But these steps hardly answer the committee's complaint about inadequate enforcement. E.P.A.'s vaunted new unit employs only 25 investigators to pursue illegal dumpers across the nation. The dumpers are known to be professional and ruthless and are suspected of mob connections, yet the new Federal agents have no authority to carry weapons or make arrests. A strong Federal commitment is crucial. Few states can afford adequate enforcement efforts on their own, and dumpers often cross state lines to release their dioxins and PCB's. The House report calls for closer Federal monitoring of state enforcement, stiffer Federal dumping laws, weapons and arrest power for the E.P.A. investigators and, perhaps most important, a role for the F.B.I. in initiating toxic waste investigations. A special F.B.I. investigation of illegal dumping, similar to those aimed at corruption in Congress and waterfront racketeering, could be a powerful deterrent. That point is hardly lost on the producers of toxic waste. As the report points out by quoting a published editorial: ''In a highly competitive industry, companies cannot afford to spend their resources on environmental protection, however well conceived the rules, unless they perceive that those rules are backed up by credible enforcement policy,'' The editorial was from an authoritative industry publication, Chemical Week.

657-> AROUND THE NATION; School Strike Leaders Accept Third-Party Plan
Leaders of blue-collar workers striking the Philadelphia school district accepted a contract proposal presented by two City Council members tonight at a meeting that was boycotted by school officials. Anthony Ottobre, president of Local 1201 of the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers, said he accepted a contract proposed by the City Council president, Joseph Coleman, and Councilman David Cohen, who helped avoid a strike by railway workers a week ago. Neither side would reveal the terms of the agreement or comment about the next step in the process. Before the meeting began, school officials said they refused to attend the meeting because the issue now belongs in the court of Common Pleas Judge Stanley Greenberg, who has ordered the strikers to return to work. The officials said Judge Greenberg had set a hearing for Monday morning, but the union and a state mediator, Charles McCloskey, said they had not been notified. About 4,000 bus drivers, custodians and maintenance workers struck Feb. 2, but classes have continued.

658-> Civil Liberties And Waiter's Research
A July 3 story (''A Fire, an Inquiry and a Waiter's Research for a Thesis'') carried remarks attibuted to me that may have appeared to disparage the case of Mario Brujaha, a Stony Brook graduate student. Mr. Brujaha is asserting a scholar's privilege to protect from a Nassau County grand jury notes that the District Attorney believes may be helpful in an investigation of suspected arson at a restaurant where Mr. Brujaha worked as a waiter in the course of his study of restaurant sociology. No disparagement was intended, and the New York Civil Liberties Union's decision not to represent Mr. Brujaha should in no way be viewed as a judgment on the merits of his case. The American Civil Liberties Union remains supportive of the principle expressed in longstanding policy that scholars should be entitled to the same privilege of confidentiality afforded to reporters, except in very narrowly limited situations. We have every hope that the Nassau District Attorney will be amenable to a reasonable compromise in Mr. Brujaha's case to meet his serious concerns about the confidentiality of his research material.

659-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; United Satellite Racing Competitors
Francesco Galesi, a real estate developer in New York, does not think it at all unusual that he has entered the business of satellite television. ''First of all,'' he said, ''satellites and so forth are just real estate in the sky. Obviously, communications are the wave of the future.'' Mr. Galesi, 52 years old, is behind a daring move to start up the first satellite-to-home TV business, and he stands to beat such competitors as the Communications Satellite Corporation, or Comsat, and CBS Inc. into the sky. Last week his venture, known as United Satellite Television and now to be called United Satellite Communications Inc., vastly increased its strength when the Prudential Insurance Company of America agreed to invest $45 million, one of the largest Prudential investments in a start-up company. Another investor is the General Instrument Corporation, which is in for $9 million. General Instrument will make the antenna dishes to receive the TV signal at homes, apartments, hospitals and the like. Subscribers can lease or buy the receivers. United Satellite plans to start broadcasting this fall from a Canadian satellite and to switch to a medium-powered satellite scheduled for launching next year by the GTE Corporation. Comsat and CBS operations, which plan to use higher-power satellites, will not be ready for several years. ''I was able to move a little more decisively because I am an independent rather than a large corporation,'' Mr. Franceso said. ''This is free enterprise. We are taking risks and the market will judge whether we were right or Comsat was right.'' The company has plans to go public eventually, he said. Mr. Galesi does not believe satellite-to-home TV will replace cable. But there are still some 30 million homes not wired for cable and some areas where cable is uneconomical. ''That's where we come in,'' he said. Mr. Galesi has another company, Argo Communications, that will offer long-distance telephone service via satellite. The more earthly ventures of the Galesi Group, of which he is chairman, include ownership of industrial parks and shopping centers in the Northeast, a resort in Vermont, oil development and manufacturing. Mr. Galesi, whose father was in real estate, grew up in Montclair, N.J., and went to Princeton. ''One gets bored with doing the same things over and over,'' he said of the real estate deals. The new technology ''has my complete interest now,'' he said.

660-> BURGER PROPOSES NEW PANEL TO CUT HIGH COURT'S LOAD
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger today asked Congress to create a court with judges temporarily borrowed from other Federal courts as an experiment in easing the Supreme Court's workload. The new panel would decide issues on which any two of the 13 United States Courts of Appeals reached conflicting decisions, eliminating the need for the Supreme Court to resolve the conflicts. Conflicting decisions among the Federal appeals courts provide the single biggest source of cases that the Supreme Court decides every year. While the Court is not required to accept such cases, it feels obliged to do so in many cases to avoid different meanings in different parts of the country for a Federal law or a constitutional provision. Caseload a Major Problem The new court, which would operate as a five-year experiment, was proposed by the Chief Justice in his annual speech on the state of the judiciary, which he delivered this afternoon to the American Bar Association's winter convention here. For years, Chief Justice Burger has encouraged proposals for a new national appeals court, without unequivocally endorsing any specific approach. This was the first time that he proposed a new court. The Chief Justice called the Supreme Court's rising caseload ''perhaps the most important single, immediate problem facing the judiciary.'' It is a theme he has sounded often in the past. At the bar association's winter convention 12 years ago, he warned that ''we cannot keep up with the volume of work and maintain a quality historically expected from the Supreme Court.'' Bar Group Asked to Lobby The Chief Justice urged the bar association to help him lobby for his proposal. ''My purpose today,'' he told the bar association members, ''is to provoke you and others and to stimulate a vigorous debate and discussion.'' ''It will no longer do,'' the Chief Justice said, ''to say glibly, as some have, that we do not need 'another tier of courts,' or another court, or a change in the structure of appellate procedure at the highest level simply because we have functioned since 1891 with the present structure.'' He continued: ''That is meaningless in terms of the needs of the present and particularly of the next 10 to 20 years and for the 21st century. We can no longer tolerate the vacuous notion that we can get along with the present structure 'because we have always done it that way.' '' Cites Figures on Cases In the last 30 years, the Chief Justice said, the number of cases on the Court's docket more than tripled, from 1,463 to 5,311. In 1953, the Court issued 65 opinions; last term, the figure was 141. ''Only fundamental changes in structure and jurisdiction,'' he said, ''will provide a solution that will maintain the historic posture of the Supreme Court, will insure proper time for reflection, preserve the traditional quality of decisions, and avoid a breakdown of the system - or of some of the Justices.'' He asked Congress to authorize a special commission, with members appointed by each of the three branches of Government, to study long-term solutions. Under his proposal, the new experimental court would get under way in the meantime and would itself be studied by the commission. The Chief Justice said that the new court would remove as many as 50 cases from the Supreme Court's argument calendar, reducing the number of cases the Justices decide each year to about 100. Under the proposal, the new court would be staffed by a pool of judges drawn from each of the Federal circuits. A panel of seven or nine judges would sit for six months or a year and resolve the conflicts that arose among the appeals courts over that time. The panel's decisions could be appealed to the Supreme Court, but presumably the Court would rarely feel obliged to accept the appeals. A special Federal court, the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals, already operates along the lines outlined by the Chief Justice, drawing on a pool of 29 Federal judges to decide disputes involving oil and gas pricing. Possible Approaches Outlined The Chief Justice said the study commission should look at several possible approaches: a national court of appeals along the lines proposed by the Freund and Hruska groups; a new court of appeals to review decisions of state courts on Federal constitutional questions, and the creation of two new national appeals courts, one for civil and one for criminal cases. By designating the proposed court as an experiment of limited duration and jurisdiction that would not involve appointing new judges, he seemed intent on avoiding the criticism that proposals for new appeals courts have drawn over the years. In 1972, a committee of legal scholars headed by Paul Freund of the Harvard Law School proposed a national court of appeals that would serve as a kind of ''gatekeeper'' for the Supreme Court, screening appeals, denying review in most of them and certifying the most important as worthy of further review by the Supreme Court itself. In 1975, a commission headed by Senator Roman Hruska, a Nebraska Republican, took a different approach, proposing a new appellate court not to screen Supreme Court cases but to decide cases referred to it by the Supreme Court. A special Justice Department committee, set up to study the question in the final year of the Ford Administration, reported in 1977 that a national court of appeals should be rejected because no ''clear and compelling'' need had been demonstrated and because a new court would introduce more costs and delay to the judicial process. 'Action Is Needed' Chief Justice Burger took note today of the fitful debate of the past decade. He said he had decided it was time to revive the issue despite the risk that he might be accused of ''crying wolf.'' Several other members of the Court have spoken on the caseload in the last few months. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor became the latest to join the chorus today. She told a gathering of state and local bar association presidents here that ''the statistics make it clear that action is needed once again'' in Congress to ease the Supreme Court's workload. She did not endorse a new appellate court, and she did not refer to the Chief Justice's proposal, presumably because she spoke several hours before he did and did not want to pre-empt him. She said a new study commission should be set up to consider various proposals.

661-> ECONOMIC THEORIES ALLERGIC TO PRACTICE
To the Editor: The Times exerts too much influence upon policymaking thinking in America to leave unexamined the particular theories it employs in counseling economic and fiscal policy. Indications are that you have become prone to assume certain principles as unquestionable, and on this assumption, economic and fiscal policy is offered which becomes progressively irrelevant to the circumstances and requirements of the nation. A particular theory which deserves re-examination is the basic, simplistic notion that the nation's economic tides move in inverse relation to the rate and volume of Federal taxation and in direct relation to the rate and volume of Federal expenditures. There are substantial indications that there is not any direct relationship between these factors, and there are very clear indications that the use of this theory in determining policy will produce outcomes for Federal finances that are incongruous, absonant, extravagant and preposterous. In the early days of enthusiasm for Keynesianism, there was a neat and attractive theory on interest rates. It did not, however, survive very long because human beings and economic forces just did not behave as the theory assumed. The currently popular theory of fiscal policy may well have the same fate as the ''liquidity theory of interest rates.'' There are signs that the rate and volume of taxation and the rate and volume of Federal outlays do not have a direct effect upon the level of investment and consumer spending. Both investors and consumers are influenced to only a very minor degree by such taxation and spending, and the effort to influence investors and consumers by fiscal policy bids fair to produce gross and irrational distortions in budgets and national debt. The financial affairs of this nation deserve more critical examination. R. WARD HARRINGTON, Flushing, N.Y., Jan. 31, 1983

663-> DELAWARE MERGER SUIT IS CURBED
The Delaware Supreme Court has significantly limited the rights of shareholders who dissent to the merger of a subsidiary into its parent company. The new opinion will in most such cases make it impossible for such shareholders to bring a class action to stop the merger, limiting them instead to a financial claim for the fair value of their own stock. ''For lawyers who defend parent-subsidiary mergers, it means less exposure to broad class action suits on behalf of all the shareholders, but greater uncertainty about how much the company will have to pay to those shareholders who persist in opposing the transaction,'' said Leonard Chacen, of the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. ''For lawyers who defend these deals, the decision enhances the importance of giving shareholders procedural safeguards, particularly independent negotiating committees.'' Large Corporations Registered The Delaware decision is important because so many large corporations are registered in that state. The entire Supreme Court participated in the decision. The case involved a minority shareholder challenge to the 1978 merger between UOP Inc., formerly known as the University Oil Products Company, and its majority owner, the Signal Companies. In 1975, Signal bought a controlling interest in UOP under an agreement providing that UOP would sell 1.5 million shares at $21 each if Signal made a successful cash tender offer for 4.3 million publicly held shares at the same price, giving it 5.8 million shares and 50.5 percent ownership. Although its tender offer was greatly oversubscribed, Signal limited its purchases to meet the goal of 50.5 percent ownership. Subsequently, Signal nominated and elected six of UOP's 13 directors. Three years later, Signal decided to acquire the remaining 49.5 percent of UOP stock at $21 a share, a decision that the members of the board that were Signal employees took part in. A report prepared by two of Signal's UOP directors for Signal - but not shared with the outside UOP directors or the minority shareholders - said any price up to $24 would be a good investment. UOP stock at the time was selling for $14.50 a share. Only 2.2 percent of the shareholders voted against the cash merger. Fairness Challenged William B. Weinberger, the minority shareholder who brought the Delaware case, challenged the fairness of the deal, showing evidence that on the date the merger was approved, the shares were worth at least $26 each. In parent-subsidiary mergers, the parent is not usually paying a premium for control, so the question of appraisal value becomes more important, Mr. Chacen said. The Delaware trial court rejected Mr. Weinberger's complaint. On appeal, however, the State Supreme Court said the method used by the trial court to evaluated the shares ''is now clearly outmoded'' and ''shall no longer exclusively control such proceedings.'' ''We believe that a more liberal approach must include proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court,'' the court said, sending the case back to the lower court for further deliberation. Mr. Chacen and other lawyers expect that the adoption of a broader method of valuing shares will have to be clarified in future cases. The Delaware Supreme Court also said that Signal did not fulfill its duty to bargain at arm's length to determine the correct price for the stock. ''When directors ... are on both sides of a transaction, they are required to demonstrate their utmost good faith at the most scrupulous inherent fairness of the bargain,'' said the court. ''The record demonstrates that Signal has not met this obligation.'' Part of the decision, though, was less favorable to shareholders such as Mr. Weinberger. In most cases, the court said, they should be limited to the monetary damages they have incurred, and not be allowed to bring a class action to stop the merger.

664-> Cleanup for College Buildings Used in A-Bomb Work Is Set
The Department of Energy will spend $300,000 to clean up three University of Chicago buildings that have been tainted with radiation since they were used in development of the atomic bomb, but officials say there is no imminent danger to teachers or students. Lea Keller, an Energy Department official at Oak Ridge, Tenn., said Wednesday that annual radiation exposure for anyone in the buildings would be comparable to ''a series of X-rays.'' But he added, ''Innocents should not be exposed unnecessarily to radiation they would not normally be exposed to in a normal working environment.'' The granite, Gothic-style buildings on the South Side campus, now housing chemistry and mathematics classrooms, were used in the Manhattan project in the 1940's. They will remain in use while the walls and floors are scrubbed with special detergents and some contaminated portions are scrapped or removed.

665-> AS FORCED EXIT EASES, AFRICA MALAISE LINGERS
A great exodus of Ghanaians and others from Nigeria has all but ended and its conclusion, as its beginning, has no joys. At the border crossing here with Togo, the last of the international barriers the Ghanaians have had to cross, tempers flared readily in the heat between those returning and those who received them under an archway that proclaims, ''Welcome to Ghana.'' The police made off with loaves of bread donated for those fleeing Nigeria after its decision announced Jan. 17 to expel foreign workers. And on the sandy Atlantic waterfront of Aflao, a great migration was ending in sad disputes and anger at trivial things. A Ghanaian, for instance, arrived in Aflao, after crossing two countries and running the gauntlets of shakedowns and hostilities, uprooted from an adopted home in Nigeria. The police searched his laden automobile and found a few notes of undeclared currency. An argument began that, inevitably, would lead to an enforced transfer of the remnants of his savings. Five Ghanaians, who were detected trying to smuggle themselves back across the border in a truck, were ordered back to Ghana by a plainclothes Togolese official who lashed at them with a length of cord, shouting ''Go back to Ghana! Go back to Ghana!'' The jubilation of the first returnees who crossed here a week ago when Ghana reopened its border to them is gone. ''They came as if they were conquering heroes,'' a Ghanaian journalist said resentfully. ''But they have conquered nothing and now they will have to learn some realities.'' Capt. Samuel Ashiagbor, the Ghanaian official in charge of the frontier post, told a reporter that between 500,000 and 800,000 Ghanaians had returned home through this untidy settlement, where the half-built and abandoned ramparts of a new customs house provide a monument to the thwarted aspirations of a nation that once promoted itself as Africa's great hope. The official figure added a further unverifiable statistic to those that have been formulated in efforts to define the magnitude of the migration. The count ranges from 400,000 to 900,000 - the biggest in black-ruled Africa's recent history but not, evidently, in line with Nigeria's initial assertion that 2 million Ghanaians would join the enforced migration. Hostility Toward Outsiders Nigeria, gripped with an economic cluded people from Benin, Togo, Cameroon and other countries apart from Ghana, ostensibly because they were illegal immigrants. The figures may indicate that some have stayed on. But that is not certain, for Nigerians are hostile toward the outsiders. Another conclusion is that many have crossed back into Ghana, as they did into Nigeria in the years of its oil boom, without the knowledge of the authorities. There were economic and political considerations behind the Nigerian decision, and there are similar consequences to be drawn from its results. ''I had a secondary school certificate,'' said Kingsley Oduro, a Ghanaian on his way home, ''but there was no work for me in Ghana, so I went to Nigeria and worked on a construction site. What point was there in going to secondary school if the only work I could do was that. But there were no other choices.'' A Corruption of the Legacy Others asserted that they had skills and crafts that could be utilized in rebuilding Ghana's broken economy. But there they are caught in the same dilemma as Mr. Oduro. At its independence from Britain in 1957, Ghana boasted resources not only from gold but also in people. Its foreign exchange reserves were high and its educational system was regarded as the best in colonial Africa. Its graduates were more numerous than those of any other African country. But successive civilian and military governments corrupted the legacy so that the aspirations born of education far outstripped the economy's ability to redeem them. Many Ghanaians, professional people like doctors, lawyers and teachers, left - as did the artisans like Mr. Oduro. Their departure twisted the downward economic spiral a little further so that a new paradox is created: Their skills could in theory be reharnessed, but the economy is so depressed, in part because of their initial departure, and its input is so scarce that it does not have the potential to absorb them. 'There Are Just No Jobs' Some Ghanaians think the young men now coming back should work the land, but that is hard to envisage among those who left Ghana and its miseries, in some cases, precisely because they did not want to be farmers and craved the life of cities like Lagos, the Nigerian capital. The economic story is the same in other countries whose nationals sought to slice themselves a share of Nigeria's now-eroded oil wealth. ''There are just no jobs in my country,'' said a servant from Benin who left Nigeria. ''We will have to go to some other country where there is work.'' The issue thus goes beyond the immediate relief effort to prevent the returnees from overtaxing the already strained food supplies and medical services of Ghana to a malaise that has seized much of Africa. The economic slide has resulted from domestic mismanagement and the impact of the recession in industrialized economies on those whom history has made their satellites. The stakes were the highest in Nigeria and so too have been the losses. At the height of its oil wealth, Nigeria absorbed its neighbors' unemployment and suffered the impact of it. Now it is re-exporting greater problems. The Government of Flight Lieut. Jerry J. Rawlings has concentrated its reaction to the influx by seeking to insure that the returnees are dispersed as rapidly as possible to distant regions and do not form a volatile mass in Accra itself. The suggestion among Western diplomats is that the sudden swelling of Ghana's 12 million population is one more challenge to an embattled regime. Flight Lieutenant Rawlings clearly feels threatened by perceived enemies so that, at nighttime, armored cars mounted with heavy machine guns take up positions in downtown Accra and approaches to the city are guarded by military and police road blocks. Verbal opposition to his regime among some Ghanaians, a Western diplomat said, is close to ''seditious.''

666-> LIBEL CASE DIVIDES AN APPEALS COURT
A divided Federal appeals court here has sent a libel suit against two syndicated columnists back for possible trial, holding that purported expressions of opinion might be libelous if they contained false statements or suggestions of fact. The decision could be of concern to other columnists, commentators and editorial writers, who have enjoyed considerable protection under Supreme Court rulings that expressions of opinion are immune from libel suits. It could be a concern as well to those who publish their writings. Chief Judge Spottswood W. Robinson 3d of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia asserted that ''hybrid statements'' that ''both intimate the existence of specific facts and convey the author's ultimate judgment or interpretation of those facts'' are absolutely privileged as opinions only when ''accompanied by a full and accurate narration of the material background facts.'' But because neither of the other judges on the three-member panel joined in his opinion, the importance of Judge Robinson's effort to specify the circumstances in which statements mixing fact with opinion could be subject to libel liability is limited. Column Was About Professor In the lawsuit, Bertell Ollman, a Marxist professor of political science, said he had been libeled by what he called false statements and innuendoes in a May 4, 1978, column by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. Mr. Ollman, who was being considered to head the University of Maryland's Department of Politics and Government at the time, said the column had cost him that job, and he sued. The column said Mr. Ollman was ''widely viewed in his profession as political activist'' rather than being respected by other political scientists as a scholar. This, Judge Robinson said in a 33- page opinion, could ''impugn his reputation severely,'' and he said the column's failure to mention a 1978 published survey of 317 political scientists ranking Mr. Ollman 10th in the field in prestige could be deemed by a jury as ''a culpable omission or error in the background facts presented to the reader.'' The column also said Mr. Ollman had conceded in his writings that he was bent on using the classroom for purposes of indoctrinating students to become Marxist revolutionaries. It quoted portions of his writings while omitting other parts that Judge Robinson said did not support the column's characterization. Judge Cites Omissions Judge Robinson said that portion of the article raised ''a genuine issue whether the absolute privilege for opinion has been forfeited by culpable omissions or errors in the supporting facts which the article offered its readers.'' While the two other judges agreed with Judge Robinson in reversing the decision of Federal District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., who dismissed the lawsuit before trial on the ground that the column was an expression of opinion, they agreed on little else. Judge Patricia M. Wald said she believed the statements in question were ''factual statements, not opinion,'' and were thus ''subject to challenge as libelous.'' But she rejected what she called the ''intriguing'' creation of a new ''hybrid fact-opinion classification'' by Judge Robinson of the appeals court. ''Specifically,'' Judge Wald said, ''I am concerned that courts not have to decide whether the author has backed a hybrid statement with a 'full and accurate account of the material background facts'; that sounds too much like an exercise of editorial judgment.'' Reader Assumptions Raised Judge George E. MacKinnon said that ''in my judgment the article, considered as a whole, is privileged opinion,'' and thus immune from libel liability. He stressed that ''newspaper readers are likely to assume that articles appearing on the Op-Ed page, especially nationally syndicated editorial comments,'' are intended as expressions of opinion. In any further proceedings, Mr. Evans and Mr. Novak could still raise the defenses that any factual statements or suggestions in the column were true, and that in any event they had not been negligent. If the courts were to determine that Mr. Ollman is a ''public figure,'' he would have to prove that statements in the column had been intentional or reckless falsehoods. The Supreme Court said in a 1974 decision that ''under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea,'' and that therefore opinions, even pernicious opinions, were privileged from libel suits. Only false statements or innuendoes of fact can be libelous. But the Supreme Court has never spelled out how to distinguish for libel purposes a protected expression of opinion from a statement of fact. In seeking to fill this gap, Judge Robinson of the appeals court drew a line between statements of '' 'pure' opinion,'' which he said are ''incapable of being adjudged 'true' or 'false' in any objective sense of those terms,'' and ''hybrid statements,'' which he said ''are remarks which most people would regard as capable of denomination as 'true' or 'false,' depending upon what the background facts are revealed to be.'' ''If the author culpably fails to provide the requisite background,'' he said, ''then the hybrid should be held to forfeit all claim to absolute privilege and be afforded only that quantum of protection accorded a purely factual misstatement in the circumstances.''

667-> BRIDGE; A WINNING SPONSOR
The past two decades have seen two major changes in the two most prestigious events in the annual tournament calendar, the Vanderbilt Knockout and the Spingold Knockout. Both changes were decidedly in evidence in last month's Spingold in New Orleans. Teams may consist of four, five or six players. It used to be virtually automatic for top-ranked teams to have six players as they do in international events. When a Canadian quartet won back-to-back Spingolds in 1964 and 1965, it was regarded as an astonishing feat of stamina, but now such efforts are not infrequent. The last 16 teams surviving in the New Orleans Spingold included eight groups playing four-handed. Five of these advanced to the last eight, two to the semi-final stage, but none to the final. Playing with four means furious concentration for more than eight hours a day, so fatigue becomes a factor; and if one player becomes sick, the team is in trouble. But it has some advantages: There are none of the problems that arise in selecting the line-up for a given session, and none of the players have to sit around in nail-biting anxiety. The other development is the increase in sponsors, wealthy enthusiasts with ability, who hire a team of four or five professionals. (Rarely three, for that would force the sponsor to play 100 percent of the deals rather than the legal minimum of 50 percent.) In New Orleans eight of the original top 16 teams in the seedings, and four of the quarterfinalists, were in this category. The only woman sponsor in this select group, and the only woman player in the quarter-final stage, was Luella Slaner of Scarsdale, New York. She and her teammates had astonished the cognoscenti in Niagara Falls last year wih their performance in the Vanderbilt. On that occasion, and again in New Orleans, they reached the final before being defeated, a remarkable achievement. Th diagramed deal enabled the Slaner team to reach the quarter- final last month. Mrs. Slaner held the North cards, playing with Brian Glubok, an outstanding young New York expert. Most modern experts would treat South's reverse bid of two hearts as forcing, and consider that it showed perhaps 18 high-card points. But playing, as North-South were doing, an old-fashioned free-wheeling style, the non-forcing reverse became a possibility. North might well have bid three no- trump at her second turn, but she delicately steered the contract into her partner's hand, allowing him to demonstrate his superior skill in dummy-play. The routine play for South at the first trick was the ten from dummy, but this would have led to quick defeat. Glubok did much better by playing low. With the actual distribution this proved immediately advantageous by forcing the jack, but in some other positions it would have given East a chance to err. As it was, East won with the jack and returned the suit. He should have shifted to a heart. South played low and West won with the king. If he had played a third round of spades, he would have made South's task easy, but he defended well by shifting to the heart ten. South won with the king, and could not attempt to establish a spade trick in the dummy for fear of a heart play by East. Instead Glubok ran four club tricks and reached this tricky ending: NORTH S Q 10 H 8 5 D 2 C 10 WEST S 9 H A J D Q J 4 C - EAST S A 3 H 3 D 9 7 3 C - SOUTH S - H Q 9 7 D A K 10 C - On the lead of the last club from dummy, East threw a diamond and South a heart. West was now in deep trouble. If he had thrown a diamond, South would have had his ninth trick in that suit; and throwing the heart jack would have allowed South to lead that suit, establishing a vital trick. So West reluctantly parted with his remaining spade, and the defensive communications were cut. Reading the position accurately, Glubok played three rounds of diamonds. West had to win, and the heart queen in the closed hand scored the last trick to make the game. In the replay the South player made the normal cautious rebid of two diamonds, ending the auction. He scored 130, and the Slaner team gained 10 international match points. If three no- trump had failed, the Slaner team would eventually have lost the match by just two points. NORTH S Q 10 7 6 H 8 5 4 D 2 C A K J 10 5 WEST S K 9 8 5 H A J 10 6 D Q J 4 C 8 3 EAST S A J 3 2 H 3 2 D 9 7 3 C 9 7 6 4 SOUTH(D) S 4 H K Q 9 7 D A K 10 8 6 5 C Q 2 Both sides were vulnerable.

668-> CHINESE FIND WAYS TO BEAT BUREAUCRACY
A British diplomat newly arrived in Peking went to the hospital for the physical examination needed to obtain a Chinese driver's license. All went well until the diplomat put on his glasses to complete the eye examination. The doctor pointed out that the diplomat's photo on his British driver's license showed no glasses. How could he be issued a Chinese license that didn't match his British one? Together they pondered the impasse. Then the doctor proposed, ''You may drive in China, but you must never wear your glasses.'' Such is the ''banfa,'' a key to circumnavigating China's formidable bureaucratism. In Chinese, ''banfa'' means a way or means, usually out of a problem, but this trivializes it. A Chinese writer, asked for a better definition, ventured that ''to have a 'banfa' means to have resourcefulness.'' Consider, for example, a ''banfa'' of nationwide proportion. Deng Xiaoping, the man who runs China, has tried to get overage officials to step down in favor of younger, better educated talent. At first, Mr. Deng was not successful. No Formal Retirement Age China sets no formal retirement age for its party and Government functionaries. Those who retire give up not only their posts but also perquisites from comfortable apartments to chauffered cars and, not least, the ''guanxi'' or pull, that finagled higher education or good jobs for their children. Under Mr. Deng's ''banfa,'' old officials who retire may now keep their salaries and fringe benefits. They also become eligible for extra pensions and retain their right to read official documents and sit in on meetings. They even get certificates of honor. Such concessions cost plenty, but Mr. Deng's ''banfa'' may be working. Over 470,000 veteran officials, one-sixth of those who held posts before the Communist takeover 34 years ago, have retired. Most of the rest are presumably thinking it over. The ''banfa'' is an antidote to a system choked with petty, conflicting and secret regulations. One ministry alone reportedly issued 1,000 new laws last year. In the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the Government stopped keeping track. As a result, said Wang Jiafu, an expert on civil law, ''many regulations and decrees are not known to the people.'' Legalistic Nitpicking Ordinary Chinese must live with legalistic nitpicking. A translator in Peking heard that his wife was coming on vacation from her job in Shanghai. Couples are not infrequently assigned to different parts of the country. But he could not rent a hotel room for their reunion because his residence permit listed him as living in a dormitory. His employer arranged a ''banfa'' that sent him on temporary assignment to Shanghai to see his wife. A Chinese who wants to change jobs needs the permission of his old ''danwei,'' or work unit, to join a new one. But his unit may not let him go for fear that he will embarrass it by doing better in his new job. One broadcasting station employee was refused permission to quit. But neither could he go on working after having appeared disloyal to his organization. The outcome is that he now stays home and goes to the office only to collect his monthly salary. Some foreign expatriates need ''banfa'' too. An American student at Peking University was moving to a better room, but she could not get the new key until she had handed in her old one; she couldn't give up the old key before she moved her things out. An intricate solution was worked out that let her retain the old key temporarily while she got the new one. To be sure, some ''banfas'' border on the inane. Some weeks ago, three fire engines were lined up outside the entrance to one of the residential areas set aside for foreigners living in Peking. The Government does not let Chinese into the compounds without permission, so the fireman, who were responding to a fire, had to wait until the armed sentry at the gate telephoned for clearance. By then, the fire fortunately had burned itself out. One nervous European diplomat inquired later about how to get a fire engine into the foreigners-only compound in case of fire. A Chinese official explained that the ''banfa'' was quite simple. After reporting a fire in his apartment, the foreigner should walk out to the gate and invite the fire crew in as his guests. If he vouched for the firemen's character, there should be no problem. Some Sinister Turns In another case, an American teaching English at Peking's Iron and Steel Institute applied to bring his fiancee to China to get married. The authorities at the institute were reluctant because he had been seen earlier in the company of a young Englishwoman and therefore might already be married. As a ''banfa,'' they had him sign a statement saying that if he had ever been married before, he would have gotten a divorce. But some ''banfas'' can turn sinister. Another young American working as a polisher of English-language articles at the New China News Agency visited Tibet with his wife last spring after getting the necessary travel permit from the police in neighboring Xinjiang. Since few foreigners are allowed into Tibet, his superiors decided that someone in the agency must have provided him with a letter to arrange his trip. His denial of any such letter was ignored. For a week, the couple were refused an exit permit to leave China until they signed a statement acknowledging the existence of the fictitious letter. When they reached the border, there was an added twist. The security police boarded their train and confiscated a year's worth of undeveloped color film. As the American told it later, they explained that ''normally foreign friends don't visit Tibet and we have to see what you photographed to make sure you didn't take any pictures of anything you shouldn't have.''

669-> UNLIKELY PRETENDER TO HAGLER'S THRONE
year-old former hod carrier with no great love for boxing but an admiration for fighters with ''character,'' has been preparing to take the world middleweight title from Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Tony Sibson, in his blue-collar fantasies, would rather be the lead guitar player in his own band than the middleweight champion of the world. But the guitar he has owned for six years sits quietly in his Leicestershire home while he keeps working toward his Feb. 11 appointment with Hagler. ''This is fate, I believe in fate,'' said Sibson as he put on a sweat suit near one of the gas heaters in the cold gymnasium. ''I never dreamed I'd be British champion or Commonwealth champion or European champion.'' A skylight is all that remains of the glass playhouse where Sibson, who began boxing professionally on his 18th birthday to supplement his weekly $54 paycheck, works out for his $525,000 payday with Hagler in Worcester, Mass. The gymnasium, complete with shower, steam bath and sauna, was rebuilt as a one-story brick house behind the pub by Ken Squires, a local construction foreman from this Leicestershire village who also trains Sibson. The fighter says Syston, a lazy Leicester suburb with a population of 8,175, is ''too built up.'' He said he prefers his own nearby village of Queniborough here in the midlands. ''It's more rural,'' he said. Sibson, with a 47-3-1 record the top-ranked World Boxing Council middleweight and thus a mandatory challenger for Hagler, gave up Christmas and New Year's Day to be in what Squires has named the ''Queen Vic'' gym. He has not always been so conscientious, mainly, he said, because he did not take boxing seriously. He has won 14 straight since his last loss, a 15-round decision to Kevin Finnegan, who once gave Hagler trouble, for the British title. Sibson ''trained'' for that 1979 fight by spending seven weeks camping in Spain. Boxing was merely a profitable part-time occupation then. After leaving school, he worked for a year in a Leicester slaughterhouse, then went to work as a hod carrier, lugging bricks around for 30 pounds a week. He began boxing at the age of 11, taken to a youth club by his father, a laborer, to learn discipline. By 18, he realized that one fight, for about 200 (now a little more than $320), ''was worth a month's paychecks.'' He boxed as often as possible, sometimes twice in a week. ''There's a rule here that says you can't fight twice in six days so once I had to wait until after midnight for a fight,'' he said. He is a sturdy, aggressive fighter, much in the style of Vito Antuofermo, the former world champion and Hagler nemesis. ''I can box, but I like moving forward, because then I'm really fighting,'' said Sibson. Sibson said he does not like the business of boxing, but he admires fighters, especially the ones who keep trying even when beaten. Oscar Bonavena, he said, was a favorite. ''I like Mustafa Hamsho, too,'' he said. ''That fight with Hagler, the way he kept moving forward. I like Hagler. he's a lovely fighter to watch. But Hamsho showed me a lot of character. That's what boxing is about.'' Unlike Antuofermo, Sibson can punch, especially with his left hook. He is a natural left-hander who turned himself around to an orthodox stance. Whether he has Antuofermo's chin is the main question, because Sibson, not the quickest fighter, is likely to be hit often by Hagler. He has been stopped once, in 1978, in the first round by Lotte Mwale, who later was ranked twice as the No. 1 lightheavyweight. ''I got set up for that fight,'' said Sibson, who said he believed that Mwale was the man the local promoters in Leicester wanted to win. ''They conned me. They told me to get him and take him right out. I went after him and got nailed. But it wasn't like I got banged up.'' In his current winning streak, Sibson has stopped Alan Minter, the Englishman from whom Hagler took the title in 1980, and outpointed Dwight Davison, a former No. 1 contender. The Minter victory especially pleased him. Hagler had stopped Minter on cuts in three rounds a year earlier. But Minter remained on his feet against Hagler. Sibson not only knocked him unconscious in three rounds, he broke his nose. ''See this nick,'' said Sibson, pointing to a minute mark on the bridge of his nose. ''It's the only one I've gotten in boxing and Minter gave it to me when I was his sparring partner.'' This will be only Sibson's second fight outside England. His only other foreign appearance was in June 1981, when he successfully defended his European title against Andoni Amana of Spain in Bilbao. ''The fight was in a bull ring and my changing room was the stable where they kept the horses and bulls,'' said Sibson. ''It was a little dodgy. I wasn't sure I was going to get a fair deal. But I won the decision and at the end, the whole crowd was my friend. I expect it will be like that in Worcester.''

670-> CATERPILLAR GREETS U.S. MOVE; SEES LITTLE IMMEDIATE EFFECT
A spokesman for the Caterpillar Tractor Company welcomed the Commerce Department's announcement today that it was lifting special licensing requirements for the sale to the Soviet Union of heavy equipment for laying oil and gas pipelines. But he said the action would not greatly relieve the financial troubles of Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill. ''It's an important step along the way to put Caterpillar back in a competitive position for Soviet business,'' Stephen E. Newhouse, the spokesman, said. The company, which he said was the only American manufacturer and exporter of pipelaying tractors and related heavy equipment, has lost much of the Soviet market for such equipment to its main competitor, the Komatsu Company of Japan, since President Carter restricted the sale of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union in 1978. President Reagan imposed a much more sweeping ban on the sale of pipeline-related equipment in December 1981 to express disapproval of the imposition of martial law in Poland. The Reagan sanctions were lifted in November, but the licensing requirement imposed by President Carter remained in force until today. The lifting of the licensing requirement ''eventually should mean sales for Caterpillar and jobs for American workers,'' Mr. Newhouse said. He noted, however, that sales to the Soviet Union were only $50 million to $100 million a year, or about 1 percent of the company's revenues, before the restrictions were imposed. The Commerce Department approved licenses for 200 pipelayers in January, but the Soviet Union was reluctant to buy from Caterpillar as long as each new sale was subject to licensing. ''While those kinds of controls are in force, the Soviets don't regard us as reliable suppliers,'' Mr. Newhouse said, asserting that it could take months to obtain the licenses. Caterpillar lost $180 million in 1982, its first loss in 50 years, and $264 million in the first half of this year. The pipelaying machines, which are tractors with special hoists that place oil and gas pipes in trenches, can cost up to half a million dollars each, including spare parts. Two prominent Republicans, Representative Robert H. Michel, the minority leader, whose district includes Peoria, and Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, have sought the lifting of the export restrictions. (Senator Percy welcomed the decision to lift the restrictions, saying that ''in the case of the pipeline embargo, we are not at all impressing our own adversaries, the Soviet Union, by kicking ourselves and our allies in the shins,'' United Press International reported. Mr. Percy added, ''Pipelayers are freely available from non-U.S. sources, have no military use and do not incorporate high technology.'' Those in favor of maintaining the restrictions include Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, and other conservatives in Congress who take a hard line against trade with the Soviet Union.

672-> BIG NAME ON WALL STREET MOVES ACROSS THE TABLE
WHEN Maryann N. Keller was offered a job analyzing the automobile industry, she did not even know that the DeSoto had long been pulled from the market or that the Bentley was a car for the very rich. She took the job anyway. Mrs. Keller, it seems, has always had confidence in her ability to swim to the top. So much so, in fact, that she recently abdicated her post as Wall Street's premier auto analyst for a different type of job at a little- known money management firm paying her half as much. The move surprised many on Wall Street, given Mrs. Keller's status and salary at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Inc., where she analyzed the automobile industry and its stocks, making buy and sell recommendations to clients in hopes of winning orders and commissions for the investment house. Her recommendations could move a stock's price sharply, and for the past four years, she was rated the No. 1 auto analyst in Institutional Investor magazine's widely watched ranking of brokerage firm analysts. The articulate Mrs. Keller was also a favorite of the television talk shows and was frequently quoted by major newspapers in their articles on the auto industry. For her skill in generating business as well as publicity, Paine Webber paid her more than $250,000 a year. Rival Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. was said to have tried to woo her away for $400,000. But the 39-year-old Mrs. Keller opted instead to step out of the limelight to roll the dice at money management, which puts her across the table from the analysts who recommend which stocks to buy. Instead, she now decides, with her colleagues, which stocks to buy and sell for the pension funds, endowments and personal accounts under their management. She began her new job in mid-June at Vilas-Fischer Associates, a six- year-old firm with eight professionals managing $900 million. Many such firms, eagerly seeking new customers, would thrive on the attention that Mrs. Keller brought by accepting the job offer, but ''I'm not sure they really like all this publicity,'' she said in an interview at her new firm's offices in the World Trade Center. ''They always prided themselves on being one of Wall Street's little mysterious companies.'' Mrs. Keller, too, is a bit of an anomaly on Wall Street. She shuns the dark business suits favored by both sexes for bright-colored dresses. She can also be quite chipper in a world dominated by grim-faced executives. Her former colleagues at Paine Webber, however, said her mood could darken, too, when the pace picked up. Her confidence shows most clearly when she talks about her career. She said she expects to become a partner in Vilas-Fischer quickly and see her salary recover to its previous level. ''Don't worry about me,'' she said. THE daughter of a factory worker and a nurse, Mrs. Keller grew up in Perth Amboy, N.J., and graduated from Rutgers in 1966 with a degree in chemistry. After brief stops at a consulting firm and a German chemical company, she became a $9,000-a-year business analyst and market researcher at the Celanese Corporation, a chemicals and fibers company. But she was ambitious. When she saw herself ''perpetually getting $1,000-a-year raises'' and wanted to profit more from her own efforts rather than those of a group, she turned to Wall Street. In 1970, she joined the corporate finance department of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. But finding a clubby atmosphere that seemed to demand the Ivy League credentials she lacked, she deemed it ''a very bad fit'' and after seven months returned to Celanese. By 1972, Mrs. Keller said, she had survived two staff cutbacks at Celanese and did not want to see if her luck would hold out. Undaunted by her previous Wall Street experience but aware that she needed to be more selective, she decided research was suited to her ability to piece together many small facts into a big picture. Kidder, Peabody & Company, as it happened, was hiring analysts, although the chemical industry slot was taken. So she accepted a $17,000- a-year job analyzing consumer durables. It quickly narrowed to autos. For the next eight years at Kidder Peabody, then three at Paine Webber, Mrs. Keller traveled extensively, in Europe and Asia as well as in the United States. She came in early, dragged home shopping bags of reading material at night and became a prolific writer of reports. To the dismay of the domestic auto makers, she was a sharp critic of the industry and warned that it would face hard times. But even the domestic companies concede privately that she was among the first to look at the industry with a global eye and was especially insightful in analyzing Japan's headlong entry into the United States market. ''Her global perspective is probably the best in the business,'' said the investor relations manager at one of the three major domestic auto makers. ''She always had a big-picture perspective,'' agreed William H. Pike, a portfolio manager at the Fidelity Group, the Boston-based money management firm. It was that ability to focus on industry trends instead of detailed numbers, as well as her pleasant personality, that made Mrs. Keller popular with morning television audiences. Steve Friedman, executive producer of NBC-TV's ''Today'' program, said he invited her to be a guest frequently ''because she talks English, she knows her stuff, she talks in short sentences, and she's right. What else do you want?'' When it comes to the nitty-gritty of picking stocks, Mrs. Keller gets mixed reviews. In a typical comment, Philip A. Cannistraro, a vice president and portfolio manager at the Bankers Trust Company, said: ''I think she was very good at understanding the mechanics of the industry, and I think her stock-picking ability was O.K. It wasn't great.'' Many of the money managers Mrs. Keller advised recall one big win and one big loss: She recommended the purchase of Subaru of America Inc., which imports and distributes Japanese-made Subarus, and that stock climbed sharply; however, she did not recommend the purchase of Chrysler Corporation stock, and last year it, too, jumped. ''I think the experience with Chrysler has tended to distort perceptions as to who are stock pickers and who are not,'' said Mrs. Keller, who lives in Pound Ridge, N.Y., with her husband of 15 years, Arthur, an attorney with a major New York bank. She said she did not recommend buying Chrysler because it had a fragile balance sheet. She also argued that it profited, in part, because of slip-ups by General Motors and Ford, and still thinks Chrysler has hurdles to overcome in marshaling enough money to design and manufacture new models. In fact, Mrs. Keller, who drives a B.M.W., is only mildly bullish about any of the three major auto makers' stocks. ''I still think you can own G.M. or Ford, and if you're a speculator, buy it,'' she said, adding that Chrysler stock seems to be ''getting real jitters lately.'' ''You buy them to sell them,'' she said. ''You don't hold onto them to put your grandchildren through college.'' Mrs. Keller continues to follow the auto industry in her new post, though not auto parts. She will also market advice on auto stocks through Freimark Blair & Company, a New York brokerage firm that plans to sell consultations with her to its clients. SHE is eager to move into other basic industries, such as chemicals, and look at some international stocks. ''Being in just autos gives you a very narrow perspective on the world,'' she said. ''You become more and more limited in the process. Eventually you find your curiosity is stifled by it. You tend to respond, 'That's the way it was in '76.' You sort of take this attitude, 'I've seen it all before.' ''The value added by the analyst is somewhat lower in the auto industry than it is in industries where there isn't so much knowledge,'' she added, citing technology-related fields as an example. ''Realistically, people can follow the auto industry by following the sales figures that are printed every 10 days.'' Paine Webber tried to accommodate Mrs. Keller's desire to branch out, making her director of international research last January and giving her money to hire a staff. She intended to look at Japanese stocks, but still found herself dissatisfied. ''As I got into it, I realized the staggering hurdles for a non-Japanese speaking individual,'' she said. ''Five years from now, all you'd have is a big budget.'' So far, she likes her new work. She is responsible for six accounts and has made presentations to prospective clients. She said she has already picked three stocks, which she would not name, and they have ''held their own'' despite recent drops in the stock market. One is a foreign stock, she said. ''This is an experience every analyst should have,'' she said. Her complaint, aside from the volume of what she finds to be unreadable analysts' reports, is that many brokerage firm analysts focus on today's bad earnings instead of tomorrow's possible profits, and miss stock upturns. And those upturns are precisely what Mrs. Keller must now find. ''It's a much more frightening experience when you're actually making the decision where to put peoples' money to work,'' she said. ''It will be your feet held in the fire.''

More than 300 nurses will walk off their jobs at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn this morning unless an agreement is reached on a new contract, the nurses' union said yesterday. A spokesman for the union, the New York State Nurses Association, said negotiations began at 2 P.M. yesterday. Hospital officials, meanwhile, have instituted emergency measures to keep the hospital open. The center, at East 49th Street and Rutland Road in the Crown Heights section, cares for 351 short-term and 539 long-term residents. The union spokesman, Karen Maune, said the key issue was money. She said the nurses' starting salaries were $1,800 less than those at nearby institutions.

676-> THE CITY; 'Terror' Attack Brings Long Term
A 25-year-old Bronx man who the judge said showed ''no significant remorse'' for his crime has been sentenced to 15 to 45 years in prison for robbing a couple and raping the woman at a midtown Manhattan hotel last summer. The defendant, David Zaire, was sentenced Tuesday by Justice Kenneth Shorter of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Mr. Zaire was convicted last month of rape, sodomy, robbery and weapons possession in the attack last July 28 at the Seton Hotel, at 144 East 40th Street. The prosecutor, Stephen Saracco, an assistant district attorney, had urged a stiff sentence. He told the judge that the victims had experienced ''absolute terror'' during the attack. The judge sentenced Mr. Zaire separately for each of the six counts and ordered that the sentences be served concurrently for a term of 15 to 45 years.

677-> WIL PERONIST PARTY DEAL A WILD CARD IN ELECTION?
-- A long-running political cliffhanger starring former President Isabel Martinez de Peron may come to a denouement this week. The drama, which Argentines have been following with alarm, hope or simple relish, concerns whether Mrs. Peron will return from her exile in Spain to back a Peronist presidential candidate - or perhaps to run herself. The ruling military has promised national elections in October. The Peronist Party, the country's largest, has scheduled its nominating convention to begin Saturday, so Mrs. Peron is expected to make a decision by then. A telex message from a lawyer who said he represented the reclusive exile informed party leaders she would return Friday. The message was revealed yesterday but without direct confirmation from her. The uncertainty thus continued. Ten weeks of provincial primaries to select delegates to the convention ended last weekend. Party leaders, trying to divine her intentions while weighing their own strengths, appear to have settled on former Senator Italo A. Luder as the presidential candidate in a series of backroom deals that may turn the convention into a formality. But Mrs. Peron could easily upset these plans. ''She's the wild card in Argentina's future,'' said a Western diplomat. As the last wife and political heir of the party's founder, Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, Mrs. Peron commands tremendous sentimental and symbolic power, particularly among working class Argentines. So did his first wife, the now legendary Eva, who died in 1952. The general, a demagogic populist, first came to power in 1946 and was deposed nine years later. He made a comeback in 1973 but died in office in 1974 and was succeeded by Isabel, his Vice President. She was overthrown in a 1976 military coup, and was held prisoner for five years before being allowed to go to Spain two years ago. Mrs. Peron, 53 years old, was a chorus line dancer when she met General Peron in 1955. Even Peronists admit her presidency was a disaster, marked by runaway inflation and gun battles between political extremists in the streets. The coup was a popular one, but public opinion is fickle. As the military has avowed its own failures, her shortcomings have been forgotten or forgiven by many Argentines. Mrs. Peron is said to feel she was bitterly betrayed. Since arriving in Spain, she has rejected old friends, replaced her personal entourage and refused to respond directly to the many entreaties from party leaders competing for her support. Indeed, in a plot twist, one of the few Argentine political figures she has met with was Admiral Emilio Massera, a member of the junta that overthrew her. The retired admiral treated her kindly in captivity and secretly courted her support two months ago in his own bid for the presidency. Mrs. Peron, a longtime admirer of the admiral, is said to have seriously considered giving it, but did not because the move would provoke certain revolt in the party. Speculation is also rife here about the role of another military man, this one an exiled Croatian colonel, Milo de Bogetich, who has become her bodyguard and spokesman in dealing with Peronist leaders. A former Yugoslav partisan fighter who advised Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in the 1950's, his fending for the widow has so frustrated powerful Peronist labor leaders like Lorenzo Miguel, head of the metalworkers union, that they have taken to referring to him in public, with some disdain, as just ''the Croat.'' Behind this concern is the memory of an earlier adviser to Mrs. Peron, Jose Lopez Rega, a soothsayer who became her Social Welfare Minister. From that post, he directed a secret right-wing terrorist group before fleeing in 1976 with millions of Government dollars. Many Argentines are concluding that her silence means that Mrs. Peron does not want to return to the turmoil of Argentine politics. Adding to that view is her recent purchase of a villa on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. But two weeks ago it was disclosed that a house had been prepared for her in Asuncion, Paraguay, where she would stop on her way back to Buenos Aires. The Government of President Reynaldo B. Bignone has said that Mrs. Peron is in fact legally ineligible to run for office or hold a party position because of a Supreme Court ruling last year upholding her conviction on a felony. She was convicted of depositing $740,000 of charity funds into a personal account. The legal issue is not seen as much an obstacle, however, as the Government is weak and the Peronists could probably obtain a pardon. The Multiparty, a forum of five of the country's largest parties, including the Peronists, last week demanded restitution of her political rights. The Peronists themselves, however, have not really forced the issue. The reason, according to Peronist insiders, is that most party leaders, aware of her weaknesses, do not want her to run. Their hope is that she will content herself with becoming president of the party, a largely titular position. The issue, however, has threatened to divide the Peronists. A loyalist minority faction has demanded that all campaigning stop until she returns to take over. ''With Isabel in hand, who needs candidates,'' Juan Labake, a leader of the faction, said. Main line party leaders fear being accused of treason to Mrs. Peron and so step carefully, accusing the loyalists of trying to gain power by using her. Mr. Deolindo F. Bittel, the presumed nominee for Vice President, said last week, perhaps with a touch of cynicism, that ''in spite of everything, we have to be respectful of the law.''

678-> Violette Verdy Named Boston Ballet Director
Violette Verdy has been named artistic director of the Boston Ballet. E. Virginia Williams, who founded the company in 1963, brought the French ballerina to Boston in September 1980 to help her direct the company. Miss Williams will continue with the company as an artistic adviser. ''Since Miss Verdy's arrival in Boston, Miss Williams and Miss Verdy have been working together for the artistic continuity of the Boston Ballet, and they feel that this is the time to make a change in titles,'' Joseph T. McCullen Jr., chairman of the Boston Ballet board, said. Miss Verdy is a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet and was a director of the Paris Opera Ballet. The Boston Ballet will perform a program of new ballets by Miss Verdy and Bruce Wells, the company's resident choreographer, from April 27 to May 8 at the Colonial Theater in Boston.

679-> UPSTATE ENGINEERING CAMPUS KEEPS CLOSE TRACK OF SHUTTLE
''No apology necessary, General. That's the way things go. Do the best you can down there.'' That philosophical advice was conveyed by phone to Lieut. Gen. J.A. Abrahamson, in Houston directing efforts to counter difficulties with the space shuttle's communication satellite, by George M. Low, once a top official of the space agency and now president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. And the tone of Mr. Low's comment reflects the level of intense interest that can exist at a predominantly engineering and technical school in the current space activities of the American astronauts. Manned flight began with the hot-air balloons of the French bothers Montgolfier in 1783, and General Abrahamson had been invited to participate in a ''day of celebration'' helping to mark the 200th anniversary. He called to apologize for having to abort his plans to be present. An astronaut who was a crewman on the previous shuttle mission, Col. Robert F. Overmyer, filled in for General Abrahamson. Took Charge After Accident Mr. Low himself could draw on first-hand experience in reminding the general that problems are part of the game in space flight. It was he who, in 1967, took over management of the Apollo lunar spacecraft program after three astronauts were killed in a fire in a simulated launching at Cape Canaveral. His work in overseeing corrective measures culminated in the first manned landing on the moon in 1969, after which he became deputy director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington. The current troubles with the Challenger's satellite, if anything, seem to have intensified the attention on the Rensselaer campus to the progress of the shuttle mission. This, Mr. Low says, no doubt has a lot to do with the fact that most of the students here ''grew up with their eyes glued to TV when we made the moon landings,'' and were influenced in seeking future careers in technology. On launching day, throngs who were not in class crowded around scattered television screens to watch. Perhaps the apogee of enthusiasm exists among a group of about a dozen students in the classroom of Prof. Heribert Wiedemeier, who, in conjunction with Prof. Robert Doremus, has an experiment aboard Challenger to seek more data on whether crystals grow better in space than on the earth. The results could improve the manufacture of semiconductor material, important in electronics. The university news bureau has duplicated periodic bulletins updating progress being made in trouble-shooting the satellite's difficulties, and the bulletins have been grabbed up by campus strollers. At today's festivities, Colonel Overmyer spoke about President Reagan's recent proposal that American scientists begin research into the development in space of a high-technology defense system against missiles. ''It upsets me,'' he said, ''that Congressmen are making fun of Mr. Reagan's proposal. I think we can do it. Politically, we may not want to do it. But it's technically feasible.''

680-> U.S. EXPANDS CARE OF ATOM VETERANS
The Veterans Administration said today it would start giving free medical treatment to veterans who took part in open-air atomic tests and who had illnesses that might be a result of exposure to radiation. The Pentagon estimates that about 220,000 servicemen participated in 235 atomic tests in Nevada and the Pacific from 1945 to 1962. Until now the Veterans Administration had been willing to treat only those veterans who took part in the tests who were suffering from cancer or thyroid diseases. The agency said the new guidelines would be published soon in the Federal Register. Officials of the Veterans Administration told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee today that the guidelines were being made more liberal ''to allow treatment of all conditions except for those which are known to have causes other than radiation exposure.'' Leukemia Death Rate Higher An official at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta testified its study of 3,027 men who took part in one of the Nevada tests showed their death rate from leukemia was three times higher than what health statistics indicate should have been expected. Dr. Glyn G. Caldwell of the Atlanta agency said nine leukemia deaths were reported in the group while 3.1 would have been expected. Dr. Caldwell said cases of other forms of cancer among the veterans were slightly lower than would normally be expected, 112 as against 117.5. The Veterans Administration began giving free treatment for veterans of the atomic tests who suffered from cancer or thyroid diseases after being compelled to do so by a law passed in 1981. Under the law, a veteran is entitled to medical care at a V.A. hospital if his ailment is service connected, if he is over 65 years old or if he signs a poverty oath. Dr. D. Earl Brown, associate deputy chief medical director of the Veterans Administration, told the Senate panel of the decision to broaden the guidelines. However, he reiterated the agency's longstanding position that cancer is the only disease considered likely to have been caused by radiation at the dose levels experienced by the troops taking part in the atomic tests. Reason for Agency View He explained it this way: ''Although consensus exists in the scientific community as to the adverse health effects of high doses of ionizing radiation, and there is general agreement as to the potential for carcinogenesis at low doses, no consensus exists regarding the causation of other diseases by exposure to low doses.'' Dr. Brown opposed proposed legislation that would require the Veterans Administration to conduct an epidemiological study comparing the health of a group of veterans exposed to radiation with the health of a group that had not been exposed. He said the agency would conduct the study without being required to do so by law if scientific experts decided that such an investigation ''would yield scientifically useful results.'' He also opposed a proposal that would require the Veterans Administration to draw plans for compensating the children of veterans of the atomic tests who were born with genetic or congenital disabilities if scientific studies now under way concluded that the children's health was affected by their fathers' exposure to radiation. ''Public consideration by Congress of methods of providing for redress of genetic or congenital disabilities would lend the unwarranted appearance that a scientific link is soon to be established and quite possibly would increase the anxiety of parents and parents-to-be,'' Dr. Brown said. He said there is no scientific evidence that a child fathered by servicemen exposed to radiation is more likely than any other child to have birth defects.

681-> THE CITY; John Lennon Area In Park Approved
The City Landmarks Preservation Commission yesterday approved plans for landscaping a section of Central Park in memory of John Lennon. The site, near 72d Street and Central Park West, will have sunken paths, new shrubbery and a mosaic with the word ''Imagine'' spelled out in tiles to commemorate the Lennon song. The landscaping will be paid for with a $500,000 gift from Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, according to Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. The area is called Strawberry Fields, after another Lennon song, ''Strawberry Fields Forever.'' In 1981, Mr. Stern, as a City Councilman at Large from Manhattan, sponsored a bill naming the three-acre site.

682-> WHAT'S HOLDING THE UNDERCLASS DOWN?
Just days after Mayor Koch entreated Democrats around the country to pay more attention to the middle class, he and other top city and state officials last week inadvertently rediscovered poverty. It began when Governor Cuomo disclosed that state inspections of two New York City hotels housing displaced families had found ''mind boggling'' conditions. Children, Mr. Cuomo said, were malnourished and living in ''Dickensian'' circumstances, with babies sleeping on floors amidst rats and bugs. The Governor ordered an immediate investigation of the 50 other hotels sheltering homeless city families. Mr. Cuomo's remarks set off a flurry of activity and a round of accusations. Mr. Koch disputed the Governor, saying he doubted that children were malnourished and cautioning that welfare hotels ''are not camps.'' Poverty lawyers and social workers, along with some state officials, called the Mayor callous. Emergency food shipments began arriving at the hotels, as doctors from the New York City Health Department started examining all 7,000 children living temporarily in them. By the end of the week several hundred youngsters had been examined and found to be fundamentally healthy. But while the condition of many children was still in doubt, the conditions under which they live had become quite clear. If the furor initiated by the Governor had done nothing else, it had at least focused attention momentarily on the overlooked underclass Michael Harrington once called the ''other America.'' Government leaders, reporters, photographers and television crews poked through rundown hotels and listened to young mothers describe how roaches sometimes crawled on their children's food at dinner. The descriptions were unfortunately not new - such scenes could undoubtedly be found in private apartments throughout the city - but by focusing on the displaced families, the Governor, the press and the public engaged in an almost ritualistic encounter with the meaner side of urban life. About 2,100 families are housed in hotels by the city. Almost all have been forced from their apartments by fire, eviction or condemnations. Almost all are led by young mothers with several children. Most are black or Hispanic. A number see themselves as victims of racism and a harsh economic system. ''It's not like I didn't have a job; I had a job,'' said Florence Boom, who has been living in the Amboy Street Shelter in Brooklyn with her two children since their Coney Island apartment building burned down in December. Mrs. Boom said she had lost a home-care position and had been unable to get a similar job because employers are reluctant to hire blacks. ''I don't have any other training,'' she said. ''Welfare won't let me go to school because of the children. I depend on the city money. You've got to depend on someone.'' ''I'm afraid for my children,'' said Monica Summers, whose three children - Niesha, 7, Kareen, 12, and Tiffany, 23 months - were examined by doctors at the Amboy Street Shelter. ''We were supposed to move out of here. I want to get a job. I don't want them to grow up to be here too.'' Too often, social workers said, a mother's aspirations are not enough. A mother on welfare is allowed an average of $218 a month to house a family of four in New York City. Apartments are hard to find at that price, so many wait for months in hotels for apartments in low-cost city housing. Hard to find, too, are the training and skills that would lift a young mother out of the web of poverty. ''If you're a poor woman with a bunch of kids, what are you going to do? Pick tomatoes in New Jersey?'' said Herbert Gans, a Columbia University sociologist. Some blamed the poor for their dependency and accused them of abusing the system. ''Their attitude is 'You owe me,' '' said one city health department official. ''We had mothers come in demanding that we give them more money. But unfortunately many who claim they're not getting enough have stereo systems that would put N.B.C. to shame.'' Mayor Koch appeared to be vindicated by the initial medical examinations and, after a 10- minute chat with Mr. Cuomo on Friday, announced they were ''on the same wavelength.'' ''Conditions are not what they might be in these hotels,'' the Mayor said. ''Unfortunately, these hotels are now virtually our only resource for housing such families.'' Mr. Koch tried to place the situation in what he saw as its proper context. In so doing, he was taken to task for what his critics called insensitivity. The Mayor said that ''it takes people to put that smell of urine'' in the hallways of welfare hotels. ''These are adults with children who run their own lives,'' he added. Later, after an unannounced tour of the Martinique Hotel in Manhattan - one of the two singled out by state officials - Mr. Koch told reporters: ''Look, these are third-rate hotels, they're not palaces. But they are comparable to the accommodations these people came from when they were burned out or evicted, and that means they are apartments that the middle class wouldn't live in.'' ''Mayor Koch and City Hall insinuate that these people are there because they want to be,'' Marcella Silverman, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society who represents displaced persons, said in an interview. ''Why would anyone want to live like that?''

683-> BIG WASTE HAULER CLOSES SITE
Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill., announced that it shut down its largest hazardous waste disposal site in Ohio yesterday after discovering that 135,000 gallons of toxic chemicals were improperly stored there. At the same time, Waste Management, which is the world's largest toxic waste disposal company, said it had named an unidentified outside counsel to ''investigate various allegations that have been made'' about its operations. Meanwhile, the Illinois Attorney General, Neil F. Hartigan, filed a $1.1 million civil lawsuit against the company, charging that it had illegally disposed of 400,000 gallons of toxic chemicals at its disposal site in Calumet City, Ill. Mr. Hartigan also charged that the company had ''consciously schemed to withhold'' from the state information about toxic chemicals it was dumping there. Company Cover-Up Is Charged ''This cover-up of illegal activities is a case of utter corporate irresponsibility,'' Mr. Hartigan said. Waste Management officials declined to comment yesterday on the lawsuit, which was filed in Cook County Circuit Court. Also yesterday, an investigator from the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted the company as part of an informal inquiry to determine whether it had violated Federal securities regulations by failing to report expenses it might have to incur to bring its operations into compliance with state and Federal environmental laws. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Waste Management stock was the most actively traded issue, at 2.2 million shares. After a delay in trading until midday, the company's stock opened down 8 3/8 from Friday's close and then closed at 49 1/8, down 10 3/4 from Friday's close. Yesterday's actions by the company and the governmental authorities came after The New York Times reported the accounts of four former employees who said the company was violating environmental laws at four of its toxic waste sites, including the one at Vickery, Ohio, that was shut down yesterday. Waste Management, which cleans the streets in Jidda, Saudia Arabia, picks up garbage in Buenos Aires and is the major hauler of hazardous wastes for the Defense Department, operates about 20 toxic waste sites around the United States. Company Explains Ohio Action Regarding the Vickery shutdown, the company said yesterday that the 135,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil waste was brought to the site two and a half years ago. The company said it ''undertook an immediate investigation upon learning of the contaminated oil last Thursday.'' A former chemist at the Vickery site, Peter Phung, had charged that the company failed to test wastes adequately before disposing of them and that it had accepted PCB-contaminated wastes for which it had no permit. In response to reporters' questions on Thursday, Harold Gershowitz, senior vice president of Waste Management, and J. Steven Bergerson, the company's general counsel, denied Mr. Phung's allegations and called him a disgruntled former employee with an interest in harming the company. Mr. Phung has filed a lawsuit maintaining that he was illegally dismissed by the company in April 1981 because he had continually protested what he thought were illegal dumping practices. The Illinois Attorney General's civil lawsuit pertains to the company's dumping at its largest hazardous waste site, at Calumet City. According to the suit, in 1980 the company disposed of 400,000 gallons of toxic wastes for which it did not have a permit. The wastes contained dichlorobenzidine, DCB, and other chemicals that are suspected carcinogens, the Attorney General's office said. Attorney General Hartigan also charged that the company had ''consciously and by deception and omission'' tried to conceal the disposals by failing to file scores of shipping documents with the state as required by law. Philip C. Parenti, a former Federal prosecutor who is now the chief of the Attorney General's environmental division, said his office's ''star witness'' would be Mahendra Sandesara, a former chemist at the Calumet City site who now works for a competitor of Waste Management. He said Mr. Sandesara's account was supported by other company employees, whom he declined to identify. 'Motive Is the Pocketbook' ''We will seek to impose the full $1 million penalty,'' Mr. Parenti said. ''Substantial monetary fines are the only way to deter this type of violation because the real motive is the pocketbook.'' The company has said that last year it had net income of $106 million on revenues of $965 million. Also named as a defendant in the Illinois lawsuit was Bofors Nobel Inc., a chemical manufacturing company in Grand Rapids, Mich., whose wastes were being disposed of by Waste Management at Calumet City. Mr. Parenti said that as the generator of the wastes, Bofors had an obligation to file one copy of the shipping documents, or manifests, with the State of Illinois but had not done so. The state is seeking a penalty of $440,000 against Bofors.

685-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Generally Higher On Rise in U.S. Rates
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday in foreign exchange trading as United States interest rates edged higher. Gold prices fell. Trading was quiet in Europe, where many foreign exchange centers were closed for the Ascension Day holiday. The dollar had fallen in value earlier this week amid growing expectations that American interest rates would fall, lowering yields on dollar-denominated investments. There has also been continued speculation that the Federal Reserve Board was about to cut its discount rate - the charge on its loans to financial institutions that now stands at 8.5 percent. But some short-term rates rose yesterday, placing some support under the dollar, traders said. The dollar began the day by rising against the Japanese yen in Tokyo, where trading ends before it starts in Europe. The American currency rose to 231.40 yen from 230.95 late Wednesday. Pound Unchanged in London In London, the British pound was traded at $1.5694, unchanged from late Wednesday. But sterling was one of the few currencies that rose against the dollar in trading in the United States, advancing to $1.5684 from $1.5676. London banks were open and quoted these other late dollar rates, compared with Wednesday's figures: 2.4395 West German marks, up from 2.4390; 2.0223 Swiss francs, down from 2.0332; 7.3403 French francs, up from 7.3375; 2.7448 Dutch guilders, up from 2.7445; 1,454.85 Italian lire, up from 1,454.05, and 1.2263 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2256. Here are other dollar rates in late trading in the United States, compared with those on Wednesday: 2.4430 West German marks, up from 2.4362; 7.3440 French francs, up from 7.3325; 2.0255 Swiss francs, up from 2.0230; 231.83 Japanese yen, up from 230.86, and 1.2270 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2257. The price of gold fell in London, to $439.25 an ounce from $443.50 late Wednesday. Zurich markets were closed for the day. In Hong Kong, gold lost $4.50, to finish at $437.50. In New York, gold for May delivery on the Commodity Exchange fell $5.20, to close at $438.70. The Republic National Bank later quoted gold as of 4 P.M. at $438 an ounce, down $5 from Wednesday's late bid.

689-> STRAWBERRY DRAWS ATTENTION
Darryl Strawberry, a 6-foot-6-inch power hitter at the age of 20, spent his first day in a major league training camp today, and said: ''I know I can hit in the big leagues, and I know I can help the Mets.'' However, he conceded, he may open the season in the high minor leagues and not make his debut with the Mets until later this year. But he had no argument with that plan. ''I realize they don't want to put that kind of pressure on me, not at this stage,'' he said. ''So I suppose they'll start me at Tidewater for a while. But I may be in Shea Stadium before the season's out.'' In a camp filled with promising young pitchers, Strawberry became an instant novelty when he arrived in a howling windstorm this morning, one day early. The pitchers and catchers have been working out for a week; the infielders and outfielders start Monday. No.1 in 1980 Draft But the young outfielder from Los Angeles promptly commanded attention as he claimed his locker and his uniform No.18. Management made no particular fuss, but Strawberry's record had preceded him and there was no doubt that a potential star had arrived. He was the No.1 selection in the amateur draft in June 1980, after an outstanding baseball and basketball career at Crenshaw High School. The Mets signed him for $200,000, then he struggled in the Rookie League that summer and in the Carolina League the following summer. But last season, although he struck out 145 times in 435 times at bat, he began to hit the long ones. He batted .283, hit 34 home runs, knocked in 97 runs, stole 45 bases and was voted the most valuable player in the Texas League. At the end of the season, he joined Tidewater in the International League and hit another home run. By then, he had hit more home runs than anybody in the organization except Dave Kingman, who hit 37 for the Mets. ''He's such a good young player,'' Manager George Bamberger said, ''that there's absolutely no point in rushing him. In my mind, I don't think he'll go north with the club. But we expect him to make it before long, and to stay a long time.'' Strawberry, a left-handed hitter who has steady brown eyes and a soft voice, said he had felt no emotional surge as he entered a big league locker room for the first time. He noted that he had spent the winter playing in Caracas, Venezuela, where he hit .302, with 12 home runs in 52 games. ''I took it in stride,'' he said, meaning his arrival. ''I hit against major league pitching this winter, and I know that I can help this team. I weigh 190, and want to gain 15 pounds. But there's no pressure on me to perform. All I want to do is avoid injuries and get my chance.'' He stopped by the locker of George Foster, who has hit 261 home runs, and noticed a stack of letters on the shelf. ''Fan mail from last year,'' Foster explained. Then he called attention to the empty locker next to Strawberry's, and said: ''That's why they gave you an extra locker. The empty one's for all the fan mail you'll get.'' ---- Lynch Is Signed Ed Lynch, who won four games and lost eight last year with a good earned-run average of 3.55, signed a one-year contract. Three players were unsigned: Strawberry, Jeff Bittiger and Mike Howard.

690-> F.C.C. Upholds MCI Award
The Federal Communications Commission has upheld a nearly $1 million damage award that the MCI Communications Corporation won in 1981 against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. MCI will receive only about $89,000 of the award, however, because the agency also concluded that MCI owes a Bell subsidiary, Pacific Telephone and Telegraph, $843,000 to settle overdue bills. MCI said on Wednesday that it was willing to accept those terms; A.T.& T. said it had not decided whether to appeal to the courts. The award stems from the refusal of A.T.& T. to lease MCI certain long-distance phone circuits in 1975, when MCI was trying to start its long-distance network. In December 1981, an F.C.C. administrative law judge, Joseph Chachkin, ruled that A.T.& T. had improperly refused to honor MCI's request for service, and awarded damages totaling $931,880. Bell later appealed.

Jerry Finkelstein, a New York financier, said that he and associates had acquired 90,000 shares of the Chock Full o'Nuts Corporation for $18.25 a share, along with a two- month option to acquire an additional 120,000 shares. The block of 210,000 shares represents about 4.2 percent of the company's outstanding shares. Chock Full o'Nuts had no comment on the latest transaction. Mr. Finkelstein said he could not comment on the purchase until he files the appropriate Government papers, although Wall Street sources said that the transaction signals the beginning of a renewed attempt by the dissident shareholders to gain control of the company. Mr. Finkelstein and his associates are now believed to control more than 20 percent of Chock Full o'Nuts shares.

693-> TREES THAT ONCE SAVED CROPS FALL VICTIM TO FARM ECONOMY
As the nation this week marks the 50th anniversary of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Presidency, some will remember his personal and public interest in conserving the country's natural resources. The preservation and planting of trees were especially close to his heart. Once describing his job, President Roosevelt was said to smile and say, ''I am a tree farmer.'' And he was, starting on his Hyde Park, N.Y. estate where he planted 567,175 trees, and continuing to the dry, almost treeless Great Plains. There, stretching 1,000 miles from North Dakota south to the Texas Panhandle, he ordered more than 222 million trees planted along fields to form ''shelterbelts'' a halfmile long and 10 to 15 rows deep. The project served a dual purpose: It employed those out of work and created natural barriers to shelter crops from hot winds and hold down the soil that choked the Plains with dust storms during the ''Dirty '30's.'' Roosevelt's Prairie States Forestry Project lasted from 1935 to 1942. ''F.D.R.'s trees,'' as some call them, have protected crops and livestock, furnished groves for family excursions, harbored game animals and songbirds. Today, however, many of the shelterbelt trees are being destroyed, even as the inspiration behind the program is being revived by some members of Congress. The House of Representatives last week passed a bill creating an American Conservation Corps, patterned after Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps. The goals of the proposed corps resemble those of its New Deal predecessor - to generate employment by maintaining natural resources. But the bill's outlook in the Senate is uncertain, and for the shelterbelt trees, a new conservation corps may not be the answer. The trees were planted on private land with permission of the owners. So, when the planting program ended as World War II began, there was no Federal agency charged with maintaining the trees or advocating their existence. This is still the case. There are no data on the number of shelterbelt trees being felled. Plains foresters, who work for the state and Federal governments, say tens of millions have been bulldozed or burned, and at an everincreasing pace, as farmland is sold to absentee landlords and agribusiness companies. The reason is mainly economic. Landowners found that they could increase short-term profits by cutting the trees and planting crops. Falling crop prices and the rising cost of mortgage payments and fuel further increased the pressure to deforest the Plains. Technology has played its part in the destruction. Plains farmers increasingly use an irrigation system called centerpivot sprinkling, a huge wheel-borne array of pipes most easily maneuvered around property when trees are not in the way. Many farmers also say new soil management techniques, such as leaving crop residue on the land, have decreased the need for trees as erosion-fighters. Foresters generally say farmers have a point, but insist that shelterbelts are still useful because they increase yields by shielding crops from desiccating southern winds and by retaining soil moisture. Trees can also be the last defense against wind erosion. ''During severe droughts, windbreaks could be the only source of protection,'' said David Erickson, the shelterbelt management specialist for South Dakota's Division of Forestry. ''The continual removal of windbreaks in the Great Plains could have an adverse effect in future years on soil conservation, wildlife and the environment,'' the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, warned in 1975. (The latest figures show erosion at a rate of 3.41 tons an acre.) But many foresters agree the community benefits from the trees while landowners alone pay the upkeep. Thus, shelterbelt proponents are calling for Government incentives and financial aid to spread the burden. A Memorial of Wood, Not Stone One solution, recently proposed and gaining momentum, is to restore and maintain the shelterbelts as a living memorial to President Roosevelt. Sen.Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and Cecil D. Andrus, Secretary of the Interior in the Carter Administration, have joined others in propounding the idea. Congress approved and President Reagan signed a measure last July authorizing a Roosevelt memorial in the capital in West Potomac Park. Plans call for a 27-acre section to include sculptures and a 14-foot-high wall winding past the cherry trees and around the Tidal Basin. The Congressional Budget Office says this monument would cost $31 million to build and $1 million a year to maintain. There is little reason to believe the Reagan Administration will push for an arboreal addition. Rather, those who would protect the Plains trees are hoping that foundations, private donors and state governments together can establish a national shelterbelt project at a relatively small cost, or that Congress will initiate such a program. ''Contrary to what some people inside the Washington Beltway think, not all memorials to Presidents have to be in Washington,'' said Mr. Andrus, who delivered President Carter's rejection of the Potomac plan to Congress in 1979. For Roosevelt, he contended, saving the Great Plains trees would be a testimonial ''more fitting than a monument built in cold stone.''

694-> THE LETTERS OF A WORLD WATCHER
THE LETTERS OF HENRY ADAMS Volume One: 1858-1868. Volume Two: 1868-1885. Volume Three: 1886-1892. Edited by J.C. Levenson, Ernest Samuels, Charles Vandersee and Viola Hopkins Winner. Illustrated. 1,857 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $85; $100 after April 30. HENRY ADAMS is our favorite teacher. He is the fierce and fascinating tyrant of eighth grade who made us learn the facts, the enigmatic professor who made us think about them. He is intimidating, infuriating, sometimes dead wrong -and we are totally loyal to him. We feel the force of his person as well as of his mind. He brings his own books to class, among them his masterpiece, ''The Education of Henry Adams,'' which is one of the most distinguished books ever written by an American. Now, 65 years after his death, this new edition of ''The Letters of Henry Adams,'' supplanting all earlier editions, puts the teacher back in our lives. It is Adams's voice that we hear in the book. The editors have been lavish in the number of letters included and have neither printed letters to Adams nor intruded with notes that are more than spare identifications of people and issues. The letters are arranged chronologically and episodically to form an autobiography. His boyhood with his grandfather, John Quincy Adams, is understandably missing, and so are his days as a student at Harvard; the years after 1892 have been left for future volumes. Much of the rest of his life is in these three volumes: his travel in Europe from 1858 to 1860; his impressions of Washington in the months just prior to the Civil War; his work in England during the war, when he was secretary to his father, Charles Francis Adams, the diplomat charged with keeping Britain from aiding the Confederacy; his experience of the Reconstruction era in Washington; his years as a teacher at Harvard, when he also edited The North Atlantic Review; and finally his return to Washington to watch the world and write. His letters to his wife, Marian Hooper Adams, when she was in Boston in 1885 with her dying father make harrowing reading, since we know that eventually she will commit suicide; but there is no new clue here to that grim mystery. After her death, the letters reveal Henry Adams straining to get back in touch with his correspondents and then escaping on trips to Japan and other distant places. His letters from Samoa and Tahiti in 1890-91 could make a book of anthropology, fascinating in its own right: ''The sensation of seeing extremely fine women, with superb forms, perfectly unconscious of undress, and yet evidently aware of their beauty and dignity, is worth a week's seasickness to experience.'' Adams told John Hay, his friend who was later to be Secretary of State, that ''the effect was that of a dozen Rembrandts intensified into the most glowing beauty of life and motion.'' Even if the reader of the private portions of these letters is tempted to speculate whether Adams was sexually attracted to or active with Elizabeth Cameron, a senator's wife, or for that matter with Charles Gaskell in England or John Hay in Washington, he is not likely to be satisfied. Despite familiarity and frankness, the letters are not intimate. Adams is always too conscious of positioning himself, even as he writes to close friends, to achieve intimacy; yet there is a nicer Henry Adams here than the one we have known before. He is relaxed and affectionate in ways the judgmental and distanced tone of ''The Education of Henry Adams'' did not disclose. In a country house in England in 1861, when he was 23, his 15-year-old sister and 13-year-old brother were homesick: ''We had a large child's party Christmas evening at which I made myself conspicuous. I had no intention of doing so, but I found it was going on very coldly and so I pitched in and laid myself out.'' He was constantly pitching into life. ''You know I'm ambitious,'' he writes in one of his strikingly admonitory letters to his mother, ''I needn't remind you of it; not on my own account, but as a family joint-stock affair. Now papa has got to make himself indispensable; not only in the wild-beast pen, but out of it too.'' The goal is the Adamses' old Washington home, the White House: ''It's all infernal nonsense, you and papa sacrificing yourselves for the good of your country; I tell you, you're doing nothing of the sort, at least if I can help it; you must take just as many honors as you can get and what's more, you must work to get them and be glad that the paths of duty and of ambition combine for you; for most people they lie in contrary directions.'' Henry was invoking an 18th-century Puritan concept of working to prove one's virtue, which in turn would be rewarded by a populace seeking to be well governed. The problem was that these Adamses were smack-dab in the middle of the 19th century. When it came to living in that century, Henry Adams was as much a prisoner of his very rich mother's moneyed aristocracy as of his father's unsurpassable political legacy. From Dresden, on his grand tour, he wrote his mother, ''I had the pleasure of informing Billy Howe the other day that his father's mill had tumbled to pieces.'' The collapse of the Pemberton cotton mill in Lawrence, Mass., killed 88 workers. Howe's response to the news was ''It's always been a rotten concern, that mill,'' and Adams seemed troubled less by the loss of life than by the sensationalism surrounding the incident. He sneered at The New York Herald's talk of ''white slaves''; he could not put himself in the place of the people of Lawrence. Adams was suspicious of disorder and wary of where the energies of nationalism might lead. ''We all ... wish luck to the 'risorgimento,' '' he wrote from Rome in 1860, ''and I would, if I were an Italian, hang tight to the coat-tails of Count Cavour, but that is really no reason why the Pope or King of Naples should allow his people to riot or rebel.'' When demonstrators were fired on, he was reminded of home: ''In the March riot in Boston which began our war of Independence, there was the usual cry of barbarity, as there is now here; there it was much more unreasonable. That hurried the revolution; you may depend that this will check it here.'' Later in ''insurgent'' Palermo, there was that ''armed and howling mob in the square below, and the music of the national hymn, and the five revolutionary cannon'' while Garibaldi, ''very kind and off-hand,'' ate with his captains. The chaplain ''was punishing his dinner. He is a fine fellow, this priest; a slave to Garibaldi and a glorious specimen of the church militant. I've met him several times rushing about the streets with a great black cross in his hands. He has a strange, restless face, all passion and impulse.'' It was, for Adams, a ''perfect'' time in his life; he was ''face to face with one of the great events of our day.'' These splendid accounts of the Italian revolution appeared in The Boston Courier in the form of letters to his brother, Charles. They show that Henry Adams would have made a great journalist, but, ironically, he would have seen such a career as mere observation. He seems to have had similar misgivings about teaching, although clearly he was good at it. He could have written his works of American history as readily in Cambridge as in Washington, but he moved to the capital. If he could not live in the White House, where he thought he belonged, he would have to torment himself by living across the park, keeping a critical eye on all that transpired. He needed to be where he had been taught the great things of the world were done, but when he tried to do them, nothing happened. The first of the very few boring letters in these 1,800 pages are those written when Adams, with striking lack of success, tried to instruct and direct the liberal Republican movement. As a political participant he was impotent. It was by exercising his limitless curiosity that he acted, that he affected his world. IT did not matter that his letters went to but one person each; he had faith that they were written for us. In 1860, when he was reading Edward Gibbon - Adams saw nothing untoward in the author of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' being the chart by which ''I too might come to anchor'' - he wrote to his brother, ''Our house needs a historian in this generation.'' He had found his calling. That December he set out to chronicle the great event of his own time: ''I still would like to think that a century or two hence when everything else about us is forgotten, my letters might still be read and quoted as a memorial ... of the great secession of 1860.'' His letters during the secession crisis form one of the most penetrating analyses we have of the nation moving from politics to combat, and when Adams went to England and was unable to see the Civil War at close hand, America lost a great account of that war. He was nicely candid in both expressing his dislike for the smug English society and confessing satisfaction in being made much of by it, but his regrets that he was missing the war in which his ''warrior'' brother fought are genuine. What we should regret is not the absence of one more Union soldier but that Adams was not in Washington or in the field watching it all, with pencil in hand. In February 1861 Stephen A. Douglas, who was dying, gave a ball. His Maryland wife, ''who is said to be much depressed by the general condition of things, received and looked as usual -handsome - 'Splendidly null' -Poor girl! what the deuce does she look forward to! Her husband is a brute - not to her that I know of - but gross, vulgar, demagogic; a drunkard; ruined as a politician. ... on the whole I'd rather not be Mrs. Douglas. Still, there she stood and shook hands with all her guests, and smiled - and smiled.'' Adams, often sensitive to women's feelings, instantly commands attention with this portrait. If he could give us this before the war began, what might he have done with Congressmen riding out to watch Bull Run, or Lincoln's melancholia, or McClellan's army in Washington and in battle, or Walt Whitman in his hospitals? If we could have had a saga by Henry Adams to match ''Mary Chesnut's Civil War,'' the North might not have lost the literary Civil War. ADAMS was a historian who not only could look at the present but also dared peer into the future. In 1862, at his club in London, he observed men who until recently had been tormenting him with threats of intervention on the side of the Confederacy. He found them ''utterly unconscious of the extent of hatred and the greediness for revenge that they've raised. When the storm does finally burst on them they will have one of their panics and be as astonished as if they'd never heard of anything but brotherly affection between the two nations.'' Next his speculations turned to the United States and to the future: ''Our good country ... is left to a career that is positively unlimited except by the powers of the imagination.'' Finally he looked beyond the problems of nations and nationalism: ''Man has mounted science, and is now run away with. I firmly believe that before many centuries more, science will be the master of man. The engines he will have invented will be beyond his strength to control. Someday science may have the existence of mankind in its power, and the human race commit suicide, by blowing up the world.'' Bad news is more exciting than good, and the contemplation of such a fate did not diminish Adams's energy for life, but it is significant that these meditations are in a letter to a cherished brother rather than in the cold, unconvincing later chapters of ''The Education of Henry Adams,'' where he expounds his apocalyptic scientific theory of history. It was in his letters to Charles and his other great friends, John Hay and Elizabeth Cameron, that one comes to see how essential intense and sane friendship was. Henry Adams was no more certain of how to avoid blowing up the world than anyone else, but he knew that pretending it wouldn't happen, as the men in the club would have chosen to do, would solve nothing. Only in the most relentless look at doom would there be a chance of avoiding it. We can learn, painfully, from our old teacher, and be sustained by him as well.

697-> Making Haste to Make Few Jobs
By common agreement, the first priority of the 98th Congress was to act on the recession. Senators and representatives, Republicans and Democrats, all had favorite bills to invent instant jobs and, beyond that, to attack deep-seated, structural unemployment. To fend off the big spenders, even President Reagan composed a quick plan, quite similar to the Democratic bill he had blocked with a veto threat in the lame-duck session only a month before. And now the President offers a long-term plan, too. All are baking hasty pudding. Barely ten weeks into the session, the House and Senate are completing different jobs bills and a swift compromise between them. They aim for a measure that will provide $4-5 billion for the highsounding purpose of creating jobs and meeting humanitarian needs. But in the process, they've staged a shameless display of parochialism, loading the package with projects and formulas that favor the states and districts of the controlling committee members. This pork-barrel politicking was then topped by the bankers' association's attempt to add an irrelevant amendment that would kill tax withholding on dividends and interest payments. The President has promised a veto, but it shouldn't be necessary. The very idea of saddling a jobs bill with a special favor to banks should embarrass the Senate into rejecting this mischief. At best, the ballyhooed jobs bill will resemble the President's January proposal to accelerate the spending of $4.3 billion already authorized for future years, mostly on public works projects. The Senate and House are usefully adding some funds for health care jobs that employ women. But they cannot agree on whether to earmark funds for states with the highest unemployment; the debate rang with special pleadings - ''where's the money for my state?'' The final cost won't be so much larger than the President's as to make a material difference to the deficit. Nor is it likely to make a material difference in employment. Public works projects deliver a relatively small bang for the buck; they are expensive and slow to develop. Even before this legislation was complete, the White House preempted more high ground by proposing two new permanent measures - a reduced minimum wage for teen-agers' summer jobs and a voucher system of tax credits for employers who hire the long-term unemployed. Both had been broadcast in advance and both suffer the same deficiency. Despite penalties the President proposes for violators, the programs tempt employers to hire a less expensive worker in place of one already employed, for no net jobs gain. All these remedies are full of promises, but not much promise.

698-> VANDALS DESTROYING CROPS AND COWS IN JERSEY
Dairy cows have been randomly shot and killed. A few cattle have been butchered in the field. Trees have been felled. Tractor tires have been slashed. Barns and wheat fields have been burned. Harvesting combines worth $100,000 have been disabled. Irrigation pumps have been shattered with sledgehammers. The vandalism, which goes far beyond mischief, has been striking farms throughout New Jersey, the country's most urbanized state. The state's Agriculture Secretary, Arthur R. Brown, said that unless the havoc can be curbed, it could undermine New Jersey's efforts to retain agriculture in the state, particularly near housing developments. New Jersey officials are uncertain why the destruction is occurring, but farmers say that most of it is done at night and that many of the vandals are teen-agers and young adults. New York, Connecticut and other states, particularly near major population centers, report increases in vandalism, but only New Jersey has reached the point of compiling statistics. Governor Kean has formed the Committee on Trespass and Vandalism in October to propose solutions to the growing problem. Legislation shaped by the committee would increase fines for trespassing to $100 from $20, provide for full restitution for damages plus fines of up to $500, make parents responsible for damages caused by any ''infant under 18,'' and assess points toward loss of license for any person damaging farm property with a motor vehicle. The measures are all before the Legislature. ''Vandalism is more intense in New Jersey than in less urbanized states,'' Secretary Brown said. ''It has been increasing from one end of the state to the other.'' He attributed some of the increase to the advent of four-wheel drive vehicles that give after-dark vandals the power to mow down corn and wheat and crush soybeans and young fruit trees. ''I don't understand why they do it,'' he said. ''I guess it's like a night out on the town.'' Jonathan P. Repair, Rutgers University's Agricultural Extension Service agent for Mercer County, said damage from farm vandalism exceeded $1 million a year in New Jersey. ''There are about 1,000 incidences a year now,'' Mr. Repair said. ''Only 20 percent of the vandals are caught. Only half of those are prosecuted, because the laws are not strict enough to deter people from continuing these unlawful acts, restitution is not required by law and farmers have suffered retaliation if they prosecute.'' Mr. Repair is a member of the Governor's committee, which is headed by Secretary Brown. It also includes Attorney General Irwin I. Kimmelman, State Police Superintendent Clinton L. Pagano, legislators from farm districts in the north, central and southern sections of the state, farmers and others. The wife of Robert A. Winner, a dairy farmer near Moorestown, said that ''our farmer friends in western Pennsylvania are astounded at the extent of vandalism we have; they have only nuisance vandalism.'' Metal and Glass in Feed She said someone had shot and killed one of their $1,500 cows. Six to 10 cows in their herd die every year, Mrs. Winner said, because vandals throw bottles and cans and other trash into their cornfields. When the corn in the fields is chopped up by machines, the glass and metal are chopped with it, and remain mixed with it in the silos, cutting an animal's stomach and heart after they are swallowed. Last fall, Gus Knight found one of his Hereford cows shot dead in a field on his farm near Pottersville. The animal's hindquarters and loin had been removed. Nathan Repair, Somerset County agricultural agent and the father of Jonathan Repair, said the incident was one of five to have occurred recently in Somerset. Another farmer, Douglas Vogel, said vandals had attached a chain to their four-wheel drive vehicle and pulled open a sluice gate, draining his cranberry bog in Lacey Township in Burlington County and ruining the $15,000 crop. In Ocean County, Martin Dwulet of Lakewood, a truck farmer who uses irrigation to water his vegetables, said vandals had ''cut every hydraulic hose and smashed all the gauges'' to ruin his $10,000 irrigation pump.'' He said he was reluctant to prosecute, even when vandals could be caught. Threats From the Vandals ''The kids say we're going to burn you out,'' he said. ''They have nothing to lose and we do.'' James Kilbourn of Jamestown in Middlesex County said that after harvesting corn all day last November, he had left his $55,000 combine in a field. Equipment is ordinarily left in a field being harvested, because combines are too wide to be moved legally over roads at night. Upon returning in the morning to finish the harvest, Mr. Kilbourn found all four drive belts cut, all electrical and hydraulic lines cut and the chain and lock on the engine smashed. He could not resume harvesting until he had made repairs that took a week and cost $1,300. ''It's very discouraging to farmers who work the fields all year only to lose much of the crop,'' said William E. Kenny, the state assistant secretary of agriculture. ''The farmer gets only one shot a year at a harvest and it has to be done on time. We are getting more and more complaints, the most serious ones in places where there has been urban encroachment. It appears to be people who come out of the city, with no farm background or appreciation for agriculture.'' The Dangers of Confrontation Police forces in rural townships are too small to stake out farm fields, so farmers go ''nighthawking,'' as John I. Rigolizzo of Berlin in Camden County put it. But confrontation with vandals can be dangerous. Mr. Winner was nearly run over by a four-wheel drive truck when the vandal who had been tearing swaths through six-foot-high corn saw his way out blocked. Last summer Steven Niederer did get run over. He still has the tire marks from the three-wheeled Honda motorcycle to show for it. ''He was fishtailing through my soybean field,'' Mr. Niederer said. ''I tried to block the road so he couldn't escape. He knocked me down and left this 10-inch-wide tire track down the back of my shirt. My wife was 100 feet away and he nearly ran her over too.'' Occasionally, vandalism is done in daylight, and the police can be alerted while the maurauders are still in the fields. Four squad cars from Winslow Township and Berlin responded last summer when motorcycles were raising a dust storm in one of Mr. Rigolizzo's peach orchards, knocking over and tearing up young trees as they went. Dust Hampered the Police ''The police cars were in hot pursuit in there,'' Mr. Rigolizzo said, pointing to the orchard. ''But the joy riders raised so much dust, the police couldn't see. The motorcycles peeled off and escaped through trees where the cars couldn't go.'' His farm is between two housing developments. Once he caught some boys stealing peaches and ordered them off the property. In retaliation, he said, they buried boards with nails pointing up in one of his farm roadways and he promptly got four flat tires on his truck. He said crops had been maliciously destroyed. The Rigolizzo family had picked three acres of butternut squash in September and laid the vegetables out in the field to ''cure'' in the sun for a week. When the Rigolizzos went to get them for packaging and marketing they found that someone had driven a car back and forth over the squashes. Damage to Soybean Crop The almost total destruction of his soybean crop on a 25-acre field two miles from his house was even costlier, Mr. Rigolizzo said. . The vandals ''fishtailed and drag-raced their way through the field,'' he said. ''They left wide tracks over mashed soybeans. We didn't harvest 10 per cent of the crop.'' Many farmers have tried to fence off their fields, to no avail. ''I put up a $3,000 fence of snow-fencing and posts,'' said Fred T. Moriuchi, who has 600 acres in apples and peaches in Burlington County. ''They took four-wheel drives and rammed right through it. Adults bring their kids to help them steal the fruit. The cars we chase away range from pick-ups to Mercedes.'' Fences stay intact no longer than a day, Mr. Rigolizzo said. ''We tried reinforcing ours with chain-link fencing,'' he said. ''They took bolt cutters and cut through it as soon as we left.''

699-> Tolentine Is Surprised By McClancy, 70-67
Tolentine, the three-time Catholic High Schools Athletic Association champion, was upset, 70-67, by McClancy High School of Queens yesterday in the quarterfinal round of the playoffs at Manhattan College's Draddy gymnasium. Joe Franco led McClancy with 26 points and 11 rebounds. Dennis Frlan had 15 points and 13 rebounds, and Wesley Jones had 14 points and 10 rebounds for McClancy, a school that had not won a playoff game since 1971. The victory, McClancy's third straight in the playoffs, raised its record to 18-9. Gary Voce and John Johnson combined for 42 points for Tolentine (22-4). McClancy earned a spot in Wednesday's final four at Fordham against St. Peter's of Staten Island, which defeated Bishop Loughlin, 66-64, in its quarterfinal matchup. In the other two quarterfinal games, Olden Polynice had 22 points and 13 rebounds as All Hallows defeated Cardinal Hayes, 59-46, and Archbishop Molloy of Queens eliminated St. Raymonds of the Bronx, 64-49,

702-> CUOMO NOW PLANNING TO REPLACE CHAIRMAN OF STATE'S PAROLE BOARD
Governor Cuomo will replace the chairman of the State Parole Board, administration officials said today. The Governor has chosen Marion L. Borum, a deputy commissioner in the Correction Department, to replace Edward R. Hammock, the officials said. The officials declined to provide details on reasons for the switch, pending a formal announcement. The announcement is being held up until a standard background check can be completed, they said. Mr. Borum did not return telephone calls to his office in New York City today. 'A Pleasant Conversation' Mr. Hammock declined to be interviewed. A spokesman for him, Paul Young, said: ''I don't know what the source of this information is, but to our knowledge, it is not accurate. The chairman spoke to the Governor last Tuesday. They had a pleasant conversation. Nobody has come to us and said, 'Look, we want you out.' '' Mr. Hammock, who is 46 years old, was elected last year to serve during 1983 as president of the National Association of Paroling Authorities, the association of parole boards and departments in the 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. Mr. Borum, 49, a former New York State parole officer, is now the deputy correction commissioner in charge of inmate programs. He is also in charge of the Correction Department's New York City region. The chairman of the Parole Board is paid $59,000 a year. The 12-member board controls the release of most inmates from the state's overcrowded prisons. It is also responsible for the supervision of thousands of convicts after they are released on parole. In 1982, the board considered 14,312 applications for parole, approving about half of them. Mr. Hammock was appointed to the Parole Board by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1976. During his tenure, the board has significantly reduced the percentage of inmates who are released when they first become eligible for parole. The reason for this, according to Mr. Young, was that plea bargaining had sharply reduced the minimum sentences of many inmates. So to ''keep an even keel,'' the Parole Board began having inmates held for longer periods, Mr. Young said. This is one of the reasons for the sharp increase in the size of the state's prison population, which last week topped 30,000 for the first time in the state's history. In recent weeks, Mr. Hammock has been at odds with the position of the Cuomo administration on a major criminal-justice issue. He has publicly opposed the Governor's proposal for setting fixed prison sentences for most crimes, rather than leaving this to the discretion of judges and in turn the Parole Board.

704-> Caveat Passing Up Preakness
The fastest starter and the fastest finisher among the 3-year-olds are out of the running May 21 for the Preakness Stakes. Strike Gold, the undefeated speedball who was held out of the Derby to be pointed for the Preakness, is going to wait a little longer before running with top company at longer distances. Caveat, who closed like a whirlwind to finish third behind Sunny's Halo in the Derby, is off his feed and scheduled for a long rest. Strike Gold was expected to top the field for the Withers Stakes at Aqueduct tomorrow but instead goes in an easy six-furlong allowance race today. So now the focus of the Withers is on Megaturn, undefeated in four outings and the 2-1 favorite in a field of 10. Country Pine, eighth in the Derby, and I Enclose, who won the Nashua Stakes last fall, are the other Preakness possibilities in the field. Slewpy, who was second in a grass stakes for New York-breds Wednesday, is another candidate for a trip to Baltimore. The one-mile Withers and the mile-and-a-sixteenth Preakness Prep Purse at Pimlico tomorrow gained new prominence after their significant outcomes last year. Aloma's Ruler won the Withers and came back a week later to win the Preakness. Conquistador Cielo won the Preakness Prep and a month later earned the horse-of-the-year title with runaway scores in the Metropolitan and the Belmont Stakes. The Preakness Prep this year drew only six entries because no one is eager to run against Assault Landing, who won the faster division of the Gotham last month and missed the Derby only because his handlers had neglected to nominate him. His rivals tomorrow are Bet Big, Dixieland Band, Noble Home, Hardi and Lovin Touch. Strike Gold's defection from the Preakness is good news for Sunny's Halo, who benefited from the lack of a swift pace in the Derby. Without Strike Gold, there doesn't appear to be any new early speed for the Preakness. Megaturn, I Enclose and Assault Landing all make one move from behind, the running style that proved ineffective for horses like Marfa and Play Fellow against Sunny's Halo in the Derby. Princess Rooney, the gray 3-year-old filly who has won all 10 times she has raced, vanned into Belmont Park this week to prepare for the New York filly triple crown, which starts May 28 with the Acorn Stakes. The combined margin of her 10 victories is 78 lengths, and she has yet to be asked for her best. It's tough to knock a legend who's 10 for 10, but Princess Rooney has to be seen to be disbelieved. Her four races this year have been visually unimpressive, her winning times mundane. Her apparent slide was reflected in her victory a week ago in the Kentucky Oaks. She won purely on class, keeping her distance from a pack of impostors while stumbling and weaving down the stretch. Will it be any different in the Acorn, the Mother Goose and the Coaching Club American Oaks? Only if some real competition materializes and the weakest 3-year-old filly division in a decade gains some legitimate contenders. At least one looks ready for the challenge: Ski Goggle, the best filly in the West, has recovered from a January injury and won a minor stakes race at Hollywood Park last week. Ski Goggle has now won her only 4 starts by a total of 31 lengths - and in better times than the Princess, even allowing for the speed-happy California tracks. The Eclipse Awards will henceforth share more than gold-plated statuettes with the Academy Awards. Next February a ballroom will hush as the envelope is ripped open and the 1983 horse of the year is announced. Previously the winner's name was released a month earlier, and the awards ceremony was a trophy-collecting formality. The winners of racing's divisional championships will still be announced a month before the ceremony, and those horses will in effect be the nominees for the big prize. The change was approved by a 2-to-1 vote of the three organizations that sponsor the awards, in the hope that the surprise element would add some drama to the usually sleepy ceremony and possibly win some live television coverage. The National Turf Writers Association, which opposed the move, expressed doubt that a television audience would be terribly interested in watching a roomful of millionaires eat dinner, but the writers' group was outvoted by Daily Racing Form and the Thoroughbred Racing Associations. If nothing else, the move is sure to give Nevada bookmakers another kind of horse race on which to set odds and take bets. Conquistador Cielo would have been no less than 4-to-5 against Perrault, Lemhi Gold and Landaluce for last year's title.

705-> THE WORLD IN SUMMARY; Healing a Split In North Africa
Seven years ago, Morocco broke diplomatic relations with Algeria over its support for the Polisario's war of independence in the Western Sahara, which Morocco won from Spain in 1975. Last weekend, the two North African neighbors met for the first time since their split to discuss a solution to a conflict that has brought them almost to blows and bedeviled African relations in general. After much secret preparation -going back to 1978, it turns out - Moroccan King Hassan and Algerian President Chadli Benjedid were reported to have discussed a solution that would involve negotiations on self rule between the Polisario and a Saharan group backed by Morocco. An agreement between these groups might obviate the need for a referendum. The referendum plan has been accepted by Morocco and Algeria, but has been held up by Algerian insistence on prior talks between Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco has refused to recognize the group. Morocco is interested in ending a conflict that has been a financial drain. After recognizing the Polisario's independent ''republic'' in 1976, Algeria appeared to see the movement as a lost cause, unable to drive the Moroccans out of the only parts of the territory that count - the coastal area and the rich phosphate mines inland. There has been no major fighting for a year. Reconciliation between the Moroccans and the Algerians would make life easier for the Organization of African Unity, which the conflict has disrupted at various times. It would also help Washington, which has tried to maintain a close alliance with King Hassan and normal relations with Algeria.

706-> JAZZ: PASS PLAYING AT FAT TUESDAY'S
WHEN Joe Pass plays solo guitar, as he is doing through tomorrow at Fat Tuesday's, he thinks like a full band. He weights every note precisely, letting his thumb carry bass lines while his fingers deal out chords or wide-ranging melodic lines or three-way repartee. Occasionally, he lets the counterpoint lapse - the better to send a single-note line zooming around the guitar - only to resume it imperturbably, as if it had been playing along silently all the time. For his first set earlier in the week, he played standards but shrugged off standard approaches. In Antonio Carlos Jobim's ''Wave,'' he defied the bossa nova syncopations and slipped be-bop licks between melody phrases; in ''All The Things You Are,'' he toyed with folksy arpeggios and a hint of a Charleston. And in a sly ''Ain't Misbehavin','' he reharmonized the tune a few times, then casually moved it up into a new key. Using a plectrum in faster tunes, Mr. Pass sometimes played so fast that phrases got tangled. But his finger-picked ballads were poised and exact, particularly ''Sophisticated Lady,'' in which the melody stood out against muted chords like pearls on velvet.

707-> KOCH PROPOSES SHIFT IN CONEY I. HOUSING
Low-income workers would get preference over welfare recipients in applying for apartments at certain Coney Island housing projects under a plan proposed yesterday by Mayor Koch. The Mayor made it clear that he was talking only about apartments that become vacant in projects now occupied by an unusually high number of welfare families. But little else was clear about the plan, which Mr. Koch disclosed - to the surprise of other city officials - in a ribbon-cutting speech at a new housing project in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. Proposal Is Applauded Standing between two rows of recently built single-family houses, Mr. Koch said, ''It was the policy of prior administrations to use Coney Island as a dumping ground, where they took whole projects and put welfare families in them.'' ''Any project that is totally or mostly occupied by welfare tenants is going to have problems and make problems for the community,'' Mr. Koch said. ''That's a fact.'' ''I hope that we can take some of these projects,'' he said, ''and, as apartments become vacant, put working people into these projects, low-income working people.'' The remark drew applause from nearby residents, who had gathered to hear the Mayor. Mr. Koch suggested setting aside entire wings of apartments for working tenants. ''I'm not a commissioner or a city planner,'' he said, when pressed for more details. Later in the day, he turned the matter over to Herbert J. Sturz, chairman of the City Planning Commission. Spokesman Cites Figures A spokesman for the New York City Housing Authority, which operates eight housing projects on Coney Island, said three of them had higher proportions of tenants receiving welfare than the citywide average of 20 percent because of Federal urban renewal policy. The spokesman, Val Coleman, said the three had been built on the condition that former residents on the site be given priority in getting the new units. As it happened, he said, a majority of the former residents were on welfare. ''The Mayor is right in the special circumstances of those three projects,'' Mr. Coleman said, ''and we're certainly taking a look at his idea. However, we must add that for some time we have been aware of this problem.'' It is Housing Authority policy to require a mix of incomes in its projects. As a result, Mr. Coleman said, the proportion of welfare tenants in the three Coney Island developments has been declining. 72 New Homes Completed The three developments are the Carey Gardens Houses, where 38 percent of the tenants receive welfare; Coney Island (1B) Houses, 50 percent, and Coney Island (4-5) Houses, 60 percent. The Mayor brought up the matter at a ribbon-cutting between Mermaid and Neptune Avenues, on West 22d Street, where 72 small homes have just been completed for low- and moderate-income families. The development is called Saltaire Gardens. With its clapboard-and-brick houses framed by front lawns and backyards, it is an incongruous sight in a landscape of boarded-up buildings and stark high-rise apartments. Mayor Koch said that the idea of putting more working people into the projects had been on his mind for a while, but that it was not until his tour of a model home at Saltaire - with memories of his own childhood summers on Coney Island floating through his mind - that he decided to disclose the idea. A sideshow to the ceremony were several exchanges between the Mayor and the City Comptroller, Harrison J. Goldin, a political rival, who was present. In the living room of the model home, the Mayor praised the easy purchase terms: ''Fifteen thousand in cash, with a write-down on the land and a mortgage subsidy. When can I move in?'' Mr. Goldin answered, ''As soon as you vacate Gracie Mansion.'' ''Listen to him,'' Mr. Koch said, laughing, before adding, ''I walked into that one.''

708-> BRIEFING
A Problem With Timing Officials at the United States Information Agency have decided that some of their counterparts in the Soviet Union have an almost uncanny knack for bad timing. Only a few days after the Korean Air Lines plane was shot down, the Russians began a major direct- mail subscription drive in this country for their monthly magazine ''Soviet Life,'' complete with a cut- rate price and a sweepstakes offering two free trips to the U.S.S.R. Such circulation campaigns are planned months in advance so the disastrous timing was almost certainly coincidental. But, U.S.I.A. observers recall, the last time the Russians made a comparable effort to stimulate magazine readership here was immediately after their invasion of Afghanistan. Heavyweight Publicity Opportunism, while an indispensable element of politics, is one of the most unscientific aspects of this realm of the imprecise. A politician can never be sure whether an opening that is seized in a timely fashion will lead to yet another more promising opening or merely an immediate unprofitable dead end. But, occasionally, there are ten- strikes. When Senator Larry Pressler entered the antique tractor pull at the South Dakota State Fair out in Huron over the Labor Day weekend, it seemed a small local enterprise. When he won the heavyweight division by driving a John Deere Model G 231 feet without killing his engine or spinning his wheels, officials gave him a trophy now proudly on exhibit in his Capitol Hill office. But who could have predicted that the resulting publicity would catch the eye of the National Tractor Pull Association? Or that the association would vote the Senator an award for ''his interest in the sport and his service to the men and women who participate''? Or that the association would be holding its national pull this weekend over at the Capital Center in suburban Maryland and thus would be able to present the award to Senator Pressler in person between events? It's enough to make your wheels spin. And Now, Goodbye In a confidential memorandum that became public earlier this year and aroused considerable controversy, Edward L. Rowny, the strategic arms negotiator, classified Joseph E. Goodby, the official State Department representative on his staff, as being among those who favor ''progress at any cost'' in disarmament, not a popular position with the former general. After a decorous six- month cooling-off period, Mr. Goodby has now said goodbye to the delegation to the Geneva arms control talks; his successor is to be Sol Polansky, another of the department's career Foreign Service officers. On Not Ignoring Plato On the logical theory that nonacademic Washington could debate a good many less important matters than philosophy, and currently is doing so, Catholic University opens a series of 12 free weekly lectures on ''Plato and His Legacy'' this afternoon. Jude Dougherty, dean of the School of Philosophy, put the subject's importance in a way that could attract politicians: ''The disputes about what Plato actually taught bear directly on the great conflicts of our day. They are not just scholarly quibbles. One may agree or disagree with Plato, but one cannot ignore him.'' Yes, More Consultants On the presumptuous theory that what Washington really needs is another firm of campaign consultants and lobbyists, Richard N. Bond, former deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Michelle Laxalt, daughter of the general chairman of that committee, Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, have got together on just such a project. Preliminary indications are that they may be right. In its first two weeks of existence, Bond & Laxalt has been engaged by the Motion Picture Association of America to work the Republican side of Congress on the controversial copyright issue and by State Senator Victor Ashe in Tennessee, who is campaigning to succeed the retiring Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. Although no commitments have been made, the White House has expressed interest in using the new firm in the 1984 campaign. Before going to the national committee, Mr. Bond was deputy chief of staff to Vice President Bush, whose 1980 Presidential primary campaigns in Iowa and Connecticut he managed. Miss Laxalt has done Congressional relations work for the State Department and the Agency for International Development and has held staff positions with the Senate Republican Conference and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

709-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; An Unusual Issue For Consolidated
The Consolidated Foods Corporation announced plans late last week for an innovative issue of convertible adjustable preferred stock with a face value of $75 million. According to John Erdman, a principal at Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment banker for the issue, the issue would be the first of its kind. The convertible adjustable rate preferred stock, called ''Caps'' by Morgan Stanley officials, is aimed at corporate treasurers who might buy it as a short-term investment for excess cash. Because 85 percent of the dividend on preferred stock is exempt from the Federal corporate income tax, such issues can have yields less than for Treasury securities, but still attract investor funds. Pricing of the Consolidated Food issue is not expected till later this month, but Mr. Erdman said the dividend yield would be reset quarterly at an interest rate below the highest yield available on certain Treasury bills, notes or bonds. The convertible feature of the new issue will help keep the price of the preferred stock from declining much below the $50 face value of the stock. If the holder is ever dissatisfied with the preferred stock's yield, the issue could be converted at face value into shares of common stock. The stock price will depend on market conditions, but the investor will receive an amount of stock equal in value to the face value of the preferred stock.

714-> U.S. OPENS CONSPIRACY TRIAL OF SIX BRINK'S CASE SUSPECTS
A Federal prosecutor asserted yesterday that members of an extensive conspiracy had carried out several armed robberies and a daring prison escape as well as the 1981 Brink's robbery and murders in Rockland County. The prosecutor's opening statement in the trial was followed by a defense statement that described the defendants as ''freedom fighters.'' Five defendants are charged with participating in the conspiracy and one is charged with helping suspects escape. With more than a dozen marshals providing tight security, Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy completed selecting an anonymous jury before the opening statements began in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The names of jurors were kept secret as a security precaution. Robert S. Litt, a Federal prosecutor, told the jury that the case included the murders of two police officers and a Brink's guard in the $1.6 million armored-car robbery in Rockland. 'Called Itself the Family' ''Those murders were only one of the crimes committed by a group that called itself the Family or sometimes the Collective,'' Mr. Litt said. He added that the group was responsible for ''violence, robbery and murder that spread through the Northeast.'' ''The heart of the Family was five men,'' he said, adding that the five leaders were supported by a ''carefully chosen crew of trusted gunmen'' and several women who drove cars as ''part of the getaway team.'' Pointing a finger at each of the six defendants, Mr. Litt cited the crimes they were accused of committing. ''The Family developed into a highly sophisticated criminal organization,'' he continued, asserting that the members wore bulletproof vests during robberies and maintained ''safe houses'' as hiding places throughout the country. Chesimard Escape Recalled They kidnapped two prison guards while carrying out the 1979 prison escape of Joanne Chesimard, a Black Liberation Army leader, and later smuggled her out of the country, Mr. Litt said, because ''they wanted to do something really big.'' Sekou Odinga, a defendant acting as his own attorney, declared in the defense's first opening statement that the defendants were ''freedom fighters.'' Mr. Odinga, who changed his name from Nathaniel Burns, was dressed in an African style, with a knitted white cap and a blue-and-white cape over a white tunic. He had been portrayed by the prosecutor as one of the criminal leaders. ''I do not agree with the Government's interpretation of what this is all about,'' Mr. Odinga told the jury. He said the defendants were part of ''the black liberation movement'' that would ''someday be successful.'' Calls Himself 'a Soldier' Speaking slowly and deliberately for a full hour, he described himself as a citizen of the Republic of New Africa that ''claimed the right to set up our own nation'' in five Southern states because African slaves had ''built the South.'' ''I am clearly a political prisoner of war,'' Mr. Odinga said, adding that he was not a criminal or terrorist, but ''a soldier in the army of the New African people'' waging an ''armed struggle with the United States.'' Opening statements are to be given today for the other defendants, who are Cecil Ferguson, Edward L. Joseph, Bilal Sunni-Ali (formerly called William Johnson), Silvia Baraldini and Iliana Robinson. All the defendants, except Miss Robinson, are charged with being members of a group or enterprise that committed armed robberies and other crimes in a ''pattern of racketeering.'' Miss Robinson is charged solely with helping suspects avoid arrest. State Trial Also Scheduled A separate trial is to be held later on state charges focusing exclusively on the 1981 Brink's robbery and murders in Rockland County. Mr. Odinga is the only defendant charged in both the Federal and state cases. The prosecution team in the Federal trial consists of Mr. Litt, Stacey J. Moritz, Paul Summit, Joan S. Alexander and Robert Cordier. The defense lawyers are William Mogulescu, Jesse Berman, Chokwe Lumumba, Lynne F. Stewart, Susan V. Tipograph and Lawrence M. Stern. Evidence in the trial is scheduled to include testimony by numerous witnesses, including informants who admitted participating in some of the crimes charged against the defendants. Judge Duffy, giving preliminary instructions to the jury of five men and seven women, said the jurors must use their common sense in evaluating the evidence in the case. He told the jury that the trial was expected to continue for four to five months. ''Above all,'' he said, ''we want you to be totally fair and impartial.'' Jury selection for the trial took two weeks. Judge Duffy questioned prospective jurors without disclosing their names to anyone. The anonymous-jury process was approved for the 1977 narcotics trial of Leroy (Nicky) Barnes and used in several trials since then.

715-> U.S. Steel Chief Explains Plan
David M. Roderick, chairman and chief executive of the United States Steel Corporation, met with members of the Congressional steel caucus today to explain the company's plan to buy and import British slab steel for finishing at the Fairless Hills plant outside Philadelphia. He argued that the plan would save about 5,000 jobs by putting employees to work finishing steel, but he estimated that at least 1,800 jobs would be still be lost. Mr. Roderick said the only alternative, barring costly modernization, would be to leave the plant alone, meaning that it would close down at the end of the 1980's, throwing nearly 6,800 employees out of work. The legislators reportedly complained that under the plan U.S. Steel would be importing a product subsidized by the British Government, after leading the fight in this country against such subsidized imports. Mr. Roderick, in a news conference following the meeting, said, ''We are not interested in entering into any arrangement that involves continuing subsidies or shipping steel into the United States below cost.''

716-> A SUPREME COURT CURB ON ITS OWN POWER
To the Editor: In his Aug. 28 Op-Ed article, ''Justice Brandeis and the Caseload,'' Lewis J. Paper said that the Justice ''wanted state courts to remain the final arbiters of state laws'' and quoted Brandeis as saying that ''in no case practically should the appellate Federal courts have to pass on the construction of state statutes.'' Ever since Murdock v. Memphis, decided in 1875, the Supreme Court has held that, with very minor exceptions, state tribunals should determine with final authority questions of state law (see also Mullaney v. Wilbur, 1975). In other words, state courts are the final arbiters of the meaning to be attached to state laws. However, this does not mean that the Federal courts have no jurisdiction where such interpretations conflict with the Federal Constitution or laws. To the contrary, the Federal courts accept the state statute as so state-interpreted but then themselves determine whether the outcome violates the Federal laws, i.e., the supremacy clause in the Constitution's Article VI applies. What Mr. Paper probably was referring to is revealed in his subsequent reference to the ''laboratory'' concept, that is, states should be able to ''try moral, social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.'' This refers to the Supreme Court's exercise of its reviewing powers under the 14th Amendment during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to strike down, under the substantive due process clause, state social and economic legislation on the vague and personal predilections of the Justices - an exercise of power that Brandeis (and, generally, Holmes) fought. In other words, accepting a state court's interpretation of its own statute as valid under its own constitution nevertheless permits a Federal court to strike it down as invalid under Federal laws. However, insofar as the 14th Amendment was so ''improperly'' used, the Brandeis views have been accepted as a voluntary and self-imposed limitation by the Supreme Court MORRIS D. FORKOSCH, New York, Aug. 29, 1983; The writer is a lawyer.

717-> DESERT WINE'S STATUS STILL QUESTIONABLE
Thirteen colts were entered today for the 108th Preakness Stakes here Saturday, but Desert Wine, the second choice on the morning line, remained a questionable starter after his owners were rebuffed in an attempt to convince the Pimlico stewards to permit the colt to run with medication. Sunny's Halo, who beat Desert Wine by two lengths to win the Kentucky Derby May 7, will break from post No. 11 in the Preakness under Eddie Delahoussaye. His rivals, from the rail out, are Play Fellow, High Honors, Deputed Testamony, Chas Conerly, Bet Big, Marfa, Desert Wine, Paris Prince, Parfaitement, Common Sense, Flag Admiral and Current Hope. Sunny's Halo was listed at 2-1 on the morning line but is more likely to go off at 6-5 or less by post time. Desert Wine is listed next at 7-2 with Marfa at 4-1, but Marfa seems a more realistic second choice in the betting whether or not Desert Wine runs. Desert Wine's owners put up the $2,500 entry fee this morning to try Sunny's Halo again in the Preakness. But they are threatening to pull him out of the race because the stewards will not let the colt run with furosemide, an anti-bleeding diuretic he was permitted to use in the Derby. No Change in Ruling Fred Sahadi and Dan J. Agnew, Desert Wine's owners, met with the Pimlico stewards for an hour this morning but failed to change their ruling. The decision was no surprise, because Desert Wine clearly does not qualify for the drug under Maryland rules, which require that the track veterinarian observe a horse bleeding after a race or workout before approving him for medication. In California and Kentucky, where Desert Wine has done all his racing, all that is required to use Lasix, a trade name for the drug, is a certificate from any veterinarian saying that a horse is a potential bleeder. ''I don't want to run him,'' Jerry Fanning, the trainer, said after watching Desert Wine draw post No. 7 for the Preakness, ''but the owners might and I understand that. ''You only get one chance to run in the Preakness. I've talked it over with my veterinarians, and they think the chance of the horse bleeding is small, but you never know. I don't think it's fair to the horse or the betting public to take away a medication he's been using.'' Fanning said that the final decision would not be made until Friday afternoon, at scratch time. He was encouraged that Desert Wine worked well this morning without Lasix, going half a mile in the good time of 46 4/5 seconds. But Fanning added that horses rarely bleed when they run less than five furlongs. Sunny's Halo is likely to be the shortest-priced Preakness favorite since Spectacular Bid won the race as a 1-10 shot in 1979. The Derby winner made believers out of many skeptics with a sensational workout Monday morning, when he went seven furlongs in 1:24 under a tight hold and with no apparent strain. He has been fighting off a rash and a ringworm throughout the week, but he galloped very strongly this morning and looks ready for a big effort. Early Pressure Could Hurt Desert Wine, with or without medication, has done nothing to suggest he is capable of reversing the Derby outcome. But if he and other frontrunners such as Bet Big, Chas Conerly and Parfaitement put early pressure on Sunny's Halo, they could wear down the favorite enough to give stretch-runners such as Marfa, Current Hope and Paris Prince a better chance than they had at Churchill Downs. By winning the Preakness, Sunny's Halo would have a chance to become the 13th winner of racing's Triple Crown, if he also can go on to win the Belmont Stakes June 11.

724-> DOW HALTS FIGHT TO SELL HERBICIDE
The Dow Chemical Company announced today that it was abandoning its efforts to have a herbicide that contains dioxin certified as safe for use as an agricultural chemical. The chemical, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, was a component of Agent Orange, a defoliant used in Vietnam. Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., about 100 miles north of here, had been contending that the chemical, also known as 2,4,5-T, could be used safely, despite an emergency decision by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979 to ban most applications in forests and on croplands. According to the Federal agency, 2,4,5-T and Silvex, a similar herbicide, are ''unavoidably'' contaminated with 2,3,7,8-TCDD, which is generally considered to be the most toxic of the many dioxin compounds. TCDD is known to cause cancer and birth defects in animals and has been linked to a wide variety of disorders in humans, including a rare form of cancer known as soft-tissue sarcoma. Company Halts Production Dow discontinued production of 2,4,5- T shortly after the Federal ban was imposed in 1979. A Dow spokesman, Terry Witt, said the company had no intention of resuming production of the herbicide. However, it has been selling the product from inventories previously accumulated for the applications that were still permitted. Mr. Witt said the company was giving up, after more than four years of defending the product. ''Because of public concern and public misinformation,'' he explained, ''a resolution of the use of 2,4,5-T as a herbicide was not practical to accomplish. It had gone beyond scientific resolution into the emotional and public anxiety area.'' Dow said it had spent more than $10 million to defend the product in hearings before the environmental agency and in discussions with officials. Don R. Clay, the agency's acting assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, praised Dow's decision to withdraw the chemical. ''Dow is to be commended for its decision and for its corporate statesmanship,'' he said. Mr. Clay expressed the hope that other companies involved in the 2,4,5-T case, which number about 60, would follow Dow's example and drop efforts to have the agent certified as safe. Dow Stands by Assertions Despite dropping its case, Dow clung to its assertion that 2,4,5-T, which was used for 30 years to retard the growth of woody plants, was not harmful. ''The great weight of scientific evidence confirms that 2,4,5-T can be used safely without undue risk to people or the environment,'' said Keith R. McKennon, the company's vice president for agricultural products. Dioxin, the toxic substance in 2,4,5-T, is considered so dangerous that the Federal Government evacuated the 800 residents of Times Beach, Mo., and bought their property when soil in the town was found to be heavily contaminated with dioxin. Dow's decision to end the effort to certify 2,4,5-T as safe does not end the company's involvement with the chemical. It is participating in a study with the E.P.A. to assess the level of dioxin contamination in and around its Midland facilities. The study was begun after state health officials issued a report indicating that there was an unusually high rate of cancer among women living in the area. The company is also a defendant in a case brought by a number of Vietnam War veterans, who have attributed medical problems to exposure to Agent Orange, which was used as a defoliant in the jungles of Vietnam to deprive the enemy of cover. E.P.A. to Seek Ban WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (AP) - The Environmental Protection Agency said today it would now seek to ban all sales of 2,4,5-T. Retail concerns that have the pesticide on their shelves would be permitted to sell of their stock, officials said. The ban would take efect 30 days after the publication of a notice, scheduled for Tuesday.

727-> UNDUE AFFRONT TO INDONESIA
To the Editor: While I agree with the wisdom of President Reagan's postponing his trip to the Philippines, I cannot agree with the statement in your Oct. 4 editorial on the subject that it is ''good diplomacy to drop Thailand and Indonesia from the intinerary as well.'' Your view lends support to White House insensitivity to some important bilateral relationships. Indonesia is the world's fifth most populous country, a vast archipelagic nation astride critical sea lanes. President Suharto's Government has steadfastly opposed Communism, and, while officially nonaligned, it has a commendable record of supporting international positions consistent with U.S. interests. Unlike the Philippines, Indonesia has a stable Government with an institutional structure that should ensure a smooth transition of authority. Indonesia accounted for over $2 billion in trade with the U.S. in 1982. It is rich in natural resources and agricultural commodities. It is our number one supplier of imported plywood, number two in rubber. In the second quarter of 1983, it supplied us with more oil than Saudi Arabia. Moreover, over 100 U.S. companies have been attracted to Indonesia's friendly environment for foreign investments. With a little more perspective, you (and the White House) could have pointed out that the President's original itinerary did not included the Philippines but did include Indonesia for the purpose of ''enhancing relations.'' Instead you have affronted Indonesia (and Thailand) because of the troubles in the Philippines. GEORGE E. BARNES President, American Indonesian Chamber of Commerce New York, Oct. 11, 1983

728-> A PRESIDENTIAL SLIP ON ENVIRONMENT
To the Editor: The Oct. 10 issue of The New York Times carried the texts of Secretary James G. Watt's letter of resignation and President Reagan's reply. Normally these kinds of self- congratulatory pronouncements contain little worth noticing, but in this case one of the President's statements merits attention. Speaking of his departing Secretary, Mr. Reagan said, ''He has initiated a careful balance between the needs of people and the importance of protecting the environment.'' This statement is worth noting not so much because its contention is arguably false but rather because in the President's mind there is an evident difference between the ''needs of people'' and ''the importance of protecting the environment'' which requires ''a careful balance.'' One would have thought that a healthy planet with clean air and water was one of the needs of people, perhaps even the paramount need, but apparently not. I would suggest that the statement the President made should actually have read ''. . . the needs of industry and business, and the importance of protecting the environment.'' Taken in that context, the sentence can certainly be argued with (Secretary Watt's ideas of balance having recently been in question), but at least it makes some sensible point. We must now wait and see which way the balance will tip under Secretary Watt's successor. One can only hope that the ''needs of people'' will get a little more weight this time. MEYER L.

730-> PUBLISHING: ON 'EXPURGATING' BOOKS
DURING the American Library Association's recent convention in Los Angeles, the group's young-adult services division issued a background report that said the three major school book clubs were ''expurgating books'' offered for sale through classrooms. The division formally notified Scholastic, Xerox Education Publications and Troll that they may not use its ''best books for young adults'' designation on a book or in promotional material for the book if the title or text has been changed from the book as originally published. ''We really feel that expurgation is censorship and therefore violates our library bill of rights, which says that information should be available to anybody regardless of age or sex,'' said Evelyn Shaevel, executive director of the young-adult division, the other day. ''We believe that no one except the parents should restrict what a child can read.'' The alleged expurgation occurs between the original hard-cover edition of a book and the book club's paperback version. The background paper said: ''They may remove four-letter words, including 'damn' and 'hell,' change 'Oh, God' to 'Oh, Lord,' remove mention of parts of the anatomy, such as 'thigh' or 'breast,' remove any connotation of anything sexual and sometimes remove violence as well.'' It added that in some cases words were removed or changed and whole paragraphs, pages and chapters rewritten. Scholastic Is Prime Target The librarians' prime target is Scholastic, because it is the only one of the three book clubs that also sells its books through bookstores and buys trade-paperback rights from hard-cover publishers. Moreover, nowhere is there an indication that the paperback is different from the originally published edition. ''The only way a person would know is to compare texts of the two editions, something most people are unlikely to do,'' the paper said. Miss Shaevel said the practice could put the school librarian, teacher and public librarian in a vulnerable position if they had both the original hard-cover and the expurgated paperback edition on their shelves. Scholastic officials are in agreement about that. Consequently, ''We are working on the wording to put a line on the copyright page that will let people know the book has been changed from its hardcover format,'' said Alice Bregman, editor of Scholastic's Apple and Vagabond Books. The new policy probably won't begin before November, she said, since the books that will be distributed in September have already gone to press. Scholastic has four book clubs aimed at children from kindergarten to ninth grade. A company official declined to give annual sales figures, except to say, ''It's millions of copies.'' Miss Bregman noted that changes occur in only a small fraction of the Scholastic titles, and she considered ''revised'' a more accurate word than ''expurgated'' for the changes. Going Back to Authors ''For book-club use, we ask the authors if they would be willing to change words here and there or, in very few cases, to rewrite a few words or maybe a couple of paragraphs,'' Miss Bregman said. ''We never do it without the authors' approval and without their doing the rewriting. We do not do any rewriting ourselves.'' The Library Association maintains, however, that even that policy affects the integrity of the rewritten book. ''We did a survey with young-adult authors at the end of last year,'' said Judy Flum, chairman of the intellectual-freedom committee of the young-adult services division. ''Most said that even though they were asked to make the changes, it put them in the position of having to go along or return the advance money. Many agreed to make changes, but they were not happy about it. They felt compromised.'' Such a writer is Frank Bonham, one of whose books was cited by the librarians as having had its integrity changed by changes in the Scholastic edition. Making a Vital Change The book is ''Gimme an H, Gimme an E, Gimme an L, Gimme a P,'' published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1980. In the original edition, the top of a teen-age girl's bathing suit comes off in a swimming pool and a teen-age boy, thinking it came off on purpose, makes a pass at the girl. He soon realizes that it was an accident, and that the girl, rather than enjoying the situation, is very upset - so upset that she later has to be talked out of suicide. In the Scholastic edition, the top stays in place, and the entire contretemps centers around a kiss. ''I didn't want to make the change but it was that or nothing,'' Mr. Bonham said yesterday from his home in Arizona. ''But in a way I could see their point. All Scholastic's books are sold to schools, and they're always catching flak from parents.'' He has written 51 books, 7 or 8 of which Scholastic has reprinted with minor changes, usually involving profane language. Even with the changes in ''Gimme,'' he said, a mother in Kansas created a minor storm over other passages in the book. The reason for requesting the changes, Miss Bregman said, is to insulate teachers against parental pressure directed at ''certain words and passages'' in some of the stories. Since Scholastic still regards this as a sound policy, it will continue asking authors to revise those words or passages that it considers likely to invite parental objections.

731-> THE EVENING HOURS
''A LL of us ladies seek a little help from time to time,'' Arlene Dahl was saying, ''and now that the grandest lady of them all needs a little assistance, it behooves us to help.'' Miss Dahl, looking great in a deep mauve Helen Rose dress and seemingly in need of no help at all, was, of course, talking about the Statue of Liberty. The occasion Tuesday evening, at the Vista International Hotel's Nieuw Amsterdam Ballroom, was New York State's kickoff dinner-dance to raise funds for the restoration of Miss Liberty in time for her 1986 centennial. ''She needs more than a 'miracle morning' at Elizabeth Arden,'' said Marc Rosen, a vice president of the cosmetics company. His reference was to the statue's corroding copper skin and wobbly right arm. More than 300 formally attired guests paid from $250 to $1,000 each because, according to said Michael Orlando, the evening's coordinator, ''they all want to do their part to restore the first lady of freedom to her deserved brilliance.'' Licia Albanese got things rolling with a rousing ''Star-Spangled Banner,'' and Kitty Carlisle Hart wound up the evening by conducting the raffle for a Louise Nevelson sculpture. Among the guests: Representative S. William Green, in whose district the statue resides; Garnet Chapin, special assistant to Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt; Michael Reagan, the adopted son of President Reagan, and, with an occasional clutch of her tiara, Janice Ann Reinauer, who recently won the title of Maritime Queen. ''I hope they let me keep it,'' she said of the tiara. The evening's wines were from New York State, although when Bertrand de Lataillade, the French Consul General, made his toast ''to the friendship of the French and American people,'' he did so with French Champagne. ''E PPIE must be in love, she looks so radiant!'' the producer Morton Gottlieb said in a stage whisper during the birthday dinner party he gave at the Ambassador Grill of the United Nations Plaza Hotel Tuesday evening for Eppie Lederer. Mrs. Lederer, otherwise known as Ann Landers, adjusted her headband, smiled and continued eating her baby asparagus and ''Marinated 10th Avenue Chicken.'' Miss Landers, however, was not at all secretive about her age. ''I'm 65, why lie?'' she asked. ''Anyway, it's in 'Who's Who.' '' Her birthday had actually been the day before, the Fourth of July. ''It's a source of embarrassment to me that people can never forget the day,'' she said. ''Barbara Walters always sends me something, and I don't even know when hers is.'' Nevertheless, Miss Landers did bestow custom-made neckties on all the men present, including Morton Janklow, Dr. William Cahan and Sheridan Morley, the British drama critic. Is Miss Landers besieged by advice-seekers at dinner parties? ''In the powder room, that's when I get the questions,'' she said. Shortly after dessert and a chorus of ''Happy Birthday,'' Miss Landers headed for the powder room. She was followed, at a discreet distance, by several of the female guests. ''N EVER get an apartment with French windows, it's impossible to do anything with the curtains,'' Lisa Oldenburg told some of the 30 or so guests she and her husband, Richard, had invited to a dinner party at their Upper East Side apartment on Wednesday evening. Mr. Oldenburg is the director of the Museum of Modern Art, and the party was to honor Fay Kanin, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and to celebrate the recently restored footage of the 1954 Judy Garland version of ''A Star Is Born,'' which had its premiere last night at Radio City Music Hall. No one, it should be added, will notice your windows if your guests include Lillian Gish, James Mason, Norman Lear, Blanchette Rockefeller, John Springer and anyone else who loves movies. Mr. Mason compared Miss Garland to Chaplin, and Miss Gish said she loved ''Tootsie'' but did hope someone would find a print of ''Romola,'' a film she made in Italy in 1922. Miss Kanin said it was about time people got alerted to the danger of losing their film heritage, and Ronald Haver, who found the missing footage of ''A Star Is Born,'' said: ''When I first approached Warner Brothers, they actually thought I was talking about the Streisand version. Imagine that!''

732-> EAST SAYS MISSILE TALKS MUST CONTINUE
Foreign Ministers of the Warsaw Pact said today that it was essential for negotiations on medium-range missiles to continue past the end of the year, but they made their call contingent on a change in American plans to start deploying new missiles in December. A statement adopted by the seven Foreign Ministers meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, and made public here by the Soviet press agency Tass was unclear on whether the East was threatening to break off the talks if the Western deployment began. ''The participants in the meeting expressed the conviction that there still is an opportunity for attaining an accord to meet the interests of the peoples at the Geneva talks,'' the communique said, speaking of the American-Soviet negotiations in Geneva on medium- range nuclear weapons. ''In this connection they pointed out that if agreement is not reached at the talks by year's end, it is essential that the talks should be continued with a view to reaching it in the conditions of the renunciation by the United States and its NATO allies of their schedule for deploying new medium-range nuclear missiles.'' Ambiguity Appears Deliberate Western experts who analyzed the statement noted that in English, as in the original Russian, the phrase ''in the conditions of'' was not tantamount to making American renunciation of its deployment schedule a concrete condition for continuing the talks into next year. An American diplomat said the formulation appeared to be deliberately ambiguous, serving both to sustain an overall tone of reasonableness in the communique and to fuel West European anxieties that the deployment will bring a Soviet withdrawal from the Geneva negotiations. Most experts on the issue agree that an agreement is almost impossible by Dec. 1, and President Reagan has steadily maintained that without an agreement deployment will start in December. In response to the growing number of SS-20 missiles being stationed in the European part of the Soviet Union and targeted on Western Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed in 1979 to start installing 108 new Pershing 2 and 464 ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe by the end of 1983 unless agreement had been reached by the Soviet Union and the United States on limiting such weapons. Possible Purposes of Statement The approach of the deadline has been accompanied both by intensified public arguments by both major powers and by growing public sentiment, particularly in West Germany, against any new missiles. Western diplomats viewed the Warsaw Pact communique as the latest of a quickening series of Soviet pronouncements intended to feed opposition to the missiles in the West. In addition, they said, it appeared to lay further groundwork for blaming the West if negotiations are suspended later this year. The comparatively moderate tone of today's communique contrasted with the threatening language of statements Thursday by Marshal Viktor G. Kulikov, commander in chief of the Warsaw Pact armed forces. Western experts said the contrasting statements a day apart were apparently intended to demonstrate both a threatening and a moderate Soviet posture to the West Europeans, although neither statement fundamentally changed the Soviet negotiating position nor specified the consequences of American deployments. Marshal Kulikov's statement, the experts also noted, was distributed by the Novosti press agency only to Western correspondents and was not published in the Soviet Union, suggesting that for domestic consumption, Moscow preferred the image offered in the Warsaw Pact communique. The U.S. Reaction WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (Reuters) - The State Department said today that the Warsaw Pact communique reflected no change in Soviet tactics to undermine deployment of new missiles. But John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said it appeared to agree with the United States and its allies that there was still an opportunity for an agreement at Geneva this year and that negotiations should continue even without an agreement.

733-> Chrysler in Talks With VW on Car
Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said talks between his company and the West German auto maker Volskwagenwerk A.G. might result in joint production of a small car in the United States. Mr. Iacocca, who noted that his discussions with Carl Hahn, VW chairman, are preliminary, said he had met two or three times with Mr. Hahn recently to discuss how to work together in the American small car market. Chrysler is planning to replace its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon with a vehicle it calls the P-car by 1986, while VW plans to introduce a redesigned Rabbit in the 1985 model year.

A former New York City police officer convicted last May of second-degree assault for striking a handcuffed prisoner on the head with a night stick in a Brooklyn station house was sentenced yesterday to spend weekends in jail for one year. The officer, 38-year-old Vincent Piscitelli, was sentenced by Justice John F. Hayes of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Mr. Piscitelli, who was dismissed from the police force after his conviction, faced up to seven years in prison. He was ordered to begin his first weekend in confinement next Friday.

735-> SCOUTING; Picture of Health
The Philadelphia Stars, who won 15 games and lost 3, the best record in the United States Football League, have only one minor injury to contend with as they prepare to play the Chicago Blitz tomorrow in the playoffs. Ken Dunek, a tight end, pulled a hamstring muscle last weekend but is expected to be ready to play. Coach Jim Mora and his chief trainer, David Price, agree that the fact that the Stars have been largely injury-free during the regular season has been a contributing factor in their success. ''I guess a lot of it has been luck,'' Mora said yesterday. ''But beyond that, we have had good athletes who were in top shape all season. Our training staff has worked hard to keep everyone fit.'' The Stars were able to go through the season without placing anyone on the injured-reserve list. George Cooper, a linebacker, was the only regular to miss more than one game; he missed four with a knee injury. ''The players reported in good condition, which was a good way to start out,'' Price said. ''Then, our coach operated realistically all season long. If I told him someone would be out for a week, he would leave me and the player alone until I told him the player was ready to play again. He put absolutely no pressure on the training staff to get players ready in a hurry. We've had our share of bumps and bruises, but no case of a player being out for an extended period with the same type of injury. Some teams try to rush a player back before he is recovered.''

736-> Braniff-Hyatt Plan Advances
United States Bankruptcy Judge John Flowers approved tonight a disclosure statement that will be mailed to 80,000 Braniff International creditors. The statement described Braniff's reorganization plan, the $70 million agreement between the airline and the Chicago-based Hyatt Corporation and the plan to return the title on 30 planes to the airline's secured creditors, who will then lease the planes back to Braniff. The documents will be sent in the next 10 days to the airline's creditors, who will vote by mail on Hyatt's plan to put Braniff back into the air with 30 planes and 2,000 employees. The ballotting is expected to take about a month. The judge scheduled Aug.30 as the date when he will consider the entire Braniff-Hyatt deal. At Braniff's request, he extended the airline's deadline for having the exclusive right to file its own reorganization plan until Sept.12.

738-> CHRYSLER'S NET SOARS IN QUARTER
The Chrysler Corporation, continuing its vigorous recovery from near-bankruptcy, reported today that it had earned $100.2 million, or 72 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with earnings of $9.4 million, or 3 cents a share, in last year's period. The Chrysler profit report was near the top of the range of analysts' projections, and brought the company's total profit for the nine months to $582.6 million. Just two years ago, in the first three quarters of 1981, the company lost $435 million. However, because of its losses in recent years, Chrysler's current earnings are magnified by the fact it does not have to pay Federal income taxes. The company said about half its quarterly profit, or $49.3 million, came from tax loss carryforwards. Ford Profit Expected Earlier this week, the General Motors Corporation reported a record third-quarter profit of $737 million. The Ford Motor Company is expected to report earnings of about $250 million on Thursday. Of the domestically based car manufacturers, only the American Motors Corporation has reported a loss - $9.1 million. Chrysler said that strong car and truck sales pushed up third-quarter revenue to $2.8 billion, a 13.8 percent increase over the $2.46 billion reported in the 1982 period. Unit sales of cars and trucks in the period totaled 316,861, an increase of 11.3 percent from 284,601. Chrysler's sales for the nine months totaled 1,087,408, an increase of 17.4 percent from 926,152, and its share of the American passenger car market rose to 10.5 percent from 10 percent. The company also noted that it was making gains in larger cars, traditionally a weak spot. Chrysler's midsize cars, the largest remaining in its lineup, captured 14.6 percent of that market segment, the company said, up from 6.3 percent last year. For the first nine months, Chrysler has earned $582.6 million on sales of $9.5 million, compared with net income of $266.2 million on sales of $7.8 billion in the comparable 1982 period. Analysts had been estimating that Chrysler would report a full-year profit of $850 million to $900 million, but the company warned today that an accounting rule might cut fourth- quarter and year-end earnings significantly. Chrysler said it might have to revalue its holding of 1.8 million shares of stock in the French auto maker, Peugeot. The company now values the shares at $323.9 million, but noted that ''due to the prevailing business and economic conditions in France, Chrysler expects Peugeot's 1983 operating results to be adversely affected.'' It said it was studying whether accounting principles will require it to reduce the stock's value. Auditor's Question Harvey Heinbach, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch, said the company may be planning a writedown to remove a qualification in the auditor's opinion of its annual report. For the past several years, Touche Ross & Company, Chrysler's auditor, has raised a question about the value of the Peugeot investment. Mr. Heinbach estimated the current value of the Peugeot shares at $45 million, but said ''since it would have no real-world effect, they may have decided to take the charge and get rid of the qualification.'' Restating the value of the Peugeot stock could result in a charge against fourth-quarter earnings, Chrysler officials said, depending on what value was put on the shares.

740-> PULL ALL ISRAELIS OUT OF LEBANON
It is time for Israel to begin withdrawing its troops from all of Lebanon and to replace them with alternative military arrangements -provided by the multinational force and the militia of the Lebanese commander Maj. Saad Haddad - that assure our security. The Israeli armed forces are stationed in three distinct regions of Lebanon. In the eastern region, parallel to the Syrian border, the Israeli Army faces the Syrian Army. Syria is not trying to provoke the Israelis, but it is trying to improve its political and strategic position - by strengthening its ties with the Soviet Union, dominating and manipulating Palestine Liberation Organization leaders, threatening the Lebanese and making life difficult for Israeli soldiers. In the central region - in the Chouf mountains and the Beirut area - the Israeli forces are caught in the inter-ethnic and interparty clashes between Christians, Moslems and Druze. Demographic changes have heightened tension in this region: The Christians have lost their demographic ma-jority, and the other communities are hoping, at least tacitly, that Israeli tanks will settle the discrepancies between the new demography and the old constitution based on a Christian majority. But the Israelis can only put out fires; they cannot eliminate the sources of the conflagaration. The southern region, from the Awali River to the Israeli border, is inhabited by a Shiite Moslem majority, some Palestinian refugees and a Christian minority. Major Haddad's forces have succeeded in establishing relative peace in the region and in preventing the return of P.L.O. terrorists. The commonly accepted view is that the Israeli presence in the eastern region - in one place our troops --------------------------------------------------------------------- Shimon Peres is leader of the Israeli Labor Party. are only 23 kilometers from Damascus - exerts pressure on Syria to withdraw from Lebanon. But this very optimistic assumption has not yet been proved, and I doubt whether it will be. Even if we agree that Syria is not a Soviet satellite, it is today more than ever dependent on the Soviet Union. And even if we assume that Russia is not interested in direct conflict - neither between itself and the United States nor between Israel and Syria - it is clear that Moscow is not interested in any peace settlement arranged by the United States without the Soviet Union. Certainly, Moscow would consider an overall evacuation of Lebanese territory an undesirable American success. Should the Syrians withdraw, this would also require the withdrawal of the P.L.O. units under its aegis on Lebanese soil (in the Bekaa Valley and Tripoli). But as Damascus is pressing for the removal of Yasir Arafat and for full control of the P.L.O. forces, it is doubtful whether Syria will agree to withdraw or encourage the subsequent withdrawal of P.L.O. units. Finally, Syria believes that Israel's present deployment along extended, temporary lines is burdensome to Israel. Given that Syrian withdrawal is unlikely, why should Israel pull out of eastern Lebanon? I do not know of a single responsible Israeli politician who proposes that we remain on Lebanese soil in the long-term future. In the long run, no one would remember the reasons that brought Israel to Lebanon, but all would be aware of our presence on territory that does not belong to us. Lebanon must not become our Vietnam. Besides, the proximity of the Israeli and Syrian forces (in several places, the distance between them is no more than several hundred meters) and the presence of irregular forces could easily bring about a renewed confrontation - a third round in the war in Lebanon. What would happen in the field should Israel leave? In my opinion, the Lebanese Army and the multinational force must take the Israelis' place in this region. According to the understanding reached in the agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the multinational force (in this case, the French) is to patrol the Beirut-Damascus highway. The multinational force, the Lebanese Government and the Israeli Government must make it clear to the Syrian Government that the present Syrian frontline will be viewed as a red line and that any Syrian movement westward into Lebanon will be viewed as deliberate escalation. As for the Chouf mountains and the Beirut area, there only the Lebanese themselves can work out rules for their own co-existence. In my opinion, it would be best for Israel to withdraw from this region as soon as possible, and our American friends should help establish alternative and effective military arrangements there. In southern Lebanon, however, Israel is faced with a serious problem. In the last year, 500 of our best young men have fallen, and about 2,500 have been wounded, in order to insure that the Galilee will no longer be shelled by Katyusha rockets. This is a very heavy and painful price. We would naturally not wish to remove our army from the security belt of southern Lebanon without insuring peace for Galilee. But here again, we cannot involve ourselves in a situation in which we attempt to control the lives of another people. Luckily, in this region as well, there is a a reasonable though imperfect alternative: reinforcing the forces of Major Haddad. These forces are composed today of regular units (about 1,100 soldiers) and of a rural militia (about 600 men). The addition of several hundred more soldiers will enable Major Haddad to establish order in the region, while the Unifil forces already stationed in the area can be concentrated at the entrance to the Palestinian refugee camps in order that no harm should come to them. The Lebanese Army can also help in this region, primarily in the northern part - an arrangement that is already stipulated by the Israel-Lebanon agreement. Israel itself would of course continue to keep an eye on what happens in this area, on our northern border. The defense of the region can thus be organized within two to three months, allowing Israeli soldiers to come home - without sacrificing Israel's security. We must pursue de-escalation in Lebanon. A temporary arrangement that perpetuates unnecessary military dangers without advancing our political goals serves no one in the long run.

741-> Race and Responsibility
Black political, civic and religious leaders have summoned a House subcommittee to New York to examine their charge of increasing mistreatment of blacks by the police. Mayor Koch resents the charge and the appeal to Washington and fears the hearings may themselves damage community relations. He accuses a handful of black leaders of stirring discontent because they want his job. The Mayor is right to be concerned about the effects of the inquiry. And he may be right about the motives of some of the complainants. The success of black mayoral candidates in Chicago and in Philadelphia's primary is gnawing at the plainly less successful black politicians of New York. But this clash also reflects a progressive breakdown of communication and trust between City Hall and the black community for which the Mayor must share responsibility. Beyond the question of whether these hearings are justified lies the question of whether the Mayor and black leaders are able and willing to hear each other out and develop an agenda for improving the climate. New York's Police Department has come to be respected for its discipline and skill. Its commanders impose restraint in the use of deadly force; wanton shootings are rare. Complaints about lesser abuses to the Civilian Complaint Review Board have recently declined sharply. Yet spokesmen for black citizens complain of increasing mistreatment and have given wide publicity to some cases. One that preceded the appeal to Washington was the Rev. Lee Johnson's allegation of assault after the police stopped him in Harlem for lacking a front license plate. Though heatedly cited, the complaint has not been pressed in established channels and cannot yet be appraised. Was it, in any case, a passionate incident or part of a trend? Police Commissioner McGuire perceives no dis-turbing trend. He does say that the many young recruits now on street patrol tend to be more aggressive with the public everywhere. Perhaps a fair Congressional hearing can sift some of the allegations and encourage black leaders and city officials to contain this inflammatory controversy. The more important response, however, has to be local, because the discontent involves more than the police. The political influence of blacks, while growing in other cities, has diminished in New York. Blacks have lost the Manhattan borough presidency, which for 25 years gave them a powerful seat on the Board of Estimate. Mayor Koch has not brought blacks to his inner circle to compensate for the loss. The recent campaign to promote a black candidate for schools chancellor stopped Mr. Koch's nominee but still failed when the job went to a Hispanic. The blocked political lines have produced a dangerous petulance on both sides. Mr. Koch's is widely observed; the excesses of his critics have not been so well monitored. Certainly black politicians also have an obligation to demonstrate restraint. And that goes particularly for Representatives Charles Rangel and Major Owens, who apparently promoted the police hearings. But Mr. Koch is the Mayor. It is for him to lead and to demonstrate special sensitivity to the special frustrations of the black community. Of late, he has in fact been reaching out. He is insisting that more blacks and Hispanics fill higher-paying city jobs. He is holding more meetings with black church leaders. He is allocating $28 million to hire unemployed people with low skills and allotting 2,000 city jobs for high school graduates. Mr. Koch can do more, particularly by appointing more blacks to high positions. This is not just a contest between him and some rivals. Racial antagonism is a grave social problem, an American problem, that cries out for statesmanship.

Trash-Can Baby She was found bruised and cold under rumpled paper towels in a trash can in a women's lavatory at Boise State University in Idaho. Doctors said last Sept. 26 that she had just been born and that 85 percent of her brain was missing. A neonatal specialist in Boise said infants like that, with only a brain stem, could survive several months or longer with care. The police were looking for the parents. She is at St. Luke's Hospital in Boise, and a spokesman there, Rita Ryan, reports: ''Her condition is critical - it's been critical since she's been here. She is on oxygen. She is breathing with the help of a respirator and cannot support breathing by herself. She is on intravenous therapy for both nutrition and for medication. Her blood pressure is erratic, and she's receiving medication for that.'' ''The nurses are calling her Ashley,'' Mrs. Ryan says, and the hospital intends to do ''everything to prolong her life as best we can and with every possible medical apparatus we have - we're not making a judgment call or a choice in this.'' At the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, where the child is listed as Baby Girl Ashley, a spokesman says the department has filed in state court to get custody of her for a year. Medicaid funds are paying for her care, the spokesman says. Detective Sgt. Frank Richardson says the Boise police have ''followed up numerous leads'' but have not found the parents.

743-> GLASGOW'S TREASURES BELIE ITS GRITTY IMAGE
R. W. APPLE Jr. is chief of the London bureau of The New York Times. For more than a century Glasgow was the second largest city in the British Empire. The empire and Glasgow's days of glory are only memories now, and the typical foreign visitor to Scotland is more likely to head for Edinburgh or the Highlands, in search of the picturesque, than to tarry in the somewhat sooty precincts of Clydeside. In part, that is Glasgow's own fault; perhaps the greatest of all Victorian cities, it was so thoroughly vandalized during the late 1950's and 1960's by the urban renewers and the lumpen-architects that its more desolate quarters are often used by film makers as a backdrop for pictures set in the Soviet Union or East Germany. But the traveler who seeks to know Scotland and the Scots, and not simply to be charmed, would be well advised to set aside a couple of days for Glasgow - for the chip-on- the-shoulder vigor of its people, for the revelations of its architecture and for the unexpected richness of its cultural life. To these can now be added an extraordinary new attraction, the Burrell Collection, which is justly described by Peter Wilson, the former chairman of Sotheby's, as ''one of the most remarkable assemblages of works of art ever brought together by one man,'' and certainly the best of its kind in Britain. Sir William Burrell was a wealthy Glasgow shipowner with a lifelong passion for collecting. He started collecting at 15 and grew into a kind of Scottish Hearst, some of whose castoffs he bought at bargain prices; a late 12th- century portal from the church at Montron, near Ch^ateau-Thierry, cost Hearst $:4,500 and crossed the Atlantic twice before Burrell scooped it up for a mere $:550.Ever the canny buyer, the Scotsman on another occasion picked up a 14th-century Chinese vase, now worth at least $400,000, for less than ,000. Such bargains enabled him to compete with Morgan and Frick and Widener, even though his fortune was dwarfed by those of the Americans. By the time he died in 1958 at the age of 96, Sir William had assembled more than 8,000 treasures, which he left to the city along with a substantial endowment. Unfortunately, his will specified a location for the projected building that proved unworkable, and the collection spent decades in storage around Glasgow. But finally, after lengthy negotiations with the trustees and enormous difficulties in raising the requisite $30 million, a museum was built in Pollok Country Park, three miles from the center of the city, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on Oct. 21. Its completion, says Sir John Rothenstein, the eminent English art historian, ''gives the city an honored place among the great art centers of Europe.'' The building itself, designed by a little- known English architect named Barry Gasson, is a real joy. At its core are three rooms from Sir William's home, Hutton Castle, in Berwick-on-Tweed; there are also small galleries for objets d'art, and 15 medieval and Renaissance stone doorways have been incorporated into the structure. Wrapped around all of this is a relatively open, glass- walled space devoted to ancient civilizations, to the Orient, to European paintings and tapestries. On two sides, the surrounding lawns and trees seem almost to invade the museum; on a third, the glass wall is used for the highly effective display of stained glass. The stained glass (including 12th-century fragments from Abbot Suger's great cathedral at St. Denis, the first important Gothic building) runs to 700 items, one of the world's finest collections, and only the Metropolitan Museum of New York has comparable holdings of Gothic tapestries (including major items from Germany, Switzerland, France and the Low Countries). But it is the scope of the collection that sets it apart. Sir William assembled an astonishing range of masterpieces in many areas - glowing Virgins by Bellini and Memling; a gently charming ''Judgment of Paris,'' attributed to Domenico Veneziano, the 15th- century Italian painter, by whom only 12 pictures are known to have survived, but more likely by a contemporary, Pesellino, according to recent scholarship; a Rembrandt self- portrait; substantial collections of works by Degas and Manet; fine Chou Dynasty pieces and Neolithic burial urns; a magnificent 12th-century bronze, perhaps German, showing three soldiers holding kite-shaped shields; a Babylonian terra-cotta lion's head; carpets, furniture, porcelain, pottery, jade, gold, silver and glass. Out of Sir William's legacy and other funds, the collection bought the Warwick Vase in 1979 for half a million dollars to keep it from going to the Metropolitan in New York. It, too, can now be seen at the Pollok Country Park, a colossal marble antique, weighing more than eight tons, discovered in Rome in 1771 and so coveted over the next century that it was the first item Napoleon planned to plunder had he succeeded in conquering Britain. Despite recurrent cash crises, the determinedly egalitarian City Council has decreed that admission to the Burrell Collection be free to all; it is open from 10 A. M. to 5 P.M. Monday to Saturday, 2 . to 5 P.M. on Sundays, and closed only on Christmas and New Year's Day. Present-day Glasgow is a hard-drinking, proletarian town, pungent in its humor, and left-wing in its politics since the 1920's. With its great industries, notably shipbuilding, in probably terminal decline, it faces appalling economic problems. Yet its indomitable people, Protestants and Catholics, orange and green, give it a yeastiness foreign to much of Britain; one Glaswegian of my acquaintance describes his fellow townspeople as ''stubborn, individualistic, a little bit pushy and relentlessly straightforward.'' This was the city of James Watt, the great mechanical engineer; of Adam Smith; of Alexander Fleming, the inventor of penicillin; of Sir Thomas Lipton, who made a fortune selling tea and spent it in vain pursuit of the America's Cup; of Lord Reith, the creator of the BBC; and of the master-builders from whose yards came the Cutty Sark and the Lusitania and the Queen Elizabeth 2. It was the city of the Gorbals, once famous as Europe's worst slum. But it was above all the city that epitomized the self-assurance of the Victorian age, and even now, as Jonathan Meades, an associate editor of The Tatler, conceded in a generally baleful piece not long ago, ''it has a vestigial splendor which the cretins have not quite destroyed.'' That splendor is visible in the massive, grimy building of Sir Gilbert Scott's Gothic revival University of Glasgow (1864); in the buildings around George Square, which Maurice Lindsay, the Glaswegian author and critic, calls ''a primer in Victorian excess and elegance,'' and in the work of Alexander (Greek) Thomson, who showed in the Caledonia Road Church and the St. Vincent Street Church, as well as in his row houses along Great Western Terrace, one of which once belonged to Burrell, just how forceful the neo- classical architecture of the second half of the 19th century could be. There is no better place to sense the prosperity, the solidity and the confidence verging on smugness that characterized British life just a century ago. Even then, however, there was a revolutionary spirit stirring in Glasgow. Its greatest exemplar was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Britain's most original 20th-century architect and one of the principal founders of the Modern Movement. Once scorned by his native city, then forgotten, Mackintosh has become a cult figure in the last decade, and happily a number of his buildings, with their bulky outlines lightened by decorative detail in iron and stained glass, have survived. So has a great deal of the elegant furniture, decorated with stylized floral motifs, delicately inlaid, unbelieveably ''modern'' in the clarity of its lines. His masterpiece is the Glasgow School of Art at 167 Renfrew Street, designed in 1896, which clings castle-like to the side of a hill; it has been called the most important proto- modern building in Europe. The library is a triumph of spatial organization. Hill House in Helensburgh, 23 miles northwest of Glasgow, is probably Mackintosh's finest domestic building, designed for the publisher Walter Blackie. It has recently been taken over by The National Trust for Scotland, which has closed it down for repairs until the spring. Normally it is open daily from 1 to 5 P.M. More information on these and other buildings can be had from the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, 870 Garscube Road, which is itself housed in the architect's Queen's Cross Church. The office is open Tuesday, Thursday and Friday afternoons (041-946-6600). Still more Mackintosh can be seen at the Hunterian Gallery, on the west side of the city, where a new wing houses a reconstruction of three floors of the architect's Glasgow home. The same museum also has one of the world's best Whistler collections. Just on the other side of Kelvingrove Park stands the Glasgow Art Gallery, whose collection includes Rembrandt's ''Man in Armor'' and Giorgione's ''Adultress Brought before Christ.'' Many visitors are surprised by the vigor and quality of Glasgow's musical life; if it is not up to the standard of London, it is nonetheless remarkable for a supposedly provincial city on the edge of Europe. At the Theater Royal, restored to its Victorian splendor less than a decade ago, the highly respected Scottish Opera will be offering this winter and next spring productions of ''La Boh eme,'' ''Turandot,'' Rimski-Korsakov's ''Golden Cockerel,'' Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel'' and ''Egisto,'' by Cavalli, the 17th-century Italian composer. Seats can be had for as little as $4 and go up to $25. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra plays about two Sunday nights a month at the City Hall, with soloists of the caliber of Elisabeth S"oderstr"om and Murray Perahia, and the Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Sir Alexander Gibson and others, is there almost every Saturday night. Tickets may be obtained on arrival and are not expensive; $10, for example, will buy the best seat in the house for the concerts. Those in search of a more earthy Glasgow will get a real sense of the style and the accent of the rambunctious Glaswegian at the Barras, a congeries of shops and stalls in the East End. Open only on Saturdays and Sundays, this is the Glasgow equivalent of the Paris flea market, except that its traders sell everything - antiques, food, dresses, video tapes, guitars. If you have Scottish blood, you might call at the newly-established Roots Bureau, housed in Stirling's Library, Royal Exchange Square, where they will discuss what clan you came from, where its ancestral territories lay and other such lore. The service is free. You can then spend yourself silly on kilts and related gear at specialists like Argyle House, 232 Buchanan Street, or R. G. Lawrie Ltd., 110 Buchanan Street. Hotels There are four top-level hotels in Glasgow: the modern, 10-story Albany, slightly to the southwest of the the city center; the neighboring Holiday Inn, considerably grander than its American counterparts; the smaller Grosvenor, on the northwest side of town, which conceals contemporary luxury behind a magnificent classical facade; and the new Skean Dhu, which is in the center of town. In each of the first three, double rooms cost about $70 to $85 a night. The Skean Dhu (whose name refers to the small dagger that forms a part of Highland dress) opened this fall and charges about $70, double. The Centre Hotel, part of the Crest chain, is conveniently located near Central Station; its rooms are about $50. If you prefer to stay outside town, , Houston House at Uphall, 20 miles east (and only nine miles from Edinburgh), offers prettily furnished rooms in an old, white-washed, step-gabled house or in a more modern wing, with the added attractions of a tranquil garden, one of the best wine cellars in Europe and palatable if often clumsily served food. About the same distance to the north, at Dunblane, near Stirling, is the more elaborate Cromlix House, with fine antique furnishings but a certain coldness in atmosphere. Rooms at Houston House cost from $45 to $75, those at Cromlix House from $60 to $120, the latter for quite spectacular suites. Meals at both will range upward from $25 a person, depending on the wines chosen. Restaurants Among the restaurants in Glasgow, it is unfortunately necessary to begin with the warning that the Malmaison in the Central Hotel, Scotland's finest French restaurant only a few years ago, has fallen on hard times. The best at the moment is Poachers on Ruthven Lane, a cozy urban farmhouse, hung with plants; it serves excellent fish dishes, lamb and game birds at prices (about $60 for two) that are fairly stiff for this region. The Ubiquitous Chip at 12 Ashton Lane is more creative (meat loaf in a suet crust, imaginatively stuffed duck) and its wine list is outstanding (and outstandingly good value) but the place is annoyingly inconsistent. About $40 for two. On a less ambitious plane, good open-faced sandwiches are found at the Danish Food Center, 56 St. Vincent Street; and such dishes as coq au vin or steak au poivre, correctly done, at a wine bar called Lautrec's, 14 Woodlands Terrace. Neither should cost more than $10 or $12 a head. Edinburgh For truly outstanding food, it is necessary to drive an hour or so to the east, to the far side of Edinburgh, to two of the most honest and enterprising restaurants in Britain. At Gullane, east of the city, is a tiny, almost doll- size house called La Potini ere, no more than a five-iron shot from the Muirfield golf links. It is open for lunch Monday through Friday and for dinner only on Saturday, and you must book weeks ahead (telephone 0620- 843214), but it is well worth the effort to sample Hilary Brown's set meals, which always include an exquisite soup and often a faultlessly cooked chicken, and David Brown's inexpensive wines. (Only a couple of years ago, he was selling Gruaud Larose '66 for less than $15.) At Peat Inn, northeast of Edinburgh, where David Wilson - as warm, talented and unpretentious as the Browns - offers p^ates, delicious fish and shellfish, lamb, perfectly timed vegetables and another star-studded, judiciously priced wine list. He closes on Sunday and Monday and serves a limited menu at lunch. You can eat in either place for $40 a couple if you order simple wines, which is what you shouldn't do - you'll never find bottles like theirs in the States at such prices. Whisky Tours The big Scotch whisky distillers give tours to interested consumers. One possibility is John Walker & Sons Ltd., Hill Street, Kilmarnock, about 20 miles southwest of Glasgow. Visitors can watch blending and distilling operations at 10:15 A. M. or 2 P. M. by calling J. G. Kennedy, the reception manager (0563-2340l) the day before. (If you are a fan of single-malt whisky, you will find 20 or 30 of the 90-odd in existence at any of the big downtown liquor stores; in Edinburgh the best specialist dealer is William Caidenhead, who sells an enormous range, including some that are 37 years old.) Information on tours and sightseeing in Glasgow is available at the Tourist Information Bureau, George Square, Glasgow, Scotland G2 1ES (041-221-6136). . R. W. A. Jr.

744-> ESSAY; TURNING BACK FANATICS
At terrible cost, the Reagan Administration has come to the conclusion that it has been wrong in its basic assumptions about the Middle East: The danger to peace there is neither Israel nor the Palestinian refugees. At the core of all turmoil is Syria, with its Soviet offensive arms enclave and its alliance with militant Iranian fundamentalists. Last year, blind to this reality, Mr. Reagan joined the worldwide diplomatic and media assault on the Israelis after their defeat of the Syrians and the P.L.O. in Lebanon. He snatched an American defeat from the jaws of an Israeli victory. That's past; give the President credit for recognizing his mistake and moving now to undo the damage his policy caused. His first step has been to assuage the suspicion of our only reliable ally in the region. Israel, now stung by the same coordinated bomb attacks that brought the U.S. and France out of their lethargy, has been listening to U.S. proposals of military cooperation. We will help the Israelis produce their Lavie aircraft; we will position more than bandages in Israel for quick response to Communist or fundamentalist power grabs; we will finance Israeli technical aid to U.S. allies in Africa and Latin America. At the same time, we are likely to stop sticking our diplomatic thumb in Israel's eye: Recently we told Liberia not to locate its new embassy in Jerusalem, a foolish interference that pandered to Arab sensibilities. Our secret plan to arm a new Arab Legion under King Hussein's command has been wisely stopped by Congress, and was given the coup de grace by Jordan's vote supporting the Soviet- Nicaraguan move in the U.N. Security Council to condemn U.S. action in Grenada. To demonstrate our steadfastness, we can no longer shy away from our responsibility as guarantor of the treaties we have pressed our ally to sign. We are paying Egypt's bills while President Mubarak ignores his commitment to return his Ambassador to Israel and to halt anti-Semitic propaganda. America's word is also on the line in our painfully negotiated Lebanese- Israeli agreement. Syria is pressuring the Lebanese to break the agreement, thereby insuring Syrian dominance; in weeks to come, we will hear American fainthearts demanding that Israel renegotiate its deal in the interests of ''national reconciliation.'' Such appeasement would embolden the Soviet-Syrian forces, dismember Lebanon and dishearten our ally. Face it: In dealing with Syria's dictator - who coolly ordered the murder of tens of thousands of his own people, as well as Mr. Arafat and the U.S. marines - only force counts. No cease-fire was attainable in Lebanon until the 16-inch guns of the battleship New Jersey started shelling Syria's proxies; suddenly, sweet reason prevailed in Damascus. In the same way, only a credible threat to Syrian offensive missiles, many manned by Russians, will stop the Syrian dictator from seeking to conquer Lebanon or the Russians from taking over the Middle East. That credible threat can come from two sources. One is Israel, which needs to remind Syrian dictator Assad that the skill and the will that humiliated his forces a year ago has not been lost during the time of American lesson- learning and Israeli economic-political melancholia. This week, Syria's Iranian bomb squad inflicted a defeat on Israel's army; the first Israeli retaliation (pointedly not condemned by the Americans or French) cannot be the final retaliation. The other deterrent to Soviet- Syrian expansion must come from us. The challenge is unmistakable: The killing of 230 marines awaits what Mr. Reagan calls ''justice.'' Secretary of State George Shultz told Congress that Iran was ''the regime of fanatics,'' and that a high Iranian official praised the ''Muslim people'' who ''dealt with the U.S. and France in such a way that they have learned their lesson.'' The Secretary added that ''Syria must bear a share of responsibility for any Iranian actions in Lebanon . . .'' As one U.S. policy maker puts it, ''We've just about had it with the Iranians.'' That means our neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war is tilting toward Iraq; third parties will soon be providing arms with U.S. components to forces fighting Iran and its ally, Syria. More important, the American bloodletting in Beirut means that superpower forces on the scene are not immune to local conflict. Washington should make it clear to Moscow that Israeli or American retaliation that hits the Soviet-Syrian or Syrian-Iranian alliance where it hurts is a measured response to irresponsible, if unintended, provocation and should not be cause for further escalation. Never has the U.S.-Israeli alliance been more necessary for both countries; as in Grenada, the danger is greater not to act than to act.

745-> GRENADIANS WELCOMED INVASION, A POLL FINDS
An overwhelming majority of the people of Grenada welcomed the United States invasion of their island, according to a poll conducted Thursday by CBS News. They felt that American troops had come to free them from the Cubans and prevent the construction of a military base. The poll showed that a smaller but solid majority said they had felt in danger under the Government of Gen. Hudson Austin, who seized power last month. Another solid majority said they believed that Cubans were building the island's new airport for Cuban and Soviet military purposes, not for economic development or tourism. The poll of 304 people was conducted by 15 Grenadian interviewers, in 30 sectors of the island. Each interviewer read questions to and took down answers from about 20 people, saying he or she was conducting a ''public opinion poll'' but not saying who was sponsoring the survey. Warren J. Mitofsky, director of the Election and Survey Unit for CBS News, supervised the polling. He said yesterday in a telephone interview from Barbados, ''While a poll of this sort carries a margin of error higher than that of a standard probability sample, we are very confident of the thrust of our findings as a measurement of Grenadian opinion.'' In a standard probability sample, the margin of error for a survey of this size would be plus or minus 6 percentage points. 'Glad the Troops Came' Ninety-one percent of those polled said they were ''glad the United States troops came to Grenada,'' while only 8 percent said they wished they had never come. A similar majority of 85 percent said they felt they or their family were in danger while General Austin was in power, while 11 percent said they were not. When asked about how they felt under General Austin's predecessor, Maurice Bishop, 33 percent said they believed they were in danger then, while 48 percent said they were not. The Grenadians' attitudes toward the Cubans were strongly hostile. Seventy-six percent said they believed Cuba wanted to take control of the Grenadian Government, and 65 percent said they believed the airport was being built for Cuban and Soviet military purposes. Only 17 percent said they had seen Cubans carrying weapons before the Americans arrived. The attitudes toward General Austin and the Cubans appeared to carry over into a warm welcome for the American troops, the CBS News Poll showed. Eighty-five percent said they felt the American purpose in invading was to ''free the people of Grenada from the Cubans,'' and 81 percent said American troops were ''courteous and considerate.'' A smaller share of those interviewed, 62 percent, said they felt the American troops had come ''to save the lives of Americans living here.'' But only 21 percent said they believed that the troops had been sent ''for the United States' own military purposes rather than to help the people of Grenada.''

746-> FOR GRENADA, A SMALL, SAD REVOLUTION
Ten years ago, just as Grenada was becoming independent, Bernard Coard, a Brandeis University-trained economist, sat in the house of his old friend, Maurice Bishop, a London-trained lawyer, and told a reporter from New York that Eric M. Gairy, the man about to become Prime Minister of this tiny island state, was ''clinically mad.'' Now, Mr. Bishop, who overthrew Mr. Gairy in 1979, is dead, killed by soldiers apparently loyal to Mr. Coard. Mr. Coard is in the custody of United States forces. Mr. Gairy says he plans to return from exile. And ordinary people say passionately that they want no more politics after suffering the effects of a schism among revolutionaries that, in its small way, was as sharp as those that turned Robespierre against Danton and Stalin against Trotsky. A power struggle that seems to have involved a personality clash cloaked in revolutionary jargon came into the open last month and led to ''Bloody Wednesday,'' the day when Mr. Bishop, freed from house arrest by youthful followers, was carried to the fortress. There troops, acting in support of Mr. Coard, the Deputy Prime Minister, fired and killed Mr. Bishop and at least 16 of his supporters, according to eyewitnesses. ''That was the day the revolution died,'' said James Sylvester, a worker who, like many Grenadians, admired Mr. Bishop and accepted his guidance and leftist rhetoric without apparently taking it too seriously. But the fight within the Central Committee of the party that governed this island of tourism, sun and nutmegs, may have changed the politics of the Caribbean. Certainly if it were not for Mr. Bishop's death, the American landing here would not have been so welcomed. It was Mr. Bishop who first announced and approved the building of the large airfield that aroused Washington's suspicions. It was he who approved the creation of the Marxist- style mass organizations and welcomed Cuban and East German support. Mr. Bishop also traveled to Washington last summer in what appears to have been an overture to the West, perhaps brought on by his growing isolation within the ruling clique. The legacy of bizarre politics continues to shape events on the island. Mr. Gairy, while in office, sought to alert the world to the menace of flying saucers. He squashed all opposition using a group of gunmen who had styled themselves the Mongoose Gang and which he renamed first the Secret Police, then the Night Ambush Squad and finally Volunteers for the Defense of Fundamental Human Liberties. At the basis of the power struggle that ensued four years after Mr. Bishop ousted Mr. Gairy, as nearly anyone can figure it out, was simple jealousy on the part of those who thought that Mr. Bishop was too charismatic and that people liked him too much. As for Mr. Bishop, he appears to have been corrupted by power, according to those who knew him. ''At the beginning, Maurice was really interested in social justice, not socialism,'' said Lloyd Noel, a lawyer and former Attorney General. Last week, Mr. Noel was freed from the jail cell where he had been detained without charges for more than two years with the approval of his longtime friend. But, he explained, ''it was easier to be in opposition than to govern. At first, I noticed that we never implemented any of the things we had demanded as opposition. We had attacked Gairy for confiscating estates but we never returned them. Little by little I could see Maurice proving the truth of Lord Acton's phrase'' about absolute power corrupting absolutely. Evidence of the break between the Bishop and Coard factions lies in the notes of the Central Committee meeting on Sept. 19, 20 and 21. The waterlogged mimeographed minutes were found in the ruins of Mr. Bishop's home. They involve endless discussions by the 16 members of the Central Committee of a plan submitted by Mr. Coard, calling for collective leadership and a curb on Mr. Bishop's power. The Prime Minister would still deal with the masses but the decisions on economic development and the army were to be made by the Coard faction. Mr. Bishop appears to have rejected Mr. Coard's plan. The coup and Bloody Wednesday followed. When some of the eastern Caribbean islands and the United States moved in to fill the power vacuum, their forces, reviled weeks before as agents of imperialism, were welcomed as saviors. Mr. Bishop, who did some of that reviling himself, is now being called a martyr and is being disassociated from the policies of the New Jewel Movement he founded. The Governor General, Sir Paul Scoon, is expected to name a ''nonpolitical'' provisional administration this week and has promised elections within a year. Members of Mr. Bishop's movement and Sir Eric Gairy will be allowed to participate, ''provided they had no criminal charges against them.'' More bizarre politics may be in the offing.

747-> FIRST CYSTIC FIBROSIS HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANT DONE
A team of surgeons at Presbyterian- University Hospital in Pittsburgh has performed a heart-and-lung transplant on a Buffalo man whose own organs had been deteriorated by cystic fibrosis. The two-organ transplant was the first known to be performed on a victim of cystic fibrosis. The patient, 25-year-old Richard Dinsbier, of East Aurora, a suburb of Buffalo, was reported in serious condition yesterday. The six-hour opertion was performed Oct. 29 under the supervision of Dr. Bartley Griffith, a specialist in transplant surgery. Mr. Dinsbier's condition was what might be expected after such surgery, a spokesman for the hospital said. It was somewhat improved from immediately after the surgery, when the hospital listed him as critical. 'We Admire His Bravery' Dr. Gerd Cropp, Mr. Dinsbier's personal physician, said it was too soon to determine the patient's medical outlook or whether the operation might be valuable to other victims of cystic fibrosis, which has no known cure. ''We do not want to build up false hopes,'' said Dr. Cropp, a professor of pediatrics at the State University of New York in Buffalo and director of the Children's Lung and Cystic Fibrosis Center at Children's Hospital there. ''It was a first effort and we admire his bravery.'' Heart-lung transplants have been done before, on heart patients, but not with much frequency. The Pittsburgh hospital, one of the leaders in such surgery, has only done seven heart-lung transplants. Dr. Robert Beall, national director of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, said the surgery would provide researchers with new information not only on a new way to treat the illness, but also on the nature of how it attacks the body. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that causes a clogging of glands that secret mucus and other fluids. This condition in turn can weaken the heart, make the lungs more susceptible to infection and disrupt the digestive system. It is believed to occur about once in every 2,000 births. About 30,000 Americans have been diagnosed as having it. Disorder Began in Childhood Dr. Cropp said Mr. Dinsbier first exhibited symptoms of cystic fibrosis at age 6. But even then, the disorder was not too debilitating and he led a relatively normal life, that included completing high school and attending an engineering school. But two years ago, the more benign phase of Mr. Dinsbier's case ended and the situation worsened, Dr. Cropp said, Because the cystic fibrosis affected lung tissue, it became harder and harder for Mr. Dinsbier's heart to push blood through it. The result was that there were signs of an approaching failure of the right side of the heart. He also suffered a chronic lung infection that resembled bronchitis, according to Dr. Cropp. Surgeons felt that they might achieve a better result if both the heart and the lungs were transplanted as a unit, Dr. Beall said. Mr. Dinsbier had waited six months for a donor. At 5:30 P.M. on Oct. 29, Dr. Cropp was notified that a heart and lung donation was available in Pittsburgh. The donor, Stephen G. Mike, 32, was a homicide victim. Mr. Dinsbier was flown there immediately by private plane and the surgery began at about midnight of that day. In an effort to minimize the chance that Mr. Dinsbier's body would reject the transplanted heart and lungs, the hospital gave him cyclosporine, an experimental drug that received tentative approval from the Food and Drug Administration in September. The drug acts to suppress the body's natural rejection of foreign cells. The hospital spokesman said doctors would watch the patient closely for several weeks for signs of rejection. Dr. Joseph E. Rutecki, the physician in charge of the Buffalo area Office of Health Systems Management for the New York State Department of Health, said that Mr. Dinsbier received Medicaid benefits and that he expected the state Medicaid program to pick up half the cost. He said the Federal Government was expected to pick up the other half.

748-> ENVIRONEWS
TWO state advisory councils are preparing a report for Governor Kean on acid rain. It will be a basis for the Governor's first concrete proposal on the subject, which he will present to the Council of Northeast Governors (CONEG) next month. Acid rain or, more accurately, acid deposition will be one of the main topics at a conference of the council to be held at the Meadowlands Hilton on Dec. 4 and 5, said Herbert Wortreich, Assistant Director, Air and Noise Quality, of the state's Division of Environmental Quality, an arm of the Department of Environmental Protection. Mr. Wortreich said that the Governor's Science Advisory Committee and the Clean Air Council were compiling a report based on testimony taken at a hearing in Trenton last month. The hearing, he said, was held to assess the known or potential environmental and economic effects of acid deposition on surface waters, wildlife, marine life, vegetation, property, recreation and agriculture. ''The Governor is chairman this year of CONEG,'' Mr. Wortreich said, ''and the report being generated will serve as the basis for a proposal to the council.'' Acid deposition occurs when the sulfuric byproducts of fossil-fuel combustion - from motor vehicles and industry, for example - combine in the atmosphere and return to the earth as acid rain, snow, mist and even dust particles. The testimony last month indicated that probably millions of dollars in damage was being done in New Jersey to buildings, automobile finishes and natural resources such as fish and pine forests. However, as previously reported, scientists and state officials are uncertain if these effects can be both qualified and quantified because of previous damage from other sources of pollution. For further information on the conference, call Cindy Gordon at the D.E.P.: (609) 292-5383. Meanwhile, the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions is preparing for the first statewide measurement of acid rain. With $35,000 in private grants, it has recruited 230 volunteers who will attend courses starting Nov. 15. Ann Morris, a spokesman for the Mendham-based association, said that volunteers would use rain gauges and be told how and when to regularly test for acid deposition near their homes for 15 months. She said it was hoped the measurements would be compiled into an interpretive report. Water Violations Debra Kaufman, a spokesman for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit citizens' organization, said that 100 volunteers donned old clothes and hip boots last weekend to inspect 15 rivers and streams for pollution and other water-quality violations. Although the results will not be reported and the names of the companies released for a few more days, Miss Kaufman said, two of 10 illegal discharges found were said to have been in a tributary of the Raritan River in New Brunswick and Assupink Creek in Trenton, one of the Delaware River's feeder streams. Miss Kaufman explained that the violations were being checked against the terms of the companies' respective pollution permits under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System, a permit system of the Federal Clean Water Act. The system defines the classes and volumes of waste that can be emptied into a waterway and the means used to discharge them. Miss Kaufman said that the 10 suspected violators either had no permit for outfall lines or that the wastes were above normal temperature or acidity. The complaints will be put in writring, Miss Kaufman said, and be submitted to the Department of Environmental Protection for legal or administrative action. That state agency is now responsible for enforcing the pollution discharge regulations, she said. Last May, the public-interest group sued 19 companies found to be illegally discharging waste into rivers and streams. Edward Lloyd, its lawyer, said that 15 of those cases were being adjudicated and four were being negotiated with the companies. Among the companies sued were Public Service Electric and Gas, Monsanto Chemical and Southland Chemical. According to Miss Kaufman, these companies had 100 or more violations that they themselves reported regularly to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, but for which no action was taken. However, she said, because of manpower limitations, both the E.P.A., and now the Department of Environmental Protection ''don't go out to check these violators on a regular basis like we can but, instead, go out maybe once a year.'' ''The regulatory agencies were seldom taking any action against these polluters,'' Miss Kaufman said.

751-> FLEA MARKETS: A BUYER'S GUIDE
THE season of the flea market is upon us, that succession of weekends in the summer when collectors, the merely curious and the compulsive pore through piles of collectibles in search of serendipitous discoveries at outdoor markets in parking lots, at race tracks, on town greens and in sports stadiums. This year, by all accounts, they will be looking for relics of the steamship era of the 1920's, when trans-Atlantic crossings were social and historical events. In other years, it was memorabilia of Shirley Temple, particularly a blue cereal dish bearing her picture; old postcards and theatrical posters, duck decoys, 1940's furniture, glass paperweights and copies of Hummel figures made in Japan. For many, a flea market is a place to indulge in not very serious interests, a reasonable excuse for a country outing. For others, however, such as antiques and collectible dealers, the flea market is a place to do business. In the metropolitan area, which is in the heart of the Northeast's concentration of flea markets, there is a wide variety of markets to choose from. There are markets filled with weekend sellers peddling haphazard collections of everything from old toasters to mismatched crockery and dog-eared magazines, and there are true antiques fairs, often outdoor extensions of indoor shops. There are crafts exhibitions selling homemade jewelry and ceramics, and there are outdoor showcases for manufacturers of inexpensive clothing, luggage, belts and purses. Sales counters are more often than not old folding tables, flatbeds of small trucks, station-wagon tailgates or simply boxes or overturned milk cartons, none of which seems to bother the many, many thousands of buyers who crowd into these flea markets each weekend from early summer until the first touches of cold in late October. Although there will still be searchers after cottage furniture, old tin weather vanes, quilts and samplers, buttons, Art Deco crockery, Big Little Books from the 1930's, early Matchbox cars and Shirley Temple items, this year anything tied to the major trans-Atlantic shipping companies like the Cunard and United States Lines will do. This includes baggage labels, timetables, brochures, posters and advertisements, including advertisements on tin. Steamship travel of an earlier era is also of interest -broadsides for coastal steamers of the mid-19th century, sidewheelers from New York, bound for Virginia and other coastal ports. There is also a growing interest in old photographs - of towns before the pavements came, of family groups, of old steam trains, tintypes. This information comes from Russell Carrell, who has been called the ''father of the American flea market,'' and who should know. ''The markets are bigger than ever,'' Mr. Carrell said the other day, pausing in the midst of the chores of closing down a charity flea market in Connecticut and packing for another, in Northfield, Mass. Start in an Open Field Mr. Carrell organized his first flea market in 1958 in an open field behind his home in Salisbury, Conn. He conceived the idea of adapting the structure of the Marche aux Puces, the Parisian flea market, and ended up with 80 dealers, mostly friends, who paid $1 each to set up in his field. Since then flea markets have become a big, and growing, business. Dealers in authentic, rare and expensive antiques set up weekend shops in these summer markets, and people who have for years augmented their incomes with the markets have been joined by young professionals and craftsmen. For many, the flea markets are social affairs. And in this new age of barter, some people have come to regard the ad hoc selling practices of the flea markets with fondness. But there are purists, like Mr. Carrell, who regard the flea market as an antiques market. ''To some extent, even though there are more of them, there is a disintegration of the flea market,'' Mr. Carrell says. ''I had a fellow call me to ask if my market was selling new sunglasses. New sunglasses indeed! That's not what flea markets are about.'' These days, however, the flea market is whatever one cares to make of it. Used toasters or Delft cups, old alligator belts or newly tanned cowhide saddlebags, Depression or Libby glass - it's all out FLEA MARKET SITES AND SCHEDULES there.

752-> Possible Guilt, Certain Death
Charles Knapp will miss his appointment in Arizona's gas chamber today. The state should be just as relieved as he is that a Federal court has stayed the event. Mr. Knapp may be guilty of child neglect, even abuse, but did he burn his daughters to death? Soberingly, it seems possible that someone else committed the crimes for which he was to die. Debates about capital punishment rarely turn on the guilt of prisoners. Everyone assumes guilt, assumes that endless appeals guard against executing an innocent person. Haven't four of the nine men executed since 1977 actually asked for death by dropping their appeals? An article about the Knapp case in The American Lawyer shows that appeals, even when they drag on for a long time, do not exhaustively demonstrate the justice of an execution. On the contrary: as the rate of executions accelerates, so does the risk of error. Mr. Knapp confessed to the police in Mesa, Ariz., that he set the bedroom fire in which his two young daughters died. That exonerated Linda Hobbs, his former wife, who had also been a suspect. But the magazine quotes authorities in Ogden, Utah, where Linda Hobbs had started a new family, as saying she was a suspect in the setting of fires in her new home and had repeatedly been investigated for alleged abuse of three children from the subsequent marriage. Also, Mr. Knapp's lawyers have obtained an affidavit from her now estranged second husband saying she told him she had set the Arizona fire. The new evidence notwithstanding, Arizona's Supreme Court, by a 2-to-2 vote, refused to delay the execution until a hearing could be held. The prosecutors are skeptical about the second husband's motive, since he now seeks custody of the three later children. And one Arizona judge suggests that even if Linda Hobbs is implicated, that still would not clear Mr. Knapp. True, but it surely would require more conscientious investigating by the police. And what if it developed that both parents were guilty? Would the state send them both to the gas chamber? Fortunately, a Federal judge in Phoenix ordered the execution delayed - for other reasons. That buys time to reexamine the case. This experience should add to the concerns of all who favor capital punishment. Societies that insist on executing people need to be more than just pretty sure.

755-> Defender Takes 2 From Courageous
In southwesterly winds that built from 8 to 17 knots on hazy Rhode Island Sound, Defender today won two races from Courageous in the trials to select the America's Cup defender. Defender, sailed by Tom Blackaller, crossed the starting line in the first race 14 seconds ahead of Courageous, never was caught and won by 28 seconds. Courageous lost the second race when its bowman, Robbie Young, fell into the water on the approach to the second upwind mark of the 14-mile windward-leeward course with Courageous holding a slight lead. Young had fallen overboard the day before but clung onto to a sheet and was hauled back on board. Today, Courageous circled back to retrieve him and lost a minute. Defender went on to win by 1:12. The third race was abandoned at the start after Defender broke its mast car, a fitting that carries the mainsail up the track. In the series to select the foreign challenger to the cup, Canada 1 won its matches from France 3 and Advance to move into second place in the standing.

756-> Storm Washes Oil Away
A severe storm that swept in from the Pacific early Thursday may have washed away the last oil from the wreckage of a Japanese freighter off the coast here, Coast Guard officials said, and the rough water should wash all the oil on the beach back to sea. About 70,000 gallons of crude oil and diesel fuel was on board the 350-foot Blue Magpie when it ran aground outside Yaquina Bay in a storm Saturday.

758-> AROUND THE WORLD; Zimbabwe Insurgents Kill a White Farmer
Anti-Government rebels shot and killed a white farmer in southwest Zimbabwe, officials said today. Ian Brebner, 39 years old, was shot in the chest Tuesday after being approached by about eight gunmen at the Lushabi Outspan Farm, 40 miles west of Bulawayo in Matabeleland Province, a Government statement said. Matabeleland farmers were armed with automatic weapons this year in an effort to curb anti-Government violence in which more than 100 people, 23 of them white, have died. Mr. Brebner's family moved into Bulawayo this year because of the security problems.

759-> CRITICS' CHOICE
ART When the New York Public Library puts on a show of illustrated books, it doesn't fool around. So rich are its own collections that when it displays first published editions of almost anything you might name, it can often accompany them with original sketches, drawings and manuscripts. A case in point is its current show, ''Blake to Beardsley: English Illustrated Books of the 19th Century'' (in the entrance hall of the Central Research Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, through February). In it there are not only splendid examples of books but original sketches and watercolors for them by such famous illustrators as Kate Greenaway, Randolph Caldecott, George Cruikshank, William Makepeace Thackeray and William Blake himself. The exhibition, assembled by Bernard McTigue, curator of the Library's Arents Collections, highlights important 19th-century developments in publishing, such as the new genres of natural history and children's literature, and the use of lithography and photography to widen the audience for illustrated books. Among the other gems here are Aubrey Beardsley's elaborate illustrations for Pope's ''Rape of the Lock'' and Sir Thomas Malory's ''Morte d'Arthur''; a jumbo-size book on the parrot family illustrated by the nonsense versifier Edward Lear; another huge lithographed text, ''Ceremonial for the Coronation of George IV,'' showing a stately procession of royal personages topped by a flashy gold tablet giving the order of their appearance; and one of a seven-part series called ''Sun Artists'' that boasts the work of the Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Current books pale before them. Grace Glueck

There are players who aim to be correct always correct even if it means agreeing correctly to correct draws. They feel a taint of error everywhere and want to distance themselves from it. Charging forward into uncomprehended complications is distasteful. it goes counter to their desire for exact calculation in all its purity. They do not mind frequent draws but use them as proof of their point that the game was level at the start of play and no one made a mistake. In addition to these purists, there are the fighters, those who aim to win. They must at times have the feeling that the position is escaping their control, but they consider that to be a temporary discomfort and throw themselves into the battle as vigorously as ever. It is not hard to tell where Lev Alburt, a New York grandmaster, and Sergei Kudrin, a Stamford, Conn. international master, stand on the matter: Their game in the Heraldica Ruslan International Tournament in New York was one of the most exciting in the event. Alburt's 5 P B3 sought to entice 5 . . . P K4?! when White could either have chanced a gambit with 6 N N5!?, Q R5ch; 7 P N3, QxBP; 8 QN B3, or settled for a slight positional advantage with 6 N B5, P Q4; 7 PxP, QxP; 8 QxQ, BxQ; 9 P K4. Against Kudrin's hippopotamus formation, 15 P QN4, aiming for positional pressure on the queenside, was probably more efficient than trying to work up an attack on the black king. The move also took away Black's QB4 square from his QN. The aggressive, dynamic thrust, 19 . . . P Q4!?, occurs so often in this type of formation that it deserves to be termed the hippopotamus's revenge. In this particular position, it initiated complicated, unclear play. After 20 KPxP, PxP, it was possible to try 21 P B5, but after 21 . . . P QN4; 22 N B3, N B5; 23 BxN, QPxB; 24 P QR4, PxP, it is doubtful that White has achieved anything 25 NxP would have been answered strongly by 25 . . . N Q4! With 21 N KB5, Alburt hoped to catch the black king position underdefended. But even after 25 QxP, Black possessed great defensive resources 25 . . . N R4; 26 QxN, Q K4! threatened 27 . . . Q K8ch followed by mate. After 30 . . . B B5, Alburt had a pawn ahead ending, but Kudrin's passed QBP and powerful bishops were bound to be difficult if not impossible to overcome. After 31 . . . B N1, it was impossible to take a pawn with 32 NxP? because 32 . . . B R2 will lead to the win of a piece. On 32 K B1, Kudrin could have played 32 . . . B B3!; 33 N B3 (33 NxP?, P B6; 34 R Q1, B B5 would have won at least a rook because there would be no dealing with the threat of 35 . . . P B7), P N4; 34 R Q1, P B4; 35 N B2, BxRP with a winning position. However, time pressure rushed his hand to 32 . . . P N4?; 33 N B5. After 36 R Q5, Kudrin would still have had the upper hand with 36 . . . B B5!, since 37 NxPch?, BxN; 38 RxB, B K6ch; 39 K B1, P B6; 40 N Q3, P B7 would have won for Black. After 36 . . . K N3?!; 37 P N3, he should have played 37 . . . P B5 to free his KB. Instead, he blundered with 37 . . . B N8ch?; 38 KxB, RxN, bringing himself into a cul de sac after 39 R Q8!, B K3; 40 K B2. Black now had to lose a piece because 40 . . . R K4; 41 P B4, RxN; 42 PxR wins easily for White. Lost anyway, Kudrin blundered again with 42 . . . K N4?, permitting Alburt to set up a mating net with 43 R Q6, and gave up.ENGLISH OPENINGWhiteBlackWhiteBlackAlburtKudrinAlburtKudrin1P QB4P QB42N KB3P QN33P Q4PxP4NxPB N25P B3P Q36P K4P K37N B3N KB38B K2B K290 00 010K R1P QR311B K3QN Q212Q Q2Q B213KR Q1QR B114QR B1Q N11 5P QN4KR K116P QR3N K417Q R2P R318N R4B Q119Q Q2P Q420KPxPPxP21N KB5NxQBP22BxNRxB23RxRPxR24BxRPPxB25QxPN R426QxNQ K427K N1B KB328N R6chK N229QxQBxQ30N N4B B531R Q4B N132K B1P N433N B5B B134K B2P B435N K3BxP36R Q5K N337P N3B N8ch38KxBRxN39R Q8B K340K 41NxBP R442N B4chK N443R Q6 Resigns KUDRIN/BLACK BuBhr k b B p B pwB BtBU B B N B NWp B B WB B P B B B B PW B R B K ALBURT/WHITE 8/14/83 Position after 25 QxP

761-> DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS TELL OF COMMITMENTS TO MEDICARE
Democratic Presidential candidates appealed today for support from the elderly, whose representatives said health care costs and the future of Medicare would be an important issue in the 1984 election. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Senators Alan Cranston of California and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida spoke at the annual meeting of the National Council of Senior Citizens, whose local affiliates have more than four million members. The candidates denounced President Reagan for attempting to cut programs that serve the elderly, and they promised to preserve the Medicare program. However, they did not say how they would avert the bankruptcy of the Medicare trust fund, which finances hospital care for the elderly. The Reagan Administration and the Congressional Budget Office have both said that Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will run out of money by 1990. Tribute Paid to Pepper The candidates all paid tribute to Representative Claude D. Pepper, Democrat of Florida, who said he hoped that 500 to 1,000 of the 3,931 delegates to the 1984 Democratic convention would be elderly people. The process of courting the elderly, one of many special-interest groups wooed by the Democratic candidates, reflects the growing politicial significance of older citizens, who constitute nearly 16 percent of the voting-age population. In a household survey by the Census Bureau after the 1980 Presidential election, 65 percent of people 65 old or older said they had voted, against a turnout rate of 59 percent for the entire electorate. The National Council of Senior Citizens, founded in 1961 in the fight for Medicare, has just established a political action committee. William R. Hutton, executive director of the council, asserted, ''Since older people vote in the largest numbers of any segment of the population, the senior vote will be an important factor in determining who will be elected the next President of the United States.'' Cranston Cites His Age Senator Cranston, who at 69 is the oldest of the Democratic candidates, said his age was an advantage. ''Principles and values don't decline with age,'' he said. ''They grow stronger.'' Mr. Cranston also said: ''Medicare is the biggest crisis that senior citizens now face. Our most immediate and pressing task is to defend Medicare against a ruthless raid by Ronald Reagan and David Stockman.'' Mr. Stockman is the Federal budget director. Mr. Mondale said Mr. Reagan opposed Medicare in 1965 when it was created and now, he said, ''President Reagan is trying to repeal Medicare by stealth, and we're not going to let him get away with it.'' Over the last two years, Mr. Reagan has often vowed that he had a commitment to the elderly and to Medicare. In an address before a joint session of Congress on Feb. 18, 1981, he asserted, ''Medicare will not be cut.'' Medicare Reductions Projected The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, as a result of laws passed in the last two years, total Medicare outlays for 1982 through 1986 will have been reduced $21.6 billion below what they would have otherwise been. Even with the cutbacks, however, the cost of Medicare is expected to continue rising, from $50.4 billion in the fiscal year 1982 to $83.2 billion in 1986. Mr. Askew said his actions as Governor had proved his commitment to the elderly. ''We increased state spending on programs and services to senior citizens from $57 million to $133 million,'' he said. ''We barred age discrimination in employment. We eliminated mandatory retirement for government workers. We improved conditions in our nursing homes. We passed legislation allowing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for prescriptions and thus made medicines available to senior citizens at cheaper prices.'' Senator Hollings, anticipating questions from the audience, explained why he had voted against the Social Security Amendments of 1983, designed to insure the solvency of the system for the next 75 years, and why he had proposed a freeze on cost-of-living adjustments, which increase benefits to keep pace with inflation. Explanations of His Actions Mr. Hollings said he disliked the Social Security compromise because it increased the normal retirement age for full benefits, increased payroll tax rates, introduced a tax on benefits and ''delved into general revenues for $60 billion over the next six years.'' The proposed freeze would apply to defense spending as well as to benefit payments, he said, and it was based on the principle of ''shared sacrifice.'' In a speech scheduled before the organization on Friday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy plans to outline a program he says would save Medicare without reducing benefits or increasing taxes. Aides to the Massachusetts Democrat said his proposal called for comprehensive cost controls on hospitals and new incentives to discourage the admission of patients who could be treated outside hospitals.

763-> REGENTS URGE 11% RISE IN STATE AID TO SCHOOLS
The State Board of Regents yesterday proposed an increase of $569 million in state aid for elementary and secondary education, including a basic grant of $400 per pupil to each local school district to help pay for the Regents' plan for raising educational standards. The proposal, for the 1984-85 school year, would reduce allocations to affluent districts while increasing amounts to poor districts, and the Regents have devised a formula they think may make the approach acceptable to the Governor and the Legislature. The Regents' proposal represents an 11.7 percent increase over the $4.86 billion in aid now being provided to the state's 703 school districts. They spend a total of $12.2 billion a year after adding local and Federal revenues. There is an increase of $195.1 million in the proposal for New York City, 13.1 percent more in state aid than this year. The state's five largest cities and almost all the rural school districts would get increased state aid, according to the Regents, who make up the state agency reponsible for settting educational policy. The elected officials are not obligated to put the Regents' fiscal proposals into effect, and in recent years state aid has been provided in ways that protected the affluent districts that the Regents had designated for less assistance. Interest in New Approach Spokesmen for the Governor and the legislative leaders were noncommital yesterday on the latest proposal by the Regents, but there was interest in the new approach. ''The approach deserves serious consideration,'' said Charles Dumas, a spokesman for Warren M. Anderson, leader of the Republic majority in the State Senate. ''However, many things will be considered, mainly involving the availability of resources and how much the Governor incorporates for education in his budget proposal.'' Hank Dullea, an education spokesman for Governor Cuomo, said that ''with the Regents' action plan this year, the proposal will obviously get careful consideration.'' Thomas Frey of Rochester, one of the 16 members of the Board of Regents, said: ''This approach is amazingly fair, and I think the Legislature will accept it as a response to the unfairness of the past.'' Schools would need additional funds to comply with proposals by the Regents to increase requirements in science, math and foreign languages, institute courses in computer literacy and lengthen the school year. In other action yesterday, the Regents turned down a proposal by the State University College at New Paltz to create baccalaureate programs in engineering. The Regents also asked for an increase in the Tuition Assistance Program for college students, recommending that the maximum aid for an undergraduate be increased from $2,200 to $2,700. Annual Meeting in City The meeting was at the the New York City office of the Board of Regents, at 622 Third Avenue, where the panel convenes each November.The newly proposed basic grant of $400 for mandated services would replace both the flat grant of $360 per pupil and part of the so-called save- harmless grant. The flat grant goes to districts regardless of need; the save-harmless grant is a supplement for the wealthy districts so that a district does not get less than it received the previous year even if the formula calls for less. Officials of the State Education Department, the administrative arm of the Regents, maintain that the termination of the two provisions, which the Regents have advocated in the past, might be more acceptable because the $400 grants would offset some of the loss. The only Regent to vote against the proposal was J. Edward Meyer 3d, of Chappaqua. In the past he has opposed efforts to eliminate flat grants and save-harmless grants because so many districts in Westchester County were receiving them. He said, however, that ''on balance, I am very pleased with this new approach.'' ''I would like to think that by voting against the Regents' aid proposals in past years I had a role in bringing about this new approach,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''And in that spirit I will vote against it again this year to get you to do even better next year.'' Mr. Meyer said the approach would reduce aid to half the districts in Westchester. The main part of the proposed assistance would be general operating aid allocated through a formula based on property values and personal income in each school district. Use of the formula would insure that there would be at least $3,100 for each pupil as long as a district imposed a local tax rate at least equal to the average tax rate in the state. To encourage districts with low tax rates to increase them, the formula would penalize districts with rates less than $13 per $1,000 of full property value by reducing their state aid. This provision would fall hardest on Suffolk County, where the low-tax districts affected would be East Hampton, Amagansett, Montauk, Shoreham- Wading River, Remsenburg, Westhampton Beach, Quogue, Southhampton, Oyster Ponds and Fishers Island.

Opposition candidates are favored in opinion polls to defeat candidates of Peru's governing party Sunday in nationwide municipal elections, which leftist guerrillas have threatened to disrupt. The opposition says the elections are a test of President Fernando Belaunde Terry's three years in office. The President says the elections are proof of democracy and a plebiscite against terrorism - and the Government says it will respect the results with ''absolute impariality.'' He has ordered tight security because of guerrilla threats to kill people who vote. Voting is mandatory in Peru, and the nation's 7 million voters were warned not to take packages to the polls or loiter after voting. Official results are not expected for about 10 days, but an unofficial count is expected to be available late Sunday.

768-> BROOK EXPLORES OPERA AS THEATER
Peter Brook, the distinguished British director whose inventive productions of ''Marat- Sade,'' ''King Lear'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' deeply influenced contemporary theater, returns to Broadway on Thursday with a new venture - opera. Mr. Brook will present his interpretation of Georges Bizet's ''Carmen,'' entitled ''La Tragedie de Carmen,'' at the Vivian Beaumont with a carefully trained company of singer-actors that includes no fewer than five alternating principal casts. The new ''Carmen,'' which has been immensely successful in Paris and on tour in Europe, was developed in collaboration with two eminent French artists, the composer Marius Constant and the screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri ere, at Mr. Brook's Paris-based International Center of Theater Research. Operated for the past 12 years by the director and his producer and close associate Micheline Rozan, the Center is funded in part by the French Government. There, with his company and his own theater, the Bouffes du Nord, Mr. Brook is free from the restrictions that hamper most directors, and his fame and artistic prestige virtually guarantee that his work will be taken seriously. His unorthodox ''Carmen,'' a stripped-down 80- minute version performed without a full orchestra and with no chorus, attracted crowds of Parisians, including French President Francois Mitterrand, and also played to sold-out houses in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Hamburg, and 14 French cities and towns. Its arrival here promises to be doubly eventful for New York theatergoers. Not only is a new Brook production always of interest, but it will signal, it is hoped, the revival of the long-dark Vivian Beaumont, which has been remodeled for the occasion to resemble the interior of Brook's space in Paris. In the rethinking and revision that produced ''La Tragedie de Carmen,'' Mr. Brook and his colleagues pored over the sources. These included not only Bizet's music and the Halevy-Meilhac libretto, but the story that inspired Bizet - Prosper Merimee's tale of sex and crime in the world of Spanish gypsies, published in 1845, 30 years before Bizet's composition. ''La Tragedie de Carmen'' is an amalgam of Merimee's novella and Bizet's opera, designed to express the essence of both. The director said he conceived the work as a stark tragedy in the Greek mode - austere, with only a few protagonists, and expressing the power of ''destiny and fate.'' The well-known plot zeroes in on the love affair between Carmen and Don Jose, who are destroyed by irreconcilable inner contradictions and opposing cultures. Don Jose is a well brought-up bourgeois soldier concerned with army, mother, and finance, only to be challenged by the gypsy, who believes in fate, magic and freedom, and who taunts him by turning her attentions to the bullfighter Escamillo. ''Carmen is all things to all men,'' Mr. Brook said. ''She has an extraordinary capacity for living for the moment. She can be guileful, wicked, innocent, pure, full of hatred, ruthless, kind - all those things rotate inside her. Which is, of course, what makes her so high-powered and such a good subject for theater. You find those characteristics in the Merimee story, which Halevy and Meilhac tried to soft-pedal. What we have done is try to bring back, as much as one can, the many-sided woman who can be dirty, violent, dramatic - all those sides which live together in one person. But we are not throwing the Carmen that everyone loves out the window. Our work is not a substitute for Bizet's opera. We're proposing something different. Our 'Carmen' is neither an opera in the conventional sense, nor a play, nor a novel; it is research for another way of telling a story through opera.'' This new effort is the latest in a long line of adaptations the opera has undergone since its first staging at the Paris Opera-Comique in 1875. After Bizet's death, recitatives were substituted for spoken dialogue, and the orchestration was augmented. Soon the comparatively modest initial production at the Opera Comique grew into grand opera, with enormous orchestras, huge casts, elborate scenery and costumes, and sterotyped acting. The public came to think of ''Carmen'' as a showy melodrama to be staged only in large opera houses. Bizet's score and Merimee's story tended to become lost in sentimental or sensational renderings. There were exceptions, of course, but on the whole ''Carmen'' evolved into an operatic warhorse, a Franco-Hispanic cliche. In 1875, however, it shocked the establishment. When Bizet and his librettists first proposed to write an opera based on Merimee's story, the director of the Opera Comique was horrified: ''Carmen!'' he exclaimed. ''Merimee's Carmen? Isn't she killed by her lover? And that background of thieves, gypsies, cigar-makers at the Opera-Comique, a family theater! You will frighten off our audience. It's impossible.'' But the sensual wild gypsy who, in Merimee's words, possessed ''a strange and savage beauty, a face which at first astonished but which could not be forgotten,'' haunted Bizet. He composed his masterpiece and the Opera-Comique performed it, after a series of stormy rehearsals. The reception was cold, the unsympathetic audience and critics both complaining that the music was Wagnerian, the plot scandalous, and the acting too suggestive. Bizet died a few months after the disappointing premiere and never realized the fulfillment of Tchaikovsky's prediction that ''Carmen'' would become the world's most popular opera. Mr. Brook's transformation of the work is intended to return it to something of its initial scale and thereby restore the originality and emotional impact of the work. His research derived partly from his own youthful, and unpleasant, experience with opera. When he was named director of Covent Garden at the age of 23, he had to oversee ''a disgracefully bad'' production of ''Carmen.'' Then, his own controversial staging of ''Salome'' so upset the British music establishment that he abandoned opera for more than 30 years. ''It seemed impossible to do good work under the prevailing conditions,'' Mr. Brook said. ''Inadequate rehearsals, for example, which led to bad relations among the singers.'' In the years that followed, his restless experimentation with both content and form, including non- Western modes, propelled him into a variety of theatrical undertakings. Always intrigued by Shakespeare, he mounted brilliant stagings of the comedies and tragedies; he tackled Chekhov in a French-language ''Cherry Orchard'' presented without scenery in Paris; he traveled in Africa and Asia, and integrated elements of their culture in a trio of plays, ''Ubu,'' ''The Iks'' and 'The Conference of the Birds,'' shown here at LaMama in 1980. Why try opera again? ''For many years,'' he said, ''we used music as interludes and as accompanment to various works. Through the years, Micheline Rozan and I talked about doing a complete musical work, and when Bernard Lefort, the Administrator General of the Paris Opera came to us and suggested that we do an opera, I agreed, and chose 'Carmen.' Why ''Carmen''? ''It's not only an opera, it's a phenomenon,'' Mr. Brook explained. ''It's like asking why is Coca-Cola so popular that you find it all over the world. It's a question of ingredients. If you sit waiting for a plane somewhere in Lapland, for example, you are more likely to hear 'Carmen' than 'Triviata' on the Muzak system. 'Carmen' has all the ingredients. It has a sharp story that in a way touches off many archetypal images and it has an extraordinary purity and truth to the music. ''Second, the basis of all our experimental and research work is directed toward the widest audience to which a theater event must be totally accessible. To me, the 20th-century musical idiom is as removed from the late 19th-century musical idiom as is a movie from a novel. Therefore, what we were attempting here is a radical transposition which made us reassess everything, including the music, the libretto, the rehearsal method, the contractual method, the seat-selling method - our audiences pay $8 a seat and $5 for special performances - and the disposition of the theater.'' Were there problems in transplanting his highly innovative production to the notoriously difficult stage of the Vivian Beaumont? ''The Vivian Beaumont is a highly workable instrument, and like any instrument it is difficult and you have to discover how to play it,'' Mr. Brook said. ''It's not an easy instrument, but it is one that can be used and one that gives possibilities. One of the great needs in this city is to find a theater that is large enough to hold say 1,200 people and is not a procenium theater - which one looks for when one is making a contemporary work. ''What is interesting about the Beaumont is that it offers us exactly this. Besides, it is equipped with everything a theater needs. I did see that there is a basic problem between the relation of the auditorium and the stage area. As we do do everywhere, we reconstructed the stage in a way that would make it as intimate as possible. The existing thrust stage was extended, a specific backwall was created and the seats of the first eight rows were raised to accommodate the sight lines. The Beaumont is a perfectly valid theater with its strengths and weakness and difficulties. One simply has to work with them - and work through them.'' Along with rearranging the music and the libretto, Mr. Brook and Mr. Constant rethought the role of the orchestra. It was unacceptable to them that the musicians, ''the co- producers and equal artists of a production,'' should be buried in the pit, with only the conductor visible, and barely so at that. ''Nothing is a more rigid totalitarian approach to theater than the conductor stuck up on a podium,'' Mr. Brook said. ''He can see the stage and the orchestra, but they cannot ever see or feel what is going on on the stage. Compare this with Oriental plays where there is music. It is inconceivable that the musicians should be anywhere other than in the same space watching the performance.'' Thus, instead of a conventional orchestra in a pit, 14 musicians, one from each section of the orchestra, sit on stage and play the score, which is sung virtually intact, though adapted and reordered by Mr. Constant, who conducts the ensemble from an unobstrusive spot on the stage. In concentrating on the ''pure story,'' as Mr. Brook put it, he and Mr. Constant discovered that ''the most sensitive and pure music is the one that is connected with the pure central line.'' All the choruses - the children, the gypsy girls and bandits - were eliminated as superfluous embellishment representing concessions to 19th-century opera convention. The libretto, stripped to its essentials and somewhat rearranged by Jean-Claude Carri ere and Mr. Brook himself, still more or less follows the Halevy-Meilhac version, with some exceptions. Drawing upon Merimee's story, they added Carmen's sinister husband Garcia and made the ending even bleaker than Bizet's. The all-important singers underwent rigorous preparation for their roles. As there would have to be several casts alternating in order to present nightly performances, they each had also to accept being one of many. ''We tried to break what is a poison in the opera, an anti-human system of judgment and comparison,'' Mr. Brook said, ''that is, if one person is good, somebody else is bad. And that is why I have refused ever to play the game, of even saying secretly which singer I have admired the most. We have five Carmens, and in quite different ways one is as good as the other. Although all must aspire to a certain level of artistry, people are radically different. I haven't any hesitation in recommending anyone to go on any night. It will be the same or different, but it will never be better or worse.'' To find the right singers took a year. ''We had to fly people in and out of Paris from everywhere,'' Micheline Rozan recalled. ''It was not easy. We had to have experienced opera singers because the score is really difficult and intricate and no ordinary singer could do it without proper training. We had to have young people as well, singers who would be able to work with Brook in his method of exploration and experimentation without their being hemmed in by preconceived notions and conventions.'' And they had to know the entire orchestral score, so they would not have to watch Mr. Constant, but could concentrate on their relationship with each other and with the work as a whole. Besides acting and singing, the singers had to be extremely physical. They sit on their haunches, lie on the ground, run, jump, and execute tricky movements in the fight scenes. And all without missing a note. To accomplish this, Mr. Brook had the singers work on specific exercises, as he customarily does for all his performers. For example, a singer would try to sustain the best sound quality of one or two notes while doing different movements, first simple arm movements, then leg and arm movements, then judo and then rolling on the floor. ''The singers got very excited and saw for themselves that they could in fact move strenuously while singing and still maintain their sounds,'' Mr. Brook recalled. ''The singers discovered that they had been singing every day for 10 hours and their voices weren't tired.'' Out of this painstaking and extensive preparation, the Brook ''Carmen'' emerged as a group effort, an ensemble production based on mutual understanding. As he intended, there are no stars, no prima donnas. But some might say that every Brook production has a star - Peter Brook himself - though he would not agree.

769-> Alfonso J. Cervantes; Ex-Mayor of St. Louis
Alfonso J. Cervantes, the flamboyant and often controversial Mayor of St. Louis from 1965 to 1973, died today. He was 62 years old. Hospital officials did not give a cause of death, although Mr. Cervantes previously had been treated for cancer. A Democrat, Mr. Cervantes was a tireless promoter of the city who recognized early the need to attract tourists and major conventions. He is best remembered for his fight for approval of a bond issue to build the Convention Center that bears his name. But he was also associated with several ill-fated projects, including the Spanish International Pavilion and the Santa Maria ship project. Drawing on his Spanish heritage, Mr. Cervantes brought to the city the Santa Maria, an 80-foot replica of Columbus's flagship that had been built for the New York World's Fair in 1965. The ship was moored on the Mississippi River here. But five months after it arrived, it sank, a victim of a storm. The Spanish International Pavilion, a $10 million building hailed by some architects as the ''jewel of the New York Fair,'' fared little better. Mr. Cervantes brought the reassembled pavilion to the city, but after nine months it closed because of financial problems. It was later bought by a hotel chain. In 1970 Life magazine published a cover story that tried to link the Mayor with the St. Louis underworld. Mr. Cervantes filed a $12 million suit against the magazine, but it was dismissed and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal. Seeking a third term in 1973, Mr. Cervantes lost to his former friend and political associate, John Poelker. Mr. Cervantes is survived by his wife, Carmen, a daughter and five sons.

770-> WORKERS AND ASBESTOS: PITTING A RISK AGAINST HOLDING A JOB
An employee at the Johns-Manville plant here leaned against a fence and talked about his job and how he felt about working so long with asbestos, which can cause cancer and other illnesses. ''You figure you've been here 35 years,'' said the worker, who would not give his name. ''You've got to have some of it. But I'd just as soon they wouldn't tell me and just let me go on working. You know - no news is good news.'' For workers, there has recently been more news than ever about occupational health hazards, and much of it has been bad, raising difficult questions in the workplace. None are more difficult than the question of which is more important to workers - jobs or health. ''It's a sad comment on our industrial system,'' said William Kane, international representative for Region 9 of the United Automobile Workers, ''when people are saying, 'I'm going to die anyway, so I might as well die of asbestos than starve to death.' '' Fighting for Regulation While industry representatives say self-regulation has made the workplace safe, union officials say health conditions are still often unsatisfactory and that only increased regulation can make the worker safe. In 1981, 4,370 deaths were attributed to such hazards, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, there were 8.3 instances of injury or illness for every 100 workers in the period. Some doctors and occupational health experts say that health problems resulting from the growth of the chemical industry after World War II are just starting to appear and that coming years may produce a variety of new occupational health problems. One example of how workers react to the choice between jobs and health involves the toxic chemical byproduct dioxin, which among other things causes chloracne, a skin condition that resembles acne but is often far more severe and persistent. 10 Years and Staying On ''I put in 10 years here, and nothing's happened to me,'' said a worker at the White Chemical Corporation, whose former site at Bayonne, N.J., underwent tests for the presence of dioxin that proved negative. ''I didn't think they were going to find anything. Sure hoped they wouldn't.'' ''But if they said they found a little something, well, I'd just as soon go on working,'' he continued, while having a beer in the Hanger Inn, across from the company's new site in Newark, where it moved when its lease in Bayonne ran out. ''You see, the job's good. It pays nice. And when you've been somewhere long enough, you're just not going to believe someone who just comes in and says the place is no good for you. '' Iris Blumenau, a registered nurse, spent about five years helping two dermatologists treat chloracne and other skin disorders of workers at the Diamond Alkalichemical plant in Newark. ''They knew at the time there was a risk,'' she said. ''We kept telling them, but they stayed there because it paid so well. They said, 'Where else can we get this kind of money?' '' ''Whenever you go into a plant that's dirty, the first reaction from the people there is not to do anything,'' said Anthony Mazzocchi, who served twice served as vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers and is now the coordinator of the Workers' Policy Project, a research group based in Manhattan. ''It's, 'Hey, don't rock the boat.' '' 'Afraid of the Job Situation' ''Today, given the economy and all the joblessness, the guys that have jobs are more careful,'' said James Moran, associate director of the Philadelphia Area Project for Occupational Health, one of about 25 coalitions of unions and individuals around the country that are trying to increase awareness of occupational health hazards and seek regulation against the hazards. ''Even if they might be suffering some ill effects, they are staying quiet because they are afraid of the job situation.'' Mr. Kane of the U.A.W. said: ''We have this wonderful attitude: 'Gee, this is America, they wouldn't kill you.' There are a lot of things taken for granted through ignorance, apathy, or what I call the American macho image.'' Dr. Irving J. Selikoff, a professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, director of its environmental health department who is an authority on occupational medicine, says: ''Even today, workers have sort of a macho approach to this. Moreover, they've got to work. Over 200 years ago, Benjamin Franklin said hunger never sees bad bread.'' Also, since the latency period for some of these illnesses is as long as 20 years, concerns of the present often outweigh future considerations. 'Keep Working to Reduce Hazard' ''If you walked into a workplace and your eyes started burning and you started coughing, you'd leave right away,'' said James W. Middleton, business representative of Local 60 of the International Chemical Workers Union. ''But asbestos doesn't work that way. It's one of those things that's so distant you'll accept it.'' ''In my mind,'' said Eric Scherzer, health and safety representative of Local 8-149 of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, in Paterson, N.J., ''the choice is not jobs or health. The only choice you have is to keep working to reduce the hazard.'' Mr. Scherzer joined a New Jersey coalition whose lobbying succeeded in passage of a strict chemical-labeling law. Twelve other states have passed similar measures, called right-to-know bills by proponents. The most recent was Illinois. Such legislation, considered in 30 states this year, often met with strong opposition from industry. ''We don't object to the intent of the laws,'' said Charles Van Black of the state affairs division of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, which has about 200 member companies. ''But what we object to is the piecemeal approach. No two of these laws are alike.'' Proponents of the labeling measures say they acted because the current standards and the newest proposals before the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are too weak. In many cases, they say, workers are still unaware of the hazards they face, and labeling laws are necessary. 'Blackmail' or 'Economic Reality' ''We understand that working in a chemical plant is not like working in an ice cream factory,'' said Charles Morris of Du Pont's Chambers Works in Deepwater, N.J., where 700 chemicals were manufactured and 40 million tons of hazardous waste were produced in 1981. ''We just want to know what those hazardous chemicals are.'' The question of jobs or health is raised in another way when companies say actions to improve health conditions would cause layoffs or close plants. Union officials and environmentalists call such warnings ''economic blackmail''; industry representatives call them recognition of ''economic reality.'' In Tacoma, Wash., William D. Ruckelshaus, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has asked residents if they would rather accept some risk of cancer from arsenic in the air or face the probable closing of a copper smelter that provides 800 jobs. Mr. Ruckelshaus has asked for the residents' advice to help him decide on a new standard to limit emissions of arsenic into the air. Awareness vs. Job Market Richard Grossman, a director of Environmentalists for Full Employment, says that as workers become more aware of health hazards they are more likely to resist poor health conditions. But people in medical and labor circles agree that even as awareness increases, a tight job market makes resistance difficult. ''If I had known that asbestos would do what it does, I wouldn't have worked there,'' said James E. Vermulen, who founded Asbestos Victims of America three years ago. He worked from 1957 to 1966 at a Johns-Manville plant in Stockton, Calif. In 1977 he was hospitalized for what was initially diagnosed as double pneumonia and chronic heart failure, to be told later that he had asbestosis. ''This is a terrible way to live,'' he continued, occasionally pausing to catch his breath. ''I think more of life than that. I'd have done anything else. I'd have washed dishes. ''You'll find people willing to work with the hazard in order to put bread on the table. Let's face it. Times are hard. But they wouldn't if they really knew what it's like. They just don't have the whole picture. It's a terrible way to die.''

773-> CRITICS' CHOICE
MUSICAL REVUE Calling itself ''a musical revue with manners,'' ''Etiquette'' made its debut at La Mama in l979 and is currently enjoying a welldeserved revival with Sunday night performances at s.n.a.f.u., 6th Avenue and 21st Street. Directed by Playhouse of the Ridiculous cofounder, John Vaccaro, with a book by William M. Hoffman and music and lyrics by John Braden, this spoof of a l940's Hollywood idea of high society is a superior musical frolic in the ridiculous theatrical mode. The revue's lessons in manners include tips on how to behave at table, at tea, at a funeral, and at the opera, offered by a regal Emily Post-like figure, then appallingly ''demonstrated'' by a cast of ten. Polite society emerges as a cheery group of gluttons, lechers and blasphemers who spend all their time in scheming and gossip. Mr. Braden's operetta-like score, which includes a hilarious travesty of Italian opera, is buoyed by the talented cast of actorsingers who play multiple roles. The staging and costumes blend the fancy with the fantastic, and the performers are as able singers as they are hams in the Marx Brothers tradition. (There are performances each Sunday in January at 6 and 8:30 P.M.; for reservations, call 691-3535) Stephen Holden

774-> STEEL PAYMENTS ACCORD ELUDES E.E.C. AND U.S.
The likelihood that the European Economic Community would order retaliatory trade measures against the United States has grown following the failure of both sides yesterday to reach agreement on the community's demands for compensation for the restrictions Washington has placed on specialty steel imports, Common Market representatives said. ''There was some movement yesterday, but there still is substantial distance between the parties,'' said Ella Krucoff, a Common Market spokesman in Washington. ''It looks more and more likely that the community will retaliate.'' An official in the office of the United States trade representative said, however, that in light of the progress at the talks in Geneva the Europeans' talk of retaliation was for the most part a threat aimed at putting pressure on Washington. The official, who requested anonymity, said: ''The negotiations have been making reasonably good progress. That's why I'd be surprised if they retaliate next week.'' Trade officials on both sides said they were close to agreement on compensation for the tariffs that President Reagan ordered on specialty steel imports last July but were still far apart on compensation for the specialty steel quotas he ordered. Meeting Next Week According to Common Market officials, the community has agreed to impose new tariffs on imports of plastics and chemicals from the United States and restrictions on sporting goods imports unless the Common Market was satisfied by progress in the negotiations. The community's ministers are scheduled to meet next Monday and Tuesday in Brussels, where they are expected to decide whether to initiate retaliatory measures. Mrs. Krucoff said that although no formal talks were scheduled between the two sides before Tuesday, it was possible that progress could be made in the next few days in private talks. Various trade sources said the Common Market had reduced its demand from $24 million to about $12 million for compensation on the four years of tariffs ordered by Washington and that the United States had raised its offer to between $8 million and $10 million. The sources said the principal snag remaining in the talks was Washington's failure to offer to compensate the Common Market for the damage that the community says specialty steel quotas have caused its steelmakers.

775-> PatentsStacy V. Jones Improving Production Of DNA
WASHINGTON CHEMICAL reagents invented by two scientists at the University of Colorado in Boulder are described as accelerating the production and increasing the purity of DNA, the basic raw material of genetic engineering. Marvin H. Caruthers and Serge L. Beaucage were granted patent 4,415,732 and assigned it to University Patents Inc. of Norwalk, Conn. Under licenses already granted, both the reagents and an automated DNA synthesizer are being marketed. Applied Biosystems Inc. of Foster City, Calif., and Beckman Instruments Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., are distributing the compounds and the instrument, often called a gene machine. Using the reagents, the synthesizer is described as providing useful fragments of genes in less than a day at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. The newly patented reagents are formally known as phosphoramidite compounds. University Patents describes them as helping to convert genetic engineering to a true industrial process. University Patents evaluates inventions on behalf of its university clients to determine if the new technology is patentable.

776-> ART REVIEW; ATLANTA'S NEW MUSEUM HAS SPACES TO FILL
As everyone who cares about such things must know by now, the new High Museum building in Atlanta is the hottest thing of its kind in the museum world since the Guggenheim Museum opened on Fifth Avenue close on 25 years ago. Richard Meier's building has star quality. Not only does it look good, and feel good, but it delivers. In fact it does a great job of seduction. Already the busty protrusion of those bone-white walls makes us impatient to get inside. Treading the long thin sloping ramp that runs up from Peachtree Street, we feel as the gods must feel when they march into Valhalla at the end of Wagner's ''Das Rheingold.'' Once inside, it is with a wild surmise that we mount that other, inner ramp that takes us up to the galleries. Such is the bleached whiteness of the atrium that we risk snow-blindness on a sunny day, but even so we respond to the niceties of Meier's detailing. We also respond to his mastery of elegant allusion. If that inner ramp gives us a sense of ritual, we relate it to the lacy terraces that we patrol at intermission time in Philip Johnson's State Theater in Lincoln Center. Even an architectural novice can spot the references to Le Corbusier, to Alvar Aalto, to Frank Lloyd Wright and to the great structures in Berlin and Munich that pioneered the notion of the metropolitan museum in the first third of the 19th century. A sense of continuity counts for much in the stature of this new museum. So the building delivers. In fact it does such a great job of delivering that we may well respond as much to the articulation of the inner spaces as to the use to which those spaces are put, and as much to the high style of the showcases as to the objects that those cases house. There were even times when I thought of those objects as a distraction from the almost lascivious perfection of the museum itself. That way madness lies. But meanwhile there really was something quite astonishing about the civic energy that had funded the new High Museum of Art, brought it in on schedule and within the budget, and made it the talk of the museum community throughout the country. Less than 30 years ago the High Museum of Art was still in the gabled family house on Peachtree Street that had been given to the city by Mrs. J. M. High in 1926. The street was very pretty. The house had an easygoing sideway spread to it that made it look like a place in which one could walk in, sit down and live happily ever after. But a museum? A museum that could bring the visual arts under one single roof in a major city? Someone had to be putting us on. And the High Museum did indeed get itself a new building in 1955. But that new building had a capacity of only 55,000 square feet, and there was no way for it to be - in the words of the campaign slogan of 1981 - ''a museum big enough for Atlanta.'' Those were fighting words, and they did the job. But now that the museum is in being we are entitled to ask, ''How big is big enough?,'' and to speculate as to what should eventually be done with those finely ordered spaces. The first thing to be said is that the history of the High Museum is such that it never had a chance to be a major museum in terms of its permanent collections. It is fundamental to the psychology of cities that whereas people can be stimulated to give to museums that are getting bigger and bigger they are turned off by little old ones. Faced with empty spaces, they long to fill them. This happened lately at the County Museum in Los Angeles. It will certainly happen in Dallas, where the Museum of Fine Arts will shortly have its new building, and it is rumored to have happened already at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the 20th-century wing is now under construction. It is one of the laws of life. An example of that law in operation can be found not too far from Atlanta. The Hunter Museum of Art in Chattanooga, Tenn., consists of a stately l9th-century mansion on a bluff overlooking the Tennessee River, plus a modern extension that was cantilevered into an adjacent site just a while ago. Chattanooga has collectors who are crazy about their museum, and between them they have seen to it that American painting up to the modernist period is represented in the original house by examples that show true and deep feeling for the subject. The group of works by Charles Burchfield would do credit to any of our great museums. Today's collectors in Chattanooga have also bought very well for the modern extension in terms of the last 25 years. Where they couldn't get paintings, they got very good prints, and once again the collection has that special and irreplaceable look that comes about when individual enthusiasts have trusted to their own instinct and not to ''advisers.'' They all pitch in, and nobody shows off, and the results are a pleasure to see. Something of that sort is beginning to happen in Atlanta, where the Forward Arts Foundation has made some inspired purchases in the field of French painting. But it would be pointless to pretend that either old master painting or the art of the 19th and early 20th centuries is well or coherently represented in the High Museum. One huge and arresting recent arrival, Max Ernst's ''Tree of Life'' (1928), is almost comically out of key with the rest of the collection. As for the American 19th century, it is represented in bulk. But bulk in that context is not the same thing as strength, and those particular rooms call out for weeding. In contemporary art, where a strong impact can be made with just a few pieces, the High Museum does distinctly better, with Kenneth Noland, Frank Stella, Elizabeth Murray and Joel Shapiro all in top form. But it is in the decorative arts, and above all in the American decorative arts as they were practiced between 1825 and 1917, that the High Museum comes into its own as the locus of an original and combative sensibility. It stands to reason. With time, understanding and money any museum can make a good showing in departments of art as to which there is general agreement. But the Virginia Carroll Crawford collection of the decorative arts goes foraging in fields as to which there is no general agreement whatever. Faced with an iron invalid chair made in the 1870's by Cevedra B. Sheldon, or with a centripetal chair that was patented in 1849 and made of cast iron with steel springs, a painted sheet-metal back and a seat upholstered in a particularly raucous shade of red, visitors to the High Museum may well be completely disoriented. As for the ''exposition upright piano'' that was built by Hallet, Davis and Company for the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, it is a monster the like of which few of us have ever seen. Based on a Renaissance fireplace surround, it was made of ebonized cherrywood, bird's eye maple, ash, spruce, gilt and ivory. Carved panels bear an almost disquieting freight of wreaths, scrolls, medallions and symbolic lyres. Sculptured birds stand free on the very top of the enormous instrument, as if preparing to take off at the first notes of a Chopin polonaise. As is the case with the sofa and four side chairs that are reproduced on this page, these pieces impress by their total self-confidence. To say that they are in bad (or good) taste would be to miss the point. They are beyond taste, in a domain of their own finding and defining. We come upon them as the first explorers came upon Easter Island and its gigantic statues, and we stand before them in wonder and amazement. It is relevant to Richard Meier's success as a museum designer that we see these pieces under optimum conditions. The light is right, the colors are right, the height is right and the distances are right. The pieces float before us as if in a dream, and nobody pressures us into liking or disliking them. Meier is dealing here with work that sometimes has a hectoring, brutish ingredient, and yet his touch is everywhere light and non-judgmental. Whether or not we ever want to see some of the pieces again, the Crawford collection is a model of intelligence and originality in its charting of unfamiliar terrain, and it is difficult to imagine that it could be installed with a surer or a lighter touch. Other and comparable original collections may come to the High Museum in time. Meanwhile, and like almost every other big city museum, it will be operating in part as a Kunsthalle - a place in which temporary exhibitions come and go. Two such exhibitions constitute the inaugural wave. One is a loan show of French 18th-century paintings called ''The Rococo Age.'' The other, ''Mark Rothko Subjects,'' is sponsored by IBM and comes primarily from the holdings of the Mark Rothko Foundation. Funded by the Forward Arts Foundation of Atlanta and organized by Eric M. Zafran, the High Museum's curator of European art, ''The Rococo Age'' includes a number of outright masterpieces of French 18th-century painting, along with others that will be familiar primarily to the specialist. Mr. Zafran's catalogue is full of pertinent information, and no one who is within reach of Atlanta should pass up the chance of seeing Fragonard's ''Washerwomen,'' Greuze's ''Indolence,'' Chardin's ''Glass of Water and Coffee Pot'' and David's portrait of Jacques-Francois Desmaisons. It is in the context of paintings of this quality that we hope to think of the High Museum in the future.

778-> Royals' Jail Terms Disturb A.C.L.U.
The American Civil Liberties Union denounced yesterday the prison sentences imposed on three baseball players who had pleaded guilty to the Federal misdemeanor charge of attempting to possess cocaine. The A.C.L.U. said the sentences made ''a mockery of the criminal sanction.'' ''Even if these individuals were addicted, putting them in prison makes as little sense as putting an alcoholic in prison for attempting to buy liquor,'' the A.C.L.U.'s executive director, Ira Glasser, said in a statement distributed to the news media from Manhattan. Willie Wilson, Willie Aikens and Jerry Martin, all of whom played last season for the Kansas City Royals, were sentenced Thursday in Kansas City, Kan., to spend three months in prison for trying to buy cocaine. They were also ordered to pay fines, $5,000 each for Wilson and Aikens, $2,500 for Martin. Mr. Glasser said that the fact that each player had been ordered to go through drug treatment while imprisoned did not affect the A.C.L.U.'s stance. ''Our point is that we don't believe the use or possession of certain drugs should be a crime, while use and possession of other drugs is not,'' Mr. Glasser said in a telephone interview. ''No one is sent to prison for alcohol, even if he is to be treated for it there.'' Athletes' 'Obligations' Cited In imposing sentence, United States Magistrate J. Milton Sullivant told the three ballplayers that as professional athletes, ''there are certain obligations and responsibilities you must live up to.'' The magistrate said that the players occupied a ''special place in our society'' and that they were responsible for setting an example for the nation's youth. Today, a woman who answered Magistrate Sullivant's office telephone in Kansas City and identified herself as his secretary said he would not discuss his decisions with the news media. In his statement, Mr. Glasser called the judge's decision hypocritical. ''He said he was sending these men to prison because they were an example for the youth of America,'' Mr. Glasser said. ''That is unfair because it means that lesser known individuals convicted of the same 'crime' would not have been imprisoned. ''And it is hypocritical, because while these athletes are sent to jail for attempting to buy cocaine, other athletes are making fortunes doing beer commercials on television, and encouraging young people to drink.''

779-> AROUND THE NATION; Palsy Victim's Husband Loses Bid on Mental Test
The estranged husband of a cerebral palsy victim who wants to starve to death because her disability makes her almost completely dependent on others for nearly all her bodily functions has lost a bid to have her examined by a psychiatrist who lectures for the Right to Life League. Arguments on a court order to bar Elizabeth Bouvia's request to be allowed to die in Riverside General Hospital will be heard Nov. 21, according to her lawyer, Carol Sobel. On Thursday, Judge John Hews of Riverside Superior Court rejected Richard Bouvia's request that his wife undergo a psychiatric examination by Dr. Nancy Mullen; the judge said the doctor had a bias in the case. Dr. Mullen has spoken on behalf of the Right to Life League, said Miss Sobel, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. Mrs. Bouvia is fighting attempts by Riverside General to give her nourishment against her will. Courts have upheld the rights of terminally ill patients to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, but Mrs. Bouvia's lawsuit is believed to be the first to assert the same right for a totally and permanently disabled person.

782-> Charlotte Curtis; Irene Selznick: Her Story
THE view from Irene Mayer Selznick's dark green study is a peaceful one. She looks over Central Park, and on winter afternoons, when the sun is a faded pink, the dim light softens the buildings and bare trees, blurring their harsh lines. ''If I look across, I see the pond,'' she said. ''Down, I see book stalls, the walks and the trees. Even when it's gray, I see everything distinctly.'' For the last seven of her 32 years in the spacious apartment, the green study has been the center of her life. For it is here, six to eight hours a day at the handsome desk next to the big windows, that Mrs. Selznick has been writing her autobiography. If she has told everything, and there is every reason to believe that she has, her book, ''A Private View,'' should be one of the rare gems of May, 1983. In short, hers is the life of the Hollywood princess who finally defied the king to do with her life what she wanted. But first, she paid her dues. She is the younger daughter of the imperial Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the first wife of the powerful David O. Selznick, who produced such classics as ''Gone With The Wind,'' and later, in her own right, one of Broadway's most successful producers. Her hits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''Bell, Book and Candle,'' ''The Complaisant Lover'' and ''The Chalk Garden.'' As a child, she is supposed to have lived the pampered life. In fact, she was raised strictly and conventionally, expected to be a housewife and mother. ''I'd pick up a book,'' she said, ''and my father would say, 'She knows too much already.' '' Her father didn't believe in careers for women. He refused to let her go to college. He didn't want her associating with actors. And he was delighted when, in 1930, at age 23, she married Mr. Selznick, and thereafter became the mother of two boys. ''I was trained, really trained,'' she said, ''not to talk, not to tell tales. My father said he could have no freedom at home unless we were discreet. People have always complained that I didn't speak up.'' Born in New York and raised outside Boston, where her father had theaters, she and her family moved to California in 1919 in time for Hollywood's Golden Years. Yet in 1946, the housewife, separated from her husband, left Lotus Land for New York. Asked why, her best answer is one she gave a reporter on the eve of the ''Streetcar'' opening. ''I don't know,'' she said. ''I begged myself not to do it. 'You mustn't do it,' I said to myself. But I kept thinking about it. There were years of thought behind this move. Then suddenly I became aware of the extent of my interest in the theater. I kept telling myself that I wouldn't be hooked, that I loved my home, my friends, my family. But finally I found myself announcing, 'You know, I did the most peculiar thing today. I took offices.' '' That was December, 1947. She was 40. ''I was an amateur,'' she said. ''Untrained and not as fully educated as I'd have liked. I had to learn on the job.'' In the end, of course, her Broadway triumphs pleased her father and, looking back, she remembers him affectionately. At 75, Mrs. Selznick's short dark hair is in bangs, and she wore a brown turtleneck under a beige caftan with gold jewelry. Old pictures depict a beautiful, wide-eyed girl replaced by a trim, tailored producer who dressed up in the evening, and she still does. ''I go out several nights a week,'' she said. ''I'm gregarious and I like people.'' She was seated in the study facing a George Bellows landscape. To her left were sketches the playwright Enid Bagnold did in South Africa, a Clifford Odets drawing and a large Mary Cassatt pastel of a child. She said friends, including some of the most celebrated actresses, had been exceedingly patient these book-writing years. ''Sentences to me always began with W,'' she added. ''When are you going to finish? What are you doing? Why is it taking so long? I told them I had to get it right. I'm a perfectionist. I work very hard.'' She wrote the first draft in longhand, had it typed, rewrote, rearranged, rewrote again and, though Alfred A. Knopf Inc. has the manuscript, she is still polishing ''bits and pieces.'' A Louise Dahl-Wolf photograph of her may appear on the book jacket, and her editors delight in the way she has described what her father, her husband and all the Hollywood greats were really like. Predictably, hers is a cast of thousands with close-ups of Sam Goldwyn, William Randolph Hearst, Henry and Clare Luce, and John Hay Whitney and his widow, Betsy. Presumably, such close friends as Janet Gaynor, Ingrid Bergman until she died, and Katharine Hepburn are there, along with Cary Grant (''My all-time favorite actor''), Graham Greene (''He frightened me except when we talked face-to-face''), S. N. Behrman (''One of my favorites'') and Jean Kerr (''A dear''). Now that the book is finished, Mrs. Selznick is contemplating a less disciplined life. ''I trust that it will be easier to revert to a normal schedule than it was to adapt to the one I'm on,'' she said. ''Why I might even go out to lunch.''

785-> DINING OUT; A GOOD SPOT FOR THEATERGOERS
FORTUNATELY , right next door to the Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield is the Playhouse Cafe, a convenient place to snack or dine before or after a theater performance. While the theatrical season ends Sept. 4, our last report was that the cafe may remain open until Oct. 1. It would be best to check by phone, however, before making a special trip. Decor at the Playhouse Cafe has something of a theatrical look itself: barrel vaulting made of thin strips of natural wood creates the illusion of greater space than actually exists in the orange- painted interior. The brick fireplace along one wall seems somewhat unnecessary if the cafe closes at the end of summer. Hanging plants and lights a bit too bright for a restaurant complete the cheerful and fairly pared-down look. The menu is small and straightforward, a notch above fast food, with many current restaurant cliches such as veal Marsala (tender veal, with an over-saucing of Marsala), shrimp scampi (nicely garlicked but tough shrimp) and fettuccine Alfredo (acceptably and creamily sauced). Service is quick, expert and accommodating, and one is not rushed to vacate the space with any untoward haste. On the whole, one fares better with the entrees than with the appetizers. If an appetizer is called for, clams on the half shell or shrimp cocktail might be the best compromise. The hot antipasto at $5.50 was a light meal in itself, consisting of a huge chanterelle-type mushroom stuffed with breading, a jumbo shrimp (tough) also heavily bread-laden, and a tomato topped with melted blue cheese, which gave it a slightly bitter taste. A surprise was the order of stuffed mushrooms. Instead of the usual button mushrooms, we were served three gigantic chanterelle-type mushroom caps, meaty and delicious of themselves, but brimful of a dense and soggy breaded stuffing. The net effect was gross. Clams Casino should more accurately be christened stuffed clams - as they were three large clam shells wadded with a heavy, almost impenetrable breading. Best entree choices are the hearty meat ones that do not require elaborate preparation, such as the New York sirloin. Double lamb chops with mint sauce were two large, tender, pink-as-ordered quality chops. The mint ''sauce'' was merely a small bowl of green mint jelly, mercifully served separately so it could be avoided. Rack of lamb for two was also excellent quality. Also commendable was the bacon-wrapped filet mignon, tender and properly broiled. The accompanying bearnaise sauce was adequate, though unexceptional. Veal piccata proved to be a good, if not superb quality veal, and the lemony sauce gave it an essential pizazz. Stuffed fillet of sole with crabmeat was so characterless one harbored the suspicion it was a frozen product. Each entree is served with soup or salad, vegetable (an al dente serving of green beans) and potato or rice. The rice was light and buttery, the baked potato fresh and meaty. Iceberg salad was hardly enhanced by a ''creamy herb dressing'' that tasted like mayonnaise with a mild herb. The dessert list is short and largely commercial. Even so, the small serving of cheesecake proved light, richly textured and pleasing. Pecan pie had a welcome topping of pecans but a too-gooey base. Strawberry shortcake was a real disappointment: frozen strawberries on a tasteless commercial base. Opt for the simpler choices: cr eme de menthe parfait or ice cream. Dinner for two - three courses, but with drinks, tax and tip extra - came to $37.25. As a pre- or post-theater place, the Playhouse Cafe works fine. One is tempted to call it a workmanlike performance. vThe Playhouse Cafe Junction of Routes 37 and 39, New Fairfield. 746-6402.

786-> Books Of The Times
THE BREAKS. By Richard Price. 446 pages. Simon & Schuster. $15.95. BIT by bit, this talented young novelist, Richard Price, seems to be working his way up out of the violent world of his first two novels, ''The Wanderers'' and ''Bloodbrothers,'' both of which were about the lives of New York's working-class young. In his third novel, ''Ladies' Man,'' Mr. Price took one of these youths at the age of 30 and put him through a lonely week selling household sprays door-to-door by day, and in the evening trying to recapture the gang camaraderie of his adolescence. Now, in his latest novel, ''The Breaks,'' he has taken yet another proletarian youth and given him a serious chance to break out of his class. At the opening of ''The Breaks,'' Peter Keller, whose family crest, if it existed, ''would be crossed AFL-CIO and CSEA union cards on a field of time clocks,'' has just graduated from Simon Straight College, ''the Harvard of Upstate New York.'' Peter, a fast-talking wisecracker, is the first of his tribe to make it to college and he's now even poised to go on to law school. But some unseen anchor seems to be holding Peter back from advancing in his career. First, he only makes the waiting list at Columbia, the law school he wants to attend. Then he can't find the sort of job that will beef up his record during the year he decides to take off to achieve that purpose. Then he is so oppressed by the experience of rejoining his father and stepmother in their Yonkers apartment and working at nothing jobs in New York that he not only gives up the idea of law school, but also performs a series of irrational acts that get him in deep legal trouble. Finally, after moving back to his college town and landing a job as an English instructor at Simon Straight, he is torn between cashing in on his evident talent as a teacher and moving back to the city and trying to make it as an actor and stand-up comedian. For the rest of the novel, Peter thrashes about. His problems with finding himself have nothing to do with luck and everything to do with certain psychological problems he has. This, I suppose, is one of the ironies of the book's title, ''The Breaks.'' As usual, there are any number of things that Mr. Price does extremely well. Peter Keller's first-person narrative is an intoxicating brew of hipster argot and popcult references. Here, for a particularly rich example, is his description of a group of housing-project fathers who have just challenged their sons to a game of playground football: ''They were wearing Hush Puppies, shiny slacks. They were definitely not from camping trips and pyschology; just some Life-of-Riley heads, big stiffs on a goof bender that morning, and plus, they were in horrible shape: pot bellies, cigarettes, jowls - I don't think any of them had really thrown a football or broken into a dead run for at least ten years.'' Then there is the convincing way that Mr. Price has drawn Peter's sense of numbness and alienation once he moves back in with his parents after graduating from college - his longing for and inability to recapture his happy and unself-conscious college persona. And finally, there are the two love triangles that Peter finds himself trapped in over the course of the novel's action - first, the one involving his stepmother and father that leads him to commit an act of symbolic violence; and second, his involvement with Kimberley Fonseca and her estranged husband, Tony, which is played out over the last two-thirds of the story and leads to its denouement. These two triangles so obviously reflect each other and so intricately dramatize Peter's problems with older men and women that it's impossible to believe Mr. Price isn't wholly aware of their Oedipal implications and isn't doing his utmost to exploit them. What Peter can't consciously express with his father and stepmother, he proceeds to act out wth Kim and Tony Fonseca. He courts and wins Kimberley, at least for as long as he really wants her, and he succeeds in turning Tony, his burned-out colleague on the English faculty at Simon Straight, into the dragon he must slay to win Kim's hand. The only problem I have with all this is the strain it puts on the character of Tony Fonseca who, at least as a fantasy figure, is expected to be all things, both benign and malevolent, to Peter and Kim. This, I think, is why this wife-beater and ''failed-writer-in residence,'' this ''king of irreverence'' with his ''urban ditty-bop routine'' and his entourage of ''burbed out or boojy students'' (meaning suburban or bourgeoise students) following him around like baby ducks, never quite comes into focus. It's hard to believe in Peter's fear of him as a castrating father-figure, particular when Tony goes to such pathetic lengths to befriend him. But this is a forgivable weakness in what is otherwise an entertaining and absorbing performance. One particular tour de force is Peter's tryout as a stand-up comic. At every other point in the novel, his jokes are strained and unamusing. But when he finally works up the courage to perform in one of those Greenwich Village nightclubs for amateurs and invents a wacky story about being molested as a child in Atlantic City, he convincingly wins his audience over. What's impressive here is not so much Peter surpassing himself in front of a larger audience, as the fact that Mr. Price dares to include us readers in that audience and still pulls off the effect. In the ultimate scheme of the novel, Peter's nightclub triumph may be of minor consequence. But it is typical of the many imaginative gambles that Mr. Price has taken in ''The Breaks'' and won.

787-> COURT IS ADVISED TO INTERVENE ON SEWAGE IN BOSTON HARBOR
A court-appointed investigator has reported that critical sewage problems in Boston Harbor have made judicial intervention ''both appropriate and necessary.'' The comprehensive report this week was prepared by Prof. Charles M. Haar of the Harvard Law School. The study was ordered by a judge in a lawsuit by the City of Quincy against several state agencies involved in sewage disposal and environmental control. The report states that partly treated sewage discharged just 500 feet from the shore contaminates beaches in Quincy, which is just south of Boston, and nearby areas. ''This pollution consists of fecal matter, floating matter such as tampon applicators, condoms, grease and oil,'' the report said. In rainy weather, the sewage system is overburdened and much of the flow bypasses treatment altogether, according to the report, which said that in the first five months of this year 863 million gallons of raw sewage was discharged into the harbor. In addition, the report said, the fins of flounder were eroding because of pollution, and shellfish flats had been closed or restricted, causing a loss estimated at $7 million to local industry. The cost of cleaning up the harbor has been estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion. Mr. Haar said in a telephone interview that scores of previous reports on the harbor had issued ''nice sounding recommendations'' but had produced little action. ''If you don't have a court order, you can kiss this report goodbye,'' he said. Justice Paul J. Garrity of Superior Court appointed Mr. Haar as special master to research the complex problem after deciding in June that the Metropolitan District Commission, which operates sewage treatment plants, had violated state water laws. The judge will hold hearings later this month to decide whether to order agencies to take action within imposed deadlines and whether to accept or modify Mr. Haar's recommended solutions. Solutions Are Proposed The proposed remedies include reducing seepage from faulty sewer pipes; requiring towns to repair old pipes at twice the rate they install new ones and resolving administrative and structural problems at the two main treatment plants. Defendants in the eight-month-old case have praised the report, but the State Attorney General's office has questioned the need for a court order. ''We never disputed the enormity of the problem,'' Stephen P. Burgay, assistant to the commissioner of the Metropolitan District Commission, said. Regardless of how the court acts on the report, he said, ''We're going to implement it. It's good stuff.'' The administration of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, installed last January, inherited the lawsuit, Mr. Burgay said. He said judicial action might help convince taxpayers of the urgency of cleaning up the harbor. However, E. Michael Sloman, a lawyer in the Attorney General's office who is representing the metropolitan commission, argues that the Dukakis administration is willing to clean up the harbor on its own. ''Judicial intervention, under those circumstances, is unwarranted,'' he said.

788-> EL SALVADOR REBUFFS MISSING MAN'S KIN
BOGOTA THE family of a missing New Jersey freelance journalist was informed last week that the Salvadoran Government will not release a body that might be that of the missing man. The journalist, John Sullivan Jr., was 26 years old when he vanished in December 1980 while on assignment in the war-torn country for Hustler magazine. He had left his home in this Bergen County community on Dec. 26 of that year. Efforts have been under way to get the government of El Salvador to ship the body back to the United States. Mr. Sullivan's mother, Lorraine, and his two married sisters, Donna Igoe of Bergenfield and Debby Indrieri of Ramsey, say that progress in getting to the bottom of the disappearance has been made, but only slowly and with great frustration. The body they seek to have shipped back was found near San Salvador, the capital, the day after Mr. Sullivan's disappearance. It was that of a Caucasian male wearing clothing similar to Mr. Sullivan's. An initial autopsy concluded that the dead man was 45 to 50 years old, but United States specialists recently placed the age at 25 to 30. Independent forensic experts in the United States are studying Xrays of the headless, handless corpse. ''There's a good chance that the remains are of Mr. Sullivan,'' said Dr. Frederick T. Zugibe, the Chief Medical Examiner of Rockland County, N.Y., ''but we can't be certain until we examine the body ourselves.'' Dr. Zugibe, whose expertise was sought by the Sullivan family, formally requested that the body be transferred to his care. The request was denied, according to the State Department, because Salvadoran law prohibits the shipment or transfer of unidentified remains. The Salvadoran Government's denial of the request was received by the State Department through the United States Embassy in San Salvador. The State Department, in turn, notified the Sullivans by telephone on Thursday. ''We were stunned,'' said Mrs. Igoe, adding: ''It just seems that both governments are withholding information and hoping that we will forget. No way!'' Earlier this year, she stressed, United States officials said that the remains could easily be recovered for examination because the evaluation would be considered a positive move toward solving the disappearance and renewing millions of dollars in United States aid to El Salvador. As a prerequisite to renewing $61 million in aid to El Salvador later this month, President Reagan is required to certify that the governing junta there is taking progressive steps toward controlling the armed forces, continuing land reforms and investigating human rights violations. It must also document its efforts in finding those responsible for the murder of four American churchwomen, two agricultural advisers and, as of last June, its progress in seeking Mr. Sullivan. Through the efforts of two local legislators - Representative Marge S. Roukema, Republican of Ridgewood, and Assemblyman William P. Schuber, Republican of Ridgefield Park - Mr. Sullivan's family has exerted continuing pressure on the State Department to act in the disappearance. Last month, the family asked the New York City-based Center for Constitutional Rights to represent it in its effort to make public, under the Freedom of Information Act, State Department documents concerning the investigation. According to Frank E. Deale, a center attorney, the State Department has declassified 155 of the 175 documents it has compiled. However, he added that this ''only covers information about the first few months of Mr. Sullivan's disappearance.'' ''Right now, there are about 19 documents being held back, not just because they are still 'classified,' but because the State Department contends that it's being overworked,'' Mr. Deale said. He said that the center, a nonprofit organization formed by civil rights activists in the 1960's to litigate cases in the South, intended to sue the Federal Government for violating its own laws. ''The document request was made some eight months ago,'' Mr. Deale said, ''and according to the Freedom of Information Act, they (the State Department) have to act within 10 days.'' The center also represented the family of Edward Horman, whose son, Charles, also a young American freelance journalist, vanished in Chile in 1973 and was later found murdered. The Horman family's plight was depicted in the book and film ''Missing.'' Also at issue is whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation can take part in the Sullivan case. Family members and local legislators contend that the bureau is reluctant and unwilling to initiate its own investigation, but bureau officials in Washington stress that such a request must come first from the Salvadoran Government and meet the approval of George P. Shultz, the Secretary of State, and William French Smith, the United States Attorney General. According to Daniel Yeager, an assistant to Representative Roukema, the F.B.I. initially refused to become involved because it contended that such a request must be instituted by the State Department. Mr. Yeager said that, although the F.B.I. had since received the request, it reported that it could not get involved unless directly requested to do so by Salvadoran authorities. Bureau officials, acknowledging the F.B.I.'s involvement in the murder investigations of the slain churchwomen and agricultural workers, emphasized that its assistance in those cases was requested through proper government channels. ''There is a proper channel to go through,'' said Lane Bonner, an F.B.I. spokesman, ''and the Attorney General has made no such request of us yet concerning Mr. Sullivan.'' He noted that the bureau was not empowered to conduct investigations abroad and could act only in a limited advisory capacity when permitted to do so. ''We can't just arbitrarily go into another country and start knocking on doors,'' Mr. Bonner said. According to several anonymous letters received recently from El Salvador, Mr. Sullivan was slain by Salvadoran secret police.

790-> BUSINESS FORUM; A BAD IDEA THAT COULD SPREAD
IT is hard to blame T. Boone Pickens Jr. for trying to get the maximum value from his investment in Gulf Oil. The company's rich oil and gas reserves, which on their own could be highly profitable, are buried in a corporate body along with many low-value, even worthless, parts. But if the Pickens effort to split up Gulf succeeds, it will be hard for other major oil companies to escape the same fate. What we will be left with is an array smaller oil companies, each with much less capital to spend on such vital activities as exploration for new oil and gas. In short, our dependence on foreign oil could increase. Without exception, the profits from oil and gas reserves of the major oil companies are greater than those thrown off by the other parts of their business. Oil refining and marketing are seldom profitable and, thus, drag down the price of the companies' shares so that stock prices reflect no more than one-third to one-half of the underlying value of the reserves. According to Mr. Pickens and others, the creation of a royalty trust by a spinoff to stockholders of a company's domestic reserves allows them to realize more of the true value of those reserves. But I think we need to consider more than just the short-term rewards to the shareholder. A much larger issue is the long-term impact of the spinoff on a corporate entity like Gulf and on the nation's oil industry in general. The Pickens group evidently selected Gulf as its target because Gulf has one of the most lackluster records of financial and operating performance of the major integrated oils - its 10.2 percent return on capital employed over the past five years has been lower than that of any other leading oil company. The Gulf dividend showed no increase over the same period when adjusted for inflation. Gulf's management has admitted the poor performance and has begun to do something about it. It has concentrated on reducing costs by sharply cutting employment, selling most of its loss-generating refining and marketing properties in Europe and eliminating certain weak chemical operations. At the same time, it has concentrated on the all-important activity of finding new oil, moving into frontier areas like Alaska and expanding exploration in the Gulf of Mexico's deep-water areas. It is using new seismic and geological interpretation to screen prospects in the Gulf and is limiting its bidding to Federal leases with reserves of at least 50 million barrels of oil or the equivalent in natural gas. The company says its five-year goal is to replace, through discovery of new oil and gas, 80 percent of its annual domestic production each year. After that, it plans to replace 100 percent of production a year. These are certainly ambitious, worthwhile goals - but even more, they are the key to Gulf's long-term viability. To accomplish them will require not only impressive geological talent but, above all, very large capital and exploratory expenditures. The search for reserves off the Outer Continental Shelf and in Alaska is very capital-intensive. THAT is where the royalty trust would jeopardize Gulf the corporation. To be meaningful to the shareholders, around half of the cash flow of Gulf's domestic production would probably have to be spun off in the royalty trust. That half would be vital to funding Gulf's exploration strategy in the high-cost frontier. The frontier - in all its vast expanse - is where almost everyone believes the next big discoveries in the United States will be, if they are to be at all. If Gulf does not have the cash flow to finance frontier exploration, it will cease being an important factor in the oil business. Thus, if the Pickens group succeeded, it is likely that Gulf would be on the same ill-fated path that Cities Service, Marathon and Conoco found themselves. Once the investing public got the sense that these oil companies were worth only the oil and gas they had in the ground, they became little more than an ''asset play.'' They were bought at substantial premiums by other corporate giants and subsequently dismantled. Occidental, for example, has sold off large parts of Cities Service's unprofitable refining operations. Du Pont divested itself of Conoco's huge coal holdings, and United States Steel has stripped Marathon of major chemical operations. Looking further into the future, if Gulf falls by the wayside, the pattern will be repeated. It is very likely that the momentum for capturing the values underlying the reserves of other integrated companies will accelerate. Few companies will be able to stave off that push. The end will come only when enough refining and marketing capacity has been shut down to make marketing and refining truly profitable and competitive with oil and gas production. But the cost will be an oil industry strapped for capital needed to find oil on the frontier and an inevitable rise in imported oil that we have fought so long to avoid.

794-> D.D. MACFARLANE, A HARNESS-RACING LEADER, DIES AT 75
Donald D. MacFarlane, a prominent harness-racing executive who helped build the sport into a billion-dollar industry, died Saturday in Delray Beach, Fla., where he resided in the winter. Mr. MacFarlane, who also had a home in Grosse Pointe, Mich., suffered a stroke two days before Christmas. He was 75 years old. He was a former president of Castleton Farms in Lexington, Ky., one of the largest breeders of trotting and pacing horses. He left Castleton to become president of Hazel Park Raceway in Detroit when that track opened in 1953. He later became Hazel Park's chairman as well, and continued in both positions until his death. A year after having arrived at Hazel Park, Mr. MacFarlane helped found Harness Tracks of America, an association of parimutuel tracks in the United States and Canada. For 20 years he was president or chairman of the association, which now has 50 member tracks. The creation of Harness Tracks of America was a direct challenge to the United States Trotting Association, which at the time barely recognized the parimutuel tracks. But it ultimately served to bring together the dissident factions in the burgeoning sport, and on his death Mr. MacFarlane was the general counsel of the U.S.T.A., harness racing's breed registry. He also bred and owned champion trotters and pacers. Among them were the pacer Vicar Hanover, winner of the 1964 Little Brown Jug, and two stakes-winning trotters, Trenton Time and Cold Comfort. Survivors include his wife, Jane; two sons and a daughter.

796-> FRANK DUNLOP READIES FOR EDINBURGH
LONDON Frank Dunlop won't have a chance to put his stamp on this year's Edinburgh International Festival. But when he takes over on Oct. 1 as director of the world's biggest arts jamboree, his plans and movements will be watched with considerable curiosity. It is an appointment that has raised expectations and eyebrows. Expectations because Mr. Dunlop becomes the first theater man ever to have run this music-and-opera dominated festival. Eyebrows because Mr. Dunlop, who constantly commutes between the Young Vic Theater in London and the United States where he is supervising his perennially successful production of ''Camelot,'' is a born popularizer and showman with an appetite for novelty. ''Unless Edinburgh can produce a lot of unique things,'' he says defiantly, ''there'd be no reason for a troublemaker like me to be going there.'' Edinburgh is not used to troublemakers. The Festival itself was set up in 1947, largely by Rudolf Bing, with the aim of bringing international culture to an austere, post-war Britain; since then, it has grown enormously while retaining its original conception. This year (the Festival starts on Aug. 21 and runs three weeks), there are 196 separate events and performances including opera from Hamburg and St. Louis, orchestras from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, theater companies from Spain, Israel and South Africa. On top of all this, there is the pressing presence of the Fringe (an unofficial, sideshow festival) which is a seething, bustling, open-to-all-comers affair that offers more than 450 companies putting on a variety of shows ranging from the dazzling to the dire. Not altogether fairly, Edinburgh has sometimes been known as the Festival with the Fringe on top. Mr. Dunlop, an energetic, bearded 56-year-old with a limitless capacity for enthusiasm, is determined to shake up this familiar pattern; high art in the main Festival, erratic razzmatazz on the Fringe. And he seems well-qualified to do so, since his career has embraced art and commerce. In Britain he founded Pop Theater (which brought film stars, singers and entertainers like Laurence Harvey, Cleo Laine and Jim Dale into the classical orbit) and the Young Vic (inexpensive theater for young people) as well as working with Lawrence Olivier at the National from 1968 to 1971. But he also turned ''Scapino'' and ''Sherlock Holmes'' into big New York hits and his production of ''Camelot'' keeps coming back like an old song. Indeed, he was redirecting the Lerner-and-Loewe musical in New York in May when he was summoned to meet the Edinburgh Festival board. ''I'd been thinking a lot about festivals, because I'd been talking to people in Boston about creating something similar to Edinburgh. Anyway, I flew over to Scotland, and the Edinburgh board asked me what was wrong with their Festival - that, while the music side had for 36 years offered a staple diet of good, wholesome food, it had been a long time since there was any real excitement, and that, in drama, dance and the visual arts there were some wonderful things, like this year's 'Vienna 1900' exhibition, but that they were sporadic. I didn't say there should be less music but lots of other things so the town was bursting. At the moment, the town bursts with the Fringe, but you sometimes have to look for the main Festival.'' Like all his predecessors, Mr. Dunlop will have to work within a tight, two-and-a-half million-dollar budget (supplied by the City of Edinburgh and the Scottish Arts Council). So, how does he aim to get the joint jumping? ''My first priority is drama and to get America much more involved,'' he says. ''We haven't really seen great American actors in great American plays since Ruth Gordon did 'The Matchmaker' here in 1954. I'll be in the States in September and talking to people at Lincoln Center about the possibility of a co-production. I'll also be talking to Ellen Burstyn and Al Pacino, who are setting up a new company based on the Actors Studio. And I'd like to negotiate with some of the best American groups: Sam Shepard's Magic Company from San Francisco, the Mark Taper Forum group in Los Angeles, the Arena Stage in Washington, Joe Papp and the Public Theater. To get companies like this, I'll have to run round and raise money from foundations and businesses. But I'm used to doing that for the Young Vic.'' John Drummond, the Festival's director for the past five years, has done a lot to broaden the scope of the drama program. Mr. Dunlop, however, aims to go much further in the direction of internationalism and new work. ''Paris at the moment is humming with activity and I'd like to tap that: Patrice Chereau, who did that revolutionary Bayreuth Ring cycle, and Ariane Mnouchkine have their own companies I'd like to bring over. And, on the dance front, Nureyev, who's taking over the Paris Opera Ballet, has already written to me saying he wants to be involved. I'd also like to do a series of new plays each year on a simple, arena stage that doesn't require 50 tons of scenery.'' To drama and dance buffs, all this is cheering news. But what about music-lovers who for the past 36 years have come to Edinburgh to hear great orchestras, stellar soloists, famous operas? What can Mr. Dunlop offer them? ''I don't think Edinburgh should just be receiving things on the festival circuit,'' he replies. ''I think it should be creating its own events. I've been talking to the Royal Shakespeare Company, who are hoping to collaborate with an orchestra on a new work. I was in Niagara-on-the-Lake the other day and met the associate manager of the new Roy Thomson Concert Hall in Toronto. We were talking about doing concert stagings of rare operas and sharing the financial risk. I also want to encourage local companies, like the excellent Scottish Opera, to think big. At the moment, we're discussing reviving 'La Dame Blanche' by the French composer Adrien Boieldieu, which is based on two novels by Sir Walter Scott. It's like a mixture of 'Lucia di Lammermoor' and 'The Daughter of the Regiment' and would be a natural for a special Festival production.'' Time and again Mr. Dunlop comes back to the need for Edinburgh to be a creative factory as well as a shop window and to the need for more financial sponsorship to make this possible. ''The Festival has got to take a look at itself and ask, 'What should we be doing now?' '' he says. ''It's 36 years since the Festival started, and it's no use doing now what it did then or simply doing it on a bigger scale, because every other Festival in the world is doing the same. It's got to be creative in itself, and maybe thinking more in terms of co-production with other countries like America and Japan. I also think the Festival should occasionally be outrageous, because only if you give people a surprise do you jolt them out of their conventional thinking. Which I suppose is why they've invited a nuisance like me.'' One of the big problems is space. For years, Edinburgh has havered and wavered over the building of a new opera house to the point where the project has become financially unviable. Mr. Dunlop, however, is exploring the idea of a low-budget, temporary structure that would be able to house major opera and ballet. He also intends to set up a pavilion that each year would be taken over by a different country (at the moment, he's talking to the Japanese and Australia and New Zealand) and that would enable them to show off all their cultural wares: the visual arts, drama and music. Mr. Dunlop's plans don't stop there. He hopes to set up exhibitions devoted to Islamic and Celtic art. He wants to celebrate the Scottish contribution to folk music. He is all for pop and rock being part of the Festival. He would like to see an International Art Fair and the creation of a world- wide Friends of the Edinburgh Festival. He's keen to capitalize on the wild success two years ago of a Writers' Conference that brought people like Gore Vidal, Anthony Burgess, Peter Shaffer and Scott Berg to Edinburgh for public interview sessions; next year, he hopes to have a three-week-long conference covering drama, fiction and non-fiction. He's even talking of capitalizing on Edinburgh's facility as a port and having people arrive by cruise-ship from London. Turning the dreams into reality is going to be a long, tough, expensive business, one that will limit Mr. Dunlop's outside directorial assignments to one show a year. The key question is whether he can turn the Festival into a creative center without alienating those who want the highly popular mixture-as-before, and whether he can generate sufficient sponsorship to justify co-productions and new ventures. Trained as an engineer, Mr. Dunlop has a love of new things; it's going to be fascinating to see how, over the next five years, he re-arranges the cultural kaleidoscope that has made Edinburgh the world's leading arts bonanza. ''It is at the moment,'' he concedes, ''the most amazing Festival in the world. I think it could be dazzling.'' Michael Billington reports frequently on the cultural scene in Great Britain.

797-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Trading Mixed; Gold Soars Overseas
The dollar was mixed in quiet trading and the pound held steady after tumbling to a low of $1.5650 last week. Speculation on the course of interest rates in the United States and Europe continued to influence currency and bullion markets. Gold bullion prices soared yesterday to nearly $500 an ounce in Europe, the highest level since early 1981. But gold lost some of its gains by the end of the trading day in the United States as investors sold gold to cash in on its surge. Bullion, which fell below $300 an ounce last June, started the day lower in Hong Kong, but then rose as high as $498.50 in London trading. It finished at $489.50 at Republic National Bank in New York, up a dollar an ounce from Friday's late bid. Declines in interest rates and a falling dollar have made gold and silver, which pay no interest, more attractive to hold, traders said. Silver rose above $13 an ounce in London for the first time in nearly two years, but also failed to hold its gains. The metal closed at $13.115 in London, up from $12.375 Friday and its best price since March 24, 1981, when it stood at $13.25. Silver for current delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange finished the day at $12.805, up a cent. The dollar began the trading day by rising to 230.70 yen in Tokyo from 229.80 late Friday. By day's end in the United States, the dollar had drifted down to 230.30 yen, from 230.70 late Friday. The pound closed at $1.5895 in Europe, up from $1.5795 late Friday. Later in New York, the pound edged up to $1.5822, from $1.5815 late Friday. Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 2.3575 West German marks, down from 2.3605; 1.9342 Swiss francs, down from 1.9375; 6.6700 French francs, down from 6.6750; 2.5955 guilders, down from 2.6000; 1,354.25 lire, down from 1,355.80, and 1.2218 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2211. Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 2.3702 marks, up from 2.3543; 6.7075 French francs, up from 6.6775; 1.9425 Swiss francs, up from 1.9360; and 1.2246 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2219.

798-> Top Avenger Is Winner In the Sporting Plate
Top Avenger, running third at the head of the stretch, made a late rush yesterday to win by a head in the $54,000 Sporting Plate Handicap at Aqueduct. Off as the second betting choice at 9-5, Top Avenger left from post 1 and quickly fell to the back of the five-horse pack. But the Jack Ludwig-trained 5-year-old outlasted Let Burn, the even-money favorite, and Mouse Corps to take the $32,640 first prize. Scoring in 1:10 2/5 over the six-furlong event, Top Avenger returned $5.60 for $2 to win. Mouse Corps was second and Triocala third. Let Burn was disqualified for interference in the stretch run and was placed fourth.

799-> AN AMERICAN OPPURTUNITY IN VIETNAM
To the Editor: Tad Szulc's Jan. 23 Op-Ed article on Vietnam is, in the opinion of one who has just completed his 16th trip to Vietnam within three years, both dead accurate as to America's many lost opportunities for a productive U.S.-Vietnamese rapprochement and inaccurate in a number of instances regarding current conditions. Dwelling on the inaccuracies in Szulc's commentary: * While many thousands (not millions) of Vietnamese were indeed sent to New Economic Zones in an unsuccessful experiment to improve agricultural production, many, if not most, of these people have now returned to their urban homes without penalty. * Hanoi's ''war of its own making'' in Cambodia was in fact an understandable (if not justifiable) reaction to repeated military attacks on its territory by the murderous Pol Pot regime and Hanoi's having to house 300,000 refugees from Cambodia and Vietnam at great cost. * China has indeed fared very well in Southeast Asia, despite Szulc's claim to the contrary: 300,000 Vietnamese troops are tied down defending their country's northern frontier; 200,000 troops are making little headway against not a local but a Chinese-armed insurgency in Cambodia, and Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Singapore are far more responsive to China's wishes than they are to U.S. policy initiatives. * As for the Soviet ''win'' in Indochina, what kind of victory is it when the Soviets have to spend $2 billion a year supporting two governments whose own functionaries criticize every aspect of their presence and dwell repeatedly on their preference for U.S. aid to that of a demanding, clumsy ally? America should not waste a great opportunity in Indochina. It is there for the asking. RICHARD M. WALDEN, Executive Director, Operation California, Beverly Hills, Calif., Jan 24, 1983

804-> MUSIC NOTED IN BRIEF; Soprano and Baritone Join Met's 'Butterfly'
Saturday night, the soprano Leona Mitchell and the baritone David Holloway joined the cast of the Metropolitan Opera's production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' under the direction of Eugene Kohn. The crucial task confronting any soprano undertaking the role of Cio-Cio-San is to reconcile the delicate vulnerability of the character with the strenuous and often heroic demands of Puccini's vocal writing. Miss Mitchell has an agile and distinctive voice, but her interpretation had a certain unwonted hardness, much better suited to a Tosca than to a Butterfly. The Act I duet with Ermanno Mauro's strong Pinkerton, for instance, seemed more a virtuosic dissection of lovers' passion rather than any sweeping surrender: Miss Mitchell's Butterfly kept her wits about her. ''Un Bel Di'' is, of course, the test of any Butterfly. To Miss Mitchell's credit, she kept the aria within dramatic context, but she seemed to be struggling against Mr. Kohn's tempo, and the result was less than fully harmonious. Although Mr. Holloway was occasionally drowned out in his duets with the large-voiced Mr. Mauro, he made an eloquent, gentlemanly and eminently believable Sharpless. Ariel Bybee's Suzuki was graceful and fluttering, and Therese Brandson sang Kate Pinkerton's few lines with the proper sense of awkward misplacement. The Fabrizio Melano production, now fully 25 years old, remains a charmer, well-suited to the opera. Tim Page

806-> WOMAN SAYS PLEA FOR A VISA COST HER A SOVIET CHESS TITLE
Anna Aksharumova says she believes that Soviet chess officials deprived her of the Soviet women's title because of her efforts to emigrate to Israel. The winner of the tournament in Tallinn, as widely expected, was Nana Ioseliani, a grandmaster from Soviet Georgia. Miss Aksharumova came in third. She says a ruling by officials in Moscow gave Miss Ioseliani a critical victory over her, and without that ruling she would have been first. Miss Aksharumova has accused the authorities of deliberately denying her the victory to avoid the embarrassment of passing the chess title to a ''refusenik.'' ''They had a terrible choice,'' said the slight, retiring woman of 25, who held the Soviet championship in 1976. ''It was a deciding match, and they faced the problem of letting me become champion or letting Ioseliani, who's very popular in Georgia, keep the title.'' Miss Aksharumova and her husband, Boris Gulko, a Soviet chess grandmaster, have been campaigning to emigrate for four years. Nonetheless, Miss Aksharumova was allowed to enter the tournament in Tallinn, and she soon found herself among the leaders. Celebrated Female Players On Dec. 17 she sat down to play Miss Ioseliani, a ranking international competitor and a source of national pride in Soviet Georgia, which is celebrated for its female chess players. The event that generated the dispute was unusual: Miss Ioseliani had completed her 39th move and tapped the button that stopped her clock and started Miss Aksharumova's going. But as Miss Aksharumova sat thinking, the red flag in Miss Ioseliani's clock suddenly dropped, signaling that the 2 hours 30 minutes allotted each player for the first 40 moves were up. The judge, K.H. Kann, declared Miss Aksharumova the winner, and the match referee, Kira Zvorykina, upheld the decision. Why Miss Ioseliani's flag dropped is a mystery - her clock was supposed to be dead until Miss Aksharumova made her move. Possibly the East German clock was defective and continued to run even after Miss Ioseliani pressed the button, or perhaps the flag had been poised to fall and was set off by a minor jolt. In any event, Miss Aksharumova, the judge and the referee agreed that under Soviet and international rules, protests about the functioning of a clock can be accepted only before the flag drops. Ruling From Moscow But Miss Ioseliani appealed to the central chess administration in Moscow, and three days later officials there announced that the game was to restart from the 39th move. Miss Ioseliani was given 1 1/2 minutes more to make her 40th move. Miss Aksharumova, however, refused to play. ''To agree to play out the game would have been to agree with a wrong decision,'' she said. The game thus went to Miss Ioseliani and with it a full point that gave her eventual victory in the tournament, which she won with 12 points. Klariya Litinskaya came in second with 11 1/2 points, and Miss Aksharumova was third with 11. Had Miss Aksharumova won the game, she would have had 12 points and Miss Ioseliani 11, and had they played their game out to the probable draw, the outcome would have been a three-way tie.

A high-ranking police official involved in the search for the Aga Khan's stolen $13 million race horse said today that ''I must now take seriously the possibility that Shergar is dead.'' The official, Chief Superintendent James Murphy, taking part in the nationwide hunt for the armed gang that took the horse from the Aga Khan's Ballymany stud farm Tuesday night, said the police were reconsidering earlier judgments that a series of telephone calls to Northern Ireland last week were a hoax. The callers told the wife of the trainer Jeremy Maxwell and the BBC's office in Belfast that the horse had been injured thrashing about in its trailer and had had to be killed.

808-> IDEAS & TRENDS; Miss Lavelle Indicted Again
Last month a jury found sympathy for Rita Lavelle's failure to show up at a House of Representatives hearing in March, judging her not guilty of contempt of Congress. Now the former ''Superfund'' manager at the Environmental Protection Agency may get a chance to see whether a jury will be less sympathetic if it determines that when she did show up, she lied. Miss Lavelle was indicted last week on five counts of lying about her actions as head of the environmental agency's toxic waste cleanup program. The indictment said that she ''participated in activity such as placing cleanup of certain sites on an 'election-track' and delaying or hastening cleanup of certain sites with political considerations in mind.'' While not charging that this was itself a crime, the grand jury said she had perjured herself before Congressional committees and submitted false written certifications to Congress and the E.P.A. The perjury charges center on Miss Lavelle's denial of having influenced agency action on the Stringfellow Acid Pits cleanup in California. Aerojet General Corporation, her former employer, was a user of that dump, and she had promised at her confirmation hearings in 1982 that she would disqualify herself from any matter involving Aerojet. But a Federal grand jury said she learned of Aerojet's potential liability at a staff meeting on May 28, 1982, not June 17 as she had testified. She continued to participate in the Stringfellow matter, the indictment stated, by telephoning John C. Andreason, Aerojet vice president, to disclose information received from her staff. Representative James H. Scheuer, Democrat of New York, said that if Miss Lavelle came to trial, it might illuminate the ''role played by other E.P.A. officials and the connections, if any, to White House policy- makers.'' Justice Department officials said there were no plans to indict any other former E.P.A. executives who left the agency under fire earlier this year.

809-> THE REGION; A Nuclear Albatross for Suffolk County?
The Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island is 10 years late, 10 times over budget and, because of action in Albany last week, perhaps indefinitely on hold. In an unexpected move, Governor Cuomo ordered the state not to approve an emergency evacuation plan for the 10-mile area surrounding the facility. Mr. Cuomo said he ''would not be a party to any effort to impose an independently developed state plan upon Suffolk County.'' The plan was submitted by the Long Island Lighting Company, which owns Shoreham. State officials said that without approval of an evacuation plan, the plant would be unable to begin operation. However, the company may try to invoke a Federal law that allows a nuclear plant to be licensed as long as a utility-sponsored emergency plan is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Cuomo did not close the door on licensing the plant, saying he would ''cooperate in any way possible'' with Lilco and Suffolk County officials to help prepare a workable evacuation program. But County Executive Peter F. Cohalan said that because of Long Island's ''unique local conditions'' - namely, that it is an island - no plan would be acceptable. And hours after the Governor issued his order, the Suffolk County Legislature voted 15-1 not to forward its own evacuation plan to Albany. ''Consumers are going to pay for the plant whether it opens or not,'' said Jan K. Hickman, a spokesman for Lilco, who added that it would cost $10 billion to operate the plant over its expected 30-year life, compared to $20 billion if it did not operate. Part of the cost difference would stem from buying power to replace the lessexpensive electricity that Shoreham would have generated.

810-> ACCOUNTS DEBATABLE
WHEN Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981, the American economy was a shambles. It got messier by the month, sliding into the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Now it is on the mend, and there are two questions: how much credit Reaganomics can claim, and how much real improvement there has been. A snapshot from last week's economic reports is encouraging. The broadest measure of economic health, the gross national product, was estimated to have expanded at an annual rate of 9.2 percent in the second quarter, the fastest in five years. As for price increases, which have been sliced by more than half since 1981, the G.N.P. deflator, a good measure of the underlying rate of inflation, showed an increase of only 3.5 percent. But many analysts are quick to point out that the remarkable improvement should not be taken as a sign that the economy's ails have been cured. ''We're still using only 75 percent of our capacity,'' said Walter Joelson, chief economist for the General Electric Corporation. ''Unemployment is still at 9 1/2 percent. And corporate profits, though they have risen, are still terrible compared to a normal year.'' Jay Schmiedeskamp, director of economic surveys for the Gallup Organization, offers a similar caution. ''There is a period during each business cycle when the economic news sounds good,'' he said. ''What is really happening is that things are badly out of balance - the deficit, for example.'' The Congressional Budget Office's latest deficit estimate, in a budget review last week, was for $200.6 billion this year. In fact, despite ebullition in the stock market and growing confidence among consumers, economists share widespread pessimism. Perhaps the main source of concern is the White House's economic policy mix - expansionary fiscally and restrictive monetarily - which many experts believe is keeping interest rates high. Reaganomics had four components: significant tax reduction; a reduction in spending growth; steady, limited monetary growth, and regulatory relief. Point by point, Administration officials say, there has been progress. ''There has been a significant marginal tax rate reduction and an increase in depreciation,'' said Edwin L. Dale, an assistant director of the Office of Management and Budget. ''On the spending side, we have been able to stop the growth of nondefense, noninterest spending in real terms, although we have not been able to turn it down. As for monetary policy, it is pretty indisputable that we have achieved a reduction in inflation that was beyond what anyone anticipated, though at a price. And on regulatory relief, we've achieved savings that should amount to $150 billion over the next 10 years for the private sector and state and local governments.'' The question that remains is the combined effect of these programs. On that count, even Administration officials are cautious, although not so pessimistic as other economic experts. ''The ultimate payoff can be seen only if the economy realizes more rapid growth than in the past,'' Mr. Dale said. ''And we really won't be able to judge that for another 10 years. But the beauty of our present situation is that we are launching this expansion from a very low rate of inflation.'' To be speaking of launching an expansion now, however, would seem to be something of a setback for a program that promised an overnight revolution in savings and investment that would place the American economy on the fast track to steady, noninflationary growth after a decade of stagflation. Clearly that is not here yet, and most observers are skeptical that it is in the offing. Unintended Consequences They acknowledge the lower inflation rate. But many share the view expressed by Mr. Schmiedeskamp that ''no one ever doubted we could break the inflationary cycle with a serious recession; the trick was to do it without.'' While there is a widespread feeling that Mr. Reagan's policies did not create recession, there is also a consensus that his approach made it longer and deeper. Not only did it encourage the Fed's restrictive monetary policy to fight inflation, but by creating huge budget deficits it probably caused the Fed to be more restrictive. Robert Eisner, an economics professor at Northwestern University, also blames Mr. Reagan for the recession's severity on the ground that he ''abandoned the consensus of the last couple of decades that Government should intervene to stop the recession.'' Outsiders also note that the policy of slow, steady money-supply growth has been tripped up by efforts to deregulate the financial markets. The rapid changes in the availability of and rules governing financial instruments, such as bank money-market deposit accounts, have confounded attempts to keep monetary growth under careful control because there are no historical guides to consumer use. Many economists credit the Reagan tax policies with giving the recovery its current strength, but harbor strong doubts about its future strength. ''There are nagging concerns about the long-term competitive position of the United States,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. ''Most business leaders feel interest rates are still too high and will impede the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.'' Other economists express even greater concerns that the large budget deficits will eventually abort the recovery, or possibly trigger an international financial crisis because the strong dollar makes it more difficult for developing countries to repay their loans. Robert Ortner, chief economist at the Commerce Department, says the worst fears are probably exaggerated. He agrees that the deficits, if not reduced, will continue to press interest up. But he does not expect that to kill the recovery. ''People forget how stimulative the large budget deficit really is,'' Mr. Ortner said. ''What these levels of interest rates will do is distort the composition of the economy. Areas that are less interest-rate sensitive, such as nondurable goods and defense products, will continue to grow.'' While others fear inflation will be reignited by the stimulative budget, Mr. Ortner is somewhat optimistic. He says the modest level of labor settlements should allow for more real growth as long as productivity continues to rise. If Mr. Ortner is right, the prospects for growth - what Reaganomics was supposed to encourage - are still up in the air. ''So far, the rate of capital investment has actually faltered, but I did not expect it to grow quickly,'' said Michael Boskin, an economics professor at Stanford University and an adviser to the Reagan Administration. ''But it will not take place now unless we get through at least four or six quarters of reasonable growth without the reacceleration of inflation, in which capacity utilization moves up but interest rates do not. If they are driven up, the whole program will be self-defeating. I do think there is a major risk that will happen.''

811-> INSANITY PLEA: DOCTORS VS. LAW
THE successful insanity defense by John W. Hinckley, the would-be assassin of President Reagan, spurred a national concern and indignation at the insanity defense. The recent controversy led to the examination of legal and psychiatric issues, especially the role of the psychiatrist in the courts, by Connecticut's Law Revision Commission. But even before the Hinckley incident, a number of cases where the insanity defense was successful caused community concern, which led to the legislature changing the verdict of ''not guilty by reason of insanity'' to the legally fatuous but ostensibly palatable ''guilty but not criminally responsible.'' Queen Victoria was also incensed that caught assassins were found ''not guilty.'' She prevailed on the English Parliament to pass a statute, in effect until 1964, that read ''guilty but insane.'' This is a reminder how over centuries people react to what they perceive to be miscarriage or a travesty of justice. As recently as the middle of the 19th century, insanity was a medical term for those we would now call psychotic, and was equated with behavior that was irresponsible, unpredictable and often dangerous. People judged to be insane were considered to be incapable of managing their own affairs, of being unable to enter into meaningful contracts and also were not considered responsible for their actions. In that sense it also had a legal meaning. If insanity was proven as having existed at the time of a felony charge, then the accused was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and while spared the ultimate punishment - execution - endured lifelong incarceration. As psychiatry became an integral part of medicine, the term insanity was replaced by mental illness. But while the term insanity disappeared from medical language - as did other terms such as ague, consumption, or bad humor - it had become firmly embedded in legal language. In all criminal proceedings it is fundamental that two elements of the crime be proven; actus rea or the evil act and mens rea, or evil intent. This is fundamental to the insanity defense, since it has been accepted that a person severely mentally ill cannot make contracts or have intent. The American legal system is based on the English common law, and the evolution of the insanity defense goes back to English case laws and antedates psychiatry. Up to the end of the 18th century, to be found insane the defendant had to be ''totally deprived of his understanding and memory and not to know what he is doing anymore than an infant, a brute, or a wild beast.'' This was known as the wild beast test of insanity. At the 1800 trial of James Hatfield, who was charged with high treason, it was successfully argued that if the original premise on which intent was based was delusional, than all consequences stemming from such reasoning were logically considered to be flawed. But the trial that has influenced British as well as American standards the most occurred in 1843 in London. Daniel McNaughton, a political activist opposed to the government in power, attempted to assassinate the Prime Minister but only succeeded in killing his secretary. Caught in the act, McNaughton faced execution. For the first time in an English court, physicians who specialized in the care of the mentally ill (at that time referred to as the ''mad doctors'') were allowed to make conclusionary statements that McNaughton had an overpowering delusion and was therefore insane. The description of McNaughton's symptoms was ''imagines the Tories are his enemies, shy and retiring in his manner.'' As a result of the McNaughton verdict, the Law Peers in the House of Lords were charged to propose a definitive standard, which in England and the United States became known as the McNaughton standard. It stated that to be acquitted by reason of insanity, the defendant ''must be laboring under such a defective reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.'' In the early 1950's the American Law Institute, because of the archaic rigidity of the McNaughton standard, proposed the Model Penal Code, which is the standard in Connecticut. It states, ''A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.'' The first part of that is nothing else but a rewritten McNaughton, and the second part appears to be close to the concept of acknowledging that some mental disorders are so overpowering that the individual is a victim of his psychopathology. The supporters of a more rigorous standard argued that Connecticut should go back to McNaughton. But it should be emphasized that all the insanity standards have been by lawmakers, not by psychiatrists. The question that heats the debate in the public forum has to do with the role of the psychiatrist and the scope of his testimony regarding insanity. Is this a decision for the judge or jury? Does psychiatry have such expertise? All attempts to preclude the psychiatrist from making conclusionary statements and/or limiting psychiatric evidence to a panel of expert witnesses have foundered in the constitutionally held prerogatives of the defendant, which permit all evidence that may support acquittal. It is unfortunate that in all instances where there is division of opinion about insanity, the public is outraged by psychiatrists, and not by the legal system that permits such adversarial strategies. The issue that polarized discussion most of all on the commission had to do with the burden of proof. Again, the split was between those concerned for the rights of the defendant and those who viewed the burden of proof of sanity as unreasonable for the state to develop. Purists of the legal system argue that since everyone is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty, and since intent is an element of the crime, then once the defense raises the issue of insanity it becomes a burden for the prosecution to prove the accused sane beyond a reasonable doubt. This, in fact, was the case in the Federal jurisdiction where Hinckley was tried and may very well be the reason why the jury was not persuaded that Hinckley, with his background and observed behavior in the courtroom, justified a finding of sane beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, it is argued that to prove someone sane is an unreasonable burden, since only the defense has the choice of introducing insanity as a defense, and only the defendant truly knows his mental condition. The majority of the commission recommended that the burden of proof be on the defense to establish the presence of insanity at time of proscribed conduct. The psychiatrists on the commission were frequently consulted as to how new scientific developments in psychiatry affected the profession's position regarding the insanity defense. It has to be emphasized that there is no direct and obvious relationship between mental illness and the legal principle of insanity. This has led to many psychiatrists advocating that the expert witness remove himself from the trial process. In that sense, they ally themselves with proponents of abolishing the insanity defense. The proponents of the abolition of the insanity defense accept the fact that intention for a crime has to be present for a crime to be legally proven. There has been an argument made that the intent issue can be argued without psychiatric testimony. The concept of the insanity defense is philosophical and moral and not dependent on the sophistication and scientific basis of psychiatric knowledge. Even if we knew the etiology of the major psychotic illnesses, it would still be a social judgment, quite distinct from psychiatric expertise, whether the defendant met the various standards of insanity advanced by the lawmakers. The fascinating argument advanced successfully in the Hatfield defense, that if the proscribed act was based on a delusion, then responsibility cannot be impugned, founders on the clinical evidence that many psychotics - while perplexed, distraught, delusional and hallucinatory - do not always act on their beliefs. In other words, human feelings, belief systems and motivations are so complex and so interwoven with the pattern of social and cultural standards and that mere psychiatric expertise is insufficient to make reasonable inferences or predictions as to personal control or behavior particularly retroactively. But the Law Revision Commission and the state legislature, cognizant of this fact, still felt that psychiatric expertise, imperfect as it is, adversarial as it has become, offered insights that were too valuable to be ignored.

812-> THE WORLD
WithdrawalSymptoms Lebanon's feuding politicians are more accustomed to hurling epithets than forging compromises but last week, with Israeli forces preparing to withdraw from the Shuf Mountains, they were seeking ways to avert renewed civil strife. President Amin Gemayel called on all faiths to unite and help him free the country of foreign armies. He sent a top aide to Paris for possible meetings with Walid Jumblat, the Druse leader, who threatened ''a terrible bloodbath'' unless his 300,000 people received recognition in the Government and autonomy in the Shuf. The Government reportedly named a Druse brigadier general to command army units in the Shuf when Israel moves out. Pierre Gemayel, the President's father, said the family's Christian Phalangist militia would leave the area when the army arrives. But Mr. Jumblat, who regards the army as also Christian-dominated, dismissed the Phalangist offer as ''certainly not a concession.'' His chief allies, former Prime Minister Rashid Karami and former President Suleiman Franjieh, offered to hold a national reconciliation conference with President Gemayel in northern Lebanon or Tunis. Mr. Jumblat's Syrian allies were more aggressive. Damascus warned it would defend the Druse if the army was sent into the Shuf. Robert C. MacFarlane, the American special envoy, also flew to Paris. He persuaded Israel to delay its withdrawal for a few days but Prime Minister Menachem Begin said he hoped the ''redeployment'' to south Lebanon would be completed by Sept. 8, the Jewish New Year. Although his peace initiative has been dormant for months, President Reagan reminded Israel in his weekly radio address that he was still intent on achieving an overall Middle East settlement. Mr. Reagan said new Israeli settlements in the West Bank were ''an obstacle to peace,'' a remark certain to displease Jerusalem. But Israel got a pre-holiday lift from another President, Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, the first African head of state to visit since 1971. The two countries linked resumption of diplomatic relations, broken under Arab pressure 10 years ago, to shared concern over Libyan President Muammar el-Qaddafi's ''new- style imperialism'' in Chad.

814-> Market Place; OPEC Sets Off 2 Reactions
JANUS, the ancient Roman god with two faces looking in opposite directions, could have symbolized part of the action in last week's stock market: airline stocks rose and oil issues fell in response to the same event. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries finished its meeting in Geneva Monday without agreeing upon production levels to bolster prices. Wall Street's reaction was that crude oil prices were likely to move lower - with bearish portents for oil-company profits - while airlines would benefit from lower jet fuel costs. In any event, Salomon Brothers reported that industry group movements for the first four days of the week showed airlines as the strongest sector, with a gain of 6 1/2 percent, while domestic oils were the weakest, falling 5 1/2 percent. On Monday, following OPEC's inconclusive meeting, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 22 points. That loss was more than offset by Thursday's gain of 25 points, an advance fueled by some signs of economic recovery. G.E. Stock Breaks Par For the week, the Dow finished at 1,064.75, showing a net gain of 11.77 points. Its star performer on Friday was General Electric. The stock broke par, in Wall Street terminology, to trade at a record price of 100 3/4 before finishing at 99 5/8, up 4 3/8 points for the session. This was in response to an agreement by G.E. to sell most of its Utah International subsidiary to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd. of Australia for $2.4 billion in cash. Last year, G.E. shares sold as low as 55. General Electric's gain on the sale, after payment of a capital gains tax estimated at 28 percent, could amount to $1 billion, or close to $4 a share, said Kemp Fuller Jr. of Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden Inc. After the sale is consummated, the company's war chest of cash and marketable securities is expected to reach $5 billion. Since G.E.'s management has expressed its intention to expand in high-technology and other high-growth areas of the economy, the likelihood is that a parade of investment bankers will troop to the company with acquisition proposals in tow. In fact, the big merger guessing game of 1983 might become, ''Who will G.E. acquire?'' Some Wary of Retreat While answers about G.E.'s intentions remain hazy, money managers last week were pondering other strategies. Some professionals still poured cash into the stock market. Others kept eyeing the possibility of a retreat in the wake of the market's huge advance since August. In New York, an executive of a firm that manages in excess of $6 billion in equity money for pension funds and other institutional accounts was asked: ''How fully invested are you?'' The man raised his hand to eyeball level. The executive said his firm is avoiding steel, chemical and other basic cyclical industries in favor of more growth-oriented areas of the economy. As far as depressed sectors are concerned, he ventured to say: ''We're looking at some machinery stocks.'' In Bridgeport, Wright Investors' Service said it believes that most forecasts of economic growth and Federal budget deficits will prove to be overly pessimistic. Thus, it is maintaining ''fully invested positions in both equity and fixed-income accounts.'' Wright manages $1.25 billion for individuals and institutions. In Philadelphia, Ben E. Capaldi of Provident Capital Management, which tends $1.4 billion of pension fund money, reported that ''we're running a cash position of 8 to 10 percent in our accounts, or in the midpoint of our customary range.'' Mr. Capaldi added: ''We have been focusing some commitments in outof-favor groups such as bank stocks.'' In Woodland Hills, Calif., William F. Mason, president of a firm that manages $70 million for small institutions and individual clients, said, ''The stock market apparently is forming a topping pattern, but it still may have some time to run - possibly before encountering a correction around March.'' The firm, which stresses market timing in its investment approach, depends heavily on ''buy'' or ''sell'' signals based on computer-fed technical data from its subsidiary, Trade Levels Inc. ''Our system flashed a buy signal on Aug. 17 and that is still in effect,'' Mr. Mason said. ''However, we are detecting signs of stock distribution that is most evident in big-capitalization issues.'' Distribution implies that selling pressure outweighs buying demand. If a stock is determined to be falling faster than the general market in a period of declining prices, or if it is rising more slowly than the overall market while most other stocks are going up, Mr. Mason said such a trend means distribution is under way. Accumulation, as Janus might have observed, is the reverse process.

815-> NEW AID FOR THE JOBLESS TRIED IN PENNSYLVANIA
Government officials, industry and private groups in western Pennsylvania are taking action to help unemployed people keep their homes and medical benefits. Action-Housing, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit group, said recently that it was establishing a $200,000 fund to provide loans to unemployed people in danger of losing their homes through foreclosures. The group said the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County had each contributed $50,000 to the fund and that five lending institutions had each donated $5,000. In addition, a Lawrence County judge recently followed the lead of Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) officials by placing a temporary ban on foreclosure sales of the farms and homes of unemployed people. In a separate move, two locals of the United Steelworkers of America in Sharon, Pa., are taking part in an experimental program that provides emergency medical and surgical care for about 600 workers laid off by Sharon Steel Corporation. Survey of Homeowners The Action-Housing program, which is not yet in effect, was developed after an examination of foreclosure records found 2,000 of the 245,000 homeowners in four western Pennsylvania counties were under foreclosure proceedings. The survey also found that 15,000 mortgage holders were behind in their payments by 30 days or more and that 22,500 appeared on the verge of becoming delinquent, because their unemployment benefits were about to expire and they were already behind in utility payments. Some critics of the idea, including the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee, representing residents out of work, have said the $200,000 fund will not be enough to help many people facing foreclosure. Sheriff Eugene Coon of Allegheny County recently removed 42 homes from a sheriff's sale and Judge Nicholas Papadakos of the county's Common Pleas Court ordered a temporary halt to foreclosure sales of homes whose owners had lost their jobs. Ban on Some Sales Shortly afterward, Judge Francis X. Caiazza of Lawrence County issued a similar order at the request of Sheriff George Sigler. To clear up legal questions on the judges' actions, three Democratic state legislators have introduced a bill in Harrisburg to permit courts to impose a moratorium on foreclosures. The hospitalization plan for the 600 unempoyed steelworkers and their families took effect Jan. 13 in Sharon, about 85 miles north of Pittsburgh, where the unemployment rate has almost doubled in the last year and is now 18.2 percent. ''As far as we have been able to determine, this is the first and only program of its kind in the country,'' said Eugene J. O'Meara, president of Sharon General Hospital. Howard Clark, president of Local 1197 of the steelworkers' union, also said he believed the program was unique. The agreement links Sharon Steel, and the hospital in a plan covering those steelworkers who have been laid off for more than one year but less than two years. Those who have been laid off for less than a year are still covered by the company's regular medical plan. Union members who are still working gave up $1-an-hour in wages to help finance the new plan. In return, Sharon Steel pays about $9,600 a month to the hospital, which has agreed to use the money as payment in full for emergency treatment for the laid-off union members and their families. Representatives of the union, the company and the hospital said the plan would be evaluated after six months to determine if any changes were needed. More than a third of Sharon Steel's 3,100 hourly and salaried workers have lost their jobs. The company, which makes flat rolled steel and stainless steel pipe and tubing, is a major industry in Sharon, population 19,057, near the border with Ohio.

816-> THE WORLD
With millions of dollars in United States aid and encouragement from President Reagan, the Nicaraguan insurgents seemed to be getting their anti-Sandinista act together last week. Government officials and diplomats in Managua said as many as 2,000 rebels had crossed into Nicaragua, launching hit-and-run attacks across three northern provinces that left scores dead on both sides. Nicaraguan officials reported that the insurgents seemed better disciplined, trained and armed this time; they suspect they are being supplied by air from bases in Honduras. Nicaragua's Defense Minister Humberto Ortega suggested the insurgents might try to seize Puerto Cabezas on the Caribbean coast, to establish a provisional Government that ''would be recognized by the United States and its regional allies.'' The aircraft carrier Coral Sea and a five-ship escort have been steaming off the Caribbean coast since mid-August. Last week, the battleship New Jersey arrived on the Pacific side with seven more warships. Nicaraguan officials said they feared the insurgents may get direct support during United States naval and land maneuvers that will bring thousands of troops to Honduras over the next six months. Chipping away at the insurgents' political divisions, the United States- financed Nicaraguan Democratic Force based in Honduras was predicting a merger arrangement with Eden Pastora's Costa Rica-based Revolutionary Democratic Alliance. Despite their differences, the two groups recently joined the Misura Indian Organization in endorsing democratic government.

817-> The Trials Of a Native-Born 'Foreigner'
AS a child growing up, I was usually the only kid of Chinese origin in the neighborhood. Indeed, in the whole school and even at college. At various times I was mistaken for a foreign exchange student from Korea, a Japanese war bride, an adopted Vietnamese and sometimes a Burmese; before Hawaii became a state, a Hawaiian visitor. I was never mistaken for an American. Saleswomen would address my blond girlfriend of Irish and French descent to see if I liked such-and-such a handbag. Later, a we would giggle, knowing I could understand English. People would also come up to me with calligraphy for my interpretation. And once, while attending the first day of an English Literature class, the instructor walked by and said some words in Chinese. I could only muster a smile, saying, "I'm fine, thank you, but I really don't understand that dialect." It was true. In fact, I understood no dialect. I lost both parents when I was young and the only words I could remember were numbers from one to 15 as well as such helpful nounces as milk and belly button. I never minded youngsters asking me, "Do you know Charlie Chan?" Or even strange men in elevators who asked, "How do you like this country?" Sometimes it was a blessing that people thought I did not understand the American language. One after noon, I was followed down the street by a stranger who said he had just returned from Japan. He said he had not seen anyone quite like me in Tokyo. An old line, I know. I shook my head to make him understand there was a language barrier between us, and therefore East could not meet West. I was always asked where I was born. And I disappointed hundreds by telling them the truth. I was born in Portland, Me. They expected some place exotic and faraway, such as Peking or Shanghai. The crowning blow came when President Nixon visited China in 1971. Suddenly, Americans were learning to cook with a work or were practicing with their chopsticks. Women's clubs wanted my recipes for crisp-fried duck, egg rolls and sweet and sour spareribs. I could only offer them New England clam chowder, baked beans and pumpkin spice pie. To save face, I had to learn how to cook the Chinese way. After all, how could someone as Chinese-looking as I not know the secrets of wok cooking? I learned and became so proficient that I even won a recipe contest sponsored by a Boston newspaper, and my article on Chinese cooking without fear was published by a women's magazine. I also bought two woks and a bamboo steamer. One summer I had a Chinese vegetable garden in anticipation of questions on how to grow snow peas, winter melon and yard-long beans. I did my homework in Chinatown, where many hours of browsing through the markets made me become knowledgeable enough to know the difference between bok choy and wong bok. So I am prepared. Am I ever. Yet, I still lack authenticity. I do not speak the language and I have never been to Peking. Seasoned travelers look to me for tips on hotel accommodations. The only building I know in Peking is the Temple of Heaven, and that is no hotel. And alas, I cannot even exchange sightseeing information when women I have never met approach me on the street to tell me they have just come back from Hong Kong or China. These days many students are taking up the Chinese language. They are thrilled when they spot me on campus, for they try out some conversation on me, hoping that they have the right inflection to be understood by a true Chinese. I can only smile and say, "I'm fine, how are you?" Even while browsing in the Chinatown gift shops, clerks speak to me in Chinese, and they take it even worse than the students when I do not reply in Chinese. Once, when I decided to discover how the Chinese celebrate New Year, I signed up for the special bus to Chinatown. I was told, much to my delight, that a guide, who worked for 16 years in Chinatown, would accompany us. But guess what? Out of 46 people on the bus, who should be singled out to answer such questions as, "Where is the best bakery to buy almond cookies?" So the pressure continues. In the meantime, I have been saving my money to go over there. This fall, I have signed up for a three-week tour of China. My husband, an experienced travel agent, was asked to lead the tour. Ordinarily, I would be delighted with this kind of arrangement, but what kind of authority does a red-haired, blue-eyed man have . . . when he has me tagging along?

821-> WHAT'S NEW IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY; A CEASE-FIRE IN THE FARE WARS
Finally, the airline industry seems poised for recovery. Airline travel increased during the holiday season and the gains are continuing. Aviation fuel prices started to drop last year and are expected to keep falling in the months ahead. Many of the nation's carriers have cut costs through labor concessions and more fuel-efficient planes. And, most important, the American economy shows signs of reawakening. But good news for the industry could bring some bad news for flyers: It could could mean an end to the much-heralded fare wars that some airlines have been waging since last fall, industry experts say. Pan American World Airways and Continental Airlines last month set off the current round of $99 one-way fares to many parts of the country. Continental's low fare runs until April 1, but Pan Am said last week that its low fares would expire on schedule Feb. 10. The company plans to keep some fares low, but will raise others to former levels. How long would a cease-fire last? If traffic falls sharply when the fare-war stops said Edmund Greenslet, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pan Am will ''come roaring right back in with the lower fares. They cannot tolerate a significant loss of revenue at this time.'' The airlines are hoping that the fare wars will moderate and enable them to capitalize on the improved traffic that some carriers reported in January. Most airlines cannot make money at the $99 fares even when most seats are filled. Early indications are that the improvement in traffic has been significant. American Airlines said its traffic last month rose 14.1 percent from January 1982. Eastern's traffic was up 13.3 percent and Delta had an 18.6 percent rise. The fare wars, to be sure, have made a difference. Pan Am and Continental have the most extensive deep-discount fares in effect, but other airlines offer them in more limited markets. Peoples Express, for example, offers a $49 one-way fare from Newark to some Florida cities during off-peak hours. Not all airlines are using the discounts solely to build market share and as a result, some sharp discounts could continue. Continental, for example, has low fares in effect as part of a long-term strategy aimed at building a ''hub'' - a center of operations - in Denver. Another factor could lead to sharply lower fares in some areas. Highly seasonal carriers such as Pan Am shift extra planes into domestic markets during the fall and winter, when its overseas tourist business is sluggish, and that factor could still work to hold down fares. According to Andrew B. Kim, the airline analyst for F. Eberstadt & Company, such tactics destroy the fare structure, with customers delaying trips to take advantage of lower fares. This is similar to the shift that has taken place in retailing and auto sales, where consumers have grown accustomed to large discounts. Because of such trends, he added:''I'm not optimistic that discounts will go away.'' There are estimates that from 70 to 80 percent of airline travel is on some kind of discount, a level that has eroded profitablity for many carriers even though traffic has increased. The Air Traffic Conference, for example, reported that domestic traffic rose 4.8 percent in 1982 over 1981, but it cost more to fly those passengers. The yield used to calculate the revenue derived from flying one passenger one mile fell 6 percent for the 30 major airlines in 1982 compared to 1981.

For months now, diagnosticians reviewing the weekly collection of reports on the economy's health have seen signs of improvement and feared a relapse. The past seven days were no different. Prices and productivity, two much hovered-over measures, looked handsome on last week's charts. Consumer prices rose a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent in July, an increase from the two-tenths of 1 percent recorded in June but still well within the normal pace of price rises as a recovery settles in. American business productivity, meanwhile, surged upward at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the April-to-June quarter, the fastest pace in nearly eight years, and again, a not atypical one. In the productivity figure, however, there was a reminder of the recession's legacy. The indicator normally rises early in a recovery, because companies increase output while still cautious about rehiring laid-off workers or wary of taking on new ones. In a survey issued last week, the National Association of Business Economists saw the civilian unemployment rate averaging 9.2 percent in the last quarter of 1983 and only edging down to 8.5 percent by the end of 1984. As for a recovery-choking rise in interest rates, there were the usual jitters. The minutes of last month's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee showed general agreement that a slight tightening of bank reserves ''would provide some insurance against the possible need'' for clamping down later to head off an inflationary surge. There had been anticipatory increases in the markets since May.

824-> SUNDAY OBSERVER
Letter to a Waitress: Dear Madam: I am now at the Chinese restaurant across the street from your place of employment, eating a large platter of General Tso's chicken. It is delicious, but a bad conscience keeps me from enjoying it. I fear I hurt your feelings by leaving your table without explanation and coming across the street to eat. True, I heard you tell the people at the next table that they could come over here to eat if they were unhappy with your service. This, you'll recall, is what you told them when they complained they'd been waiting 20 minutes to order and wondered if you could attend to them. Their rudeness was properly chastened when you told them, ''I don't have to serve you if I don't want to.'' Aware that they had behaved swinishly, they did not take your advice to eat across the street but waited meekly another 10 minutes until you were ready to take their orders. I am quite clear on the timing because I had been waiting at my own table long enough to read The New York Times from front to back and finish the crossword puzzle when they came in. Having finished The Times, I had nothing left to read but my watch, and I was deeply absorbed in it when you gave them the tongue-lashing. In fact, I had read my watch thoroughly and was pondering my chances of sneaking out without being thrashed when I overheard you tell those louts about the labor shortage: how you were one of only two waitresses who had shown up for work. Here was a new face on matters. The exploitation of labor. Only two waitresses to cope with tables where nine people now sat. When you brought those two complainers their hamburgers and beer, I had a moment's panic. Yes, I was afraid you might notice me sitting there in my vast pile of thorougly read newspaper. If so, you would surely feel obliged to approach and say, ''What's yours?'' Fortunately, you did not, for if you had I would probably have mumbled something heartless and unfeeling, like, ''A cheeseburger and cup of coffee.'' I doubt you would have understood in the distraught state of mind under which you were then laboring, but if I had said, ''A cheeseburger and cup of coffee,'' it would not have been a gloating sneer at the cruelty of your life. It would have been a stumbling, inarticulate substitute for the gentle words that swelled my heart but could not take shape on my tongue. Would you believe that I cannot speak truly brusquely to salespeople of any sort, including waiters and waitresses, when they make it clear they hate me for wanting to buy something? With you, as with all of them, my only desire is for forgiveness. Had you come to my table and said, ''What's yours?'' my shyness would have permitted me only to say, ''A cheeseburger and cup of coffee,'' but in my heart I would have wanted to fall to my knees and apologize. Let me do it now, sitting here at the restaurant across the street in front of General Tso's chicken: I am sorry. Sorry I came in so thoughtlessly anticipating a cheeseburger and cup of coffee on the day only two waitresses showed up for work. If I had known there were only two waitresses, I would never have done it. This, of course, doesn't excuse me. I should have phoned ahead. Should have asked, ''How many waitresses have come to work today?'' But I didn't. I am too thoughtless of others. Otherwise, I might have had the good grace to ask the manager before taking a seat: ''Tell me, my good man, do you have sufficient waitresses working today, or are you mercilessly sweating an undersized staff?'' Once I learned the harsh facts, I might still have done the proper thing. I could have stormed off to the manager. Could have said, ''Look here: You have only two poor waitresses on duty, and they are furious with you for overworking them.'' The manager couldn't otherwise know about your anger, could he? As a waitress, are you going to go to the manager and rage at him? He might tell you to try to get a job at the restaurant across the street. Of course. But somebody has to pay for all the grief you are suffering. Who? The insensitive, thoughtless, cruel, demanding customers. Sitting here across the street, I want you to know that I understand. Understand that you don't truly hate me, but that it's economically sounder to hate me than it is to hate the boss. Please believe that I would have stayed and tried to apologize for even thinking of a cheeseburger and coffee, if only I hadn't felt a heartless urge to get lunch eaten before dinnertime sets in. I am tempted to show good faith by bringing you a snack of this delicious General Tso's chicken, but refrain from doing so, knowing I would feel like a terrible human being if the gesture compelled you to throw it on my necktie. I am, Madam, yours apologetically, . . .

825-> State Panel On Arts Gets Grant For Study
CONNECTICUT'S Commission on the Arts was recently chosen as the first recipient of a special Rockefeller Foundation grant for self-evaluation. The $17,000 award was made to the commission, according to its executive director, Gary M. Young, "because I think they felt Connecticut has the makings of a good case study; the state has a high density -- and a high diversity -- of arts organizations, so it makes sense to start with us." The evaluation will be conducted by Robert Crawford, a Vermont consultant who had formerly worked with the Rockefeller Foundation. Mr. Crawford is the author of the book "In Arts We Trust," an exploration of nonprofit organiztions and their boards of directors. Although commision staff members will be "borrowed" from time to time to aid Mr. Crawford, the report will primarily be his responsibility. The report is due in mid-October. The evaluation ties in with a year of self-examiation by the commission, which was founded in 1965 -- the same year as the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, D.C. Last spring, the commission held a series of nine four-hour workshops in artistic endeavors, such as crafts, literature, visual arts, dance and theater. The workshops, held around the state, were an attempt to analyze the past, as well as to forecast artistic trends. Now, the Rockefeller study will tie into those workshops and the General Assembly's mandated five-year "sunset" review of the agency. Last year, the State Commission on the Arts awarded a total of $935,000 in grants to resident artists and art organizations. The Rockefeller Foundation awarded the grant to the commission on July 29. Besides assessing the overall goals of the commission, Mr. Crawford will be interviewing corporate business leaders, "probing the possibilities of new roles," according to Mr. Young. "Private support for the arts in Connecticut has been pretty vigorous," Mr. Young said, citing the Stamford and Hartford areas as sources of major corporate donations, "but there is still some way to go." Connecticut's corporations might explore lending executives to the commission, Mr. Young said, or "using the arts more in ways to benefit their own employees." In Connecticut, more than 6 million people annually attend arts performances ane exhibits. In 1983, visits to the state's museums were up 17 percent. "Connecticut's commission has a reputation of being innovative," Mr. Young said, "and the report should land right in the middle of our own self-examination. The timing works very nicely."

827-> THE NATION
Mississippi DecidesThough her opponent avoided the issues of gender and age, preferring to portray her as a member of the ''old guard'' that controlled Mississippi for 50 years without bringing progress, many voters clearly believed 62-year-old Evelyn Gandy's place was not the Governor's mansion. Or so they said last week after Miss Gandy, a former Lieutenant Governor trying for the second time to become the state's first woman chief executive, lost the runoff for Democratic nomination to Bill Allain, 52.3 percent to 47.7 percent. Not that Mr. Allain, the State Attorney General, does not have political liabilities of his own. He is a divorced Roman Catholic given to anti- establishment rhetoric in a Protestant state that hardly seems comfortable with noncomforming politicians. In his race against Leon Bramlett, who is trying to become the first Republican Governor elected since Reconstruction, Mr. Allain also must contend with the independent candidacy of Chaples Evers, the civil rights leader and former Mayor of Fayette. Mr. Evers could siphon black votes Mr. Allain captured last week with a campaign that took him to the Delta and focused on pocketbook issues.

828-> CONGRESS'S INTENT HELD AS VIOLATED
Many Democrats on Capital Hill, joined by some Republicans, believe the Reagan Administration's actions on environmental laws have violated the intent of Congress and contradicted a broad national consensus in favor of antipollution measures. Accordingly, these lawmakers say that the resignation of Anne McGill Burford as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will not silence criticism of the Administration on environmental matters or erase the political damage that the issue continues to inflict on the White House. After Mrs. Burford resigned last week and the Administration turned over cartons of disputed documents to Congress, Representative John D. Dingell told a news conference, ''It's pretty obvious the Administration did seek to cut its losses.'' Asked whether the move would succeed, the Michigan Democrat replied, ''If that's the goal of the Administration, they probably have not succeeded.'' An aide to the Senate Republican leadership said that while the week's events helped ease the Administration's immediate plight, the White House still faced a long-range need to ''restore its credibility'' on environmental matters with Congress and the general public. Advice on New Nominee The best way to do that, the aide added, is for President Reagan to nominate someone to replace Mrs. Burford who is ''lily-white with no baggage, no hint of conflict.'' Otherwise, the aide added, the perception will persist that ''this Administration gives much more weight to big business than to common people.'' Mr. Reagan disagrees sharply with critics who say his Administration has not enforced environmental laws with the vigor that Congress intended. At a news conference on Friday he asserted that his Administration ''can be very proud of our record in environmental protection.'' He also said his critics were guilty of ''environmental extremism'' and questioned their motive for attacking him. ''I sometimes suspect,'' Mr. Reagan told reporters, ''that the lobbyists for the environmental interests feel that they have to keep their constituents stirred up or they might not have jobs anymore.'' This comment highlights a belief widely held in the Reagan Administration that in 1980 the electorate was voting for smaller government and less Federal intrusion into private lives. Accordingly, the White House believes that it has a popular mandate for policies that reduce concern for environmental quality while increasing attention to the health of business interests and free enterprise. Laws Called Unrealistic Some lawmakers agree with Representative Gene Taylor, a Missouri Republican, when he says environmental laws have been ''completely unrealistic'' in the past and adds, ''Somebody has to pay for all that foolishness.'' Representative Richard T. Schulze, Republican of Pennsylvania, charges that Democrats have been ''playing politics'' with the issue and grabbing headlines without much evidence to back up their allegations. But the more common view is that Congress wrote tough laws and the Administration is simply not enforcing them. Representative Barbara Boxer, a freshman Democrat from California, put it this way: ''They can't get the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts amended, the way they want to. So they weaken them through regulation, and defy the intent of Congress. They are the best at figuring out ways to legally undermine the will of Congress, but this time, in the E.P.A. case, we caught them.'' ''This is the most blatant example,'' added Representative James J. Florio, Democrat of New Jersey, ''of an Administration that doesn't believe in the laws that it is called upon to enforce.'' Many politicians in both parties also believe that by not enforcing the laws more stringently, the Administration is making a political mistake. Every national poll shows that a strong majority favors tough regulation of pollution, and that squares with the impressions that most Congressmen glean back home. Voters Repond to Survey Representative Thomas E. Petri, Republican of Wisconsin, says people want a ''rule of reason'' to guide regulatory judgments. But he adds, ''My constituents are extremely pro-environment.'' Representative John F. Seiberling, Democrat of Ohio, asked voters in Akron in a mail survey if they favored stringent antipollution laws, and two-thirds responded yes, even if those laws would cost some jobs. As a result, the consensus on Capitol Hill is that Mr. Reagan misunderstands the political situation when he dismisses environmental activists as a ''bunch of kooks,'' in the words of Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma. Representative Boxer of California says an issue like toxic waste disposal is a ''tremendously potent political issue'' because it affects the health of every individual. ''Everyone is afraid of cancer,'' she said. Now that Mrs. Burford is gone and the disputed documents are being handed over, Congressional Democrats say they will press in coming months for additional funds for the Environmental Protection Agency and legislation that would ''plug loopholes'' in current statutes, Representative Florio said. They will be joined by such key Republicans in the Senate as Robert T. Stafford of Vermont, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who is a leading advocate of tougher clean air regulations. Mr. Stafford introduced a bill last week designed to control acid rain, a condition caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. ''As Americans learn more about this form of pollution,'' the Vermont Republican said, ''I am confident they will ask us to protect them against its effects.'' In general, advocates of antipollution laws think the trend is with them. ''The President,'' argued Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, ''will have to fulfill the will of Congress and the American people.''

829-> CHINATOWN GANG LEADER IS SLAIN
A 33-year-old man described by the police as the leader of a Chinatown gang was found shot to death yesterday in the Pell Street office of a Chinese fraternal organization. The police said they were investigating whether the killing was part of a new round of gang violence. A spokesman for the Police Department said the dead man was the leader of the Flying Dragons, one of the gangs believed involved in the extortion of Chinatown businessmen. The police spokesman, Sgt. Edwin LeSchack, identified the victim as Michael Chen of 210 West 230th Street, the Bronx. The police said he had an arrest record and was known to them because of his gang activities. Mr. Chen's body was found at about 12:30 P.M., when an officer of the Hip Sing Association, one of the largest Chinese family and business associations, entered the offices of Hip Sing's credit union at 15 Pell Street. Police Capt. Robert Larkin said the gang connection also was being explored because members of a rival gang, the Free Masons, had accused the Flying Dragons of killing three of their members in a restaurant in Chinatown last December.

830-> CHINA PARTY CHIEF CALLS FOR MARXIST FLEXIBILITY
The Chinese Communist Party leader, Hu Yaobang, said today that the world Communist movement had suffered ''severe setbacks'' in the last three decades, and he called for flexibility in interpreting Marxist theory. In a speech marking the 100th anniversary of the death of Marx, Mr. Hu said Marxism was immortal and had inspired ''a worldwide, irresistible historical tide propelling social progress.'' But he said Marxism had also met with serious problems. ''For more than three decades since the Second World War,'' he said, ''the world Communist movement has followed a tortuous course of development. It has scored magnificent successes and victories, but has also experienced severe setbacks and failures, undergoing a bewildering process of turbulence and division.'' Mr. Hu's mention of division was clearly an allusion to the Chinese-Soviet split more than 20 years ago that divided the Communist world into two camps. 'Its Own Line and Policies' Mr. Hu said the Marxist party of each country should formulate ''its own line and policies in accordance with its own concrete conditions.'' Praising Marx as ''a working-class intellectual par excellence,'' Mr. Hu stressed the importance of intellectuals in China's modernization plans. He said Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, and his colleagues were determined to raise the status of intellectuals persecuted by Mao Zedong. Mr. Hu said those who worked with their minds and were relatively well educated should be paid better than manual laborers because such people made great contributions to the country. Millions of intellectuals were persecuted, and many of them were killed, in an ''antirightist'' campaign in the 1950's and in the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976.

831-> WESTWAYGATE
Trade-in, livelier than ever, is looking better for New York every day -the result of almost unnoticed Congressional action that became law in January. Westway, plagued by scandal, is looking worse every day - the result of sensational revelations in the Federal courts last week and earlier that are beginning to make the whole Westway operation look like another Environmental Protection Agency. The man who has to decide between Westway and trade-in, Governor Cuomo, is now about to receive the long-awaited report by former Assistant United States Attorney Thomas Puccio on the pros and cons of the issue. It is increasingly clear that the only logical choice that Governor Cuomo can make is to come down on the side of trade-in. Why? Even if it were not the planning, environmental and economic disaster that it is, so much dirty work involving Westway has already been uncovered in the Federal courts that the possibility of bringing Westway to fruition has, realistically, to be pushed off for years - if not forever. The disclosures of conflict of interest, bad faith, governmental cover-up, outright deception on the part of the Army Corps of Engineers and the New York State Department of Transportation are only symptomatic of the sleazy atmosphere that has come to surround this multibillion-dollar superhighway and real estate deal on Manhattan's West Side shore front. It is going to continue to be fought on justifiable legal grounds for a long time to come. Meanwhile, what about the trade-in alternative? The old canard that trade-in is dead wasn't true when both of New York's Senators mouthed it two years ago (both later retracted). And it is even less true today. Trade-in means transferring to New York's mass transit, street and bridge systems the $1.5 billion of free Federal funds now prospectively allocated to Westway. Trade-in is not only very much alive. Thanks to the new Federal legislation, it is an even surer bet for New York than ever. Its acceptance by Governor Cuomo, with approval of Mayor Koch - who has been on both sides of this question and whose mind can doubtless be changed again - would get the Westway albatross off both their necks once and for all. The main change in the new Federal law is that it requires 50 percent of allocated trade-in funds for mass transit to be distributed by formula instead of by the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. What this really means is that New York will automatically receive its due share of trade-in funds in the annual allotment to the various applicant cities. The old fairy tale that it is now too late to benefit from trade-in because so many other cities are ahead of us, and, therefore, New York would have to fall in ''at the end of the line,'' never did have any validity. But now it's nailed to the wall. The Reagan Administration made it clear long ago to city and state officials that a trade-in application from New York for Westway would be approved. For good reason: This would get President Reagan off the Westway hook on which he foolishly hung himself at the behest of Labor Secretary Donovan (the Schiavone Construction Company) in the 1980 campaign. The new law also extends the deadline for Westway trade-in for two years (until September 1985) and it authorizes an increase in trade-in funds specifically marked for mass transit from the $365 million for the current year to $400 million for fiscal 1986. What could the city and state do with all this trade-in money? It would pay, first of all, for a handsome, reconstructed West Side shore-front boulevard at a fraction of the cost of Westway - a point usually overlooked by Westway proponents. This several-lane highway, which already exists in embryonic form up to 42d Street (as far as Westway would go), could be turned into an attractive, tree-lined waterfront drive, modestly imitative of London's Embankment, while avoiding the fantastically expensive and environmentally harmful Westway landfill. Eligible for the remainder, and by far the major, part of trade-in funds would be such urgent needs of New York's mass-transit system - on which the very life of the city depends - as rehabilitation of its stations, tracks and maintenance shops. Does trade-in work? In the past 10 years of its existence, no less than 28 cities in 20 states - including Washington ($2 billion), Boston ($1.2 billion), Philadelphia and Chicago -have traded in unneeded interstate highway funds. Congress is clearly committed to the continued funding of trade-in, if for no other reason than that so many major municipalities have an abiding interest in it. There is no longer any ground for doubt that if the Governor and Mayor ask for trade-in, they will get it.

832-> WOMEN ARE INCREASING LEAD IN ENROLLMENT ON CAMPUSES
Women are going to college in ever-increasing numbers, expanding their enrollment lead over men, and the average age of college students is creeping upward, the Bureau of the Census reported today. A report by the bureau showed that total enrollment at all school levels stayed about the same in 1981 as in 1980, but that it had changed markedly since 1970, with the number of children in nursery schools nearly doubled. Women began to outnumber men on college campuses in 1979. By 1981 there were 108 women in college for every 100 men, the report said. In 1972 there 74 women for every 100 men in college. The survey showed that most college students were over 21 years old, and more than a third were 25 and older. Enrollment in colleges rose by a third from 1972 to 1981, to a total of 12.1 million, with the number of men in college up 12 percent and the number of women up 63 percent. Total enrollment among those 14 to 34 years of age was 10.7 million, meaning 1.4 million people 35 years of age and older were attending colleges. Statistics for Women Women, the report said, made up half the full-time undergraduates under the age of 35, and 45 percent of the graduate students. They also accounted for a majority of the part-time and two-year college students. Total enrollment in all schools did not change much from 1980 to 1981, reaching nearly 58.4 million in 1981. But the composition of the enrollment has changed significantly from 1970, the bureau said. The number of children in nursery schools doubled over the decade to nearly 2.1 million, and it was nearly four times higher than in 1965. As the children of the baby boom years have grown older, the number of elementary school students has dropped about 18 percent from the peak of almost 34 million in 1970 to 27.8 million in 1981. Drop at High Schools High school enrollment was down 9 percent to 14.6 million from its apparent peak of 1976-77 The proportion of elementary and secondary students in private schools was about the same in 1981 and 1971, about 11 percent. It was 15 percent in 1964. There has been a decline in the percentage of young blacks who dropped out of school in the last several years, the report said, while the percentage for whites has remained the same. Among black civilians 18 and 19 years old, 19 percent were not in school and had not graduated in 1981, in contrast to 1967, the first year such data were gathered, when the proportion was 26 percent. The proportion of white dropouts was 16 percent in both years.

833-> VENEZUELA, ITS EYE ON OIL, FINDS ITS FARMS FALTERING
There is a lot of heroic statuary in Venezuelan town squares and city parks celebrating the nation's past, but the symbol of its present could well be the forlorn image of two young planters standing in their barren fields outside this farming community. The two planters, Gino Pedroni and Federico Cappellin, are part of a rice-growing partnership here that bought land, invested $2 million in machinery and irrigation, plowed the soil into ankle-high furrows and then watched the planting period pass in enforced helplessness when the Government bank reneged on its promise of credit to buy seed, pesticides and other necessities. Food Is Running Out With its oil revenues plummeting and its foreign debt up for renegotiation, Venezuela is suddenly suffering the results of a disregard for agriculture that a national preoccupation with its petroleum wealth produced. The country may soon not have enough food to feed its 16 million citizens. This is the height of the dry season in Venezuela's plains, and the rising dust was choking as Mr. Pedroni and Mr. Cappellin trudged through their brown acreage. Heavy-duty farm rigs that should have been busy in the harvest this time of year stood idle in a desolate cluster in the afternoon sun. ''In Venezuela, the countryside is ignored,'' said Mr. Cappellin, a 25-year-old Venezuelan who went to Mexico for his agronomy degree because of the poor quality of instruction here. What Venezuela has been paying attention to has been oil. Agriculture, the economic and cultural mainstay of its pre-petroleum past, has gone neglected. Though Venezuela has more than enough land to feed its own citizens -and once did so - today it imports more than 60 percent of its food. So thorough is the dedication to oil that petroleum-based fertilizers are promoted here even though they increase the acid content in the already overly acidic soil of the Venezuelan flatlands. Carlos Cisneros Rendiles, president of the Venezuelan chapter of the Inter-American Council of Commerce and Production, pointed to a more immediate problem stemming from the country's current efforts to establish new foreign-exchange policies. ''When this began, we had seven weeks' worth of food inside our borders,'' he said. ''But we have taken three weeks arguing over the economic measures, and in this time the country has been paralyzed - the bureaucrats haven't known what to import and at what price, and we are eating commercial inventories and prime materials. ''If you consider that we import up to 70 percent of what we eat,'' he said, ''that means we only have four more weeks of food left.'' This region of Venezuela, 100,000 square miles of featureless pampas lying between the Andes and the Amazon, is called the Orinoco Lowlands, and it stretches into hazy invisibility on all four sides of Calabozo. So much of it has been abandoned by growers these days that Venezuela could end up this year having to import rice, the only crop in which it has remained consistently self-sufficient. The common complaint is the failure of the state bank to make its promised production loans and of the Government purchasing agency to come up with crop payments. In Caracas, Government officials point to rice as one of the few secure areas in Venezuelan agriculture and note that the country exported it last year. In fact, the exports were occasioned in part by insufficient Government storage capacity and were sold at a loss because of their bad quality. Some of the shipments could only be used for animal feed. Poor Seeds and Black Rice A carpet of green plantings extends out from one side of the partnership's property, but the healthy aspect is deceptive. Though the neighbor had his own funds to plant his fields, he got trapped by another of the backward ways of Venezuelan agriculture. He was sold poor seeds, and his rice is turning up black. The rice growers here prefer to buy their seeds from neighboring Colombia, a far poorer nation that has had to focus more on its agriculture. The Colombian seeds are checked in Government laboratories, a procedure that does not exist in Venezuela. Under the new exchange-control measures, the Colombian seeds have become prohibitively expensive for the Venezuelan growers. ''If petroleum's no longer their strength,'' said Ruben Rodriguez, a Colombian who works with the partners, ''they have to turn to farming. But they have to build an infrastructure. They don't really seem to have a vocation for it.'' Both major candidates running in next December's presidential election are sounding the familiar theme. The opposition Democratic Action Party hopeful, Dr. Jaime Lusinchi, is promising in full-page newspaper advertisements to turn the countryside into ''the essential nucleus of our development and the recuperation of the nation.'' Ambitious Program in 1960 An ambitious agrarian program was started in 1960, but it collided with a mass movement of rural people to the cities. In addition, peasants receiving land did not get adequate instruction in farming techniques, and they often ended up selling their properties to others or simply abandoning them. ''It is disputable whether or not it achieved much social progress,'' a Venezuelan agricultural analyst in Caracas said, ''but there is no doubt that it achieved no agricultural progress.'' The 6.2 percent of gross national product that agriculture accounts for in Venezuela is the lowest of any country in Latin America. Some 60 percent of the labor force worked in the fields before the oil discoveries of the 1920's; only 20 percent work there now. The realization that petroleum proved to be such a consuming distraction is particularly discouraging to Venezuelans because they appear to have anticipated the problem as far back as 1938. In that year President Eleazar Lopez Contreras coined a thereafter oftenrepeated phrase dramatizing the need to use oil revenues for national development. He promised to ''sow the petroleum.'' ''That's what Venezuela has been trying to do for years now without much success,'' said Nicomedes Zuloaga, one of Venezuela's most prominent businessmen, during a visit to a cattle ranch in Barinas state in the western part of the country. ''I guess what we've proved is that oil is not a sowable commodity.''

834-> TREASURY DOMINATES WEEK'S ISSUES
New-issue activity in the credit markets this week will be dominated by the United States Treasury. It has scheduled note and bond auctions totaling $13.5 billion as well as the regular weekly bill auctions, which total $12.4 billion. In advance of today's auction of new three- and six-month bills, dealers said late Friday that outstanding issues were bid at rates of 8.5 percent and 8.57 percent, respectively. According to securities dealers, the auction of $5.5 billion of four-year notes on Tuesday, $4.75 billion of seven-year notes on Wednesday and $3.25 billion of 20-year bonds on Thursday are more of a challenge than the bill sales because investors in these longerterm issues are harder to find. As of late Friday, dealers said, the upcoming four-year notes were traded with a yield of 10.14 percent, the seven-year notes at 10.54 percent and the 20-year bonds at 10.9 percent. In the Government agency sector, the Federal National Mortgage Assocation plans to sell $300 million of debentures due March 30, 1990, at a price of 100 with an interest rate to be announced tomorrow.

835-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; GENERAL MILLS POST IS SEEN FOR RETAILER
Michael J. Boyle, the former president and chief executive of the Petrie Stores Corporation who departed after less than two-and-a-half months in those posts, is expected to be named executive vice president in charge of specialty retailing and furniture manufacturing operations of General Mills Inc. In these new posts, Mr. Boyle, who is 38 years old, will be in charge of eight divisions of General Mills. Among them are 240 stores operated by the Eddie Bauer chain of outdoor equipment stores; Talbot's, women's apparel; Lee Ward Creative Crafts, hobby stores; Wallpapers to Go, wallpaper retailers, and Wild West Stores, casual clothing. Also to come under his supervision are three furniture companies: Pennsylvania House, the Kittinger Furniture Company and the Dunbar Company. Sales of the combined operations last year were $453.2 million. Mr. Boyle, who had been chairman and chief executive of the Lazarus department stores in Columbus, Ohio, joined the 873-store Petrie chain in November. But he left in January after a dispute with Milton Petrie, the 82-year old founder of the company, who then resumed the posts. General Mills, based in Minneapolis, is expected to make the announcement of the appointment early this week, trade sources said, but a spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Boyle could not be reached over the weekend. Sources close to Petrie Stores said that Mr. Petrie, while initially enthusiastic about Mr. Boyle, became reluctant to allow the much younger executive to take command. In exasperation over the delay, Mr. Boyle one day wrote a letter curtly demanding to know when Mr. Petrie ''planned to step aside,'' the sources said. The company founder then reportedly became infuriated and asked Mr. Boyle to leave, granting him a settlement on his employment contract.

836-> An Uneasy Ribicoff
FORMER United States Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut is an elder in the Democratic party, a man of rare dignity and as staunch a supporter of its younger members as a grand seigneur is supposed to be. So it isn't that he doesn't genuinely like the array of Democrats running for President. He does, heaps praise upon them individually and considers each a friend. But what troubles him these early days of the 1984 campaign is that not one of the contenders has proposed what he considers a fully developed program for dealing with the nation's problems or a process by which the goals may be achieved. ''No one stands for anything,'' he complained the other day. ''No one represents anything except generalizations. I know it's early, very early, but the homework has to be done. Each one can't just be against President Reagan. He has to tell us specifically what he, the candidate, is for.'' The sartorially splendid Mr. Ribicoff was between appointments in his Park Avenue law office, to which he walks from his Manhattan apartment in all but the worst weather, and he was concerned not so much with winning the Presidency for the Democrats, though he wants that too, but with what he thinks will happen to candidates without concrete action plans. ''Some of those men are smart, ambitious and combative,'' he said, choosing his words carefully. ''They are not going to let anybody get away without saying something.'' If the Senator is right, the lesser-known candidates could attack, possibly destroy, the front-runners, forcing the party to nominate from among the darker, perhaps weaker horses. And in the fall of 1984, the triumphant nominee might still be out there on the hustings without a program, an easier target for Republicans and a disappointment to the voters. ''Whether you agree or disagree with President Reagan, his is the first landmark Presidency since Roosevelt formulated a series of social, economic and political solutions that continued to dominate the American scene, whether Democratic or Republican,'' he said. ''He has had a consistent philosophy, a program. He's the only President I know who has kept his campaign promises, who has advocated and tried to achieve what he said he would. ''Now he's in the position of his predecessors,'' Mr. Ribicoff continued. ''His program hasn't worked either. Unless he can make it work, he will be turned out in 1984.'' If the Democrats win, they'll need a program even more. ''You cannot govern without one,'' Senator Ribicoff said. Should they try, they could end up with another disposable President. ''The world is actuated by hope and rising expectations,'' he explained. ''No politician in recent decades has been able to fulfill these expectations. There is disillusion with the current leadership. The leader is turned out by the opposite side, irrespective of whether he's good or not.'' Nationally, he said, this is destructive. ''The Presidency has become so complex that it's virtually impossible for a President to know his job or carry out a program in less than two terms.'' And while he'd mind less if the Republicans were limited to a single term, he'd hate to see that happen to a Democrat. ''I know there are paradoxes and contradictions in this,'' he said, ''and a lot of things can happen between now and 1984. But I also know the time's short and it's irresponsible to run for President without a program.'' The Senator, of course, has a plan up his sleeve, and a not-so-secret plan at that. ''Felix Rohatyn is the only person saying anything, who has a perception of what the problems are and what to do about them,'' he said. ''He's the only one laying out an alternative, and it's there for the asking.'' Mr. Rohatyn, of course, is the Lazard Freres investment banker widely credited with saving New York City from financial collapse. Senator Ribicoff said, ''Somebody should go and see him.'' Since he left government, the 72-year-old Mr. Ribicoff says he's had a thoroughly good time. He serves on corporate boards, chairs a Council on Foreign Relations-New York Bar Association retrospective study of the Iranian hostage crisis, and heads a city tax abatement policy study. Next month, well ahead of the deadline, he and former Senator James B. Pearson, a Kansas Republican, expect to tell the Senate, at its request, how its rules and procedures should be revised. Though a Connecticut resident, Mr. Ribicoff and his wife spend a lot of time here. ''We try not to go out more than three nights a week,'' he said. ''But you know, you do.'' And after 42 years in politics, rising from Connecticut legislator to Governor, then Senator, with time off to run the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, just what has the Senator learned that's important? ''Maturity,'' he answered. ''You don't become mature until you reach that stage of life when you don't have to prove anything to anybody. More importantly, you don't have to prove anything to yourself either.''

837-> ANTHONY BLISS TO RETIRE AS MANAGER OF THE MET
Anthony A. Bliss will retire as general manager of the Metropolitan Opera on July 31, 1985, the company announced yesterday. A search committee has been formed to select his successor. Mr. Bliss's retirement comes as no surprise. He will be 72 years old at the time of his retirement, and he has often hinted that he might withdraw after the Met's 1983-84 centennial season ended and his current contract expired. The Met's four-year contracts with its labor unions will lapse in the summer of 1984, so Mr. Bliss will still oversee negotiations for a new contract. He will also, because of the necessity for long-range planning in opera, play an integral role in artistic programming for seasons through the end of the 1980's. Frank E. Taplin, president of the Metropolitan Opera Association, will head the search committee. Mr. Bliss will be a member, as will William Rockefeller, Michael V. Forrestal, Laurence D. Lovett, James S. Marcus and James S. Smith. Levine to Continue Mr. Taplin said yesterday that the board expected to select a new general manager who, like Mr. Bliss, would not be directly involved in artistic matters but would concentrate on financial and administrative decisions. He added that the Met hoped to assure the continued services of James Levine, the music director, before proceeding with the selection of a new general manager. Mr. Levine's contract expires on July 31, 1986. Mr. Bliss said yesterday: ''I would not be willing to step down at this point unless I was assured that we would have continuity on the artistic front.'' He added that Mr. Levine and the Met were ''nine-tenths'' agreed on an extension of Mr. Levine's contract, as well as an augmentation of his role in the company. But Mr. Bliss declined to specify whether Mr. Levine's title would be changed from music director to artistic director. Mr. Bliss has been a board member of the Metropolitan Opera Association since 1949, and served as its president between 1956 and 1967, when he clashed with Rudolf Bing, then general manager. In 1974, Mr. Bliss was named executive director, and soon supplanted Schuyler Chapin as head of the company - first in a ''troika'' with Mr. Levine and John Dexter as head of production, then with just Mr. Levine. He was formally named general manager, Mr. Bing's old title, in 1981. Taplin Denies Interest There has been speculation that several current Met board members aspire to Mr. Bliss's job. Both Mr. Taplin and Mr. Bliss said yesterday that the search committee had not yet formulated specific criteria, but they acknowledged that board members would not be excluded from consideration. Mr. Taplin himself has been mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. Bliss. But he will be 70 in the summer of 1985, and yesterday he denied any interest in the position. Mr. Bliss has been credited with modernizing the Met. Since 1974, the administrative structure of the company has been reorganized, fund-raising has been brought into the computer age and a $100 million centennial endowment drive has been steered well on its way to a successful completion. Notable new productions during Mr. Bliss's tenure have included Wagner's ''Tannhauser,'' Offenbach's ''Contes d'Hoffmann'' and such modern works as Poulenc's ''Dialogues des Carmelites,'' Britten's ''Billy Budd,'' Weill's ''Mahagonny'' and the Satie-Poulenc-Ravel triple bill designed by David Hockney. During the Bliss-Levine regime, the Met has won critical praise for the the introduction of a variety of new operas into the repertory. The Met has also been credited with obtaining coherent, adequately rehearsed casts and lively but responsible stage direction. ''I have mixed feelings about my retirement,'' Mr. Bliss said yesterday, ''and the way I feel right now, I could go on for several years beyond 1985.'' ''The more I see of this job, the more I see that still needs to be done,'' he said. ''But I expect I'd always see it that way.''

838-> U.S. Holds Off on Appealing Ruling on Student Aid Curb
The Justice Department is planning to defend the law requiring draft registration as a condition for receiving Federal student loans, but it will not immediately appeal a preliminary injunction against enforcing the law. On March 9 Federal District Judge Donald D. Alsop of in St. Paul temporarily blocked enforcement of the law on the ground that it would probably be found to violate students' right against selfincrimination. The law, signed by President Reagan last Sept. 8, requires men who apply for Federal tuition loans to disclose whether they had registered for the draft, and prohibits them from receiving loans unless they had done so. ''The Government is not taking an appeal at this time from Judge Alsop's preliminary injunction,'' Tom DeCair, a spokesman for the department, said Friday. ''However, the period within which an appeal may be taken does not expire until April 8 at the earliest.''

839-> INTERVIEW EXCERPTS
Following are excerpts from an interview with Prime Minister Maurice Bishop: You need to have a society that can provide the basic human needs - jobs, housing, health care, all the usual areas. To bring that about it must mean that you are going to have to develop a new political, cultural and economic dispensation for the country. I don't think that can be done in the system we have got right now, which, as far as I am concerned, is inherently exploitative. Therefore I think you are talking about trying to develop in a very fundamental sense a new and just society, where exploitation is ended, at least in its most vulgar forms, and where really what you are trying to do is to shape a new human being. We see Cuba as being in a special category for all kinds of reasons. First of all, Cuba did have its own revolution in 1959, and that had a deep impact on every contemporary of mine. It certainly had a major impact on me. There are all kinds of romantic and idealistic notions that one attaches to that. Outside of that kind of almost romantic starting point, there was certainly the whole question of the way in which one sees Cuba in the context of Caribbean and Latin American history. We feel very strongly that the Caribbean is basically one region. We feel very strongly that it is important to knock down all of the artifical barriers erected by colonial powers in the area of alleged cultural differences, linguistic differences. Regardless of any ideological considerations, the fact of the matter is that Cuba is part of the Caribbean family, part of the Caribbean nation, and we have to develop close links with them. A third factor is that we have been genuinely impressed with the achievements of Cuba in a number of areas, particularly in education and health.

840-> ALLIED BANK: VICTIM OF ITS LATIN LENDING
-brick townhouse on East 55th Street, Allied Bank International looks solidly prosperous. But beneath the elegant facade, it has been badly shaken. Indeed, the bank consortium would have failed if its 12 often contentious shareholders - all large regional banks in the United States - had not agreed earlier this year to ante up more than $300 million - or about 40 percent of Allied's total assets - to keep it solvent. Its problem is that almost 30 percent of its loans are to debt-ridden countries in Latin America - 9.8 percent to Mexico alone. Last year, the commercial bank reported a loss of nearly $19 million as a direct result of problem loans to that region. What's more, its president and chief executive officer, Richard A. Melville, was fired in May, and its present management is more intent on resolving current problems than on developing new business. Even the rescue was iffy for a while. Some of the partners wanted to abandon Allied, leaving its depositors and creditors to fend for themselves - a move that would be considered unthinkable in most banking circles. Eventually, however, all the partners agreed to the support package, and today they appear to be in more agreement than ever. ''It's been a difficult time, and at long last we came to the conclusion we had to support it,'' acknowledged Paul Mason, Allied's chairman, who is also chairman of the executive committee of the First National Bank of Fort Worth, one of the 12 partners. But the story of Allied is more than a tale about a bank rocked by the international debt crisis. It is also a telling example of the problems inherent in joint-venture banking and of the changing attitudes among regional banks regarding their role in the international arena. The bank's saga began in 1968, at a time when joint- venture banking was in vogue. Banks large and small, European and American, flocked into international partnerships; it was believed that individual banks could offer a wider and more effective package of international services by combining their resources. A number of the consortium banks formed in the late 60's and early 70's sought high profits in risky areas - such as oil-tanker loans and real-estate investment trusts - and eventually suffered severe losses. Others, held back by jittery shareholders, did very little and ultimately were phased out or their ownerships shuffled. Few have survived in their original form. Allied is one of the last of the consortium banks; European American in New York, which has seven leading European banks as partners, is another. But one of its major shareholders, Britain's Midland Bank, is now trying to pull out. At Allied, there was trouble even before its recent losses. Dissension among its partners over basic policy issues made it difficult to keep the organization in tact - and of its 18 original partners, only 12 remain. In fact, at the end of 1981 a group of Arab investors bid $100 million to buy Allied, and all the partners had agreed to sell, according to bank sources. But before the negotiations could be concluded, the Latin American crisis emerged, and the offer was withdrawn. Many of Allied's troubles were typical of joint ventures. ''The question of control and the inability of the partners to agree on an overall policy has always been the thorny issue in consortiums,'' said David P. Anderson, executive vice president of the Commerce Union Bank in Nashville, Tenn., who had prepared a study on consortium banking in the early 70's. Throughout his 10-year reign, Mr. Melville, now 50 years old, saw one of his primary goals as getting the partners to agree on a common strategy. But his ability to do so disintegrated as the problem-loan crisis intensified, he said in a telephone interview from his summer house in Massachusetts. ''It became increasingly difficult for me to cement a consensus strategy,'' Mr. Melville said. ''In the end, I felt I had given it all I had, and I simply felt I was unable - even unwilling - to go on trying to rally the directors around a strategy.'' That was not how it had been planned. Before Allied was organized, its 18 partners-to-be watched bitterly as the biggest American banks rapidly expanded their international lending activities. The regionals felt helpless. They were fearful that their relatively puny international capabilities would drive their traditional corporate customers into the hands of giant banks in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. With the encouragement of government officials, each of the 18 banks invested $1 million in Allied. It was an exciting time for its founders. In fact, before moving to its current townhouse headquarters, the bank operated out of a suite in the old Commodore Hotel. ''It caught all the euphoria of consortium banking,'' recalls Jacques Stunzi, Allied's first chief executive officer, who is now in charge of a Swiss subsidiary of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Mr. Stunzi said, in a telephone interview from Geneva, that when Allied was established his hopes had gone far beyond Allied's stated purpose. ''My dream, and I was drunk, was that the domestic banking laws would be changed to allow interstate banking and that Allied would have been at the center of interstate mergers,'' Mr. Stunzi said. ''But I was ahead of my time.'' IF his dream had come true, Allied would have been a formidable institution. At the end of 1982, its 12 partners had combined assets of $37.6 billion, equivalent to the United States' 10th-largest banking company - the Security Pacific Corporation, which had assets of $37 billion. ''Allied was started by a group of progressive-thinking regional banks, and it enabled us to learn more and become more professional and become a bigger factor in international activities,'' said Kenneth W. Plunk, executive vice president of the First Tennessee Bank in Memphis. A major problem, however, was that the partners had different needs because they had varied levels of expertise. Some wanted to use Allied to learn the fundamentals of international banking; others wanted Allied to provide highly sophisticated international services. For a number of years, in the mid- to-late 70's, when substantial profits were being made on international lending, Allied concentrated on syndicating international loans and parceling them out to its shareholders. But more recently, as those loan yields dropped and as the business grew riskier, most regional banks, including Allied's partners, pulled back on international lending. ''At one time we had $18 million in foreign loans on our own blotter, now that's been scaled down to about $4 million,'' said K. Gordon Greer, president of the Liberty National Bank and Trust Company of Oklahoma City. ''The use of Allied has changed,'' said Russell H. Knisel, Allied's vice chairman and vice chairman of the Connecticut National Bank. ''Before 1978 there were good spreads in the international market and we built a large portfolio, $350 million, of foreign loans. As spreads narrowed and risks seemingly increased, we reduced it,'' Mr. Knisel said. ''Now our international role is to serve our domestic customers.'' The changing demands of its partners was a problem that has plagued Allied throughout its history. ''The trouble with consortium banking,'' noted Mr. Stunzi, ''is the changing interests of the shareholders. First the partners used Allied as a training ground and then they started to compete with us. If you have 18 shareholders, each with a 5 percent stake, they don't have loyalty to the bank.'' As a result of the lack of what Mr. Stunzi calls loyalty, and also as a result of their own shifting needs and managements, six of the partners had asked to be bought out. Their reasons underscored the problems of consortium banking. - The Bank of the Southwest, based in Houston and the Valley National Bank of Arizona withdrew following changes in their own managements. The new chief exexcutive officers - presciently as it turned out - felt that Allied represented a risk over which they had no control. Both also had substantial international operations before joining Allied. - A change in management also prompted the First Hawaiian Bank to drop out of Allied. The new chief executive officer decided First Hawaiian should concentrate on the Pacific Basin in its international activities, rather than on Latin America, where Allied's attention was focused. - Michigan National Bank of Lansing was one of the first partners to seek to pull out because the Federal Reserve refused to allow it to open a branch in the Bahamas. Like the other partners, Michigan National needed the Bahamian branch to coordinate its activities with Allied. - The Trust Company of Georgia had been riding the crest of the go-go banking wave of the early 70's and Allied was part of that fling. But in the mid-70's the Trust Company suffered big losses from its investments in real estate investment trusts. It then pulled in its horns and decided to stay out of any operation not related to its Georgia customer base. - And in the nation's capital, American Security decided to leave Allied as the result of new management's philosophical opposition to involvement in joint ventures. It was not easy, however, for the partners to find a satisfactory way out without stripping Allied of its capital or without forcing the remaining partners to put up a lot of new money. A formula eventually was worked out in which those that left were paid with preferred shares. Michigan National was the first to withdraw in 1978; the others pulled out the following year. The partners that wanted to withdraw put heavy pressure on Allied's management to make substantial profits. But that was especially difficult because Allied was established under the so-called Edge Act, an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, which allows banks to set up banking subsidiaries outside their own states - as long as they engage solely in international banking. A key problem for Allied was that Edge Act banks were allowed to leverage their capital only 10 times. That is, for each dollar invested by a partner, Allied could borrow only nine additional dollars. At the time, the major banks were leveraged anywhere from 25 to 30 times capital. In addition, because the Edge Act forced Allied to conduct an exclusively international business, Allied could not diversify its portfolio by making domestic loans. Following Mr. Stunzi's departure in 1973, Mr. Melville was named Allied's president and chief executive officer. Through much of his tenure, Mr. Melville lobbied hard to get the Edge Act changed - and in that he was somewhat successful. Among the provisions of the International Banking Act of 1978 was a clause allowing Edge Act banks to leverage themselves up to 15 times capital. But still Allied had to take big risks to produce the profits shareholders wanted. ''The regulations forced us to stretch,'' said a former officer who requested anonymity. ''We could not generate satisfactory profits with uncompetitive leverage so we looked for high-margin business. That meant lending to Latin America.'' The policy worked - at least for a while. Allied's net income climbed to a record $5.6 million in 1981, up from $3 million five years earlier. Return on the partners' equity rose to 11.4 percent in 1981, from 6.8 percent in 1977. Allied's return on each $100 of average assets, a key indicator of a bank's basic profitability, rose to 72 cents, from 46 cents. DESPITE the profit improvements, they paled in contrast with the overall earnings of most of Allied's shareholders. In 1981, for example, the First National Bank of Fort Worth reported a $1.14 return on each $100 of average assets and a 17.9 percent on equity. The Fidelity Union Trust Company in New Jersey earned an 82-cent return on each $100 of average assets and 12 percent on equity. To achieve its modest earnings, Allied placed a large part of its portfolio in Latin America, and most of its loans were to private companies rather than to governments. So, when the debt crisis hit, Allied was in far worse shape than most bank lenders because private debts were given the lowest pay-back priority. Loans actually written off by Allied amounted to only $4.6 million. But $18.6 million was allocated to the loan-loss reserve, which is subtracted from the bank's earnings. As a result, Allied showed a loss of $18.9 million in 1982. Additionally, more than 20 percent of its loans were not being paid as originally scheduled. The partners were stunned. Tempers flared and scapegoats were sought, according to bank sources. ''It was the politics of decline,'' one officer was quoted as saying. Some of the partners considered abandoning the venture and limiting their losses to their respective equity investments. ''We all thought about walking away from it at times,'' said Kevin Shanley, Allied's vice chairman and vice chairman of Fidelity Union. ''But we quickly decided it really wasn't an option.'' The banking community is a tight-knit group and if the shareholders had abandoned Allied it could have seriously hurt their long-term relationships with banks around the world. A large part of its deposits and other obligations were to banks around the world. Although their differences had not been fully resolved until last May, late last year the partners agreed to inject $18 million of new capital into the bank through the purchase of preferred stock. They also agreed to provide Allied, which had total assets of $738.6 million, with a $120 million standby credit, which could be drawn upon in the case of liquidity problems. Any drawings against the credit line had to be backed by good-quality loans. No drawing has been made on the standby credit. Battles continued to rage among the shareholders. According to insiders, Mr. Melville was at the center of the controversy, with some shareholders demanding that he resign. According to bank sources, the partners were divided into three basic groups. The first supported Mr. Melville in wanting to keep Allied functioning as usual. They feared that a drastic cutback would destroy Allied's customer base and eliminate any value it might have in the future. A second contingent - and the one that eventually prevailed - sought to cut back and quietly unravel the organization. And the third group simply wanted to abandon the venture. Once the course was agreed upon, Mr. Melville was asked to leave. The partners also agreed to increase the standby credit to $180 million and to place $120 million of interest-free deposits in Allied for a minimum of 18 months. The interest-free deposits are expected to offset the cost of funding the problem loans. The directors also asked William J. Anthony, a veteran international banker who had joined Allied as senior vice president at the beginning of this year, to take over as chief executive officer. Mr. Anthony said he would have refused to take the job if the shareholders had not committed themselves to the support package. ''Having gotten to the point it had reached, the shareholders now are more united than ever,'' Mr. Anthony said. ''They know it is in their interest to turn this thing around and they've given tangible support.''

841-> WASHINGTON; REAGAN IN 1984?
The most popular game in the capital of the United States these days is ''Will He or Won't He'' run for a second term in the White House. It's popular because it takes everybody's mind off more important problems. You don't have to think much about it, and couldn't do anything about it if you did, and the best player in this political game is the President himself. He loves it. He may not be a great President, but he's a great Performer. He told the Conservative Political Action Conference here the other day ''our clean-up crew will need more than two years to deal with the mess left by others over a half-century.'' Some ''crew,'' some ''mess''! But what did he mean? This was taken by his conservative audience and others as an indication that he intended to run again for a second term, but he didn't say ''I'' need ''more than two years'' to clean up the ''mess.'' He just tossed it off as usual with a smile and an amiable wave of his hand, and left them to guess what, if anything, he meant. The chances are that he didn't mean anything except to hold his party together, and make them wonder, from right to left, what he will do, and keep them in line while he waits to see how his economic and foreign policy work in the next six months. Nobody can blame him for that. The objective of the Republican Party, including the extreme conservatives, who regret his recent pragmatic compromises with the Democrats, is to retain control of the White House for the next six years. This is, and always has been, the main purpose of political parties: to hold executive power for themselves, and deny it to the other party. So Mr. Reagan's friends are telling him that their main hope of getting rid of the ''Democratic mess'' is not to leave it to a divided Republican Party, but to command the conflict by running again himself. No matter how much Mr. Reagan may long for home or retirement, they insist, he must go on for another four years. Otherwise, the Republican Party will be split between its moderate candidates - Vice President Bush, Senate majority leader Baker, Senator Dole of Kansas - and the conservative candidates like Jack Kemp of New York, opening up the White House to the Democrats. President Reagan is being told by his friends that he is in precisely the position President Eisenhower found himself after his heart attack and his ileitis operation in 1956, when Ike wanted to go home but was persuaded that, if he did, everything he had fought for would be lost, and the Democrats would take over. Eisenhower stood for a second term and won, and the argument of the Republican establishment here now is that Mr. Reagan should do the same. It's a persuasive partisan argument, and no doubt President Reagan thinks about it and talks it over with his wife in the quiet of the night, and discusses what they want to do with the rest of their lives. Nobody ever knows how people decide the conflicts between private and public responsibilities. Mr. Reagan is already the oldest President in the history of the Republic. He is now 72. He would be 74 a few days after inauguration, if he was elected in 1984, and 78 at the end of his second term. These are considerations he and others have to take into account now, when he is trying to make up his mind whether to assume the responsibilities of the Presidency until the end of the 1980's. There is an odd thing about this critical period while Mr. Reagan is trying to make up his mind. What he decides will obviously determine the strategy of both political parties in the election of 1984. But the people who want him to run again are being increasingly loud in their arguments, and the people who think his running again is a bum idea, are being very quiet. Oddly, what is not being discussed much is what would be best for the nation. There are some good candidates coming up out of both parties. Baker of Tennessee, Dole of Kansas, Mondale of Minnesota, Glenn of Ohio, Hart of Colorado, Askew of Florida, Bumpers of Arkansas - these are of the rising generation, and though not very well known, they are at least equal if not better than the people now in charge in Washington. The problem in the next few years is to concentrate on the young men who are coming rather than the old men who are going. Mr. Reagan has performed a valiant service to the country. He has challenged the assumptions of the Democrats and the welfare state, which was useful, but he has imposed his own ideology of his old age, which has not been very successful. Do we really want to go on with these old men - the Reagans, the Tip O'Neills, the Cranstons - and the old conflicts between the parties, the regions, the races, management and labor - or do we want to look to younger men who see the possibilities of a different world in terms of cooperation rather than confrontation? If this is a reasonable question, the argument about whether Mr. Reagan will or won't run seems almost irrelevant. He's the nicest guy who has come down this pike for a long time, but as an old sports reporter, he must know that government, like a football team, has to draft and make room for the coming generation.

843-> 16 TRIBAL GROUPS CONSTITUTE 10% OF POPULATION IN ASSAM
Assam, India's remote northeastern state where at least 600 civilians were reported yesterday to have been killed by Hindu tribesmen, has a population of nearly 15 million. Among these, there are at least 16 tribal groups that make up perhaps 10 percent of the state's population. Although many of the tribal people have been converted to Christianity, the large majority carry on the customs and festivals of a traditional religion that bears an affinity to ancient forms of Hindu worship. Hinduism is the religion of about two-thirds of Assam's nontribal population; one-third are Moslems. Of the tribes found in Assam, the largest are the Garo, the Kachari, the Khasi, the Lushai and the Mikir. Of Mongoloid stock, most tribespeople speak a dialect of Tibeto-Burman origin. The Indian Constitution of 1950, following the practice of the British during their rule, established a list, or schedule, of castes and tribes that are eligible for special benefits, including welfare services, scholarships and guaranteed places in educational institutions, guaranteed posts in the civil service and seats in Parliament. System Relatively Egalitarian Unlike Hindu caste structure, tribal life tends to be relatively egalitarian, with leadership based more on kinship and personal relationships than on a hereditary hierarchy grounded in religious mandate. The Nagas, the largest tribe in the northeast, waged a separatist war for several years that forced the Indian Government to carve out a separate state for it in 1963. The state is now called Nagaland. Hindu Assamese animosity toward ''immigrants'' stems from the period from 1951 to 1961 when as many as 300,000 Moslems immigrated into Assam looking for arable land. In 1961 the Assamese government began to expel the Moslems to what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. By 1965 more than 136,000 had been deported. A movement to have the rest evicted began to gain momemtum in the 1970's when deportation became an objective of student protests.

844-> MISS BELLAMY URGES CITY TAX RISE LIMITED TO INCOME ABOVE $30,000
City Council President Carol Bellamy proposed yesterday that New York City raise its income tax on the wealthiest 10 percent of the city's taxpayers: those earning more than $30,000. Miss Bellamy said the plan would raise $128 million.''Raising taxes is always painful,'' she said, ''so it is important the additional burden be distributed as equitably as possible. By targeting the city's tax increase to those individuals receiving the largest Federal tax decreases, they simply will be receiving a slightly smaller overall tax break. This tax would be equitable, predictable, deductible and collectible.'' The maximum city tax rate is now 4.3 percent. Miss Bellamy's plan calls for a rate of 4.5 percent on incomes between $30,000 and $50,000 and 5 percent on incomes above that. Miss Bellamy, who made the proposal public yesterday, sent it to Mayor Koch in a letter Jan. 21. ''As I review the preliminary budget, it is clear tax increases will be necessary if we are to avoid drastic reductions in police, education and other essential city services,'' Miss Bellamy said in her letter. Earlier this month Mayor Koch submitted to the State Financial Control Board his $16.5 billion preliminary budget for fiscal 1984, in which a $580 million budget gap was projected. The Mayor warned that ''painful'' reductions in city services, employee layoffs and tax increases on luxury goods and services would be needed to make up that deficit. According to the City Council President's plan, a family of four with a gross annual income of $40,000, would owe the city $8 more a year, but would still save $1,753 in taxes in 1983, compared with 1981, because of Federal tax reductions. An income of $80,000 would mean a city tax increase of $553, but a net tax break of $3,429. In response to Miss Bellamy's proposal, Mayor Koch said only: ''I always welcome Carol's suggestions. I will ask Ken Lipper, Alair Townsend and Phil Michael to study her proposal, and I will get back to her.'' Alair A. Townsend is City Budget Director, Kenneth Lipper is Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and Philip R. Michael is the city's Finance Commissioner.

845-> SOVIET FARMING SEEMS HEADED FOR SHAKE-UP
The new Soviet leadership under Yuri V. Andropov appears to have decided on a drastic overhaul of agriculture, traditionally one of the weak spots of the Soviet economy. The reorganization, according to the Soviet press, is aimed at better coordination of the farm sector, now broken down into a dozen specialized agencies, from a Fruit and Vegetable Ministry to a Ministry of Machine Building for Animal Husbandry and Fodder Production. The mergers have yet to be officially announced in Moscow, but have already started to take effect in Georgia, one of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. They are part of a broader effort to improve the performance of agriculture, which has been given a high priority since Mr. Andropov came to power in November on the death of Leonid I. Brezhnev. Grain production, in particular, has become so poor that the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of keeping grain harvests secret. No figures have been published for the harvests of 1981 and 1982. Other crops, such as cotton and sugar beets, continue to be officially reported. Subsidiary Farms' Role To supplement the output of the Soviet Union's 48,000 huge collective and state farms, the authorities have been looking to greater contributions from the so-called subsidiary farms operated by factories for the benefit of their workers. A broadened role for these factory farms, going beyond the growing of fruits and vegetables, was indicated last Monday in a report on a high-level Moscow meeting by Tass, the Government's press agency. ''Attention was drawn to the need for further expansion of the operations of subsidiary farms for processing farm products, preparing building materials and producing consumer goods,'' the agency said. The decision to merge ministries was signaled last month when the Georgian republic announced that it was consolidating three of its agricultural agencies. Georgia Took the Lead In the Soviet Union, the structure of government at the national level is generally duplicated in the various republics. What was unusual in this case was that Georgia, an independent-minded land of five million people between the Caucasus Mountains and Turkey, took the lead without waiting for Moscow to act. The action, announced March 12 in the newspaper Zarya Vostoka of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, set up an all-embracing administration to be known as the State Committee of Agricultural Production. It was formed by merging the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Management, and a state committee charged with supplying machinery and fertilizer to collective and state farms. In Soviet parlance, ministries and state committees perform the same supervisory functions. Western experts say one reason for consistently poor performance in Soviet agriculture has been inadequate advance planning and preparation of machinery, which is not always ready for spring planting or for the harvest in the fall. A description of Georgia's State Committee of Agricultural Production indicated that it was the forerunner of a new farmadministration system for the entire Soviet Union. It was defined as a ''union-republic'' type of agency, meaning that it would have its head office at the ''union,'' or national, level, with counterparts in the republics. Officials Given Warning At the March 28 meeting in the Soviet capital, according to the Tass report, several ministries connected with agriculture were told that they must improve their performance this spring and that officials would be held responsible for failure. Deputy ministers responsible for the meat and dairy industries, in particular, were told to cut losses or face the consequences, the press agency said. Tass said steps were being taken to improve supplies of tractors, plowing and sowing machines, spare parts, fertilizers, pesticides and other equipment. There are shortages in several regions and some farms do not have the required stocks of fuel, it said.

846-> THE WORLD OF DATA CONFRONTS THE JOY OF HACKING
THE recent electronic escapades of a group of Milwaukee youths have brought national attention to the growing problem of computer security. But so-called computer hackers have long been an active subculture. Geoffrey S. Goodfellow, 27, is now a computer security researcher at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif. He was first hired by a computer company between the eighth and ninth grades after being nabbed inside its system. John Draper, 40, is the originator of the popular Easy Writer word-processing program and the president of Cap'n Software, a San Francisco company. In the late 1960's, he was the legendary Cap'n Crunch, who discovered that the toy whistle available in certain cereal boxes would open the long-distance telephone network. Mr. Goodfellow and Mr. Draper talked about computer security with Wayne Biddle, an editor of The Week in Review. Excerpts from their discussion follow. H OW would you describe the interests of computer hackers? Why do they do it? Mr. Goodfellow.A hacker is someone who programs computers for the sheer fun of it rather than, say, just theorizing about programming. A hacker could be described as a person capable of appreciating the irony and beauty - or as we refer to it, the 'hack value' - of a program. But another part, unfortunately, is a little bit on the dark side. There is a malicious or inquisitive hacker, or meddler, who would like to discover information by poking around. Hackers consider themselves somewhat of an elite. It's a meritocracy based on ability. Based on all the ones I've talked to, I'd best describe them as loners looking for someone to appreciate their talent. The typical hacker is probably somewhere between seventh grade and undergraduate level in college. They're sort of social outcasts. Most boys like to drink beer or play sports; the hacker is intensely interested in technology and is a very inquisitive person. The way they bring themselves to your attention - it is also my premise that all hackers want to get caught - is by penetrating computer systems. They wouldn't personally think of calling up on the telephone and saying, 'Hi, I'm a bright young guy and I'd like to hack your computer.' Mr. Draper. I suppose they do it because of the challenge and probably just for their own curiosity, much like I was doing when I was hacking on the phone network. You can be told in books, you can be told by hearsay, but to actually go in and learn it is the only real way. Once they get into a system they can cause a lot of mischief. Is it criminal to enter somebody else's computer? Mr. Goodfellow. I don't think that most people are taking reasonable and prudent measures to protect their computer systems. I draw a direct analogy between this and the way classified information is handled. It is the responsibility of the organization which you belong to, such as SRI, to provide you with rules and regulations in handling that information. The same applies to administrators of computer systems. It's their responsibility to provide measures to prevent people from breaking into a system. This means things like forcing users to choose reasonable passwords - not their spouse's name or their dog's name. What all hackers are going after, mainly, is the treasure chest of the system's password file. Now the second facet of this is the users' responsibility. I don't go out to lunch and leave my secrets sitting on my desk. I put them in my safe. And I don't go throwing them over the embassy walls, so to speak. The third matter is the responsibility of the hackers. When we were brought up, we were taught about trespassing. If you go to a friend's house and the front door is wide open, I don't really know of anyone who would walk right in to look around. I would stand at the door, ring the doorbell or knock or call out. That type of responsibility or sense of morals has to be slid down onto the computer. Mr. Draper. It's a shady question of just where the line is between actually trespassing on the property and not trespassing. Are you trespassing when you take your foot and step right on the lawn of the person's house? Or are you trespassing when you're standing on the porchway? Or are you trespassing when you indeed stick your foot in the door? Now, when you log in a computer of a whole system you're talking to an outer shell, more or less. It's kind of like a little watchdog. And this watchdog system is the thing that's going to ask you for the password. But you can also do other things on the system - sometimes getting it to read mail or send messages to people without even logging on. If you haven't actually logged in the computer when you're on the system, I would say that you're probably not trespassing or breaking in. However, if you actually type in a password and go into an account, I would say that could be considered illegal. What do you think the answer is to current concerns about computer security? Mr. Goodfellow. I think there are two primary areas that will help in the future. One is teaching a sense of responsibility with respect to hackers, systems administrators and the users. The second is improving the safeguarding of information through technology. I'm the principal investigator of a Government- funded project at SRI, which has to do with that type of technology. There is a very pressing problem in the Department of Defense with computer systems that run at different security levels. My involvement has to do with developing technologies that will insure absolutely that I am only entitled to get information out of a computer system which I have clearance for. Mr. Draper. There are no Federal laws for computers and there probably should be. The problem is wording the law such that it is very specific. In my opinion the easiest way to prevent an illegal break-in of the computer is to have a simple watchdog program between the computer and the user that would detect repeated attacks. A repeated attack is dialing the host number if you're on one of the networks, trying a password, being rejected, trying another password, getting rejected. A watchdog program would come back with a message warning the attacker that what he is doing is illegal and that an attempt is being made to trace the call. That would scare 90 percent of the hackers. The other 10 percent would have to get nailed when they got past the watchdog program by the system software of the host computer. System owners should be made aware that more and more people now have modems (telephone line hookups) and more and more people are going to be trying to get in their system. How they should be made aware is a logistical problem that has to be solved in the computer industry. It could be done through the Association for Computing Machinery, it could be done at computer shows, it can be done in schools.

847-> A RARESHOW OF THE FAMILIAR MASTERS
LUGANO, Switzerland The most spectacular exhibition in Europe this summer is not in Paris or London or Berlin but in a villa on the eastern tip of Lugano, Switzerland. In exchange for a loan of 40 paintings from his celebrated Old Master collection, Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza has borrowed 40 late 19th- and early 20th-century French paintings of the highest quality from the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. The show is of particular interest, since the paintings have been rarely seen in the West since they were acquired by the two great Russian collectors, Ivan Morozov and Sergei Shchukin, in the years prior to World War I. This Impressionism to Cubism greatest-hits shows, installed in the private quarters of the baron's Villa Favorita, the building that houses his Old Master museum, continues through Oct. 15. The Soviet authorities' selection of the baron's top 40, which includes paintings by Rogier van der Weyden, Titian, El Greco and Goya, will be on display at the Pushkin from Sept. 12 to Nov. 14 and the Hermitage from Nov. 19 to Feb. 1, 1984. The initial response to ''Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post- Impressionism From Soviet Museums'' is likely to be a sense of disbelief. Seeing so many major but still largely unseen and therefore unassimilated paintings by Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh (three by each), Gauguin (nine, one self-portrait and 8 paintings of the South Seas), Cezanne (eight), Matisse (six) and Picasso (eight, including five diverse Cubist works), in a setting that is as accessible as the exhibition's scale, may send the visitor scurrying through the rooms, as a child scurries through his entire lode of presents, needing to know the extent of his riches before concentrating on one nugget in particular. Two of the velvety 1876 Monets commissioned by Ernest Hoschede for his chateau in Montgeron, Gauguin's 1892 ''What! Are You Jealous?,'' Cezanne's 1905-6 ''Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen From Les Lauves,'' Matisse's 1908 ''Red Room'' and Picasso's 1908 ''Three Women'' are landmarks of late 19th- and early 20th-century art. One can only hope that it will not be another 75 years before the Soviet Union is magnanimous enough to grant us access to an album of works that live in our imaginations like photographs of family members we recognize but do not know. According to villa officials, the exhibition was initiated by Vladi- mir S. Semyonov, formerly head of the Soviet delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and presently Soviet ambassador to West Germany, who wanted for a long time to bring to the Soviet Union a selection of the baron's Old Master collection. The stature and desirability of that collection were established in 1979-81 when 57 of Mr. Thyssen's Old Master works toured the United States, opening at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and closing at the Metropolitan Museum. A selection of works from Mr. Thyssen's 20th-century holdings will go on display at the Metropolitan on Aug. 31. There is a remote possibility that the 40 French paintings in Lugano will come to the United States. Since negotiations for works of art in Soviet collections invariably take place on a political level, the American institution with the best chance of borrowing the paintings is probably the National Gallery, with its strong governmental connections. ''Obviously, any institution would be delighted to show pictures of that significance and beauty,'' a spokesman for the gallery said. ''If it does work though, it will be one of those last-minute things.'' Villa officials say that Mr. Thyssen selected the works in the Lugano show himself. With the exception of the van Goghs, in every instance the selection suggests the full strength of the particular artist. Installing a greatest-hits show consisting of a handful of works by a limited number of artists is always a problem. The approach in this case is not historical. Moving from Monet, van Gogh and Renoir to Picasso, then from Gauguin to Matisse to Cezanne, there is really no way to trace the development from artist to artist, movement to movement. The most striking effect of the sequence is that Picasso and Cezanne become the standard by which the work of the other artists is measured. A show that brings together so many eminent but rarely experienced works has a chance of changing the way the authors of those works are seen. Renoir, for example, may still be tainted by the modernist assumption that major artistic ambition and an a painterly preoccupation with the good life are mutually exclusive. In this show, there are two portraits by Renoir, both of celebrated women, both superb. In the 1876 ''Woman in Black'' and the 1878 ''Portrait of the Actress Jeanne Samary,'' Impressionist brush and color, with their evocation of transience and movement, are combined with a frontal, symmetrical structure that feels as inflexible as a two-ton block of stone. Renoir works against the immobility in such a way that the figures and the paintings seem newborn, having just this second come to life. The earring and the flower in the hair of the ''Woman in Black'' are radiant pieces of painting that would draw nods of approval from the best of Renoir's Venetian and Dutch ancestors. The idea of emerging life is central to the theme of Picasso's show-stopping 1908 ''Three Women.'' After what has been written about this painting in recent years by Leo Steinberg and William Rubin, one wishes the work could be seen again in the United States - through the efforts of Margaret Potter, it was borrowed for ''Four Americans in Paris. The Collections of Gertrude Stein and her Family,'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970. This more than six-foot tall painting of three monumental, sculptural figures - a kneeling woman at the right, what seems to be a man starting to rise on the left, and a somewhat androgynous figure standing between them (Mr. Steinberg has suggested that ''Two or Three Women'' would be a more accurate title) - in front of a rock landscape, seems in many ways diametrically opposed to the major Picasso of the previous year, the ''Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' In the 1907 painting, the setting is indoors, a brothel. The rock landscape and hazy, muted, golden brown light leave little doubt about the outdoor setting of the ''Three Woman.'' The ''Demoiselles'' is tough, brashly colored, confrontational. In the ''Three Women,'' the colors are softer, the values more equal, the mood one of expectant stillness: the stone seems to have just opened and human life to have arisen and taken shape after a primordial sleep. The earlier painting is filled with jagged, intruding volumes; the shapes in the later work are more rounded, the work as a whole more flat. Picasso's 1908 ''Dryad''is a painting of a large, dual female figure striding through a forest: the ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' suggests the dryad's defiant, closed- fisted left hand; the ''Three Women'' suggests her right hand, curved and open in a gesture of accessibility and welcome. It is hard to see the two paintings apart. Mr. Steinberg sees the ''Three Women,'' on one level, as a way of resisting Cezanne, who died in 1906 and was given a memorial exhibition in Paris in 1907. Indeed, in its shallow space and muted tones, the Picasso could hardly be further from a painting like Cezanne's 1905-6 ''Mont Ste. Victoire seen from les Lauves.'' In the background of the Cezanne is the familiar white mountain, in the foregound a rumbling mass of brown, green, blue and ochre paint where it seems as if all the trees and fields of Provence have been fed into the canvas. Unlike Monet's 1867 ''Woman in the Garden'' - in its shower of light the quintessential Impressionist painting in the show - ''Mont Ste. Victoire'' is not a painting concerned with the flash of a moment. Colors ''arise out of the roots of the world,'' Cezanne is reported to have said. In the paintings he did at the end of his life, Cezanne wanted his paintings to devour earth, water and sky. Even for Cezanne, the materiality of this small painting is extraordinary. If it were suddenly jarred loose from the wall, one has the sense it would go through the floor. It is one of those paintings - with certain Titians and Rembrandts, perhaps - that suggests what can happen when paint seems to swallow the subject whole and become something that finally belongs to both and neither. Almost all the Cezannes in the show, including the 1873-75 still-life and self- portait and the 1895-1900 ''The Smoker,'' seem like elements unto themselves. The one artist in the show who is outclassed is Gauguin. Because of his liberties with space, his inventive use of color and his subsequent importance for modernist developments such as Fauvism and German Expressionism, Gauguin's problems as a painter have sometimes been overlooked. Even with the startling play of primary colors and compositional rhythms of Tahitian paintings in the show like the 1892 ''Landscape With Peacocks'' and 1896 ''Tahitians in a Room,'' many of his paintings remain, in some sense, at war with themselves. Given Gauguin's feeling of alienation from society in general, it is not surprising that a major problem in his work is an unresolved tension between figure and ground. Gauguin was generally more comfortable painting patterns and landscapes than he was painting people. The trees and hills and water in ''Landscape with Peacocks,'' the 1892 ''Her Name is Vairaoumati'' and the 1894 ''Delicious Water,'' also in the show, are already expressionist in their fabulous colors and shapes. Painting South Sea natives, however, Gauguin was less at ease. He painted them with the wariness he seems to have felt for them. Gauguin tried to find ways to make his self- conscious treatment of people into a strength, for example, by incorporating stylistic elements from Egyptian hieroglyphs, as in ''Her Name is Vairaoumati,'' and from Japanese prints, in ''What! Are You Jealous?'' Often, however, the figures, as opposed to the setting, remain conceptual and lifeless. What Gauguin released while painting the natural world trees seems to be all that he bottled up when painting people. The conflicts in Gauguin's paintings between inhibition and instinct, self-consciousness and spontaneity, the sophisticated and the primitive, human life and nature, ambition and escape, were certainly not his conflicts alone. With the Neo-Expressionism and neo-primitivism of contemporary painting, it is clear the degree to which they are ours. Gauguin defined the problem. All the other artists in this invaluable show suggest answers.

848-> ADVICE TO WOMEN AT MIDLIFE
Betty Furness, who makes no bones about the fact that she's 67 years old, told more than 200 middle-aged women that they should never turn up their noses at entry-level jobs, should never take no for an answer and should fake only one thing: confidence. ''If you don't have confidence,'' she said in a spirited speech at a conference last Friday, ''lie in your approach. No one wants to know if you're scared. It makes them scared themselves. Be absolutely sure of yourself, and if you're not, fake it.'' Miss Furness, who is a consumer reporter for both WNBC-TV and NBC's ''Today'' show, was the keynote speaker at the conference for middle-aged women at Marymount Manhattan College, 221 East 71st Street. The conference, titled the Midlife Fair, was sponsored by the college's Midlife Institute, which offers courses dealing with the concerns of women in their middle years. The standing-room-only crowd, mainly women in their 40's, 50's and 60's, paid $5 each to hear Miss Furness and to attend workshops on financial planning, coping with elderly parents, relationships with grown daughters and life planning. Mary Jean Tully, director of the Midlife Institute, said there were two kinds of middle-aged women: ''Those who never want another volunteer job in their lives, and those who want an interesting job but find these jobs are all in the volunteer field.'' 'Get Your Foot in the Door' Singling out those who were considering entering or returning to the paid job market, Miss Furness said: ''I think an entry-level job is a perfect job. The important thing is to get your foot in the door. Take a job as a secretary and then look around and see what else is available.'' She acknowledged that there was disagreement about whether women in midlife should should accept such entry-level jobs. ''I know this is one area where I part company with the women's movement,'' she said. Miss Furness, who observed her 50th anniversary in show business and broadcasting last year, is believed to be the only woman over the age of 65 who appears regularly on television news programs. One reason for her success, she said, is that she has never taken no for an answer. ''When you want something,'' she said, ''go back and go back and go back, and don't take no for an answer. And when rejection comes, don't take it personally. It goes with the territory. Expose yourself to as much humiliation as you can bear, then go home and go do it all again tomorrow.'' She told of how the best things in her life had happened to her after the age of 45, when she quit the job she had had for 11 years as the woman who opened the refrigerator door on Westinghouse television commercials. ''I quit because I was restless,'' she said. ''I wanted to be me.'' In 1967 she was named special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson for consumer affairs, a job she held for two years. In 1970 she was appointed executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, and in 1973 she became Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs. She left that job in 1974 to join WNBC-TV. A Query About Television During a question-and-answer session, Miss Furness was asked what she thought about the negative ways that older women are often portrayed on television. She said she thought that little could be done, ''because we're in a youth thing now.'' ''Everything is youth,'' she said. ''Maybe Jane Fonda will be the one to change it. She's 46, and she's certainly glamorous and energetic.'' The financial planning workshop drew an overflow crowd, including Valerie Cahill, 51, of Rowayton, Conn. Mrs. Cahill, who has been separated from her husband since 1977, said she quit college after her sophomore year to get married, raised three sons and is now wondering what she will do with the rest of her life. ''It's scary, it really is,'' she said. ''You find yourself faced with a lot of opportunities, but you don't know which ones to pursue.'' At the workshop on relationships with grown daughters, several women nodded in agreement when Doris Bernstein, a psychoanalyst who teaches at the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in Manhattan, said the women's movement has been ''a source of tension'' between mothers and daughters. ''It's one of the most unfortunate things that have come from the feminist movement,'' she said. ''Mothers are feeling ashamed that they've stayed home and raised their daughters, and daughters have joined in devaluating the very core of their mothers' existence.'' ''There is no live-and-let-live feeling here,'' Miss Bernstein added. ''Each is defending her own territory, rather than negotiating an appreciation of the different territories.'' She said that, with more and more women deferring marriage and child-rearing, the ''antagonistic battle'' between mothers and daughters is lasting much longer than before. This battle usually ends, she said, when the daughter moves into marriage and motherhood. ''They become comrades then,'' she said. Several women said that many children now expect to be subsidized by their parents through their 20's and early 30's. One widowed mother told of the hostility she encountered from her 26-year-old daughter when she told her, ''You're on your own.'' Reassurance From Others ''That was three years ago,'' she said, ''and she's still very cool to me. It causes me a lot of pain.'' Several women immediately assured her that she had done the right thing. Another popular subject at the conference was the mother who still treats a grown daughter like a child. In a workshop on elderly parents, one woman said her mother wanted her to stay at home with her, isolated from the world. The woman added, ''So I finally told her, 'I'm your child, but I'm not 10 years old anymore.' '' Babette Becker, executive director of the New York State Coalition for Improved Long Term Care, who ran the workshop, said it was important for children to care for their own needs as well as those of their elderly parents. ''You have to take in order to be able to give,'' she said. ''A little narcissism can go a long way.''

849-> SALES OF RECORDS ON THE RISE
After four years of plummeting sales, the recording industry finally appears to be on the way up. It is being propelled by several hit albums, aggressive price-cutting and marketing by the record companies, and the comeback of consumer spending -abetted by teen-agers' retreat from arcade video games. Record sales, which went into a tailspin in 1979 when consumers began home taping, have risen in recent months. It is too early to measure the upturn precisely, but RCA estimates that the industry's unit sales are currently 5 percent to 10 percent higher than last year's, and CBS is projecting a 2 percent sales growth for the entire industry for 1983. ''After a few years of being beaten on the head, I had to look at the numbers twice to believe them,'' said Walter R. Yetnikoff, president of CBS's record group since 1975. With several singles and albums at the top of the charts - including ''Business as Usual,'' a best-selling album by Men at Work, the Australian group - CBS Records seems to be on a roll. But other record company executives say that their sales have also increased. Cautious Optimism Expressed ''We're approaching each day with a little more confidence,'' said Robert Summer, president of RCA Records. That caution is warranted. For one thing, sales are rising on a sadly shrunken base. After decades of double-digit growth, the industry's domestic shipments slumped from 726 million units, or $4.1 billion, in 1978, the last good year, to 594 million units, or $3.6 billion, in 1981, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. While there are no published statistics for 1982, John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., estimates that unit volume fell another 8 percent. Furthermore, the recording industry's gains are still outpaced by the phenomenon that has accounted for most of its troubles. ''There's no stopping home taping,'' said Stanley Gortikoff, president of the Recording Industry Association, adding that the sale of blank tapes is still outpacing sales of records and prerecorded cassettes. Still, a number of factors have made recorded music more competitive with home taping. The start of the economic recovery has brought consumers back to the record shops, including many of the teen-agers who had been spending their money in the video arcades. More Competitive Pricing In part, record companies have been wooing them back by slashing prices. Most record companies have cut prices on much of their socalled catalogue, the list of albums and singles released six months to a year ago. In January, Warner Communications Inc. cut the list price of some 1,100 catalogue long-playing records and cassettes from $8.98, to $6.98, the lowest level in five years. (Marketing and packaging apart, the cost of manufacturing a long-playing record is less than $1, according to Mr. Reidy.) ''It seems to be stimulating sales,'' said Elliot Goldman, a senior vice president at Warner. CBS and Warner together account for nearly half of the United States market. Other record companies have experimented with price cuts, to as low as $4.98, on releases by new artists. Many have cut the price of cassettes, which now account for nearly half of the sales of recorded music, to match that of LP's. Even so, they remain substantially more expensive than blank tapes, which average about $4 for 90 minutes of recording capacity. Variety of New Products In the effort to reach budget-conscious consumers, the record companies have also brought out a range of products that seem to offer more music for less money. There are the EP's, or extended-play records, a crossbreed between an LP and a single. A& M Records introduced a cassette single, dubbed the Cassingle, and another company experimented unsuccessfully with a cassette with only one prerecorded side. Recognizing the importance of the cassette, companies are packaging it more enticingly, in wrappers as distinctive as album jackets. In the view of some record company executives, however, it is the sound of music that has led to the upturn in sales. Hits have always been vital to the record industry - only one in five albums recovers its costs - and last year they were in distressingly short supply. There were 128 gold LP's and tapes, and 54 platinums in 1982, compared with 153 golds and 60 platinums in 1981. A gold album must sell 500,000 units and have manufacturers' sales of $1 million; a platinum must double those numbers. Only three albums achieved the prized mega-platinum status by selling 2 million units or more. More Hit Records Seen Whether credit belongs to the talent or the marketing - MTV, the all-music cable television channel, is a powerful factor in promoting new releases - a number of releases by new artists have become overnight hits this year. According to record company executives, at least five albums - including RCA's ''H2O,'' by Hall and Oates, CBS's ''Business as Usual,'' and ''Thriller,'' by Michael Jackson, under CBS's Epic label -will be mega-platinums. ''It seems that the top of the chart is now yielding at least one million more units,'' Mr. Summer said. The upturn appears to have caught even the record companies by surprise. With their profits and sales reduced by the slump, most have pared their operations in recent years, shutting down factories, dismissing workers and trimming overhead. In January, Warner announced plans to move its Electra-Asylum label to the East Coast, where it can share some overhead with Atlantic, another Warner label. All the record companies say that they are signing fewer artists, and scrutinizing deals more closely. Only 5,500 new LP and singles titles were released by United States recording companies in 1981, compared with 6,700 in 1980, and the companies say that, despite the upturn, they will continue to hold the line. ''A lot of us have learned to do more business-like business,'' Mr. Yetnikoff declared. Denying a published report that he is leaving CBS to join a competing company, MCA Inc., he said yesterday, ''CBS Records is enjoying enormous success at this time. I'd be crazy to leave.'' Help Sought From Congress In the short term, however, record company executives seem to be pinning their hopes less on the free market than on legislative remedies to combat home taping. There is an effort in Congress and a case before the Supreme Court that would require manufacturers of blank tapes and players to pay a royalty to copyright owners as compensation for sales forgone. But even if the measure succeeds, Mr. Gortikoff conceded, ''revenues will in no way match losses.'' Another legislative target is the record-rental stores, which rent records for as little as $1. ''It's a parasitical business, whose only purpose is to foster home taping,'' said Mr. Gortikoff, whose association has counted more than 200 such stores nationwide. He noted that in Japan, where the trend began, the tally had reached 1,600. Record manufacturers are lobbying Congress for a law that would give them the right to withhold their products from record rental stores. Bright Prospects for Digital In the long run, the industry's answer may be the new digital technology, which reproduces sound far better than the conventional analog method. A new market for records could be born, said Mr. Reidy of Drexel Burnham Lambert, if the price of a digital compact disk turntable, now about $900, fell below $500, and a disk, now priced at $16 to $20, dropped to $10. ''The dream of the industry is that customers would buy compact disk players and reinventory what they have on analog,'' he said. Already, the record companies have begun recording in digital. RCA Records said that it has 70 albums. While the initial interest is expected to come from classical music buffs, record company executives say that they also expect a market in pop, the bulk of the business. And they are hopeful that, as technology advances, the disk will be portable, allowing its use in cars and radios. Nonetheless, the industry is reserving judgment. Not only is the acceptance of the compact disk an unknown, but so is its impact on home taping. While no tape will be able to replicate the fidelity offered by the compact disk, ''the disk is a terrific master from which to tape,'' Mr. Yetnikoff conceded. ''We don't know how people are going to react.''

850-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Technology, Art and Toys T urning technology to a playful use, three new sculptures are mesmerizing onlookers in the lobby at 2 World Trade Center. ''Moving Rock,'' cast in resins by Rikuro Okamoto from a Central Park boulder, crawls back and forth on its platform, powered by who knows what hidden urge, or motor. ''Maybe it's ants under there,'' mused Ed Bider, a SoHo painter. Equally mystifying is ''Weeping Column,'' a concrete shaft by Clyde Lynds embedded with delicate studs and filaments that alternately glow and disappear. ''Fiber optics,'' explained Susan L. Davis, a spokesman for the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, co-sponsor of the exhibit with the Port Authority and Art for Public Space Inc. ''Magic Clock,'' George Rhoads's big toy, draws transfixed crowds. Pings, clangs, whirs, thuds and bongs - in the tradition of the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely's kinetic sculptures -emerged from the Plexiglas-enclosed gears, gongs, springs, pendulums, pans, spools, cages and saw blades, all set in motion by oversized pinballs and culminating in the squawk of a raucous cuckoo clock. ''The perpetual-motion machine -perfect Rube Goldberg,'' said Burton Jacowitz, a Brooklyn lawyer. ''You feel like a kid again,'' said his partner, Paul Plust. A larger-scale version of the clock has been commissioned for the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

851-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Inescapable Taxes
Four years ago, when he was 12 years old, Jody Gerard was responsible for reforming New York State's sales tax law. He was selling worms to fishermen at his home in Eddyville in Ulster County when the State Tax Department found out about it and required him to pay it 64 cents in sales taxes. In the freshet of publicity that followed, the State Legislature voted to revise the sales tax law to exempt entrepreneurs under 16 years of age if they grossed less than $600 a year. The bill became law in July 1980. Today Jody still sells worms at his home - 35 cents a dozen for red wigglers and 50 to 75 cents for glass worms, depending on size. Same prices as in 1979. But one of life's certitudes has again caught up with him: He must pay the sales tax this year. Jody turned 16 in September 1982 and lost his exemption. He says he has grossed $50 to $60 in worm sales so far this summer. That would put his sales-tax bill at $3.50 to $4.20. Rather than register with the state, Jody says, he will pay the taxes through the Mouse Factory, a small puppet-making business that his mother runs. ''It doesn't really bother me,'' he says of the taxes. ''That ain't too much now to really worry about.'' In fact, Jody says, he is looking for an outside job that will pay more; then he can pay Social Security and income taxes. He tried to give away his business to his 14-year-old sister, he says, but she doesn't like worms.

852-> YANKEES POUND ANGELS
The subject matter at Yankee Stadium for the past month had been pine tar. But last night, in front of 43,181 fans at the Stadium, the Yankees appeared to leave that issue behind them, belting 15 hits on the way to an 11-6 victory over the California Angels. ''In my mind, the guys in our dressing room were very relaxed tonight,'' said Don Baylor, the Yankee designated hitter. ''I didn't hear a thing about pine tar all day, and that was nice. I'd like to go the rest of the year just watching the paper, reading who's winning and who's losing.'' By the end of the third inning, the Yankees were already well in command with an 8-0 lead. And by the end of five innings, having collected 14 hits, the Yankess had extended the lead to 11-0. 'I Feel Good' Omar Moreno and Graig Nettles each drove in three runs for the Yankees, still very much a part of the five-team pileup in the American League East. They are in fifth place, but only 3 1/2 games out of first. Moreno, acquired Aug. 10 from Houston in a trade for Jerry Mumphrey, went 3 for 4 and drove in his first runs in the American League. Nettles, who will turn 39 today, went 4 for 5 and now has 58 runs batted in - three more than he had all last year - and had his first four-hit game since April 22, 1979. ''I feel good, happy,'' said Moreno, a center fielder. ''If I can get on base once or twice every game then I know I can score a lot of runs for this team.'' Moreno also scored three runs, reaching base and scoring in each of his first three trips to the plate. Ron Guidry (14-8) went the distance for the Yankees, scattering nine hits. He has now equaled last year's won-lost mark. Once staked to the 11-0 lead, the Yankee left-hander began to experiment with pitches and lost his chance for what would have been a league-leading fourth shutout. He did, however, throw his 14th complete game and has now gone the distance in his last 7 starts. Kemp Hits Homer ''When you get a big-run lead like that, you forget what you're doing out there,'' said Guidry, who struck out only two Angels. ''Their guys are free-wheelin', and they can hit the ball. If the game had been close, I don't know if I would have thrown the same pitches. I was throwing some curves out there, and I never throw those, but this was the type of game to do that.'' The Yankees took a 4-0 lead in the second when they chased the Angels' starter, Ken Forsch (11-8), with four hits on four runs. Steve Kemp led off with his 12th homer, a towering shot into the upper deck in right field, for a 1-0 lead. Moreno later drove in his first run with a double, and Nettles knocked in two runs with a single to center. Moreno drove in two runs in the next inning as the Yanks made it 8-0. Another run scored on an error, and Nettles delivered his third run batted in with a pop double to left. New York put across its final three runs in the fifth, helped by four hits off the reliever John Curtis. Guidry, who allowed two hits in the first five innings, lost his shutout in the sixth when two sacrifice flies drove in the Angels' first two runs. Bobby Grich added a two-run homer in the eighth, and Daryl Sconiers belted a two-run shot in the ninth. Robertson Listed as 'Stable' Andre Robertson, the Yankee shortstop injured in a car crash early Thursday morning, was listed in ''stable'' condition yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital. Steve Barboza, a hospital spokesman, said a doctor's report at 2:15 P.M. noted that the 25- year-old shortstop was ''doing very well'', but he did not estimate how soon Robertson would be released. Meanwhile, the Yankees put Robertson on the 21-day disabled list and recalled Bob Meacham, an infielder, from their Triple A team in Columbus. . . . Mickey Mantle was seen in the Yankee hospitality room after last night's game. It was believed to be his first appearance at Yankee Stadium since he was ordered last February by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to sever any links with the Yankees because of his ties to an Atlantic City casino.

853-> U.S. SOCIAL TOLERANCE OF DRUGS FOUND ON RISE
Social scientists believe that the level of public tolerance of the use of illegal drugs is continuing to rise in all levels of American society. They say, further, that the growing availability and acceptability of these drugs is effecting profound social changes that have neither been fully acknowledged nor fully understood. The signs of the raised level of acceptance are widespread. At a rehearsal break in a recent Manhattan practice session of an Ivy League alumni choral group that counts stockbrokers, lawyers and corporate executives among its membership, one successful businessman held out a bit of hashish to a fellow singer, aged 49. ''Have some?'' he asked. At 9 A.M. the other morning on the Brooklyn Heights promenade, a youth in a blue windbreaker, out walking his German shepherd, took a deep drag on a marijuana cigarette. None of the joggers and walkers nearby gave him a second glance. In an office of a university in New York, a professor who had traveled from the Midwest for a job interview inquired solicitously about the health of the sniffling department head sitting behind the desk before her. ''Oh,'' he said offhandedly, ''that's not a cold. I've been doing too much cocaine lately.'' ''In a very short time, cultural patterns have changed dramatically,'' said Dr. Richard Jessor, a social psychologist who is director of the Institute of Behavioral Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. ''It is now normal for the majority of young people to have experience with a range of substances that was unavailable to previous generations. And that raises important and interesting questions for social policy that haven't been addressed.'' Dr. Norman Zinberg, professor of psychiatry at Harvard University, said: ''Nobody in the United States is more than one handshake away from virtually any drug they want to get. Drugs are used in every stratum, across the board, from blue-collar people to professionals. There is no distinction between 'heads' and 'juicers' anymore.'' Dr. Jessor's and Dr. Zinberg's views were generally reflected in a series of interviews and a survey of the opinions and findings of drug-abuse experts, medical and treatment authorities, drug users and law-enforcement officials across the nation. Some of these experts say that drug use has become so widespread that it often goes unnoticed, and that, in focusing on the dangers of specific drugs like cocaine, society has overlooked the very phenomenon of drug use itself. They view with increasing alarm the availability of illegal substances including cocaine, marijuana, heroin, LSD, angel dust and the nonmedical use of tranquilizers, Quaaludes and diet pills. And they are deeply concerned over what they regard as a wide variety of subtle or hidden costs that result from the pervasiveness of drug use and its consequent ''acceptability.'' These experts see the effects of such substances in tragic indicators like emergencyroom statistics and automobile-accident rates, and insist that there are equally important costs in the workplace, schools and family life. Others say, however, that the long-term social effects are not entirely clear. They contend that most people now using drugs have successfully integrated them into their lives to help cope with stress, and that the overall results may not necessarily prove harmful to society. These authorities, while deploring the misuse, say that people's sophistication about the dangers inherent in different drugs is increasing. An alarmist view cannot be supported, they contend, by recent Federal statistics. These studies show either a decline or a stabilization among American youth in the use of most types of drugs. All seem to agree that there is now a basic paradox in social attitudes toward drugs. ''Society is giving all of us a double message,'' said Dr. Robert E. Gould, professor of psychiatry and associate director of the family life division of New York Medical College. ''On the one hand, we are told, 'Don't take illegal drugs.' At the same time, this is a drug-taking culture and a drug-encouraging culture. Look in anyone's medicine chest and see how many drugs Americans rely on. Drug-taking is often portrayed in the media as glamorous and chic. And the message the commercials give is: If you have a problem, take a pill.'' Dependence on Chemistry Seen Dr. Gould does not suggest that taking aspirin is the same as taking heroin. ''But the cumulative effect of these messages is,'' he said, ''that you won't have to suffer, chemistry can give you an answer, the route that drugs offers is the easiest way to get out of anxiety. It focuses on instant gratification, and not on solving the underlying problems.'' The substances available in this $90 billion-a-year marketplace have become so diverse, and some so new, that even the experts cannot keep track of them all. ''The selection in the delicatessen of drugs is much greater than it's ever been,'' said Dr. M. Duncan Stanton, director of research for the Addicts and Families Program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Philadelphia Child Guidance Center. He conducted a nine-year study of hard-drug users. In some respects, wholesale access to drugs is a situation with little cultural precedent. ''Most societies since the beginning of time have had intoxicants and integrated them into rites of passage like weddings or celebrations,'' said Dr. Robert B. Millman, director of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Service at the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic in New York. ''But these societies were using the one or two substances endemic to that area,'' he said, citing alcohol as an example. ''Most people didn't get into trouble with these substances - they were integrated into the society, in the sense that people knew how to control them. ''The ominous thing about the present-day Western culture is that we have access to all intoxicants from all societies, and we don't know how to control them. This can be very dangerous to those who are at risk: the young, the psychologically disturbed and the disadvantaged.'' 'You Can Get Anything You Want' That availability cuts across age, class, professional and geographic distinctions. ''You can get anything you want, anywhere,'' said 15-year-old Eileen Otero, who grew up in Queens and Manhattan, and now attends a parochial high school on Manhattan's East Side. ''Drugs are all over. I never go a day without someone offering me weed.'' Availability is no doubt a key factor in widespread use. In the general population, the increase in use of illegal drugs has been dramatic in the last two decades. In 1962, less than 4 percent of the population had ever used an illegal drug. Two decades later, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 33 percent of Americans age 12 and older reported having used marijuana, hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin or psychotherapeutic drugs for nonmedical purposes at some time. The increase in cocaine use, particularly, has been substantial, doubling among those over age 26 in the three-year period from 1979 to 1982. The 1982 survey was based on 5,624 Americans living in households at a fixed residence and is projected on national census figures. Sixty-four percent of American young people have tried an illegal drug before they finish high school, and more than a third have used drugs other than marijuana, according to another 1982 National Institute study. The research showed that 59 percent of the seniors had tried marijuana, 16 percent had tried cocaine, 10 percent had tried LSD and 1 percent had tried heroin. Nearly all young people, 93 percent, had tried alcohol. The high use of alcohol among young people is, of course, not a new phenomenon in America, but its use in conjunction with drugs is regarded as a growing problem. Parallel With Alcohol Some observers say the overall statistics themselves illustrate the new level of social tolerance and are not overly concerned. R. Keith Stroup founded the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in 1970, and is now a lawyer practicing in Washington. ''I think marijuana gained respectability as the people who smoked it gained respectability,'' he said. ''The great number of middleclass recreational drug users use them like their parents used alcohol.'' But many of those who treat the casualties of this quiet transformation are worried about its effects. ''The culture just isn't seriously looking at soft or recreational drug use as a health problem,'' said Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, a psychiatrist who is president of Phoenix House in Manhattan, the nation's largest private drug-treatment program. ''Everyone wants to talk about the newest drug - cocaine or Valium or angel dust. And what that ignores is that the culture just naturally takes for granted that there will be a new drug.'' Dr. Rosenthal believes that drug abuse is an insufficiently recognized factor in the national statistics on suicide, auto and other accidents, plane crashes, mental breakdowns, work-related problems, truancy and teen-age pregnancies. Since the role of drugs is usually ignored in tallying such statistics, it is difficult to measure precisely. Link to Accidents Tabulated However, 6 percent of those in New York State, 729,000 people, it is estimated, had in the last six months driven an automobile while feeling the effects of drugs, according to the most recent study of drug use among state residents. It is estimated that 58,000 New Yorkers reported having automobile accidents while driving under the influence of drugs. The study, a 1981 survey of 3,500 New Yorkers residing in households, was conducted by the state's Division of Substance Abuse Services. As a result of using drugs, the study showed, an estimated 618,000 state residents experienced problems in work or school, 565,000 experienced problems with family and friends, and 443,000 experienced health problems. The researchers reported that residents with household incomes of $50,000 or more had the highest drug use in the state, and 6 percent, an estimated 51,000, of these residents were considered to be serious abusers. In specific incidents, drug abuse has caused everything from snowmobile accidents to drownings. ''The only subgroup in our society that has showed an increase in mortality rates is our adolescents,'' said Dr. William Pollin, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ''That trend is also true for accidents, homicides and suicides, and many of those trends may be related to drug and alcohol use.'' Though drug use among the nation's youth has generally declined, he said, ''We are still the country with a higher level of drug use among young people than any other country in the world.'' In the workplace, drug use is reported to have been directly involved in everything from train wrecks by marijuana-smoking engineers to the arrests of nuclear power-plant guards by the Oregon State police for using marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and LSD. Cost to Employer Estimated Industry studies have estimated that drug or alcohol abuse costs an employer at least 25 percent of a worker's salary in loss of productivity, poor attendance and increased medical benefits. The economic, social, health and crime-related losses caused by drug abuse in a single year have been placed at $10 billion to $20 billion, according to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Associations. Among professionals, doctors have traditionally been singled out for abuse problems because of their easy access to drugs. But the problem exists among other professional groups as well. ''This is in every way a conservative community,'' said a highly placed court administrator in a major Middle Western state who requested anonymity. ''But I know prosecutors who regularly prosecute marijuana cases and smoke pot at the same time.'' She said that although the stresses of their trade had long made trial lawyers vulnerable to alcohol abuse, younger lawyers were combining alcohol with other drugs. ''Don't imply from what I'm saying that it's just lawyers,'' she continued. ''Lots of cocaine is used and sold by other professionals in this town. ''One sitting criminal court judge,'' she said, ''who has a reputation as a tough sentencer in cases involving possession of cocaine and heroin, once lectured me about how provincial I was about not using cocaine myself. He told me I should grow up.'' In other words, that she should have used cocaine, as he had. ''What really bothers me is the hypocrisy of it,'' she continued. ''Sentencing people to the terrible prisons we have in our state for things the prosecutors are doing themselves.'' Persistent Problem in Military For another large employer, the military, drug use has been a matter of concern since the Vietnam War, and is a persistent problem. According to a 1981 study by the House Select Committee on Drug Abuse, two thirds of the sailors on the aircraft carrier Forrestal, including the men who launch F-14 jet fighters, regularly used marijuana and pep pills to relieve the fatigue of working 16-@ and 18-hour days. Assertions about the effects of drugs in the workplace are often simplistic, said Dr. John C. Kramer, who, in the Nixon Administration, was an associate director of the White House Special Action Office for Drug Abuse and Prevention. ''People tend to forget that lots of jobs are very boring,'' said Dr. Kramer, a psychiatrist who is an associate professor at the University of California at Irvine. ''For a carpenter who has to hit the same kind of nail in the same spot on the same pieces of wood all day, marijuana may be the only thing that makes his hammering seem new.'' Perhaps the least statistically measurable hidden cost is the effect of drug abuse on American families. ''Unquestionably there is a cost in family life,'' said Dr. Kramer. ''In all family problems, ordinary conflicts can be exaggerated when an individual is using drugs.'' Weakening of Parents Seen Dr. Stanton of the University of Pennsylvania says changes in the structure and transience of American families have increased their vulnerability to drug abuse and other problems. ''Social, economic and cultural changes have altered family patterns, taken supports away from parents and weakened them,'' he said. ''It has blurred the difference between parents and kids.'' Such abstract social trends are evident in the real-life experience of one family. ''My drug use forced the family to confront many issues that were not out in the open,'' said 18-year-old Debbie Marks, a New York University freshman who lives in Manhattan. She started smoking marijuana and drinking in the seventh grade, after her parents' divorce. By the age of 16, she was finishing a bottle of Jack Daniels every night, and was experimenting with LSD during the day, having tried everything else but heroin. In 1981, she entered a treatment program at Phoenix House and, after a four-month battle with her multiple addictions, has been drug-free for 14 months since. ''I was very naive,'' said Mrs. Marks. In Debbie's treatment, Mrs. Marks joined family-therapy sessions with her 20-year-old son Scott, and with her former husband, Sam, and his wife, Bonnie, and with Debbie. ''I think that parents have to take over and be parents again,'' she said. ''When I was growing up, my parents said no and that was it - but I wanted my children to be my friends. And that was wrong.'' Dr. Pollin of the National Institute on Drug Abuse says one should remember that social toleration of some drugs is not necessarily the same as approval. ''There is much less shock value now involved in, say, seeing someone smoking a joint or using coke,'' he explained. ''But there has also been a trend countering that: the steady and accelerating passage of legislation banning head shops, which has been a grass-roots movement.'' Closing of Shops Sought In many communities across the country, antimarijuana organizations have attempted to shut down paraphernalia outlets, efforts that have paralleled the attempt to get drunken drivers off the road. The backlash against drugs has included a network of parent-initiatated support groups, drug-information meetings and drug-treatment-referral networks. Dr. Pollin believes that drug use as a phenomenon peaked between 1977 and 79. In his oranization's student surveys, the 1982 results showed a drop from 1981 in the number of high-school seniors who used marijuana daily, monthly or had used it in the last year. And daily use of marijuana among high-school seniors declined for the fourth successive year, from 10.7 percent in 1978 to 6.3 percent in 1982. ''It may be, as some have speculated, that our young people are beginning to heed the Government's health messages,'' said Dr. Ira Cisin, professor of sociology at George Washington University, who directs the Federal agency's national survey of Americans in households. ''We do not know whether the downturn in marijuana use reflects a temporary economic slump or a continuing shift to more conservative behavior.'' Change Is Related to Age In contrast, though, among those over age 26, the use of cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens and stimulants reported in the study is rising, though not dramatically, save in the case of cocaine. In addition, the number of emergency-room visits and deaths involving drug abuse have increased among those age 30 to 39, unlike the patterns for younger age groups. According to reports from the agency's national Drug Abuse Warning Network, there was a doubling of reports involving cocaine from 1979 to 81, the most recent statistics available; and there was a sharp increase, from 1,910 to 3,479, of reports involving heroin. Dr. Pollin and a number of other experts attribute the contradictions between declining drug use among the young and rising drug use among older groups to the lingering effects of the 60'sgeneration culture on the rest of society. ''The flower children of the 60's are now approaching middle age and they are bringing with them the residue of habits formed in earlier years,'' said Dr. Cisin. Not everyone accepts that view, however. ''I don't have the sense that we can attribute this to a group with a specific problem that is wending its way through the age pyramid, and then the problem comes to an end,'' said Dr. Jessor. ''It seems unlikely that the drug problem is going to 'age itself out' of the population - that's rather wishful. Looking at it from the larger culture, drug use in general is an institutionalized phenomenon.'' He Sees Process of Integration Whether or not drug use has reached that status yet, Dr. Zinberg of Harvard says a number of illegal drugs are undergoing a process of societal integration. ''Of course it poses problems for those who are vulnerable to abusing these drugs,'' he said, ''but a lot of the use has developed into what I call controlled usage. ''Most of these drugs are introduced with a bang,'' he continued, ''and they are greeted with enormous hysteria. The process is not complete, but the large majority of people know how to control them. Hysteria has been replaced by a knowledge of the boundaries of these drugs.'' Some drugs are much harder to control than others, he said. ''I'm not happy about the extreme availability of cocaine,'' said Dr. Zinberg. ''We can reduce trafficking by making it prohibitively difficult for people to try it,'' said Francis M. Mullen, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Dr. Kramer agrees that it is necessary to control the availability of illegal drugs, but he says that to expect their elimination is unrealistic in an open society. ''As the stringency of controls increases,'' he said, ''the social problems associated with the control of drug use become greater and greater. So, as you lengthen sentences and tighten up, you get more problems involving black markets and organized crime, and you get more invasion of privacy and fundamental liberties.'' Sees It as Task in Growing Up Dr. Jessor of the University of Colorado says coping with the presence of drugs may have become a kind of rite of passage for young people. ''It may now be a developmental task that young people need to come to terms with,'' he said, ''like separation from parents, career development, and sexuality. And so we ought to focus on education and provide the kinds of information and skills for the least irresponsible use of these substances.'' Dr. Pollin offered a final, disquieting note on the future of the nation's drug culture: ''The laboratories that produce ever-more potent psychoactive drugs are going to continue their efforts. The number of drugs out a decade from now will be twice as great as they were 10 years ago. The problem will never go away. It will be more complex.'' --- Next: The biological and psychological effects of illicit drugs now widely available.

854-> ABROAD AT HOME; THE LIMITS OF FORCE
At this time a year ago Israel was winding up its war in Lebanon, claiming major political as well as military victories. The P.L.O. had been defeated in battle and Syria humiliated. With that, it was said, there would be a ''stable, sovereign Lebanon'' - a Lebanon at peace with Israel. The words ring with irony now. There is no stability in Lebanon. Its Government is effectively sovereign only in and around Beirut, not including the airport. There is no peace, and relations with Israel are an agitating factor in the country's murderous political divisions. There was a small incident the other day that showed how distant reality is from the visions of a year ago. Israel's Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, appeared in Beirut and was feted by the Phalangist Christian militia. The Prime Minister of Lebanon, Shafik al-Wazzan, threatened to resign in protest. To calm him, President Amin Gemayel, himself the leader of the Phalange, criticized the Phalangists and asked the Cabinet to ''condemn the Arens visit.'' The Lebanese adventure has gone wrong for Israel in many different ways. For the people of Israel the worst miscalculation has proved to be the human cost. More than 500 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Lebanon so far, and the casualties continue. That is a direct result of expanding the invasion beyond the stated original objective of clearing the P.L.O. from a 30-mile strip in southern Lebanon - an objective that was achieved in a week, with few Israeli casualties. A major gain claimed for Israel in the war - and for the United States - was the showing up of Soviet weapons. Syria's Soviet-made aircraft and antiaircraft missiles were simply overwhelmed. Syria had been significantly weakened, it was said, and Soviet influence set back in the whole region. The result has been to the contrary. The Russians have made an extraordinary effort to rearm Syria, pouring in new weapons and advisers. That demonstration of commitment and resources has no doubt impressed the Arab world. Syria, with its arms restored, is taking an aggressive political line in Lebanon and exercising greater influence on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. In Lebanon itself the Israeli invasion removed one large cause of political trouble: the P.L.O. state-within- a-state. But the myriad other conflicts of sect and tribe that afflict the country were not resolved and in some cases may have been aggravated. For example, the Shuf mountain region above Beirut escaped the worst of Lebanon's civil warfare over the years. There was an arcane system of understandings there between the Druse sect and the Maronite Christians. It was upset when Israeli forces came in, and what will happen when they leave? The recent Druse shelling of Beirut airport was a pre-emptive show of force. The division of Lebanon, with its complicated hatreds and private armies, is of course not to be blamed on Israel. But the assertion of a year ago that the invasion would help end all that has proved fatuous. The country is nearer total partition than ever. When there seemed to be a chance for a Lebanon free of foreign armies, when the Israeli-Lebanese withdrawal agreement was signed, Syria said no. That disappointed many, including the United States Government. But in truth there never was any chance that Syria would say yes to an agreement that to a significant extent detached Lebanon from the Arab world - and did so without a settlement of Syrian-Israeli issues. Israel rightly yearns for a peace treaty with Lebanon as with Egypt. But what the last year has shown is that such a peace is not obtainable by force. An opposition member of the Knesset, Amnon Rubinstein, said the Government had not understood the limits of force in politics. ''An insensitivity to political facts,'' he said, ''blinded the government and resulted in the fiasco of the war in Lebanon.'' In Israel there were and are deep divisions over what is called a ''war of choice'' - not of necessity. The phenomenon of war resistance appeared for the first time, with some reservists refusing to serve in Lebanon. Now the economic costs are beginning to be felt. There are concerns about the moral responsibilities taken on by Israel: for one, the fate of thousands of Palestinian refugees now without other protection in Lebanon. The doubts in Israel are not, I think, matched among Israel's supporters in this country. They waivered when the bombs fell on Beirut, but now many seem to resent any expression of doubt about the Begin Government's course in Lebanon. And that is so even though Prime Minister Begin himself reportedly is suffering from doubts. The immediate excuse for the invasion in June 1982 was an assassination attempt by a Palestinian splinter group on the Israeli Ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. Last month Mr. Argov, recovering from his wounds, spoke out about the war. ''Those who brought it upon us,'' he said, ''should have thought more than twice about the price, especially in human life. The Lebanon war is an unsuccessful war, and the people of Israel came out weakened by it.''

855-> Virginia and Missouri to Play in Jersey
Ralph Sampson has played at his best in nationally televised games for two reasons, according to Virginia's coach, Terry Holland: - The opposing team is always one of the nation's leading teams and more likely to have players good enough to play the 7-foot-4-inch Sampson man-for-man. This gives him more leeway to maneuver. - Any athlete or team plays best when facing another team or player of equal caliber. ''And Ralph has never backed down from a challenge,'' Holland said. Sampson will face a strong challenge Sunday in another nationally televised game on CBS against Missouri at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. Far from Atlantic Coast or Big Eight Conference territory, this game is being played for revenue and exposure and starts at 3:45 P.M. Women's Teams Also Play The Rutgers women's team, ranked No. 13 in the nation, will play Virginia in the first game, starting at 1:15 P.M. The result of the men's game will have no bearing on either team's chances to reach the N.C.A.A. tournament next month. Missouri (21-4) leads the Big Eight. Virginia (20-3) is in second place in the A.C.C. behind North Carolina. Both are ranked among the top dozen teams in the nation. Norm Stewart, the Missouri coach, would not say what player would get the burden of guarding Sampson, although Missouri is also blessed with a big man, the 6-11 Steve Stipanovich. Both Sampson and Stipanovich are seniors and not easily intimidated. Holland said: ''The only time Ralph did not have an excellent game on national TV was against North Carolina at Charlottesville. Every other time he was exceptional.'' Actually, Sampson, the player of the year for the last two seasons, had 17 points and 12 rebounds in that North Carolina game but Virginia was beaten, 101-95, last Jan. 15. Excellence on Television In other nationally televised games during his career, Sampson had 40 points and 16 rebounds in an 89-73 victory over Ohio State as a sophomore; 26 points and 10 rebounds in a 74-56 victory over Louisville in January 1982, and 35 points and 12 rebounds rebounds in a 98-81 victory over Louisville last Jan. 29. ''When we play against the better teams they try to guard against Sampson head up as opposed to teams totally outmanned,'' Holland said. ''Those outmanned teams tend to gang up on Sampson with two, three or more. Most of Ralph's low-scoring games have come when we were completely in control.'' Stipanovich was injured two years ago when a pistol he was holding accidentally discharged. The bullet grazed his flesh, and Stipanovich did not miss a game. Missouri Avoids the Zone Stipanovich leads Missouri with an average of more than 19 points a game. If Virginia and Sampson can limit him, there is Jon Sundvold, a 6-2 guard, who hits from just about anywhere. Missouri will probably play Virginia man-to-man because, according to Stewart, ''we haven't played 30 seconds of zone defense this season. Things might be disguised a little, but the only time we would play zone would be if the players did it themselves, by mistake.'' Virginia has been playing most of its recent games with a 3-point shot line and a 30-second shot clock because the A.C.C. is experimenting with these rules this season. The Big Eight, which experimented with a shot clock for three seasons during the 1970's, is not using a shot clock or a 3-point line this season. The Missouri-Virginia game will not have a shot clock or 3-point arc and will be played under normal college rules that will be used in the N.C.A.A. tournament next month.

856-> Advertising; Parker Pen Job Widens For Ogilvy
THE Parker Pen Company, which last summer moved the responsibility for its domestic advertising and some of its Far East advertising to Ogilvy & Mather, last week threw in the rest of the non-Communist world. That increases the company's billings and its distributors' billings in this agency from $5 million to about $20 million. But more important, it will pull together advertising responsibility that had been handled by the 34 different agencies retained by 22 Parker subsidiaries or distributors. Each was creating its own advertising with its own look, message and direction. ''And that doesn't help in this shrinking world,'' said Manville Smith, for almost a year the president of Parker's writing-instrument division. Not many ad agencies are equipped to handle such a consolidated assignment, but Ogilvy, as the third largest truly international agency, is more than ready. With its Chicago office serving as command center and with London, Singapore and one of the Brazilian offices serving as regional headquarters, it will serve Parker in 154 countries through 38 agency offices, according to Henry P. Bernhard, vice chairman of Ogilvy's domestic operation and head of the Chicago office. He thinks the assignment may set a record for the number of countries in which a single agency is serving one client. Ogilvy has American Express in 27 countries, General Foods and Unilever in 25, Shell in 19, Beecham in 17 and Mattel in 13. James R. Peterson, Parker's president and chief executive officer since January 1982, has already consolidated international manfacturing from eight countries to two - the United States and Britain. Parker has been selling pens abroad since 1902 and, indeed, is a bigger factor in the writing instrument market in Europe than in the United States. On the Continent and in the Near East, Mr. Bernhard said, outward signs of affluence such as expensive pens and watches are important accessories. Over there, market sorces say, Parker has a 20 to 25 percent share of the market, which it used to be able to match in the United States as well. However, it's down in the neighborhood of 2 percent now, following the huge success of Bic and Gillette's Papermate. Mr. Smith calls them ''the sticks.'' His company doesn't sell any pens for less than $2. It has fountain pens for as much as $500, but its workhorse is the Jotter, called ''the mule'' around corporate headquarters. Over the years Parker has sold 500 million of them. The first worldwide campaign is due next fall, and for the first time Parker's advertising will have a common graphic look and creative strategy. And the message will probably have to do with how well Parker pens write, since that, according to consumer research, is what the consumer most wants to hear.

857-> B.A. DEGREE WORTH $329,000 IN EARNINGS
A bachelor's degree is worth $329,000 in extra lifetime earnings for today's young men and $142,000 for women, the Census Bureau reported today. The study said an 18-year-old man with a bachelor's degree could expect lifetime earnings of $1,190,000, compared with earnings of $861,000 for a person with a high school diploma. Earnings for a man who did not complete high school would be $601,000. A woman at the age of 18 can expect earnings from $381,000, with a high school diploma, to $523,000, with a bachelor's degree. Without high school, she would expect to earn $211,000. The earnings were given in terms of 1981 dollars and were calculated by using surveys of income for 1979, 1980 and 1981. 'Improper to Compare Estimates' Bruce Chapman, the Director of the Bureau of the Census, said it was difficult to compare figures for men and women. ''It is improper,'' he said, ''to compare the estimates for men and women without accounting for the significant differences in amount and continuity of previous work experience and in other important characteristics between men and women.'' There are ''lots and lots'' of reasons for the difference between the earnings of men and women, said the author of the report, John F. Coder, chief of Current Income Statistics for the bureau. Time in the work force and generally lower pay are the most important reasons women earn less, Mr. Coder said. He said the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the average man worked 38 years, compared with 28 for women. Effects of Taking Breaks The study found that women with a two- to-four year break in work averaged 13 percent lower annual earnings, and those who had taken five years off had 19 percent less. Larger effects were recorded in men's earnings. A 21 percent reduction in pay was found if the break was two to four years, and 29 percent for five years or more. Mr. Chapman said statistics were not available to calculate how many women took time off to have children. Mr. Coder's report said the effect of salary discrimination could not be determined. He said income statistics between men and women should only be compared for people with the same educational backgrounds, occupations and experience. The figures in the study include all individuals, whether working full- or part-time or not at all.

858-> AROUND THE NATION; Workers Told to Reject Airline's 'Final' Offer
Eastern Airlines' offer of a 32 percent pay raise by November 1984 to avert a strike by its 13,500 machinists is ''final,'' the company's president, Frank Borman, said today. But union leaders told workers to reject Eastern's proposal. Bargaining almost nonstop for six days, representatives for Eastern and National news is on pages A11-13, B5-8 and D12. the International Association of Machinists hammered out a two-and-ahalf year contract to be voted on Friday by the airline's mechanics, baggage crews and ground personnel. Although Charles Bryan, the District 100 president, backed off from calling the strike the union had threatened for this morning, he said he was angry that Eastern's offer did not include retroactive pay increases for 1982, when union members worked without a contract. Mr. Borman said Eastern could not afford a retroactive increase.

860-> COMMODITIES; Silver in Sharp Gain; Gold Rallies in London
Silver prices advanced sharply in New York yesterday after displaying strength earlier in London where a rumor that President Reagan had died caused heavy selling of gold bullion. However, the London gold market recovered after the White House issued an official denial. But the fact that London silver prices held up despite the decline in gold impressed traders in New York when the Commodity Exchange opened later in the day, said Howard Levine, precious-metals specialist at ACLI International Commodity Services Inc. When the Comex closed, spot silver futures, which expire April 26, were up 45.2 cents an ounce, to $11.872, while the more active near May contract rose 45 cents, to $11.91. ''Aside from the bizarre rumor in London, the silver market has been performing better than gold for several weeks,'' Mr. Levine said. ''There seem to be big blocks of gold on offer in the $436 to $438 range. This has been a check on gold, but not on silver.'' Silver More Volatile Whether these blocks of gold overhanging the market represent sell orders from central banks, the Middle East or the Soviet Union could not be ascertained. But silver tends to be more volatile than gold because of the larger number of small speculators who participate in the silver market, Mr. Levine added. Charles R. Stahl, editor and publisher of Green's Commodity Market Comments in Princeton, N.J., which specializes in precious metals, said that a major reason for silver's recent strength is the possibility that the Soviet Union has resumed buying small quantities of silver from British and Swiss dealers. In 1982, Moscow reportedly imported 10 million ounces of silver. The metal, which the Soviet Union does not produce in large quantities, has become increasingly important to it, Mr. Stahl said. ''However, Moscow has been known to buy silver just before it sells gold, he added. ''Why? Silver tends to lead the precious metals, and if they buy even a small amount of it, chances are the gold market will move up and they will get a better price for their bullion. In any event, the next upper chart barrier for silver is $12.60 to $13, which, if reached, should provoke another bout of heavy profit taking before the metal resumes its advance.'' Martin M. McNeill, senior vice president at Sinclair Securities Inc., offered another view of silver's behavior yesterday. ''Prices of Treasury bills and bonds hit new highs for the current move today and that was good news for the precious metals because it meant that yields on competitive investment were down.'' Mr. McNeill also said that when the May silver futures contract broke through its old upward chart ceiling of $11.56 on the Comex, ''the buyers, domestic and foreign, really jumped in, but I hope they didn't overdo it again.'' The last major advance in silver lifted the price from just under $6 an ounce last June 21 to a high of $15 late in February, when huge waves of profit taking slashed the price to nearly $10 within two weeks.

Bill Walton, the 30-year-old San Diego Clippers center who has been playing full time since Jan. 15, says he may have to go back to parttime play. He does not plan to be in today's game against the Kings in Kansas City. Walton, who played 34 minutes against San Antonio Friday night, scoring 18 points and grabbing eight rebounds, felt soreness in his right ankle for the second time in a week. He had to quit playing in 1980 because of recurring stress fractures in his left foot. Surgery allowed him to return this year. ''There's a point on his ankle that did not have fluid,'' said Paul Silas, the San Diego coach. ''We might have to modify his schedule. I told him I wanted him to take it slowly.''

The six, including one killed by police gunfire, were slain in clashes in the districts of Dibrugarh and Sibsagar, the United News of India reported. At least 1,700 people have been killed in Assam since January in violence that followed a demand by Assamese natives that settlers from Bangladesh be expelled. Anti-Government Assamese protesters attacked Government offices, police posts and trains in some areas, state officials said today.

864-> 'BRIGHTON BEACH' HONORED BY CRITICS
Neil Simon's ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' was named best new play of the 1982-83 season by the New York Drama Critics Circle at a meeting held yesterday at the Algonquin Hotel. David Hare's ''Plenty'' was voted the best foreign play, and ''Little Shop of Horrors'' was selected as best musical. A special citation was voted to the Young Playwrights Festival, as sponsored by the Dramatists Guild at the Circle Repertory Company. The winners will be honored on Monday, when a check for $1,000, given annually by Lucille Lortel, will be presented to Mr. Simon. ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' now playing at the Alvin Theater, was named on the fourth ballot after a heated discussion and a split vote. On this final, weighted ballot of the 16 members of the Circle present and voting, ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' received 25 points, the exact number necessary to be named winner, to 23 for Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother'' and 11 for ''Plenty.'' In a weighted ballot, three points are given for a critic's first choice, two for his second and one for his third. On the final weighted ballot, in order to prevent any competitors from gaining on ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' Clive Barnes of The New York Post named ''Moose Murders'' as his second choice and T.E. Kalem of Time magazine chose ''Moose Murders'' and ''Private Lives'' as his second and third selections. Both ''Moose Murders'' and ''Private Lives'' received some of the most negative reviews of the season. Some Others Mentioned ''Plenty'' was third in the weighted voting with 11 points. On the first ballot, including proxy votes from absent critics, the score was ''Brighton Beach,'' six; '' 'Night, Mother'' and ''Plenty'' three each; Tina Howe's ''Painting Churches,'' two; and single votes for Peter Nichols's ''Passion,'' Caryl Churchill's ''Top Girls,'' Simon Gray's ''Quartermaine's Terms'' and Lanford Wilson's ''Angels Fall,'' with one abstention. ''Plenty'' was named best foreign play on the second ballot, with 28 points, to 23 for ''Quartermaine's Terms,'' 22 for ''Top Girls'' and 13 for ''Passion.'' On the first ballot, ''Plenty'' received eight votes, with five for ''Quartermaine's Terms,'' four for ''Top Girls'' and one for ''Passion.'' Produced by Joseph Papp, ''Plenty'' ran on Broadway earlier this season. ''Little Shop of Horrors,'' with music by Alan Menken and book and lyrics by Howard Ashman, was first produced the WPA Theater and is now running at the Orpheum. On the initial ballot it tied with Andrew Lloyd-Webber's ''Cats,'' with six votes for each show, and one vote for ''My One and Only,'' with five critics abstaining. Revoting, the critics made the score 10 for ''Little Shop'' and five for ''Cats.'' This is the first time in three years that the Circle has named a best musical. The meeting was conducted by the Circle's president, Edwin Wilson of The Wall Street Journal. Other voting members were Clive Barnes and Marilyn Stasio, The New York Post; John Beaufort, The Christian Science Monitor; Glenn Currie, United Press International; Michael Feingold and Julius Novick, The Village Voice; Mel Gussow and Frank Rich, The New York Times; Richard Hummler, Variety; T.E.

866-> FUTILE WAIT IN CALIFORNIA FOR END OF MARS SILENCE
The antenna out in the Mojave Desert of California, at Goldstone, listened in on Mars yesterday, with its attendants hoping against hope to hear something from Chryse Planitia. There, on the cold, rusty-red plain, the Plain of Gold, sat the Viking 1 lander where it had put down in July 1976 and had regularly transmitted photographs and weather reports until last November, when inexplicably it went silent. Flight controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., had made repeated attempts through the antenna to get the attention of the Viking. The craft neither acknowledged the new commands nor made its normal weekly reports. In time the squat, buglike lander, which had been the last of four operating vehicles in the Viking project of Mars exploration, was all but given up for dead. There remained, however, a glimmering of hope. Perhaps the craft was still alive but somehow unable to receive communications. Stored in Viking's computer were instructions for the craft to get in touch with its earthly masters if it did not hear from them for nine weeks. That time arrived yesterday at 1:03 P.M., Eastern daylight time. The craft was then to radio a message of scientific and engineering data. Waited for an Hour As the Earth rotated into position, the 210-foot antenna turned toward Mars, now 230 million miles away. The flight controllers sat at their consoles in Pasadena, waiting for the message. They waited for an hour. There was no message from Mars. The Viking 1 lander, the first working craft to reach the surface of another planet, had conducted the first on-the-scene search for life on Mars, with inconclusive results, probed the planet's soil chemistry and monitored its seasons of cold and colder weather. Its camera, scientific instruments and radio operated for 2,234 Martian days -six years and 108 Earth days. And now, still silent after more than five months, the craft was presumed dead. ''We listened and listened and listened, and no joy,'' Don Bane, a spokesman for the laboratory, said by telephone from the control center. George Gianopulos, the project manager, said, ''It's like losing an old friend. How do you express it?'' Mr. Gianopulos said that two more attempts would be made to restore communications with the Viking by commanding it to switch to different components of its transmitter. The next attempt will be made May 13. Mr. Bane said the engineers were ''not optimistic, but are going through the exercise to make sure.'' The engineers were not sure what happened to the Viking and were not sure they would ever know. Its batteries may have run low. Some electronic components may have failed. Whatever happened, barring an unexpected resurrection, it marked the end of the $1-billion Viking Project, the most ambitious effort to explore Mars. Launched in Summer of 1975 Two identical spacecraft were launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in the summer of 1975. Each consisted of an orbiter and a lander. Viking 1 arrived at Mars on June 19, 1976 and sent its lander down to the surface on July 20. Viking 2 arrived at Mars on Aug. 7 and made its landing on Sept. 3, on a more northerly plain. The two orbiters, each with two cameras and other sensing equipment, completed and elaborated on the mapping of the entire planet that was begun by Mariner 9 in 1971. They gave scientists a comprehensive view of the advancing and retreating glaciers of the Martian polar regions, the global dust storms and the rugged terrain of canyons, plains and towering extinct volcanoes. The last of the working orbiters ran out of gas for its steering rockets in 1980. The Viking 2 lander, which touched down on Utopia Planitia, the Utopian Plains, transmitted its last data on April 11, 1980. It was the apparent victim of dying batteries. In the first three months the two landers operated, they concentrated on the business of scooping up soil and running the samples through a set of three onboard chemical laboratories. Scientists were searching for evidence of living organisms and organic molecules on the dry Martian surface. The question of life on Mars, according to project biologiests, remains an open one. In other words, the tests did not find life or rule it out. Afterward, the landers settled down to a routine of sending the Martian weather report every week, or whenever requested by the controllers at Pasadena. They photographed frosts on the surround red rocks. They noted that Martian weather runs to the uniform and dull. At the Viking 1 site temperatures ranged from summertime highs of minus 24 degrees Fahrenheit to wintertime lows of minus 191 degrees. Winds turned out to be gentler than expected, with gusts of the rarefied carbon-dioxide atmosphere never exceeding 74 miles an hour. Over the last few years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration spent about $150,000 to $200,000 annually to maintain this last of its working outposts on the other planets, the Viking 1 on the Plain of Gold. Engineers had hoped to keep hearing from the Viking into the 1990's. But there was no message from Mars yesterday, and with the sharp cutbacks in the American program of planetary exploration, the prospects for further contact are not bright.

867-> NEW TEAM AT E.P.A. TO BE GIVEN TIME TO MAKE PROGRESS
The Reagan Administration has decided to give the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and her new management team time to improve the agency's performance before taking further action, a White House official said today. Craig Fuller, secretary to President Reagan's Cabinet, reported the decision in response to questions about the possibility of naming an outside consultant to conduct a management study of the E.P.A. The agency has been the subject in recent weeks of allegations of mismanagement and suspicions of political manipulation and is under investigation by the Justice Department and several Congressional committees. On Friday, a senior White House official said the President was considering the appointment of David F. Linowes, a professor at the University of Illinois, to head a special committee that might recommend changes in the agency's organization and management approach. Today, Mr. Fuller said the Administration had decided not to ask Mr. Linowes to make the study. Considered but Rejected ''Early in our discussions, with respect to strengthening the situation at the E.P.A., we considered a commission and talked to Mr. Linowes,'' Mr. Fuller said. ''We have rejected that idea at the present time.'' Instead, Mr. Fuller said, Anne McGill Burford, the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, will first be given a chance to work with a new group of five top assistants on the problems that the agency faces. President Reagan named the five new officials last week in a major reshuffling of responsibility at the agency. Lee M. Thomas, an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was named to replace Rita M. Lavelle as assistant administrator in charge of the national program to clean up toxic wastes, the program that has been the target of much of the controversy surrounding the agency. Miss Lavelle, who has since told a Congressional committee that the agency was split by internal rivalries and lacked strong management, was discharged Feb. 7 after she refused to resign at the request of Mrs. Burford, who was known as Anne M. Gorsuch before her recent marriage. Charles Dempsey was named inspector general and Alfred M. Zuck was promoted to assistant administrator for administration, both of them replacing officials who had been forced to resign. Other new appointments were Courtney Riordan as acting assistant administrator for legislation and Lee Verstandig as acting assistant administrator for legislation. These appointments were meant to give the agency a ''fresh new start,'' and ''to improve the management capacity of the agency,'' the White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said at the time. Mr. Linowes, the Boeschenstein Professor of Political Economy and Public Policy at the University of Illinois, recently headed a commission studying the Interior Department's oil royalty program. According to the White House official who had suggested that Mr. Linowes's appointment to study the E.P.A. was under consideration, the professor did a ''first-rate job'' of looking into that program and recommending management reforms. Earlier, Mr. Linowes was chairman of the United States Privacy Protection Commission.

871-> BALLET: 'EPISODES' REVIVED
THE re-entry of George Balanchine's ''Episodes'' into the New York City Ballet repertory after an absence of four years is cause for rejoicing. Performed on Wednesday at the New York State Theater, it is a major work of 20th-century ballet - provocative in its astringency, strikingly beautiful, and a revelation of its Webern score. Choreographed in 1959 to orchestral pieces by Webern, this second half of a Balanchine-Martha Graham homage to the composer was a breakthrough work that owed little to the most astringent of Balanchine ballets preceding it. The choreographer has matched Webern's compression and symmetry in four dances - a solo originally performed by Paul Taylor is no longer part of the suite - that unfold against the music's dense atmosphere of sound. That atmosphere is made visible in metaphoric partnering in which the woman penetrates the medium created by her bending, encircling partner. It is possible to ''see'' the spare arrangements of notes in the manipulation of limbs, and to ''hear'' the tight-closed ranks of dancers in the first section, set to the Symphony (Op. 21), and the third section, set to the Concerto (Op. 24). Yet ballet classicism is preserved in this most avant-garde of dances, certainly a fit companion piece to what the world proclaims as ''modern'' dance. It is there in the momentum of the ballet and the clear continuity of body line, even (in the second section, a pas de deux set to the Five Pieces, Op. 10) when the woman's upended, livid legs seem to sprout from her partner's head, still causing nervous laughter from the audience. The resolution to this stark and sometimes shocking dance is in the closing section, set to and following the fugal mode of the Ricercata in six voices from Bach's ''Musical Offering.'' It clears the air with its pellucid, courtly and almost contemplative beauty. To applaud seemed an intrusion, so eloquently did Maria Calegari and Adam Luders dance it. But this was a memorable performance from the entire cast, headed by Kyra Nichols, new as a pliant cipher in the first section, Victor Castelli, Karin von Aroldingen and Mel Tomlinson - Mr. Tomlinson bringing a sense of mystery to the pas de deux -and Heather Watts and Bart Cook. Mr. Luders's passion and elegance as Merrill Ashley's Siegfried added glowing color to ''Swan Lake.'' Melinda Roy made an interestingly phrased and daring, if not especially fluid, debut in the ballet's Valse Bluette, with a velvety Lourdes Lopez leading the Pas de Neuf. Jerome Robbins's exciting new ''Glass Pieces'' completed the program, replacing ''Celebration,'' by Jacques d'Amboise, which has been rescheduled for June 1. Robert Irving conducted.

873-> Insilco to Sell Silver Interest
The Insilco Corporation has announced an agreement in principle to sell off its last remaining interest in silver, which was the company's only line when International Silver was formed in 1898. The International Silver consumer products division, which manufacturers and sells sterling silver and silverplated flatware, would be sold to Katy Industries of Elgin, Ill., under the agreement. Final approval is needed from directors of both companies. Last month, Insilco agreed to sell World Tableware International, the other half of its silver division, to the American Silver Company. Neither sales' terms have been disclosed. Insilco, which was called the International Silver Co. until 1946, now deals in products for the high-technology industries and specialty consumer markets. It has annual sales of more than $636 million.

874-> ART: ISAMU NOGUCHI AND HIS WORLD OF STONE
IF nature hadn't invented stone, Isamu Noguchi might have, so in touch does he seem with its dense essence. To be of Japanese blood is to have stone in the family, so to speak, and the 78-year-old sculptor has always worked with it, mostly in landscape arrangements and monumental structures. ''The whole world is made of stone. It is our fundament,'' he has written. ''When I tap it, I get an echo of that which we are.'' But several years ago, recovering from surgery for a spinal injury, he had to suspend his involvement with large-scale pieces. He turned to smaller stones he could work by hand: ''found'' rocks and ''practice'' boulders already invaded with power tools by his assistants. These playful, improvisatory works - sometimes very minimally altered from their original state of stonehood - first appeared in a Noguchi 75th-birthday show at the Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, three years ago. And now the gallery presents (through June 4) another group, some unadorned, some mounted in steel or rough-hewn wood. A stone, of course, is already a piece of sculpture, even more so when smoothed and shaped by such a consummate craftsman as the ocean. One could argue that nothing more need be done but admire nature's handiwork. Yet Mr. Noguchi is not one to leave a stone unturned. ''Clawing'' or scraping its surface at points, he produces textural shifts from matte to nubbly, and color changes from slaty black to warm buff to pale pebble gray, as in ''Shiva Rock,'' a small basalt megalith. Cutting, coring, boring and channeling, he penetrates the stone's interior by means of mysterious holes -as in the granite ''Worm Stone'' - or lays it open like a cut fruit. In the basalt ''Wounded Rock,'' he lets a big stone sit in majestic cracks, exuding a tension most unstonelike in its implications of mortality. And sometimes, to show the artist's mastery over nature, he imposes on the free, biomorphic form of a stone a constrasting construction of metal planes. What's celebrated here is the basic ''aliveness'' of stone, and the mysterious inner spirit that seems to inhabit it, affirmed in ancient myth and religion. Yet sometimes the artist's processes seem too arbitrary: the slicing into the stones by metal plates is forced, and the textural contrasts too pat and pretty. Occasionally, he makes metal the hero of his dramas, using the stones as small and decorative accents. Yet if this is not the strongest Noguchi show we've had, it's a quiet, relaxed one that seems to put us in more intimate touch with an artist of very grand achievement. Also of interest this week: Charles Ginnever (Marlborough Gallery Inc., 40 West 57th Street): By now a public sculptor of some renown, Charles Ginnever has been doing his strong, geometrical pieces since the mid-1960's, and in the last decade he has installed more than a dozen in prominent sites throughout the country. Four new ones now grace the outdoor sculpture terrace at this gallery, one of them, ''Hangover II,'' a 25,000-pound behemoth that dwarfs the other three. Of rusted Cor-ten steel that ranges in color from orange to yellow, ''Hangover'' is composed of two open parallelograms - a favorite Ginnever form - connected by a top flange, the space between them implying another parallelogram. Each of the two real forms, depending on the spectator's point of view, seems to fly off at an angle to the other, or then again follow closely the other's pitch. It's a superb aerial act, made breathtaking by the massivity of the forms. ''Heavy Metal,'' a smaller Cor-ten work in the same family, deploys three more flattened parallelograms held in tension, that soar up, up and away into space, all sharp edges when viewed from one point, bold planes from another. The two other pieces follow another Ginnever format; that of triangles played off against each other in complex arrangements that seem to derive from stiff paper sharply folded. ''Luna Moth Walk I,'' another Cor-ten piece, starts with a triangular base, then angles gracefully up to poise another triangular structure overhead that echoes but doesn't repeat the base, the whole suggesting a geometric cobra ready to strike. Even more impressive is ''Goddard's Dream,'' evoking the form of two paper airplane darts (one landing, one about to take off), its triangular aluminum planes alternatingly painted mauve and green in the lightest, dreamiest of finishes. Working in heavy metal, Mr. Ginnever is lighter than air. (Through July 2.) Charles Hinman (Galleri Bellman, 41 East 57th Street): The shaped canvas, a funny thing happening to painting on the way to sculpture, is Charles Hinman's metier, and he's enormously clever at it. Using a Constructivist grammar, he skews polygonal figures - sometimes flat forms given trompe l'oeil dimensionality by color and shading; sometimes planes pushed into real dimensionality by the line of a curved strut - and piles them atop one another in a wild melange of colors that range from hot and brilliant to the most reticent of whites and pastels. ''Sensor,'' for example, a wall piece of sharp and muted contrasts, has a straight-edge rectangular ground of a deep black and a shrieking red plane (the black underlaid with a mauve shadowing edge). On it rests a pair of pale-colored polygons, each bulged out in a slight curve. Over them hover two beamlike forms, white and the palest of blues, also in illusory dimension. Such are the spatial ambiguities of ''Sensor'' that the viewer reads it smack-flat on the wall, but also as if looking down on it from an angle. A lot of these elegant exercises fill the gallery - maybe too many -along with smaller, cast-paper reliefs in which a raised, hard-edge plane of color is incised by a gentler, arclike form that recedes by levels and accenting colors back to the original ground. After a while, there's a certain sameness to these works, and maybe a certain slickness. But Mr. Hinman is a very skillful formulator. (Through May 28.) Gregorio Prestopino (Midtown Galleries, 11 East 57th Street): A former social realist painter, Gregorio Prestopino has for some time devoted himself to bucoloic studies of nude figures in landscapes. In both oils and watercolors, he portrays very generalized figures, often deployed among rocks backdropped by woods or grasses, in hot Fauvish colors (more pastel in the works on paper). The effect is - well, a little Cezanne teamed up with a lot of Matisse and maybe some Milton Avery. But there's a quiet joy to these works, and one or two are very striking, particularly ''Venus in Willard Pond, Spring,'' in which a zaftig, orangey-red figure sits tranquilly against a deepgreen pond cut into by a swath of paler green, the whole enhanced by a richly colored mass of hills. (Through tomorrow.)

876-> TABLE-HOPPING AT SEA
Eating aboard cruise ships traditionally has been a test of one's capacity and stamina: huge full-course breakfasts, morning bouillon, elaborate lunches, either in dining rooms or on decks, afternoon teas, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, vast multi-course dinners, desserts and after-dinner drinks in the lounges and midnight buffets. To some extent that pattern still exists, particularly aboard such luxury liners as Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2, the Royal Viking Lines' Sky, Norwegian American Lines' Sagafjord, Home Lines' new Atlantic and Paquet's Mermoz, all of which seem dedicated to giving their passengers lots of food, much of it good. But quantity alone is not enough in these days of choice. With more and more vacationers looking to cruises, the ships have become more selective. They offer menu variations. Some, like the QE2, the Royal Viking Sky and the Sagafjord, for example, stock thousands of pounds of extra foods so that passengers may indulge their gastronomic whims. Others, like Mermoz and Atlantic, become floating ethnic kitchens - the former French, the latter Italian - in hopes of enticing food lovers. All, it appears, seem to put great emphasis on buying the best, restocking larders with fresh foods as they go from one port to another. All say their kitchens stand ready to cook anything for anybody, anytime. It's not quite like John Bainbridge's early days of cooking at sea (he's the executive chef of the QE2) when a passenger insisted on sending his own chickens aboard so that he'd be sure to have fresh eggs for breakfast each morning, but the chef still receives culinary requests he considers odd. ''Many people lately are asking for fish and meat on the same plate,'' Mr. Bainbridge, a traditionalist, said with some exasperation via satellite telephone from his kitchen aboard the QE2, which was cruising in the Pacific. ''It's mostly Americans, but we try to meet every request whatever it may be.'' Most requests, he says, are easy to fill: orders for such exotica as the chilled pineapple and wine soup called ananas Kaltschale, grouse a l'anglaise, fettuccine carbonara, extra-thick slices of foie gras shot through with truffles, poached paupiettes of sole Boistelle, which are crabs' claw meat rolled in sole and covered with a lobster sauce, cold poached salmon and more Beluga caviar than one should decently eat at one sitting. But to Mr. Bainbridge the idea of two courses being eaten simultaneously is a bit odd. The executive chefs of other cruise ships, such as Royal Viking's Klaus Hoetmer and Norwegian American's Klaus Baumbach, in addition to running immense kitchen staffs, ordering provisions by the ton and planning meals by the thousand, must also be prepared to honor the special meal request. They have to cater to the often quixotic fancies of special passengers and those who have paid more for their passages. For even in this day of one-class cruising there are differences. Home Lines has had what it calls ''an Italian kitchen'' aboard its ships for as long as anyone can remember. Mario Cabrio, the executive chef, carries on the traditions - and the recipes - of his predecessor, Mario Ratto. The sauces are Bolognese or white clam, the pasta course often the oven-baked lasagne verde created by Mr. Ratto. Nightly menus are peppered with pizzas, minestrones, braised beef with tortellini, tortonis, espressos and cappucinos. ''Most of those who sail with us come for our Italian kitchen,'' says David Sutherland, a Homes Lines representative. ''Virtually all of our dishes, no matter what their origin, have what we like to call an Italian accent.'' With Paquet, the accent is French, and depending upon which cruise you choose, it will be the accent of Provence, Burgundy or Paris. The line's flagship, the Mermoz, which cruises in the Caribbean in winter, the Mediterranean in spring and out of Calais and Toulon in summer, is ''totally French, the French flags, a French staff, a French kitchen,'' according to Peter Rothholz, a spokesman. Under its executive chef, Rene Abauznit, the kitchen of the Mermoz bakes its own breads daily and offers free and unlimited red and white wines with lunch and dinner. ''Our passengers are Francophiles,'' said Mr. Rothholz. ''They're looking for the style of France, they expect French style.'' Ships calling at U.S. ports are required to undergo inspection by the Public Health Service. Over the course of a year, according to officials of the Federal agency, roughly 30 percent of inspections result in failing scores. When a ship fails, immediate efforts are undertaken by the shipping lines to correct noted deficiences. In the case of the Queen Elizabeth 2, which has failed both inspections since it resumed passenger service following a $12 million refurbishing after duty in the Falklands, most recently on Jan. 19 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at the beginning of a cruise to Asia and the South Pacific, consultants specializing in sanitation and food preparation were put aboard to correct the deficiencies as the liner cruised. On ships like Royal Viking's Sky and Norwegian American's Sagafjord, whose menus can be characterized as that melange of French, Italian and other European cuisines known as Continental, there is a single-class sitting for breakfast, lunch and dinner, no matter what price you've paid for your cabin, with additional buffets offered on upper decks at lunch and at midnight. Similar service is offered on Cunard's QE2 when it is a cruise ship, but on its trans-Atlantic crossings there are marked differences in food services, menus and alternative dishes. On these five-day voyages there are two classes, what Cunard calls first and trans-Atlantic, and there is definitely eating by class. Following are examples of single-class dinner menus from each of these three lines: QE2: Smoked salmon with capers or Norwegian brislings; jellied consomme madrilene, broiled supreme of turbot with herb butter, gnocchi, a choice of tenderloin of beef, entrecote, roast turkey, grenadine of veal, pork cutlets or a charcuterie platter; cold lamb, ham, sirloin, duckling and chicken; salads, and a wide selection of cheeses and desserts. Sagafjord: Cured rack of pork with Waldorf salad, breaded fried mushrooms; chilled avocado soup; steamed clams or Norwegian baby shrimp in an aquavit cream sauce; grape sherbet; diced beef tenderloin, chicken curry, medallions of reindeer; cold sardines; salads, cheeses and desserts. Sky: Escargots in wine sauce, marinated hearts of palm, pate in Madeira aspic; vichyssoise; broiled filet of salmon, poached filet of sole; braised oxtail, grilled filet of beef, roast Cornish game hen; five kinds of potatoes; salads, cheeses and desserts. Breakfasts and luncheon buffets on all three ships are vast, varied and elaborate, though essentially similar. All of these liners take pains to prepare menus that passengers will regard as extraordinary, although some critics have suggested that many of the dishes are unusual in name only, that because cooking must be done for large numbers of people there is a certain blandness to ship food. On a recent cruise aboard the Royal Viking Sky I found that there was indeed a certain sameness, although a visit to the ship's lockers indicated that the quality of the provisions was high. But there are ways to obtain spice if that is what is wanted. After a few portions of boiled vegetables, I beckoned to our Spanish table waiter, who asked to be called ''Franky,'' and asked him why all the vegetables tasted the same. He shrugged. ''Franky, do me a favor,'' I whispered. ''Get me something fresh, uncooked. And put some garlic on it. Please!'' The waiter scurried off and returned in minutes with three ripe, red, firm tomatoes, sliced, over which had been minced what seemed to be several cloves of garlic. It was simple and tasty. Subsequently, it was discovered that the kitchen would prepare virtually anything to order if you gave prior notice. In general, spice is either avoided or used sparingly in most floating kitchens. Home Lines is somewhat of an exception, Paquet even more of one. For example, a sample menu from Paquet's Mermoz offered at dinner a pepper fish soup in the style of Provence, frogs' legs Provence style with garlic, roast leg of lamb accompanied by seasoned fried eggplant, salads, cheeses and apple tarts. The kitchens of most cruise ships are prepared to turn out special dishes. For a 14-day cruise the Sagafjord puts aboard, among other items, 44 pounds of caviar (Russian Malossol), 12,100 pounds of meat, 4,800 pounds of poultry, 3,900 pounds of fish and other seafood, 19,000 pounds of fresh fruit, 27,300 eggs and 1,500 pounds of coffee for its 505 passengers. The QE2's stock of provisions is even more elaborate. For a 10-day round-trip trans-Atlantic crossing it stocks 150 pounds of caviar, 100 pounds of foie gras, 25,000 pounds of beef and 14,000 pounds of other meats, 22,000 pounds of fresh fruit, 27,000 of fresh vegetables as well as 600 jars of baby food, 50 pounds of dog biscuits, and 79,200 eggs. For its current 89-day round-the-world cruise, which left New York on Jan. 17 and returns here on April 16, stocks for the 1,850 passengers include 28 tons of meat, 14 tons of potatoes, 14 tons of ice cream and 18 tons of fresh vegetables and fruit. The amount and variety is necessary so that the ship's demanding passengers will be able to order ''just about anything they wish to eat,'' according to Alice Marshall, a Cunard representative in New York. When it is a trans-Atlantic carrier with different classes of service the demand, she says, can be relentless. Cunard's director of purchasing, Philip G. Courtney, selects 350,000 pounds of beef in Sioux Falls, S.D., and it is stamped with a ''Cunard Brand,'' set aside to be hung and aged and shipped upon request. Veal, 55,000 pounds of it, comes only from Rouen, France, and is picked up when the QE2 puts into Cherbourg, and 120,000 pounds of lamb loins, racks and legs are bought from farms in Kent, close to the liner's home port of Southampton. The 2,500 cans of foie gras, with truffles, come from Strasbourg. The QE2, which Miss Marshall says is ''the largest single purchaser of caviar in the world,'' and which has a 20,000-bottle wine cellar, has begun a calorie-counting menu and soon will have a daily buffet solely for passengers who are devotees of the ''Golden Door,'' the California spa that now has a branch aboard the ship. On longer cruises the ship provides a kosher kitchen, under rabbinical supervision. Passengers can also specify no-salt, Pritikin or any other diets, either when they purchase their passage, or later, even after they've boarded, according to Mr. Courtney. On its round-the-world cruises Cunard flies ethnic chefs from various countries to the ship and they remain aboard until their home ports. On trans-Atlantic trips, the QE2's 900 first-class passengers, who are obliged to wear dinner clothes for their three evening dinners at sea (a jacket and tie is required for the first night aboard), eat at a single sitting in three dining rooms: 610 in the Columbia Restaurant, 188 in the Queen's Grill, 102 in the Princess Grill. The more than 800 trans-Atlantic-class passengers eat, at two sittings, in the Tables of the World Restaurant. There are repeat first-class passengers who will eat nowhere else but in their favorite dining room. In principle any first-class passenger has the choice of selecting any of the three dining rooms, but in practice, many, particularly those in what are considered the best cabins, A, B and C, have first choice. And it is usually the Queen's Grill. Those in first class need eat nothing from the daily published menus if they do not wish to: They may order anything they desire, including caviar, 24 hours a day, and can have anything from a ninecourse meal to a multi-course English breakfast served in their cabins. Trans-Atlantic passengers in Tables of the World have menus with fewer selections, can order only certain things as special orders, cannot order full meals in their cabins at all times and are permitted to order only Continental breakfasts to be sent to their rooms. On cruises, as opposed to crossings, there is only one class in terms of dining and every passenger can order off the menu, if he or she so wishes. There is one sitting in all four dining rooms. But table assignments are generally made in direct ratio to the amount of the fare paid. So, even on ''one-class'' cruises, ''the pecking order survives,'' says Miss Marshall.

Joey Fink scored his second goal of the game one minute into overtime to give the Baltimore Blast a 7-6 victory over the San Diego Sockers and force a decisive fifth game in Major Indoor Soccer League finals. The fifth game will be played Monday night in San Diego. Fink's goal capped a rally during which Pete Baralic pf the Blast tied the score with a short-handed goal with 51 seconds left in regulation. The Sockers had overcome a 5-4 deficit when Jean Willrich tied the score one minute into the fourth quarter. The Blast withstood a twogoal, one-assist performance by Julie Veee.

878-> SPORTS PEOPLE; More Trouble for Best
He's had his troubles with the bottle, he's had his troubles with gambling, and yesterday George Best was having his troubles aired in court. ''I am an alcoholic,'' the 36-year-old soccer star told a public examiner in a bankruptcy proceeding in London, where he faces debts of $178,897, including a hefty bite for unpaid back taxes. ''My drinking over the last 12 years has been at the root of my trouble,'' said the former star for Manchester United and Northern Ireland International, explaining how he had squandered earnings of more than $100,000 a year over the last decade. His drinking has been no secret. He sought treatment for alcoholism last year, after having been suspended for the entire season by the San Jose Earthquakes. The club, now the Golden Bay Earthquakes, later traded him to the Bournemouth club in England.

881-> ALBANY VOTES PENALTY FOR WEARING BULLETPROOF VEST DURING A FELONY
A bill that would allow a judge to lengthen the prison term of anyone wearing bulletproof clothing while committing a violent crime received final approval yesterday in the New York State Legislature. Under the measure, wearing the clothing during such a crime would itself be a felony, and one to four years could be added to the defendant's sentence. The bill passed the Assembly yesterday by a vote of 135 to 1. It was approved by the Senate on Monday. The measure's chief sponsor in the Assembly, John C. Dearie, Democrat of the Bronx, said he expected Governor Cuomo to sign the bill. The bill's supporters say the measure should help reduce violent crimes, such as armed robbery or assault, because criminals are more likely to commit them while wearing bulletproof vests. The vests can be bought without a license at many stores and through mail-order houses. ''Right now, Joe the criminal can walk into a store, plunk his money down, buy a bulletproof vest and be protected when he walks into a store to rob it,'' Mr. Dearie said. ''I think we have to make the penalty harsher for wearing it. Unless we do something, I think we're going to keep seeing increases in the number of these crimes.'' Support by Police Groups Alice T. McGillion, the New York City Police Department's deputy commissioner for public information, said that while she had not seen the bill, ''I would think the department would be in favor of it.'' Two of the state's largest police groups, the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the State Police Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said they supported the bill. Phil Caruso, president of the city association, said there had recently been ''a rash of crimes'' in which the criminals wore the vests. ''It looks like the career criminals, the most violent ones, are the people who are buying the vests,'' he added. Another police group, the Police Conference of New York, which represents 25,000 police officers throughout the state, said it did not support the bill because it was not strong enough. ''We wanted it to be illegal to possess a bulletproof vest, not just wear it, at the time of a felony,'' said Joseph Sanchez, a spokesman for the organization. According to Mr. Dearie, in the last year police officials in the state recorded about 50 felonies committed by someone wearing a bulletproof garment. The sponsors said the bill was partly a response to the 1981 Brink's armored-car robbery in Rockland County in which two police officers and a Brink's guard were slain. According to the police, at least one of the gunmen in the holdup was wearing a bulletproof vest. Under the bill, a criminal who wore bulletproof garments - defined in the legislation as any bullet-resistant soft clothing - during a violent felony could be charged with both the violent crime and with wearing the vest. The sale of the vests would not be restricted. Wholesaler Backs Bill ''Let's say some guy held up a gas station,'' Mr. Dearie said. ''He goes to trial and is found guilty of armed robbery and is given 5 to 10 years in prison. If he is also found guilty of the vest charge, the judge can, at his discretion, add 1 to 4 years to the term, meaning the term could be 14 years.'' A defendant could not be found guilty of the vest charge without being convicted of the violent crime itself, said Lee Mager, legislative counsel to Mr. Dearie. William Levine, president of Body Armor International, a Long Island wholesaler of bulletproof vests, said he and most of his competitors would support the bill. Frank Astin, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he had not seen the measure. But he said that even though it tried to regulate garments that in themselves did not pose a hazard, he did not think the legislation would violate constitutional or other freedoms. ''It would certainly be a tricky issue, though,'' he said. Mr. Dearie acknowledged that there might be certain problems in enforcing the law. He said he did not know, for example, how a criminal picked up days after a violent crime could be shown to have worn bulletproof attire during the crime. ''These are the questions that would have to be left to juries and courts,'' he said. Mr. Dearie has also introduced a bill that would require licensing of bulletproof vests, but he said he doubted it would be approved this year.

882-> DOUBTS IN LEBANON
Slowly, concern is developing in France, Italy, and Britain about the possibility that the multinational force in Lebanon might be drawn into a war of imprecise and dangerous dimensions. But the concern in Europe has not been intense, as it has in the United States. Perhaps because public interest has been restrained and unemotional, the debate on the future of the force and the role it should play has been limited. The European commitment to the force still appears strong, with Italy's Defense Minister, Giovanni Spadolini, who reasserted his country's continuing participation earlier in the week, saying today that Italy was discussing the use of a British base in Cyprus in order to give Italian units in Beirut the possibility of air support. A measure of new unease was apparent, though, in France after carrier-based French jet fighters for the first time attacked elements firing on French ground forces Thursday near Beirut. Although Defense Minister Charles Hernu insisted that the air attacks did ''not distort the nature of our mission'' in Lebanon, there was extensive press commentary noting, although not necessarily in critical terms, that France may be going beyond the narrow role it sought to define for its forces. Wariness in London An edge of wariness was also reflected in comments in London by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Stressing the day-to-day changes in the situation, she said, ''You always have to watch that you do not get involved too deeply.'' She added, ''I think that one would have to be very, very wary of deeper involvement.'' With only 97 British soldiers involved in the multinational force, however, French attitudes are relatively more critical to its functioning. Over the space of a year, French units in Beirut have suffered 17 dead and 35 wounded, figures far above those of the other contingents. The effect of the French air attacks here was to underscore the reality that in spite of the Government's determination not to become involved in a civil war or to give direct support to the Lebanese Army, it would be unable to control what Syria or its allies in Lebanon might do in trying to draw France deeper into the conflict. Although the jets' sweeps were commented upon favorably as a necessary riposte to the wounding of four French soldiers, some editorials also suggested there was a degree of incoherence in the Monday to Thursday progression from criticism by Claude Cheysson, the Foreign Minister, of United States naval bombardments of Syrian and Druse positions, to the raids by the Super Etendard fighters. No Political Pressure French officials explained the sorties today as ''punctual'' ones in reply to direct attacks on French forces. There was a clear effort to play down the criticism of the American shelling, regarded here as direct intervention in behalf of President Amin Gemayel, and considerable stress given to the idea that only the United States, France and ''some Lebanese'' are committed to the goal of preserving a unified Lebanese state. Although there is virtually no domestic political pressure for France to pull out of Lebanon - most of the complaining has come from conservatives who argue that France should do less warning and more shooting when its men come under fire - the Government has no interest in becoming a hostage in Lebanon through its involvement in the multinational force. The Government has been suggesting that the largely inactive United Nations force in southern Lebanon could be enlarged, with French participation, to take over the duties of the multinational force, but this would in effect draw the Soviet Union and Syria into the equation, a situation the United States might regard as a defeat for its efforts in the Middle East. Because France wants to maintain what it regards as its status as an independent factor in the Middle East, French diplomats concede the unliklihood of French and American positions becoming completely parallel. The diplomats also acknowledge that there are very real limits to the extent of individual French initiatives. Communists Only Opposition In both France and Italy, each with more than 2,000 men in Lebanon, the only concerted opposition to participation in the force has come from the Communists and far-left splinter groups. The French Communist Party has argued that the United States is trying to drag France into a Middle East conflict. In spite of the casualties, there has been no sign that French public opinion regards French involvement in Lebanon thus far as unwise or troubling. France and the French Army have been historically involved in Lebanon, and many people in France feel there is a kind of unstated legitimacy in their role there, rather like their view of the French presence in France's former colonies in West Africa. French troops serving in Lebanon are volunteers or Foreign Legionnaires. Although Socialist Party friends of Mr. Hernu once campaigned for the dissolution of the legion as a colonialist relic, it is now fulfilling its historical function: carrying out France's small-scale military business overseas without getting French conscripts involved. In Italy as in France, there is no bring-the-boys-home groundswell. Instead, parliamentary debates have reflected tangible Italian pride in involvement in so exceptional an assignment. On the day that United States naval shelling was being criticized in Paris, Italian Government officials stated their approval of the firing.

883-> THE POP LIFE
IT seems that almost everybody loves the Beach Boys. Apparently James G. Watt, the Secretary of the Interior, does not, but his recent attempt to bar the group from performing on the Mall in Washington brought down such a storm of criticism that one would have thought he was advocating unregulated industrial pollution. President Reagan, who has never seemed to be much of a rock-androll fan, apparently told his Interior Secretary in no uncertain terms that the Beach Boys were a national treasure and should be left alone. Nancy Reagan let it be known that she was a Beach Boys fan. And, according to Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys: ''Mike Love, our lead singer, got a call from Nancy Reagan after the story broke. He said she was very friendly, and he was thrilled about it.'' As for Secretary Watt's original remarks, Mr. Wilson chose to ignore the categorization of the Beach Boys as a ''hard rock'' band, though one Washington pundit said that ''the Beach Boys are to hard rock as Mantovani is to jazz.'' ''The thing we took exception to,'' Mr. Wilson said, ''was what he said about us attracting the 'wrong element' at our concerts. We love our audiences. And really, Beach Boys music is pretty harmless. My brother Brian says it celebrates the joy of living, and it's always positive and light-hearted - too much so for some people.'' ''Young Blood'' (Epic), Carl Wilson's new solo album, will appeal to some of those people who find Beach Boys music too sweet and bland. It's guitar-based mainstream rock, with soul and gospel roots, a far cry from the blue-eyed barbershop harmonies popularized by the Beach Boys. But then, Carl Wilson was the original Beach Boy who quit the group for a year, in 1981-82, charging musical complacency. ''The Beach Boys just got into the habit of going out and doing the same show, all the hits, and there wasn't any really vital energy going into it,'' he said the other day. ''They wouldn't rehearse, or try doing new material. It was disturbing to get up onstage and not feel the energy, the joy you expect from the Beach Boys.'' This state of affairs spurred Carl Wilson to try making records of his own, records that ''would be rougher around the edges and have a more immediate emotional impact.'' So he wrote some soul and gospelbased songs with Myrna Smith-Shilling, a former member of the Sweet Inspirations soul group who is married to his manager, Jerry Shilling. Their collaboration provided the material for his first solo album, ''Carl Wilson,'' which was released in 1981 and which was a modest success. They also wrote together seven of the 11 songs on ''Young Blood.'' ''This time, that soul or rhythm-and-blues flavor is most evident in the writing,'' said Mr. Wilson. ''I loved those soul records that were coming out in the mid-1960's, and all the great singers who were around then. I wanted that edgy kind of emotional energy in the songs, so you can really feel them.'' This time out, though, Mr. Wilson called in the guitarist Jeff Baxter, formerly with Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers, to produce the album, and Mr. Baxter helped him rework the songs into guitarband rock. Eight slide guitars are layered together on one song, and another hot-shot session guitarist and Steely Dan alumnus, Elliot Randall, contributes a screaming solo to ''Rockin' All Over The World,'' which Carl Wilson has been singing on Beach Boys shows. Mr. Wilson rejoined the Beach Boys in May 1982, and the group is spending much of the summer on tour. ''I was 14 when I first joined the Beach Boys, back in 1961,'' he recalled, ''and during all those years, naturally there were times when the energy wasn't there and things were slow. But since we got back together last spring, everybody's been involved in the music again and working really hard. We're trying different things, performing some songs that aren't heard very often in addition to the hits, rearranging certain songs. But the music is still about the simple things -growing up, discovering girls, being with your friends, hanging out. Who wouldn't love being in a big arena singing about stuff like that?'' Like many Jamaicans, Augustus Pablo lives the life of a devout Rastafarian, spending most of his time in the hills and braving the pace and pollution in Kingston only when his work takes him there. But Augustus Pablo is no ordinary Rasta hill-man. Many knowledgeable fans of Jamaican reggae consider him the most brilliant and original of all reggae musicians. Mr. Pablo was one of the originators of the ''dub'' style of recording, which involves stripping instrumental tracks down to rhythmic basics and adding electronic ''seasoning'' such as echo and other effects, and which has spread from the Kingston studios to influence rock and funk in North America and England as well as much African pop music. His recordings have a mysterious, shimmering allure and sinuous lyricism, whether he is playing in the band, producing a singer, or appearing as the featured artist. A single phrase from his melodica, a small wind instrument with a keyboard instead of fingerholes, is enough to announce his presence, for no one else has been able to draw such distinctive and musical sounds from what is essentially a children's toy instrument. Several excellent collections of Augustus Pablo's music are in print in the United States, including ''Original Rockers'' and ''East of the River Nile,'' both available through New Jersey's Shanachie Records. But his latest album, ''Earth Rightful Ruler,'' which so far is available only on his own Rockers label and can be found here only at reggae and new-wave specialty stores, is a striking departure. It's still reggae, and the music still has the same hushed devotional mood, the same air of mystery. But the textures are much richer, with layers of keyboards, percussion and some other sounds that might be little bells or perhaps toy instruments, all bubbling in a sonic brew. Sounds rise to the surface and then fade into the background; melodies appear, disappear, and then emerge again when one least expects them. This is a kind of symphonic dub music, denser and more complex than anything else Mr. Pablo has done, but just as immediately appealing. And it will almost certainly be an exceptionally influential album, not just within reggae but in funk and rock and the third world's varied pop styles as well.

885-> ARCTIC PRECURSORS
To the Editor: Walter Sullivan's news article on animal origins (Sept. 17) reports the new hypothesis that ''many plant and animal species . . . may first have evolved in the Far North.'' Prevailing doctrine since the mid-19th century has held that most mammals originated in the tropics of Africa and South America. However, as early as 1878, Joel Asaph Allen, a biogeographer then at Harvard, bucked the establishment on this issue. He theorized that many mammals originated in the Arctic and were later driven south as the region cooled. Allen lacked the tools of modern research and his reasoning was somewhat different from that of Drs. Hickey, West, Dawson and Choi. Yet his wide knowledge and intuitive thinking led to a view that has now acquired some new support. New York's American Museum, recognizing his talents, snapped him up and kept him on its staff for 36 years. KEIR B. STERLING, Pleasantville, N.Y., Sept. 19, 1983

886-> HADDAD RULES OUT ANY COMPROMISE ON HIS ROLE IN SOUTH LEBANON
Maj. Saad Haddad, the former Lebanese Army officer who operates his own militia in southern Lebanon, said today that he would not accept any compromise on his demand to be appointed overall commander of Lebanese security forces in the south. Major Haddad's stated position appears to be at odds with the reported draft agreement worked out between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the Lebanese Government of President Amin Gemayel in the last week on an Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon. According to the Beirut daily newspaper As Safir, that draft agreement, which Mr. Shultz is trying to persuade Israel to accept, called for Major Haddad to be appointed to an ''honorary post'' as deputy commander of the Lebanese Army contingent in the south. Executive powers would reportedly be placed in the hands of a new senior officer appointed from Beirut. Major Haddad said in an interview that he expected any withdrawal agreement between Israel and Lebanon to leave him as commander of an area extending about 28 miles north of the Israeli border. He added that the Israeli Government had promised him that it would never back down on its support for this demand, ''even under American pressure.'' Meeting Arranged by Israelis The 47-year-old major made his remarks in a meeting arranged by the Israeli military in the northern Israeli village of Metulla, situated just across the border from Merj 'Uyun, the major's hometown and headquarters. ''I can't accept any compromise about my role,'' Major Haddad said, relaxing in the coffee shop of the Arazim Hotel. ''I have to be commander with full authority in the south. I have to continue in the way that proved to be the only way to save Lebanon.'' Asked why he would not agree to be second in command as a facesaving solution, the major replied, ''If I am second or third in command, the power to decide will not be mine, and in this case I cannot accept it.'' This, he said, is because supreme authority would be in the hands of someone not as committed as he and his men are to preventing a return of Palestinian guerrillas to southern Lebanon. If the Israelis are contemplating a compromise on the Haddad question, they have clearly not told the major. ''I am sure the Israelis would not accept this,'' he said. ''I have a promise. I am sure the Israelis will not let down their friends, not only Haddad but the population here that has been working with Israel for seven years.'' A Network of Agents United Nations officials in southern Lebanon say that if the Israelis give in to the Lebanese demand on Major Haddad they could jeopardize the widespread network of intelligence agents and informers they have cultivated in the last five years in southern Lebanon. This, they say, is because villagers would seriously question the ability and willingness of the Israeli Army to stand by its supporters in the south. Both Israeli and United Nations sources say the importance of the Haddad militia has never been its fighting ability - which American military experts believe is no better than that of the official Lebanese Army - but its network of informers throughout southern Lebanon. The informers keep the Israelis and Major Haddad abreast of everything in the area and act as a deterrent to would-be infiltrators. The Haddad militia consists of a loosely knit coalition of villagers. Most Israeli and United Nations officers in the south agree that without the inspiration of Major Haddad at the helm, his militia could easily crumble. The major agrees with this assessment. ''I prefer to resign and leave everything than accept a role that leaves me as a witness to the destruction of my country,'' the major said. 'The People Want It' He said he wanted to be the top commander ''because the people want it,'' adding: ''I want to follow the will of the people because my country is still in danger. When the future of my country will be assured, we will be willing to pass the command to others.'' A career Lebanese Army officer who trained for a year at the advanced infantry school in Fort Benning, Ga., Major Haddad first came to the attention of the Israelis in September 1972, when a group of Israeli commandos entered southern Lebanon in pursuit of Palestinian guerrillas. In the three-day operation an Israeli armored platoon went astray and stopped at a Lebanese Army post at Bir al Salsil. The officer in charge of the position was Capt. Saad Haddad, who reportedly provided the wayward Israeli platoon with supplies and directions back to the border. Militia Trained by Israel The Israelis never forgot that episode, and when they invaded southern Lebanon for the first time in 1978 they sought out the friendly officer. By that time he was a major in charge of the Merj 'Uyun border garrison and had earned a widespread reputation for antipathy toward the Palestine Liberation Organizaition, having been wounded in the chest in the first clash in 1968 between the Lebanese Army and Yasir Arafat's guerrillas. Between 1978 and 1983 the Israelis trained, advised, paid and clothed the Haddad militia and provided it with old, captured Soviet artillery and American-made Sherman tanks. In return, Major Haddad helped control Palestinian guerrilla infiltration into northern Israel and publicly appealed for a peace treaty between Lebanon and Israel.

887-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Bad Day for Reaves
John Reaves of Tampa Bay not only had his worst game in the United States Football League season, but also finished it on the sidelines with a broken right wrist. The injury occurred in the fourth quarter of the Bandits' 18-13 loss to the Los Angeles Express Monday night, and it is expected to keep Reaves out at least six weeks. He went into the game as the league's leading passer, But an aggressive Express defense held him to 7 completions in 27 attempts for 81 yards, and intercepted four of his passes. ... Last month the Boston Breakers of the U.S.F.L. signed Dan Ross, a tight end for the Cincinnati Bengals, to a four-year, $1.5 million contract beginning in 1984. He's not the first N.F.L. player to change leagues, but unlike previous defectors, Ross still has a year to play under his Bengal contract. Aghast at the prospect of N.F.L. stars' negotiating with the rival league while still playing for the N.F.L., the senior league has moved to protect itself. Its Management Council has urged the 28 clubs to press for a clause in contracts that would bar a player from signing a future-performance pact with the U.S.F.L. while the N.F.L. contract was still in effect. Jim Miller, a spokesman for the council, said the move was ''a good business decision.'' But Dick Berthelsen, counsel for the N.F.L. Players Association, said it might be illegal under a 1974 Supreme Court decision, and urged free agents to resist it.

889-> MONEY SUPPLY DECLINES $3.1 BILLION IN WEEK
The basic measure of the money supply dropped an unexpectedly large $3.1 billion in the week ended Sept. 14, the Federal Reserve System reported late yesterday. Within minutes of the report, bond prices rose and yields on short-term government securities fell. This came at the end of a week marked by general strength in the financial markets, despite huge borrowings by the Federal Government. Most participants in the market had expected a decline in the money supply of about $500 million, and some had even predicted an increase as large as $2.5 billion. ''I'm shocked,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics. ''Obviously, this is bullish. I thought all along that the Federal Reserve would ease its policy and that interest rates would drop, and now I'm sure of it.'' In formulating and carrying out monetary policy, the Federal Reserve watches the growth of the money supply. If the growth rate is within the Fed's targets, the central bank, which also considers general economic conditions, can be more generous in supplying money to the economy. Such injections of funds often lead to lower interest rates. The latest $3.1 billion decline in the M-1 measure of the money supply, which consists of currency in circulation and all checking and check-like accounts in banks and savings institutions, follows other larger-than-expected declines in recent weeks. Growth Is Within Targets Monetary growth has fallen to well within the Federal Reserve's targets, giving it leeway to make more money available to consumers and businesses. As a result of the latest decline, M-1 averaged $515.4 billion in the week ended Sept. 14, well within the Fed's targets. M-1 now is $5.3 billion below the Fed's ''interim'' target for the third quarter, which aims for a growth rate of 7 percent, and $4.9 billion below the upper limit of annual target range of 5 percent to 9 percent growth, according to Maria F. Ramirez, senior money market economist of Merrill Lynch Economics. Despite the latest drop in M-1 and the continued improvement in the bond market, the debate among economists over whether the Federal Reserve has eased its monetary policy continued. Those who believe the Fed has not eased its credit reins cited yesterday the extraordinarily high level of bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve. This often indicates that the Fed was stingy in supplying funds to the market, forcing the banks to borrow. Last week, net borrowed reserves soared to $1.158 billion, compared with an average of $186 million over the previous four weeks. Different Interpretations Citing that level, Philip Braverman, chief economist of Briggs Schaedle & Company, argued that those who contend the Fed has eased ''have lost the smoking gun.'' He said, ''All they now have is circumstantial evidence.'' But Mrs. Ramirez and Cengiz Israfil, vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said that the high level of net borrowed reserves was merely an aberration, probably caused by the unusually high level of Treasury deposits at the Federal Reserve. Such deposits are not included in the money supply and are not available to the banking system. ''The balance sheet is distorted,'' Mr. Israfil said. ''It will be impossible to see the Fed's true policy from the balance sheet. I remain convinced the Fed has eased.'' Mr. Israfil and Mrs. Ramirez said that in the long run, the high Treasury balances would be very positive in that they would reduce the Government's borrowing needs and dampen the growth of the money supply. ''It's extremely positive for the bond markets,'' Mr. Israfil said. Some economists took a middle ground. ''They probably haven't eased, but they will in not too long,'' said James Lothian, vice president of Citicorp. ''It makes sense to ease now.'' Lower Rates Predicted Mr. Chimerine of Chase Econometrics agreed. ''The economy is beginning to slow,'' he said. ''The risk of higher interest rates is next to zero and we'll soon see some modest declines.'' Following the Fed's announcement, the price of the Government's bellwether 30-year 12 percent bond rose to 104 27/32, from 104 5/32. As a result, the yield dropped to 11.41 percent, from 11.49 percent. A week earlier, the price of the bellwether bond stood at 102 3/32, for a yield of 11.73 percent. Short-term rates also declined following the Fed announcement. Rates on three-month Treasury bills dropped seven basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point, to 8.83 percent following the anouncement, and the rate on six-month Treasury bills dropped five basis points, to 8.91 percent. The one-year Treasury bill declined 11 basis points, to 8.98 percent. A week earlier, the three-month rate was 9.07; the six-month rate was 9.27, and the one-year rate, 9.33. During the week, the Government raised $14.25 billion in notes and bonds.

890-> CONNORS AND MRS. LLOYD ADVANCE
Don't tell Jimmy Connors that defending his United States Open title will be any easier now that the top- seeded John McEnroe has been eliminated. He just won't believe it. ''I've got to be playing my best tennis,'' Connors said after defeating 14th-seeded Eliot Teltscher, 7-6, 6-2, 6-2, yesterday to advance to the semifinals at the National Tennis Center. ''I can't worry about the draw. I never look at it. I just play who gets in my way.'' Next in Connors's path will be Bill Scanlon, who reached the semifinals last night in by far the most exciting match of the day. Scanlon, who upset McEnroe Monday, survived a 4-hour- 13-minute duel with unseeded Mark Dickson. Scanlon won the match in a fifth-set tiebreaker that ended at 11:55 P.M. The scores were 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, with the tiebreaker going to 7-4. This will be the first semifinal appearance in the Open for Scanlon, the 16th- seeded player. Earlier, Chris Evert Lloyd, the women's defending champion, defeated eighth-seeded Hana Mandlikova, 6-4, 6-3, and reached the semifinals for the 12th consecutive year. Mrs. Lloyd's opponent will be 14th- seeded Jo Durie of Britain, who swept past unseeded Ivanna Madruga- Osses of Argentina in only 51 minutes in the opening match of the day, 6-2, 6-2. The other women's semifinal tomorrow lists Martina Navratilova against Pam Shriver. Controversy Over Withdrawal Miss Durie's berth in the semifinals, only the second time she has reached this point of a Grand Slam event, underlined a controversy at the tournament that began with the sudden withdrawal of Tracy Austin, the fourth-seeded woman, on the first day because of injuries. Miss Austin, who won this tournament in 1979 and 1981, was criticized by the third-seeded Andrea Jaeger for withdrawing at such a late date. Had Miss Austin withdrawn before the seedings were final, Miss Shriver, who was eventually seeded fifth, would have moved up. But because of Miss Austin's last-minute departure, her place in the draw was taken by a player who had failed to qualify - a so-called lucky loser. As a result, Miss Durie did not face a seeded opponent en route to the semifinals. ''It's tough,'' said Mrs. Lloyd, when asked how she viewed Miss Austin's withdrawal. ''Maybe Tracy thought she would give it one last hope. In a big tournament like this, you want to give it as many chances as you can. If she had a chance to play, I don't blame her for pulling out at the last moment. But if she knew in her heart she couldn't, then, yes, it's unfair.'' Mrs. Lloyd's meeting with Miss Mandlikova was a rematch of last year's two-set final. Today's score was not as lopsided as that 6-3, 6-1 encounter, but it looked to be just as easy as Mrs. Lloyd countered Miss Mandlikova's strong attacking - but often erratic - game with her best tennis of the tournament. 'Good, Quality Match' ''It was a good, quality match,'' said Mrs. Lloyd, who is trying for her seventh Open title. ''With her type of game, she'll make two or three brilliant shots, then one game you wonder where those shots came from she makes so many errors.'' Not so with the 23-year-old Miss Durie. She routed Mrs. Osses, a clay- court specialist who did not weather her opponent's attacking serve-and- volley game. Mrs. Osses upset 12th- seed Kathy Rinaldi and Andrea Leand, and was a surprise winner over sixth-seeded Wendy Turnbull enroute to the quarterfinals. Still, she was no match for Miss Durie, who said afterward: ''I've learned a lot about myself and my game in the last year. I believe I'm a top-class tennis player now. A year ago, I was still struggling. I felt I had shortcomings in my own game, and I didn't feel it would stand up to pressure. I still have things to improve, but even if I'm playing badly they stand up under pressure.'' Connors said he had come into the tournament wanting to battle McEnroe, which would have happened in the semifinals had not Scanlon executed the most startling upset of the tournament by eliminating McEnroe Monday. ''You can look at it a lot of ways,'' said Connors, a four-time Open winner. ''I would've liked to have played McEnroe because he won Wimbledon. You feel like that's the way it should've been, me and Mac. But Scanlon didn't want it to happen.'' Now Scanlon faces Connors, whom he has never beaten in five previous matches. For a time yesterday, it looked as if Connors might join McEnroe on the sidelines. With both he and Teltscher battling the sudden gusts within the Stadium Court, the match got off to an inauspicious start. After the players split the first two games of the opening set, each winning his own service games, they went through eight straight breaks before the set went to 6-all. But for Teltscher, the match ended right there. Connors blanked him in the tiebreaker, 7-0, and went on to sweep the first four games of the second set en route to what became an easy victory. 'Got the Job Done' ''I got the job done,'' said Connors, dismissing the opening set with a shrug. ''I'm playing well, hitting the ball very solid and moving well. It's just a matter of going out there, taking the time and doing it.'' Unlike McEnroe, who left amid a shower of boos from the fans here, Connors's following is growing stronger every day. Many in the crowd of 17,778 cheered wildly throughout the match, but especially when he executed what has become his trademark, diving for shots at the net. ''I think it's just that I go out there and do it the way I know best,'' Connors said of his relationship with the crowd, ''I give 'em blood.''

891-> DODGERS TROUNCE BRAVES, 11-2
Dusty Baker blasted a home run and drove in four runs and Ken Landreaux homered and drove in three as the Los Angeles Dodgers trounced Atlanta, 11-2, tonight and stretched their lead over the Braves to five and a half games in the National League's Western Division. The Dodgers reduced the number for clinching the division title to five as they increased their season-series margin over Atlanta to 11-5. The Dodgers have nine games remaining; the Braves 10. Jerry Reuss (12-11), allowed nine hits, struck out four and walked none in going the distance to improve his career record against Atlanta to 17-8. The Dodgers, with every starter getting at least one hit, raked six Atlanta pitchers for 14 hits. Los Angeles took a 1-0 lead in the first inning when Steve Sax singled up the middle, stole second, went to third on Len Barker's wild pitch and scored on Baker's sacrifice fly. The Dodgers chased Barker (1-3), with three runs in the third. A single by Sax and walks to Bill Russell and Baker loaded the bases. Sax scored on Landreaux's groundout. Mike Marshall followed with a two-run triple, his first of the season. Landreaux belted his 17th homer in the fifth after a single by Pedro Guerrero, who hit his 31st homer in the eighth. Baker's 15th homer, a three-run clout, carried into the left-field seats and capped a four-run sixth inning that also included a run-scoring bunt-single by Russell. Pirates 10, Expos 1 MONTREAL (UPI) - Mike Easler cracked a grand slam and Tony Pena hit a pair of homers to support the three-hit pitching of Rick Rhoden (12-13) for Pittsburgh. The victory kept the Pirates three games behind the leading Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East race. Easler's grand slam was his second this season and third of his career. It came in the first inning off Scott Sanderson (6-7) of the fading Expos. Marvell Wynne walked, Johnny Ray singled and Jason Thompson walked to load the bases before Easler hit his 10th homer of the season. Tony Pena followed with a homer over the left-field fence to make the score 5-0. Pena also belted a two-run homer in the ninth. Orioles 4, Brewers 1 MILWAUKEE (UPI) - Cal Ripken had four hits and Scott McGregor and Sammy Stewart combined on a four-hitter to pace Baltimore. The triumph reduced the Orioles' clinching number for the American League East title to two. They lead second-place Detroit by seven and a half games. McGregor (18-6) allowed all four hits and two runs in seven innings. He struck out four and walked two in winning for the first time since Sept. 3 and increased his road record to 14-1. Stewart picked up his seventh save. The Orioles took a 3-0 lead in the second inning. John Lowenstein led off with a walk, and two outs later, Rich Dauer and Rick Dempsey hit consecutive doubles. Dempsey went to third on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Al Bumbry. The Orioles got their last run in the seventh on singles by Dempsey, Tito Landrum and Ripken. Tigers 7, Red Sox 0 DETROIT (AP) - Doubles by Wayne Krenchicki and Larry Herndon were the key hits in a three-run fifth inning for Detroit behind the combined six-hit pitching of Juan Berenguer and Dave Rozema. Berenguer (9-4) struck out three and walked only one over eight innings but was forced to leave in the ninth when a line drive by Wade Boggs, the leadoff batter for Boston, hit him in the right shin. It was the fifth hit off Berenguer. Boggs, the top hitter in the American League, collected three hits in four times at bat, giving him 201 hits for the season and making him the seventh player in Boston history to get 200 hits or more in a season. John Grubb got the Tigers in front 1-0 in the second inning when he singled and moved to second base on Chet Lemon's grounder, then scored on a single by Rick Leach.

892-> BALLET: DAYTON TROUPE IN THE BRONX
THE development of American ballet has been largely the story of dancers trained in various parts of the country by a core of very good teachers. It is from these teachers, as well as from abroad, that New York's major troupes continue to draw their principal dancers, and it is only fair that they should receive their proper due. What would New York companies be like without the California teachers who have supplied them, or without those in such key training centers as Dayton, Ohio, where the Schwarz sisters have gained a national reputation. In 1927, Josephine and Hermene Schwarz founded the Schwarz School of Dance. Among their most recent prominent pupils are Joseph and Daniell Duell of the New York City Ballet, Donna Wood of Alvin Ailey's company and Rebecca Wright, most recently with American Ballet Theater after nine years with the Joffrey Ballet. In 1980, Josephine Schwarz asked another former pupil, Stuart Sebastian, to return to Dayton and become director and choreographer of the Dayton Ballet - itself an outgrowth of a small performing group she had formed in 1937. So it was mainly as an outlet for Mr. Sebastian's choreography that the Dayton Ballet was seen Saturday night at the Lehman College Center for the Performing Arts in the Bronx. This is both good and bad, depending upon what one thinks of Mr. Sebastian's choreography. When the Dayton Ballet appeared briefly at the New York Dance Festival some 10 years ago, it seemed less grounded in a single specific style. Mr. Sebastian's work has a consistent inner tension that sets up hurdles for the dancers. At its best, it is exciting. At the other extreme, it can make the choreography look awkward. Mr. Sebastian is drawn to drama, gesture and depiction of situations. Yet he also tries to use the classical ballet vocabulary in itself, not always succeeding in finding the expressiveness he seeks. Perhaps that is why the only work not by Mr. Sebastian on the program had a naturalness and simplicity that showed the company off at its best. This was ''Celebration,'' a modern-dance piece to Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, by Mary Giannone. This is a tribute to the modern-dance pioneer Doris Humphrey, and since the Schwarz sisters had studied under Miss Humphrey, its place in the Dayton repertory has some meaning. Miss Giannone, who has previously worked at length in Connecticut, has created a formal plotless dance that alludes to Miss Humphrey's own work and musical preferences, but which adapts the Humphrey idiom to ballet dancers without any heavy-handedness. The shifts of weight, the wavelike and receding movement, the neat formal structures are all there. But there is also a sense of shining faces and joy that takes ''Celebration'' beyond the classroom piece it might at first seem. The second section is especially fluent. A woman is lifted above a group. It becomes her cortege, turns into a chain, separates and regroups into the first image. Here was a good introduction to the dancers - Camille Ross, Jill Stebbins, Laura Frock, Sheila Winn, Sharon Donohue, Gregory Robinson, Mario Nujara, Lowell Mathwich, Peter Means and Lee Kimble. In general, the men are of preprofessional level, but many of the women are strong classical dancers and well placed. This was obvious in Mr. Sebastian's ''Romance,'' to Rachmaninoff's Variations on a Theme of Corelli. Christine O'Neal, once with Ballet Theater, danced superbly even when she had to slide down a partner's back, and Barbara Pontecorvo had an impressive bold strength. Mr. Sebastian knew how to show these qualities off. But ''Romance,'' which paired Miss O'Neal with Mr. Means and Miss Pontecorvo with Mr. Robinson, was merely an obscure spinoff of Jerome Robbins's ''In the Night.'' The relationships and the interactions of the couples was never clear enough. ''... And They Were Not Ashamed,'' to Debussy, was Mr. Sebastian's Adam and Eve duet, much too static but performed appealingly by Mr. Kimble and Risa Gary. Mr. Sebastian, who has choreographed considerably for the Metropolitan Opera, is perhaps at his best when he is at his most theatrical. The crowd pleaser was ''Fast Company,'' with its social-dance themes to a recording of nine compositions by Erroll Garner. Miss Ross and Mr. Robinson were dynamite as the street-wise couple, with Miss O'Neal and Mr. Means less defined. Miss Donahue was cute as half of a squabbling couple, with Mr. Mathwich. Mr. Sebastian demonstrated a sure touch in the ensemble dances, and the evening ended with a rousing reception.

895-> EXILES AND PUBLISHERS DIFFER ON MOSCOW FAIR
At the same moment that the Fourth International Book Fair is being held in Moscow this week, several Soviet writers-in-exile and American publishers who did not go to the Moscow Fair as a matter of principle met yesterday - but disagreed about the merits of attending or not attending this year's fair. The main aim of their luncheon at the Alqonquin Hotel was to call attention to the plight of Soviet writers. Many are in labor camps or in internal exile, including Andrei Sakharov, Oles Berdnyk and Mykola Rudenko, and almost a hundred exiled Russian writers live in the United States and Europe, including such prominent authors as Joseph Brodsky, Andrei Sinyavsky and Vladimir Voinovich. The two Soviet authors who spoke - Lev Kopelev and his wife, Raisa Orlova, from Cologne, West Germany - strongly differed with the sponsors of the lunch, Robert L. Bernstein, chairman of the Fund for Free Expression and chairman of Random House, and John Macrae II, chairman of the International Freedom to Publish Committee of the Association of American Publishers and editor in chief of Holt, Rinehart & Winston. Mr. Kopelev, a figure in the Soviet human rights movement, an authority on German literature and longtime defender of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, said before the luncheon: ''It is better for American publishers to go to Moscow than to boycott the fair, to speak up openly there, to protest about the Russian writers, to give books to the people who attend, even to have their books stolen to satisfy the hunger for reading. It is always better to make a demonstration than to be silent.'' 'By Speaking Out' Mr. Kopelev pointed to his Polish Solidarity button. ''This is what I mean by protest, by speaking out. Solidarity is a real revolution, a nonviolent revolution. They are alive.'' At the luncheon he made the same point, disputing the position of Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Macrae, who voiced the opinion that American editors and publishers could register protest by staying away, explaining that the fair had become a propaganda device no longer affording the opportunity to help dissident authors. Mr. Kopelev continued, ''Going to Moscow is a way of making an opening in the state armor. You speak to 10, and 1,000 will hear very soon afterward. That's how it works.'' Raisa Orlova agreed with her husband. ''I hope some of the American publishers who go there will speak up - that's a possibility - to ask questions, to influence, not just to stay away. There are many people to influence, not just dissidents. What Lev calls the silent majority, you have to get to know them, too, the writers, the scientists, the poets who are dreaming and want to be heard. Show up - but speak up. We should know that books in my country are as necessary for the soul as grain is for the body.'' Mr. Bernstein replied: ''It's a difference of opinion. If you can go and protest, all right. We will continue to publish Soviet writers.'' Random House is publishing the memoirs of Mr. Kopolev and Miss Orlova. Lawrence Hughes, president and publisher of William Morrow, added that one fundamental reason American publishers remained away was that there was not enough business to justify going.

896-> AFGHANS EXPEL 2 U.S. DIPLOMATS
The State Department said today that the United States Embassy in Kabul was told two American diplomats were being expelled on charges of spying. ''We are puzzled and concerned by the Afghanistan Government's inexplicable and outrageous action,'' the State Department said after the Kabul radio had broadcast news of the expulsion. The State Department identified the diplomats as Hugh J. Turner, a second secretary, and Rob Q. Blackburn, an attache. In May the Afghan Government expelled another American diplomat, Peter Graham, saying he had sold ''pornographic literature.'' At that time, the State Department said the charges were ''ludicrous, and wholly without foundation.'' The Kabul radio said the American charge d'affaires, Edward Hurwitz, had been told that, on the basis of ''information and reliable documents,'' the Afghan authorities believed the two men were engaged in espionage. The broadcast said that the Afghan authorities had confessions from two people it called embassy employees, who said Mr. Turner and Mr. Blackburn had produced a letter containing instructions on opposing the Afghan Government that was distributed to rebels. Ever since the Soviet military intervention in December 1979, when most Western journalists were barred from Afghanistan, the Western embassies remaining in Kabul have been a major source of information on fighting between Soviet-backed Afghan Government troops and the insurgents and on other developments within Afghanistan.

897-> A DECADE LATER, IT IS STILL VENICE VS. THE ADRIATIC
Venice is no longer sinking, said Deputy Mayor Paolo Cacciari, but it is still subject to the capricious buffeting by nature that has left it ''exposed to catastrophe.'' In November 1966 torrential rainstorms lashed Italy from the Alps to Sicily, causing disastrous flooding in Florence and Venice and other towns. The flood in Florence was described at the time as the worst in that city's history and the water in Venice rose to more than six feet, the highest in 200 years, before the measuring instruments broke. Sir Ashley Clarke, who was the British Ambassador to Italy until 1962, said about Venice that ''if in 1966 there had also been a spring tide, the city might have disappeared.'' Sir Ashley, who is 80 years old, lives in an apartment on a quiet side canal and has, since his retirement, devoted much of his energy to gathering international support for the safeguarding and restoration of Venice's treasures of art and architecture. Rome Acts to Save Venice Venetians have learned over the centuries to live with the constant threat of high waters that leave the city's piazzas submerged several times a year. But on Nov. 4, 1966, there were sufficiently strong winds, heavy rain and high tides in the Adriatic Sea to create a flood that resulted in extensive damage to the city. The event stirred a long national debate that, with all the deliberate speed of the Italian political process, resulted seven years later in the central Government in Rome enacting a special law to save Venice from the high waters and industrial pollution that threatened the city known to Italians as La Serenissima, or the most serene. But a decade later, the primary aim of the law - to protect Venice against the menace of flooding - remains mired by political indecisiveness. Most of the measures have not advanced beyond the project stage. One measure that was quickly taken was the capping of almost all of the artesian wells that had been dug by the petroleum refineries, steel mills, shipyard and chemical and fertilizer plants that have turned the villages of Mestre and Porto Marghera on the mainland into a major industrial zone. City Sank 75 Feet The wells had so lowered the water table that instead of sinking at the normal rate of 4 millimeters a year, it had sunk 75 feet in the 75 years since the turn of the century. The lower the islands sit in the lagoon, the more the city is subject to high water, which is the bane of Venetian life. But with the capping of the wells and their replacement by an aqueduct as a source of water for Porto Marghera's industries, Venice has since 1975 returned to the natural level of sinking, four millimeters a year. But while the threat of gradual disappearance has thus been averted, the danger of a sudden sweep of flood waters over the whole city remains, as do the threats of erosion from pollution and more modern aggressions, such as the churning of the waters of the Grand Canal by the increase in the number and speed of high-powered boats. An argument, dulled only by the fact that it has gone on for years without action, continues over a master plan to protect Venice from the high waters. The project, which has been accepted in principle by the national Government and which in the view of local officials and environmentalists has all but replaced the local authorities under the special law, calls for devices to be installed that will completely block the three mouths between the lagoon and the Adriatic when the water level rises beyond a fixed danger point. Despite its adoption in principle three years ago, no contracts have yet been awarded for the project that is expected to cost more than $500 million to complete. ''There is no central force in Italy to take such decisions,'' said Giuseppe Rosa Salva, leader of a Venice environmental association called Italia Nostra, or Our Italy, and a main voice against the project. Environmental groups condemn the project because they believe that a fundamental reduction of activity in the industrial area and the port of Venice are needed. Mr. Rosa Salva and many others consider the project a way of protecting industrial interests by a costly enterprise that does not address the main cause of Venice's troubles. Environmentalists see the root of Venice's problems as the intensity of industrial activity and the 50-foot deep channel that was put into operation in 1968 to allow big petroleum tankers to reach the port and refineries at Porto Marghera. Political Parties Torn In the debate between development and conservation, Augusto Pulliero, a journalist who specializes in the threats to Venice, said the two major political parties - the Christian Democrats and the Communists - are torn by conflicts between their consciences and political interests that leave them unable to act decisively. The Christian Democrats, Mr. Pulliero said, are limited in their concern for Venice by the pressure that industrial interests exercise, and the Communists have the nearly 30,000 jobs in Porto Marghera on their minds. Mr. Cacciari, a Communist, put all the blame for political delays and inaction on the local Christian Democrats and the unresponsiveness of a succession of national Governments to local problems even if, as in the case of Venice, a national interest is at stake. Mr. Cacciari, speaking in his office near the Rialto, said that outsiders did not realize how little power the local government had. Even with regard to the threat posed by the powerful boats that ply the Grand Canal and cause waves that threaten the palaces that line them, the Deputy Mayor continued, it was the central Government in Rome that has failed to use its right to license boats and apply a ceiling on engine power. Like many environmentalists, Sir Ashley believes that inaction on the master project is a deterrent to carrying out necessary restoration on the many damaged and eroded buildings and monuments. ''There seems no use in conserving monuments unless you see to it that they are not engulfed by the sea,'' he said.

900-> AROUND THE WORLD; Guatemalan Guerrillas Free Sisters of 2 Leaders
Leftist guerrillas have released the kidnapped sisters of Guatemala's current head of state and his predecessor, a Government spokesman said. A group calling itself the Rebel Armed Forces freed Celeste Aida Mejia Victores, the sister of President Oscar Mejia Victores, yesterday more than a month after she was captured. The sister of former President Efrain Ros Montt, Marta Elena Rios de Rivas, who was abducted almost four months ago, was also released. The women were freed after newspapers published a manifesto from the rebel group Tuesday, accusing the Government of killing 243 Guatemalans since General Rios Montt was deposed in a coup Aug. 8.

901-> Associate of Trump Is Generals' Chairman
Jay Seltzer, a 53-year-old retired real-estate lawyer, will run the day- to-day business operations of the New Jersey Generals as their chairman, sources familiar with the team said yesterday. The formal announcement is expected next week in Houston at the meetings of United States Football League executives. Seltzer, who lives in Oradell, N.J., is a business associate of Donald J. Trump, who recently bought the team from J. Walter Duncan and Chuck Fairbanks. Seltzer's role will include contract negotiations, though day-to- day football matters are expected to be handled by whoever succeeds Fairbanks as head coach. The club's president, another role that Fairbanks had, will be Jim Gould, one of the league's founders, whose responsibilities will include marketing, public relations and league liaison. Yesterday, the Generals' ownership change was made final with the signing of papers. Gould said that the team's lease with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority at Giants Stadium required the club to stay there four more years. The 20 years often cited as the length of the lease involve options, Gould said. There has been speculation that the Generals might try to move to New York once their commitment to Giants Stadium has expired, and Trump has not ruled out the possibility. 2 Jets Upgraded to Probable The Jets upgraded Jerry Holmes and Mike Augustyniak yesterday from questionable to probable for tomorrow's game against Miami at Shea Stadium. Holmes, a starting cornerback, had a concussion, and Augustyniak, a fullback, had continuing back spasms. Burt Said to Be Improving Jim Burt, the Giants' starting nose tackle, who has back spasms, and Terry Jackson, a starting cornerback, with knee problems, remained doubtful for tomorrow's game against the Chiefs in Kansas City.

903-> AROUND THE NATION; Suspect in Child Killing Held Competent for Trial
A man who is said to have confessed to killing 6-year-old Adam Walsh is mentally competent to stand trial in the murder of a boarding house resident, a judge has ruled. The defendant, Ottis Elwood Toole, 36, and his onetime companion, Henry Lee Lucas, 47, a prisoner in Texas, have been linked by the police to 69 murders in nine states. The authorities have said the two said they had killed possibly 200 people. Meanwhile, a score of police officers and forensic experts searched the snake-infested St. John's Marsh, 75 yards off the Florida Turnpike, where Mr. Toole says he buried the boy. The head was found floating in a canal two weeks after Adam disappeared from a Hollywood, Fla., shopping center. His death two years ago and the fight of his parents for Federal laws on missing children were the subject of a television movie. Circuit Judge Henry Adams ruled Tuesday that Mr. Toole must stand trial on charges of first-degree murder and first-degree arson in a January 1982 boarding house fire that killed 64- year-old Nicholas Sonneberg.

904-> ACTORS STUDIO FIGHTING TO KEEP STRASBERG TAPES
The Actors Studio and Anna Strasberg, widow of the studio's renowned artistic director, are embroiled in an emotional court fight over Mrs. Strasberg's efforts to obtain more than 1,000 sound tapes recorded during critique sessions at the country's most famous training school for professional performers. Mrs. Strasberg, who is the executor of her husband's estate, filed a motion in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court last April seeking ownership of the tapes. On Tuesday, she took the stand and tearfully said, ''The Actors Studio is family - I don't want to say anything bad against them - everybody here is family.'' In her lawsuit, Mrs. Strasberg declares that the tapes belong to the Strasberg estate and should be considered like personal ''lecture notes'' made by a professor. Mrs. Strasberg maintains that the tapes are ''unique and irreplaceable'' and may also have ''substantial worth.'' In response, the Actors Studio says that the tapes were made in group sessions with various actors participating and serve not as an individual's ''notes'' but rather as the school's ''textbook'' property, an ''integral and crucial part'' of the studio's educational process. Tapes Held in Warehouse Until the court testimony concludes and Manhattan Surrogate Marie Lambert issues a ruling, the tapes remain, under a temporary injunction, locked up by court order in a warehouse on West 58th Street. The Actors Studio is at 432 West 44th Street in the theater district. Leading names of the American stage - some of whom once were members of the Actors Studio and friends of Mr. Strasberg - have filed affidavits in support of the position that the tapes should remain in the possession of the Studio. They include Paul Newman, president of the Studio; Ellen Burstyn, president of Actors Equity who, with Al Pacino, is co-director of the Studio; and two directors, Elia Kazan, a founder of the Studio, and Arthur Penn. No actors or directors were named in the court papers in support of Mrs. Strasberg's position. However, Irving P. Seidman, the lawyer for Mrs. Strasberg and the estate, said that ''at an appropriate time we will have support for our position.'' Mrs. Strasberg's secretary said yesterday that Mrs. Strasberg was distraught and ''in seclusion.'' The tapes in dispute were made as part of what the the Actors Studio calls ''sessions'' - they were not termed ''classes'' because in some cases established stage and screen stars participated, honored to be admitted to Mr. Strasberg's lecture-lessons. In the usual session, performers would act out a scene, and then it would be criticized by the members and by Mr. Strasberg. Among those who attended the sessions at the Studio over the years were Marlon Brando, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Sidney Poitier, Robert Duvall, Marilyn Monroe, Eva Marie Saint, Jill Clayburgh, Robert De Niro, Sally Field and Ben Gazzara. Making Tapes More Available Mrs. Strasberg, who was the director's third wife, contends that the purpose of her action is to make her husband's tapes more widely available ''to everyone who has an interest in the theater and acting.'' In her testimony, Mrs. Strasberg said, ''From the very beginning I said that the Studio could have the tapes for its own use.'' But she added that she would not give up her children's rights to the tapes. ''I can't sign for them. That's when our talks over control of the tapes broke down.'' The couple had two sons, Adam and David. Mr. Seidman yesterday described the Actors Studio as ''in effect a private club'' because it has only about 585 members. ''The estate wishes the tapes to reach the public through the Lee Strasberg Creative Center, which is now being set up.'' Mr. Seidman described the center as ''a legal entity'' but it does not yet exist in any specific location. Last night, Paul Newman, president of the Actors Studio, said: ''This should be a case about who has ownership of the archives of an institution, and I just think it's tragic that Anna Strasberg's lawyers and press people have chosen to turn it into a sideshow by contacting television talk shows and gossip columnists. The person who would have been most offended would have been Lee Strasberg.'' The Actors Studio was founded in 1947 by Elia Kazan, Cheryl Crawford and Robert Lewis. Mr. Strasberg became its president in 1949 and his was the name most prominently associated with the Studio. In recent years, he had cut down his sessions to about one a week, but he had continued to tape them until his death last year. Some of the tapes made by him between 1956 and 1965 were donated to the University of Wisconsin. A book, ''Strasberg at the Actors Studio: Tape-Recorded Sessions,'' edited by Robert Hethman, was published by The Viking Press in 1968. The case is expected to resume tomorrow.

905-> WEST GERMANS START MISSILE PROTESTS
Several thousand demonstrators tried to blockade a United States Army barracks in Bremerhaven today. It was the first major action of a planned 10 days of protests against the deployment of American medium-range nuclear weapons in West Germany. Early this morning, riot policemen laid down huge coils of barbed wire and cordoned off the Carl Schurz barracks in Bremerhaven, preventing demonstrators from getting near the base's perimeter a mile away. Police armored cars patrolled the streets of the northern German port city, and water cannon stood by. The protest at Bremerhaven, which the United States uses to land munitions and supplies for troops in southern Germany, is scheduled to continue until Saturday, when the demonstrators hope to encircle the Army installations. Some 5,500 extra policemen have been sent to Bremerhaven. Interior Ministry officials have expressed concern about possible acts of violence by militant leftists who plan to join the protest, which organizers had said would be nonviolent. Demonstrators Squat at Base The police said that between 2,000 and 2,500 demonstrators squatted in three groups around the installation, where 4,000 American troops and their dependents are stationed. At their barricades, the police established control points, allowing those with business inside the perimeter to come and go. A police spokesman said 21 demonstrators were briefly detained for identity checks, and that the protest had unfolded peacefully. At one point, a military vehicle was turned back by a band of protesters, who wrote ''no war'' and ''pigs'' on its side. The police removed several demonstrators, who resisted passively, to clear a path. Americans in the city said that there had been no incidents in the residential quarter where many of them live. ''The blockade of military facilities is going to be difficult,'' said Rainer Trampert, a leader of the Green Party in Hamburg, ''because it's a new tactic.'' Mr. Trampert has urged the protesters to be more aggressive, and has defended ''violence against things,'' though not against people. In Bonn, coordinators of the arms protest predicted at a news conference that three million West Germans would take part in protests that are scheduled to culminate Oct. 22, when demonstrations will take place in West Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart and here in Bonn. Plans for Blockade The scattered actions include announced plans to blockade an American Air Force base near Frankfurt, a barracks in West Berlin, an arms depot in southern Germany and the Defense Ministry outside Bonn. The 248,386 American troops stationed in West Germany have been given strict orders to avoid involvement in the demonstrations, and security at American bases will be handled by West German police. Jo Leinen, 35 years old, a spokesman for the protest coalition, said today that the Soviet-American arms limitation talks in Geneva are a failure, and blamed the Reagan Administration for having taken ''a maximalist position'' that doomed the negotiations. He did not criticize the Soviet Union. Mr. Leinen complained about leaflets that have been distributed by the Interior Ministry, giving details of what the Government calls the infiltration of the protest coalition by the pro-Soviet German Communist Party. The Ministry says that the country's estimated 100,000 Communists and their sympathizers are the largest bloc of arms protesters in West Germany. The protesters have called for a referendum to determine whether West Germans want the new American missiles stationed in the country. Mr. Leinen said that the March 6 election victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition had merely given the deployment ''formal legitimation,'' and he cited opinion polls showing that some 60 percent of the nation opposes the missiles.

906-> AT NYNEX, X IS THE UNKNOWN
For Nynex, the holding company that will join the New York and New England telephone companies on Jan. 1, its customers are both the problem and the opportunity. Delbert C. Staley, Nynex's chairman and chief executive officer, not surprisingly calls his seven-state Northeast region, with its 30 million people and 10 million customers, a ''big plus.'' As he sees them, the region's strengths include its economic stability, its higher-than-average income base and the many businesses ''involved in the information age,'' which thus makes them heavy users of telecommunications services. ''Despite all you have heard from the Sun Belt states, the sun really does rise over the Northeastern states every day,'' Mr. Staley says wryly. The minuses, however, are compelling, too. They include the region's high costs of doing business, the absence of population growth, its older- than-average telephone plant and its dense population, which fosters economies of scale but also makes it easy for competitors to pick off customers. At New York Telephone, 25 percent of revenue comes from only 1 percent of the company's business customers. Nynex officials acknowledge the vulnerability of their business base. ''The large customers are easy for us to serve, but they are also easy for the competition to go after,'' said William G. Burns, vice chairman and chief financial officer at Nynex. He adds that competition, in the form of cable TV, the Port Authority's Teleport and radio towers and dishes, are already in the marketplace. But he maintains that if Nynex is allowed to price its services in line with costs, it can be as competitive as anyone else. Stresses of the 70's Mr. Staley says he is convinced of his company's ability to surmount the absence of customer growth. He points, for example, to the way New York Telephone and New England Telephone coped with their stresses in the 1970's. ''We lost population, businesses moved out,'' he said. ''But our business kept growing because of greater phone system usage.'' What's more, he said, the Nynex Corporation is in a better position to profit from increased usage than the other regional telephone holding companies that will also be created on Jan. 1 with the divestiture of the operating companies from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. More of its customers are billed for the service they use, rather than on a flat fee basis. At New York Telephone, 97 percent of business customers and 63 percent of residential customers pay for local service on a usage basis. In New England, the figure is 63 percent for businesses but only 4 percent for residences. Financially, the New York and New England phone companies have fared well, but have not been at the top of the Bell heap. Together they earned $973 million last year, on revenues of $9.7 billion and an asset base of $19 billion. Financial Performance Because some of the operating companies' assets will be transferred to A.T.& T. on divestiture, the companies' financial figures are likely to differ somewhat from their historical performance. But during the past five years, Nynex, as a region, would have ranked second (to BellSouth, which covers the Southeast) on return on equity. Nynex, along with the other regional holding companies, will release its own projections on Nov. 16. (The name Nynex - which, judging by the jokes, reminds many people of various drugstore products - was chosen because it combined the initials of New York and New England, with an X for the unknown. Mr. Staley defends it by saying ''You remember it, don't you?'') Perhaps the best evidence that Nynex believes the potential for telephone services in its region is strong is its decision to emphasize that business - and telecommunications generally - rather than rush to put its chips on new businesses, as some other regional companies are doing. ''When we look at the management challenge we have, it is to try to manage so we provide a fair return to our shareholders, and that isn't necessarily going to happen with new businesses,'' Mr. Burns said. ''The markets we already are in are very, very attractive, and the evidence of that is all the new players coming in,'' he said. ''The growth in telecommunications is 11 to 12 percent a year, worldwide. We do have to get some things straightened out in those markets, but we don't have to look elsewhere, at things we are not familiar with.'' To that end, Nynex has set up a strategic market planning group and a sales organization of about 800 people that will offer equipment from a range of manufacturers. A.T.& T. will be represented only at the low end of the market, with equipment for small businesses, while Nynex will look to such suppliers as TIE, GTE and Northern Telecom for the more expensive lines. 'We Can Compete' Richard J. Santagati, vice president for marketing and a New England Tel alumnus, says that where appropriate, Nynex will even sell equipment that customers can use to bypass the local phone company. ''The alternative is to lose that business,'' he said, adding, however, ''We can compete with anyone if we are allowed to have the pricing flexibility we need.'' In fact, working to change the regulatory environment is another Nynex strategy. Leonard S. Hyman and Richard Toole, utility analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company, assess the regulation Nynex faces as ''sophisticated, consumer-oriented and less than generous, although relatively fair in the most important states served.'' New York Telephone and New England Telephone will undoubtedly face the usual rate battles. But the new challenge is how fast they can get out from under various regulations and pricing restrictions. At the top of the Nynex wish list: less regulation on mobile phones and changes in regulation regarding large business private lines and intrastate toll calls. Regulatory Changes Seen ''I don't think there is a chance of selling total deregulation in any of these now,'' Mr. Staley said. ''But what is important to us at the moment is the ability to do flexible pricing and set flexible rates. If there were to be no major regulatory changes in our areas, that would destroy my strategy and destroy the business, but I have to think the regulators are smart enough to see that too.'' Another task for Nynex is modernization of equipment. Although New York Telephone boasts that it was the first to use fiber optics - it has a fiber optics ring around Manhattan - analysts say it has work to do to update parts of its system. The company says it has modernization plans, but is reticent about disclosing much. It points, however, to a pilot project of a system that carries voice and data over telephone wires simultaneously. Whatever changes are to be made, the company is cautious about portraying itself as anything other than a phone company - at least for now. ''I think people may be looking for major change in our business in too short a period of time,'' Mr. Staley said. ''With an $18 billion asset base and $10 billion in revenues, you'd have to create some major subsidiaries - or have a major change in regulation - to drastically change the composition of our business.'' New York Phone Chief William C. Ferguson, president and chief operating officer of the New York Telephone Company, was elected chief executive yesterday, succeeding Delbert C. Staley. Mr. Staley, 59 years old, is chairman and chief executive of the Nynex Corporation, the newly formed regional telephone company that will encompass the New York and New England telephone companies. He will remain chairman of New York Telephone until the end of the year, when Nynex will go into operation. Francis M. Austin Jr., 55, was named vice president for operations at New York Telephone. He succeeds Leo P. Oberst, 64, who is retiring.

909-> ADVERTISING; Tri Star Pictures Hires Diener Hauser Bates
Diener Hauser Bates, the entertainment advertising subsidiary of Ted Bates Worldwide, has become the first ad agency for Tri Star Pictures, a movie studio started by a consortium made up of CBS, Columbia Pictures, which is owned by Coca-Cola, and Time Inc.'s Home Box Office. The company could be spending as much as $40 million to promote its movies, the first of which will be ''The Natural,'' a baseball story starring Robert Redford, due in May. As is the case in most movie promotion, Diener Hauser, which will be paid a fee, will not do all of the creative work, since freelancers or boutiques are traditionally called in. But with the help of Bates, its parent company, it will be buying at least 99 percent of the broadcast time and placing the print in at least the five markets where it has offices.

911-> SPORTS PEOPLE; The Price of Honesty
All that Florida State's injured star tailback, Greg Allen, had to do last Saturday to hold his position as the nation's collegiate rushing leader was to stay on the bench. Allen, who is nursing an injured knee, had led the week before with a three-game average of 156.7 yards, and by missing Saturday's game against Auburn, his average would have remained the same. That, according to the official record sent to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by Auburn statisticians, is exactly what happened. As a result, Allen's picture was featured in the N.C.A.A.'s weekly statistical report, which listed him as the the rushing leader for the second week in a row. But when Florida State athletic officials learned about it, they knew something was wrong. ''We all sort of looked at each other,'' said the school's sports information director, Wayne Hogan. What Hogan and his colleagues knew was that Allen had been used as a decoy runner for one play in the fourth quarter of the Auburn game, an appearance that had somehow been overlooked in the official game report. As a result of the single appearance, his rushing average for four games dropped to 117.5, putting him in fifth place behind Mike Rozier of Nebraska, the leader with 151.8. N.C.A.A. officials, who praised Florida State officials for calling attention to the mistake, said the record would be corrected in next week's report.

913-> Advertising; Challenge To Nielsen From AGB
A.C. NIELSEN, the world's largest research company, could well be getting some domestic competition in an area in which it has reigned supreme: measuring network television audiences. The potential challenger, AGB Research of Britain, has people over here now trying to drum up financial support for a United States test of its system. Stephan Buck, group research director, and Richard Hallwood, a company representative, will be putting on presentations for small groups of broadcasters and cable operators, agency folk and advertisers at the Doral Hotel through the rest of the week. The attendees will be told that AGB is looking for slightly more than $1 million to underwrite the test. And it has already figured out that it would like 47 percent from the networks, 24 percent from advertisers, 14 percent from agencies, 10 percent from cable systems and 5 percent from independent stations. But that will be after they see the equipment and hear the competitive pitch that AGB has better hardware than Nielsen and that, for the same sort of revenues that Nielsen is pulling in, it can probably triple the 1,700 households that Nielsen has wired for its network audience head count. To make their point, the British have brought along the hardware that will be part of the test. Nielsen's little black boxes record what channel each TV set in a household is tuned to and when. That gives the dope on what programs are being watched. To find out by whom they are being watched, Neilsen has households keeping diaries. Since each little black box reports to a big black box automatically by telephone, program viewing information is available daily. The ''by whom'' data comes later. The AGB people have two electronic devices to accompany their black boxes, and each is designed to allow respondents to check in with Big Brother with a minimum of effort. Advised of this activity by a foreign element, Nielsen, predictably, said that it was testing a similar device. AGB, which already owns the National Family Opinion consumer panel in this country, has reached an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Information and Analysis, whose president, Norman Hecht, used to be an executive at Arbitron, currently Nielsen's major competitor in broadcast audience measurement. According to Mr. Buck, AGB, a publicly held company, was founded in 1962 and currently has 8,000 homes wired in 10 countries: Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, West Germany, France, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. In those countries, clients can call the AGB computer in the morning with their computers to find out how many households and what kind of people were watching a particular show. They can also get audience ratings for commercials. Does that shake you up?

915-> Miss Taylor's Illness Halts Production Anew
Lingering bronchitis and laryngitis problems prevented Elizabeth Taylor from going on last night in Noel Coward's ''Private Lives'' and the performance was canceled. A statement about the actress's condition was read to a crowd of patrons outside the Lunt-Fontanne Theater. Dolph Browning, a spokesman for the production, said later that Miss Taylor was ''very valiant, but she must listen to her physician.'' He would not predict when the actress would resume her role in the play, which closes here on July 17. Previews begin in Philadelphia on July 19, as part of a national tour. Miss Taylor has been unable to perform 13 times in New York since the revival opened on May 8, Mr. Browning said. Kathryn Walker, a supporting actress in the production, assumed her role five times, and eight other performances were canceled, Mr. Browning said.

The Senate voted today, 91 to 6, to provide $4 million to clean up radioactive wastes in Maywood and Wayne, N.J. The House has passed an identical measure, and Republicans on the Senate's Appropriations Committee said they did not expect a veto. The atomic waste problem in Maywood is a result of thorium deposits by the Maywood Chemical Company. The Maywood plant is now owned by the Stepan Chemical Company, which has agreed to contribute $4 million to supplement Federal funds, according to Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey. The site in Wayne, used by the W.R. Grace Company in the late 1940's, would receive $2 million in Federal funds, Senator Bradley said.

A Federal interagency committee has just completed six years of studying and redefining what it takes to make what it considers a metropolitan area, and it has found that sprawling urban areas with no clearly defined center are the trend. In other words, do not expect any more high-density central cities surrounded by dependent suburbs, like New York and Chicago. The uneven spread of such places as Phoenix or Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, which two decades ago became metropolitan areas separate from New York City under the census's definition, is fast becoming the rule. The panel's report, issued last week, found Houma-Thibodaux, population 176,876, and Visalia-Tulare-Porterville, 245,751, to be prototypes of the metropolitan areas that have been springing up around the nation. This reflects the faster growth rate for these smaller areas, which may well become major population conglomerates in the future. Study Began in 1977 The panel that conducted the study, the Federal Committee on Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which operates under the Office of Management and Budget, began wrestling with the question of what constitutes metropolitan growth in 1977. That marked a recognition that old areas were expanding and new ones were being born at a rapid pace as the population, industry and other institutions dispersed into nonurban areas that had been declining for decades. The committee's revised boundaries and definitions for more than 300 areas took effect July 1. Edward J. Spar, president of Market Statistics in New York, which prepares demographic data for private companies, called the changes ''the most far-reaching since the Government began designating metropolitan areas in 1910.'' The committee, headed by Christopher DeMuth, administrator for information and regulatory affairs, is composed of demographers from various agencies and departments. The panel defines a metropolitan entity as ''a geographical area with a large population nucleus together with adjacent communities which have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus.'' On the basis of its revised definitions, the committee has designated 40 new metropolitan statistical areas, two of them in Puerto Rico, since the 1980 census. Because the committee created three different names for the areas, some of which are intertwining, it is hard to figure the total number, but Mr. Spar said that for all practical purposes there are now 314, up from 172 in 1950. Bowing to Realities Bowing to the realities of population growth outside incorporated cities and towns, the committee repealed the long-standing requirement that a community must have a population above 50,000 to qualify as a central city within a metropolitan area. The central city designation is especially important because the formulas for distributing funds under many Federal programs are based on the size and character of those key cities. As a result, cities and counties around the country are now trying to find out how the changes will affect the amount of Federal aid they receive. But the formulas are exceedingly complicated, officials say, and the process may take some time. With no minimum size requirement for central cities, that designation now is determined by other qualities, such as whether a city is a work center surrounded by bedroom communities. Thus, Benton Harbor, Mich., a declining city of 14,707, is now classified as a central city in a new metropolitan area of 171,276 people. As is the case with most large cities, the small cities of America are overwhelmed by their suburbs, whose size and density chiefly determine whether an area qualifies as metropolitan. In many areas population growth has occurred around and between small towns. Houma, La., for example, has 32,602 people, according to the latest census, not much more than in 1970. Its neighbor, Thibodaux, in the next county, has 15,810. Most of the growth in southern Louisiana, spurred by energy-related companies and other industrial development, has been in new settlements outside the towns. Pattern Holds in California In Tulare County, Calif., the little cities of Visalia, Tulare and Porterville, and surrounding areas in the San Joaquin Valley between Bakersville and Fresno all grew rapidly but, again, not in a concentrated manner. The vast majority of habitable land in California is now covered by metropolitan areas. Calvin L. Beale, chief demographer for the Agriculture Department who is a member of the committee and has watched rural areas become metropolitan, said some of them lacked metropolitan character because there was no sizable city, major airport or other amenities associated with large areas. But the people are there with an economy to support them. They are simply dispersed in a way that does not support the usual urban living patterns. Based on the changed definitions, several new central cities have been designated within large metropolitan areas. They include White Plains in the New York area; Elizabeth, N.J., in the Newark area; Miami Beach in the Miami area; Arlington, Va., in the Washington area; Annapolis, Md., in the Baltimore area; Bloomington, Minn., in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; Pasadena, Pomona and Burbank, Calif., in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, and Evanston and Chicago Heights, Ill., in the Chicago area. In effect, what the committee did was classify as central cities many of the old suburbs that now share many characteristics, such as high poverty rates and large numbers of members of minority groups, with the older and bigger central cities. The change will alter both the distribution of Federal funds and the Government statistics on cities and suburbs. In some Federal programs, at least, such cities as White Plains and Miami Beach may be entitled to increased aid, officials say. Changes for Rural Counties Some rural counties that in the past were classified as part of metropolitan areas because of commuting patterns were separated from those areas by the committee. It also removed some places from the central city category because they no longer qualified as such under the new definitions. West Haven, Conn., in the New Haven-Meriden area, is one example. But the overall trend of changes was additions and growth. In its report, the committee said it was recognizing 257 freestanding metropolitan statistical areas and 78 others that made up 23 consolidated metropolitan statistical areas. Mr. Spar and other demographers said the consolidated designation was not of much use either for product marketing or government financing purposes. On the East Coast, for example, the areas so run together that the New York consolidated area covers much of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey and has several centers. Finally, the committee left room for politics despite its concentration on geographical definitions. Some changes may have been made because the panel frequently has to please the state Congressional delegations, which act on complaints from chambers of commerce and other local boosters. Thus, Fort Worth finally severed itself from Dallas, Oakland from San Francisco, Niagara Falls from Buffalo, East St. Louis, Ill., from St. Louis and Kansas City, Kan., from Kansas City, Mo., mostly for purposes of the smaller cities' civic pride. Mr. Spar said publishers and broadcasters in those areas would probably lose advertising dollars in the process because many advertisers looked for size when deciding where to concentrate their resources. Some Areas Merged That awareness also led to some mergers. The Norfolk and Newport News, Va., areas joined, for example, to form the largest metropolitan area between Washington and Atlanta. Bergen County, N.J., seceded from the New York City area to the Paterson area. In the process, however, again for political reasons, Paterson lost its name in the metropolitan title, which became Bergen-Passaic for the two counties involved, even though Paterson is a central city of 138,000. The new area has 1.3 million people. The move by Bergen County took 845,000 people from the New York area, though it still is the nation's most populous metropolitan area, with 8.2 million people. Moreover, in the Federal Government's roster of metropolitan areas, New York remains a rarity as one of the few big cities not overwhelmed by suburbs. There are seven million people in the city and 1.2 million in Putnam, Rockland and Westchester counties. Although it is not noticeable from the New Jersey Turnpike, the Federal Government has redrawn the map of metropolitan America.

921-> COLUMBIA IS TIED ON DARTMOUTH KICK
A 32-yard field goal by Craig Saltzgaber on the game's last play gave Dartmouth a 17-17 tie with Columbia at Giants Stadium today. That field goal kept the Green in first place in the Ivy League standing, tied with Pennsylvania, Dartmouth's final opponent in two weeks. Penn, which lost to Colgate today in a nonleague game, and Dartmouth have 4-0-1 records in Ivy competition. Columbia is 1-5-2 over all and 1-3-1 in the league. Joe Yukica, the Dartmouth coach, said he had never hesitated in making the field-goal choice on fourth down with four seconds left and his team at the Columbia 15. ''At that point,'' he said, ''we're talking about a conference championship. A tie in a league game beats the heck out of losing.'' The tie was a jolt to Columbia, taking away what would have been a monumental upset victory that would have been something special for John Witkowski, Don Lewis and Bill Reggio. Those three seniors for four seasons have played remarkable pass- and-catch football Saturday after Saturday with many records but few victories. Witkowski Passes for 2 Scores Witkowski passed for 337 yards and 2 touchdowns today, 1 each to Reggio and Lewis. It was Witkowski's 10th 300-yards-plus game, his 6th this season. Lewis caught nine passes and thus broke by one the Ivy career record for receptions, 103 by Dartmouth's Dave Shula (1978-1980). The score was tied twice in the second quarter, at 7-7 and 14-14. Columbia went ahead at 6 minutes 9 seconds of the fourth quarter on a 42-yard field goal by Larry Walsh. Field-goal attempts of 31 and 28 yards by Walsh were wide and two Witkowski passes were intercepted by Scott Kehoe and Don Pomeroy in the Green end zone. The Lions outgained Dartmouth in total yards, 500 to 354. But Dartmouth rallied near the end to avert defeat, as it did against Yale last Saturday. The final drive began at the Green's 23 with 2:30 remaining. Frank Polsinello completed three of seven passes, a key one to Rick Weissman, the halfback, for 16 yards to the Columbia 18 on third down. Polsinello's last two passes were incomplete and then the sophomore kicker, Saltzgaber, came out and achieved the tie. Princeton 41, Lafayette 33 PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - Doug Butler, Princeton's sophomore quarterback, threw for 469 yards and 3 touchdowns, and Eric Robinson intercepted 3 Lafayette passes in the fourth quarter as the Tigers rallied. Derek Graham, who caught 2 of Butler's scoring passes, had 15 receptions for 216 yards. Butler has thrown 19 touchdown passes this season to break the single- season school record of 16 set in 1981 by Bob Holly and equaled last season by Brent Woods. Graham, with 8 touchdown receptions on the year, broke the single-season record for scoring catches.

923-> NEW PORT OFFICIAL FOUND HER JOB IN NEWSPAPERS
Susan Frank read in the newspapers that New York City was looking for a Commissioner of Ports and Terminals. ''So I sent in a resume,'' she said yesterday in Mayor Koch's office in City Hall after her appointment to the $62,000-a-year job was announced. Her mission, said Deputy Mayor Kenneth Lipper, to whom she sent the resume and to whom she will report, is to ''restore New York as a work port.'' Mayor Koch said he had been seeking someone ''with familiarity with the port and who is an entrepreneur.'' He seemed amused at reporters' attempts to learn whether Miss Frank had any political contacts. She said she had none. ''Unbelievable, right?'' said the Mayor. Miss Frank, a 30-year-old Manhattan resident, is chief financial officer of a family-owned company, Standard Marine Services of Bayonne, N.J. The Mayor said she had told him that she supervised 200 employees, a 10-acre waterfront facility and 20 tugs, barges and tankers operating in the port. The company, founded on Staten Island by her grandfather, dumps sewage sludge at sea for communities from New Jersey and Long Island, cleans ships, transports petroleum products and owns an oil terminal. It moved to New Jersey in the 1950's. Currently, according to the Mayor's announcement, the company has no contracts with the city. Miss Frank said, ''This city has the best waterfront around, and Ports and Terminals has not been developing property as best they can.'' The agency that she will head has regulatory authority over some 500 miles of waterfront and manages city-owned waterfront property and 14 public markets. The Mayor said he had interviewed a number of candidates to succeed Linda W. Seale, who resigned June 30. Miss Frank was brought up on Staten Island, is a graduate of Boston University and did graduate work at George Washington University. She will take office Aug. 1. She and her husband, Jared Stamell, a lawyer, have a 6-month-old daughter, Kate.

924-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Saudi Investor Buys Stake in Occidental
The Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a company with no shortage of aggressive, internationally known senior executives and major shareholders, now has another strong presence to contend with. Suliman S. Olayan, a Saudi Arabian investor with major holdings in several other American companies, has become the largest single holder of its common stock through a company he controls. Occidental, a major energy company based in Los Angeles, declined to say exactly how much of its stock is owned by the company controlled by Mr. Olayan, the Competrol Establishment. However, it said the holding exceed the 3.5 percent interest owned by David Murdock, a Los Angeles financier who has taken an increasingly active role in the company's affairs during the past two years. It also said the holding is less than 5 percent of its shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that an investor disclose ownership of more than 5 percent of a company's stock. Mr. Olayan, who owns about 1 million of the Mobil Corporation's 406.7 million shares, has been a member of that company's board since 1980. Through Competrol, he also controls nearly 20 percent of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation and 7.6 percent of the First Chicago Corporation. Mr. Olayan, a 64-year-old businessman who lives in Saudi Arabia but often travels to this country for Mobil's board meetings, is known to have longstanding friendships with Dr. Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman, and A. Robert Abboud, its president and chief operating officer. Mr. Olayan was in Saudi Arabia yesterday, and could not be reached for comment. Occidental has elected Aziz D. Syriani, president of Competrol, to its board. Wall Street analysts were intrigued by the disclosure because it reflects a continued expansion of the American business interests of Mr. Olayan. One analyst, who asked that his name not be used, said it raised new questions about the future management of Occidental, which remains under the firm control of Dr. Hammer, who is 85 years old. The analyst said that Mr. Olayan's interest in the company may serve to ''counterbalance'' the influence of Mr. Murdock, who is considered a potential successor to Dr. Hammer. But James A. Burke, an analyst for Duff & Phelps, characterized Mr. Olayan as a man of ''such great wealth that he has no need to run Occidental.'' Mr. Olayan had ''probably invested in the company simply because he's an astute investor looking for undervalued shares,'' Mr. Burke said.

925-> IRANIAN AT U.N.: NO ROOM ON AGENDA
In the last 10 days, an Iranian exile opposed to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini went from mission to mission at the United Nations hoping to place a resolution on the agenda of the General Assembly condemning Iran for ''grave violations of human rights.'' To support his arguments, the Iranian, Dr. Kazem Rajavi, a political science professor in Switzerland, distributed a 76-page list containing the names of 7,746 people who, Iranian exiles say, have been executed in Iran since June 1981. The list, Dr. Rajavi said in an interview, cost the lives of 25 people to assemble, since some in Iran were executed for helping to compile it. The deadline for placing items on the United Nations agenda passed on Monday night without success for Dr. Rajavi. Despite meeting with 75 delegations here, according to his account, and despite the information that Dr. Rajavi presented, he did not find a major member nation willing put the issue of human rights violations in Iran before the world organization. 3 Countries on Agenda Some United Nations delegates, aware of the difficulties of getting Iran placed on the human rights agenda, said it showed what they called the one- sidedness of many United Nations decisions. This year, as in previous years, these delegates said, the human rights discussion will focus exclusively on three Latin American countries: Chile, El Salvador, and Guatemala. None of the delegates interviewed contended that the General Assembly was evenhanded on the question of human rights. Some, however, argued that the focus on Guatemala, El Salvador, and Chile was nonetheless justified because of the seriousness of the problem in those countries. The United Nations examines the question of human rights in two arenas. One is the 43-member Commission on Human Rights, which meets each spring in Geneva. The commission, which includes most of the European and North American democracies, has in the last few years taken up violations of human rights in a wide variety of countries, including Iran. In 1981, it examined human rights violations in a Communist country for the first time in its 38- year history when it put Poland's declaration of martial law and the suppression of the Solidarity trade union on its agenda. 'No Way to Challenge That' The other forum is the General Assembly, or, more precisely, the Third Committee of the Assembly, which deals with social, humanitarian, and cultural matters. All 158 countries in the United Nations are members of the Third Committee, and many delegates say they believe the large membership, which is dominated by the group of 101 countries professing nonalignment, has made it far more difficult to direct human rights deliberations toward anything but a small number of habitual target countries. ''The easiest thing for the Third Committee to do is take up countries that are not part of any powerful voting bloc at the U.N.,'' a Western delegate said. ''On Chile, El Salvador, and Guatemala there is a tacit coalition among the pro-Soviet states, some of the West European countries and most of the nonaligned. There's no way to challenge that.'' One result of the bloc system, diplomats here say, is that countries accused elsewhere of violating the rights of citizens escape attention at the United Nations. Amnesty International has reported on numerous instances of atrocities in Iran. This summer, it announced that it had received reports of 5,195 executions in Iran, a figure it called ''an absolute minimum'' since ''numerous executions are reported to have been carried out in secret.'' 'Propaganda,' Iran Says In a letter to the United Nations early this year, the Iranian mission to the United Nations said attacks on its human rights record resulted from a ''campaign of propaganda'' orchestrated by the United States. The Iranian letter listed 175 attacks, bombings and assasinations that, it said, had been carried out in the country by the Mujahedeen Khalq, the principle group in Iran opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini. The Mujahedeen, which is led in Paris by Dr. Rajavi's brother, Massoud Rajavi, supports Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the elected President of Iran who fled the country in 1981. According to Dr. Rajavi, 90 percent of the names on his list of 7,746 that he distributed at the United Nations are members of the Mujahedeen. Dr. Rajavi and members of the Mujahedeen interviewed here contended that the list represents only about one-fourth of the people actually executed in the country. Political Considerations To get charges before the General Assembly, a resolution dealing with the issue must be submitted for the members to debate and a vote must be taken. A resolution needs to be sponored by one member nation and co-sponsored by at least one more, but a host of political considerations seem to work to prevent any country from taking the necessary action. Asked why his country would not sponsor a resolution on Iran, a West European delegate said: ''The answer lies in the very delicate relations that the European countries have with Iran. If you want to bring Iran back into the international community and to encourage it to negotiate on other issues, you might harm your chances if you go against them on human rights. The two interests conflict.'' Other delegates said they had not been contacted by the Iranian exile groups. The United States was not among the countries asked to sponsor a resolution. American officials said that if a resolution is introducted without the support of the nonaligned group, it is likely that amendments will be added to it by other countries that would have the effect of blunting or even destroying its original intent.

926-> S.E.C. QUESTIONS DEFENSE DEPUTY
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Paul N. Thayer, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, passed along inside information to others in 1982, when Mr. Thayer was chairman of the LTV Corporation and a director of several other public companies, according to Administration officials. Mr. Thayer, these officials added, did not make any questionable stock transactions himself. The investigation is focusing on whether he passed along information about companies in which he was a director, according to sources familiar with the investigation. In addition, these sources said, the S.E.C. wants to know whether the recipients of any inside information traded stock on the basis of information that was not known to the public. At least one of the transactions under review involves trading in LTV stock, these sources said, but neither the company nor LTV officials are subjects of the investigation. Thayer Releases Statement Late this afternoon, Mr. Thayer issued a personal statement saying he had ''given testimony'' in an S.E.C. ''private investigation into the trading of certain securities in 1982.'' Mr. Thayer's statement went on to say that the ''investigation does not involve any securities transactions by me'' and he has ''every confidence that when this matter is concluded it will be established that I have not done anything which violated the securities laws.'' Mr. Thayer's statement did not provide any details on the S.E.C. investigation and he said he would ''not have any further public comment on the investigation.'' The S.E.C. investigation has been going on for some time - Mr. Thayer testified last July, according to one associate - but its existence has been not been widely known, according to Administration officials. It could not be determined how the civil investigation started. The identity of the persons who may have profited from any inside information is also not known. John M. Fedders, head of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, said, ''I can neither confirm nor deny'' the existence of any investigation. The definition of legal and illegal insider trading is a contentious and somewhat unresolved issue. Last July, the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of illegal insider trading, but since that ruling the S.E.C. has brought cases against people who passed along inside information. The commission, under its chairman, John S. R. Shad, has made insider trading cases a major priority. Last month the House passed an S.E.C.-backed bill that would toughen the sanctions against people who improperly use insider information. Mr. Thayer became chairman and chief executive officer of LTV, a major military contractor and steel producer, in 1960. In January of this year he resigned to assume the deputy secretary position. Mr. Thayer also resigned his directorships with four other publicly traded corporations. In addition to LTV, Mr. Thayer, in 1982, was a director of the Mercantile Texas Corporation, a bank holding company in Dallas; the Allied Corporation, a large chemical company; the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the holding company for the beer producer, and the Altec Corporation, a small electronics company in Annaheim, Calif. Julian Scheer, senior vice president for corporate affairs at LTV, said the Dallas-based conglomerate had received and complied with a ''routine subpoena from the S.E.C.'' Mr. Scheer declined to identify the kinds of information the S.E.C. was seeking. An official at Altec said the S.E.C. had not requested any information from the electronics company. Spokesmen for the three other companies on whose boards Mr. Thayer served said they were unable to determine whether the S.E.C. had requested documents in connection with the insider investigation.

927-> STOPPARD'S 'REAL THING' IN LONDON
In a weak West End theater season, there is only one new play that almost everyone agrees comes close to the real thing - namely, Tom Stoppard's flawed but adventurous ''Real Thing.'' A comedy that tells of a playwright's amorous travails, this is surely Mr. Stoppard's most personal work to date. The hero is more than faintly autobiographical - he even shares the author's wellknown enthusiasm for cricket - and the writing aspires to an emotional openness well removed from the brilliant intellectual skywriting of ''Jumpers'' and ''Travesties.'' Yet the old Stoppard is present, too - in the wry puns, the sleight-of-hand juggling of reality and illusion, the lacerating ruminations on theater and all manner of culture. No other writer would dream of quoting Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' and The Monkees' long-ago top-40 pop hit ''I'm a Believer'' - both approvingly - in the same play. A Noel Coward Pastiche In the end, Mr. Stoppard's old and new obsessions fight to a fitfully engaging draw. ''The Real Thing'' feels transitional and tentative: its sincere feelings and potentially dazzling theatrical devices buckle out of shape as the author veers between fresh territory and familiar ground. It's also possible that the staging muddies an already blurry script. Peter Wood, the director, and Carl Toms, the designer, have fashioned a preposterously gimmicky production in which constantly sliding panels, irrelevant photograph projections and studied David Hockney-inspired tableaux busily upstage the actors' words. If the Tinker Toy set were dismantled, ''The Real Thing'' might shed 15 minutes of running time and gain in dramatic force. The evening begins splendidly -with a fiendish Noel Coward pastiche titled ''House of Cards'' that is the first of several plays within Mr. Stoppard's play. The author of this work, it turns out, is the playwright-hero, Henry (Roger Rees), and its adulterous heroine is played by an actress, Charlotte (Polly Adams), who happens to be Henry's wife. What's more, we soon learn that Henry himself is an adulterer, carrying on with another actress, Annie (Felicity Kendal). Annie - wouldn't you know it? - is married to the actor (Jeremy Clyde) who plays the cuckolded husband opposite Charlotte in ''House of Cards.'' This opening art-mocks-life gambit is so clever on so many levels, both thematic and stylistic, that it dwarfs some of what follows. The other, similar tricks to come are not nearly as ingeniously conceived. After a while, they seem like mannered digressions designed mainly to add literary gilding to a conventional story about Henry's awakening to passion. A playwright of maddening intellectual prowess and arrogance, Henry ''has all the answers'' but doesn't know how to ''write love'' or express it. Needless to say, he does fall in love with love by the final curtain. 'A Lout With Language' As Mr. Stoppard fails to build his promised Chinese-box structure from beginning to end, so he allows a related but secondary theme to overwhelm his account of the hero's psychological growth. That theme is worthy, having to do with the very nature of theater. Henry is the sworn enemy of political playwrights - those writers who, in turn, dismiss him as trivial for dramatizing bourgeois couples instead of the ''real life'' of social issues. But if love is the transcendent ''real thing'' - and, as Mr. Stoppard demonstrates, a matter of overwhelming complexity - isn't it just as legitimate a subject for ''real'' plays? This is an iconoclastic, unfashionable argument for a playwright to advance in England right now, where the theater is so highly ideological, but it is rather gracelessly set forth with lumpy harangues in ''The Real Thing.'' The particular left-wing playwright who arouses Henry's ire proves a straw man - a boorish fraud who's ''a lout with language.'' Arguing at length against such a pushover of an antagonist, Mr. Stoppard's literate hero seems to be engaging in rhetorical overkill. To be sure, the play has its counterbalancing virtues: endlessly funny asides about topics as varied as digital watches and Maria Callas, razor-sharp repartee and, in Act II, some heartfelt confrontations between Henry and his various female foils (a smart teen-age daughter most notably among them). When this comedy is seen in New York, as it should be -one hopes that Mr. Stoppard will strip away the clutter and allow the promising real play in ''The Real Thing'' to emerge. The work might also benefit from more sympathetic casting. Mr. Rees, last seen as Nicholas Nickleby, and Miss Kendal, a delight in Mr. Stoppard's ''On the Razzle'' in London last year, are both superb actors. But there doesn't seem to be much sexual rapport between them, and, until the end, Mr. Rees goes a bit overboard in accentuating the stiff rationality of the repressed Henry. Paragon of Selfless Affection As it happens, one ideal couple for ''The Real Thing'' can be found at the Barbican Theater, where the director Terry Hands has mounted an exquisite ''Much Ado About Nothing'' with the Royal Shakespeare Company. As Benedick and Beatrice - two lovers who, like Mr. Stoppard's, mask feeling with wit - Derek Jacobi and Sinead Cusack slowly but surely arrive at a state of rapture that is intoxicating. Miss Cusack, tomboyish at first, melts into femininity as she moves from battling her co-star to embracing him. Mr. Jacobi - generally not the most romantic of leading men -steadily simplifies an initially broad performance until he seems a shy and kindly paragon of selfless affection. We feel as if we're watching Shakespeare's progressively more lilting and poetic language purify and reshape Benedick's soul. The world in which this pair's war of words unfolds, designed by Ralph Koltai, is a Rembrandt-hued box filled with mirrory surfaces, starry nights and shimmering music (by Nigel Hess). By the happy ending, all the superflous furnishings have vanished and the whole setting seems to twirl in heaven. The audience levitates as well. This ''Much Ado'' is one of those rare occasions when, even after the curtain calls, no one in the theater wants to go home.

928-> No Headline
The Worm and the Apple If Fishermen, Why Not Bikers? We recently awarded worms to Police Commissioner McGuire and Transportation Commissioner Ameruso of New York for their indifference to reckless cyclists. Too many bikers careen through crowded Manhattan streets at top speed, ignoring traffic lights and one-way signs. Their only gesture to safety is a whistle whose shrill blasts are meant to scatter pedestrians. The bikers easily evade traffic law enforcement because when stopped they are free to give false names and ignore any summons. Requiring them to carry licenses could make enforcement meaningful, we suggested. In response, Jack Lusk, a transportation adviser to Mayor Koch, writes that the city has examined the idea of bicycle licensing and concluded that programs in other cities ''have had little or no impact on improving the behavior of bicyclists on the streets.'' Transportation Department studies submitted by Mr. Lusk conclude that to license all cyclists, from toddlers to their grandparents, would require elephantine administration for little tangible gain. A reasonable response. But then what will the city do about the bicycle danger? Apparently not much. A recent Department of Transportation report to the City Council recommended bike safety courses in schools, and meetings to encourage cooperation between police officers and traffic agents. None of that addresses the problem, which is how to identify and punish reckless cyclists. Citywide licensing may be unmanageable. It also seems unnecessary. Why not just require anyone who wants to ride a bike in the most congested areas - south of 96th Street in Manhattan, for openers - to carry an identifying license? The police could then be empowered to impound the bikes of unlicensed violators. Sure, there's a public interest in urban bike riding. But saving energy, promoting fitness and providing cheap messenger service ought not to require pedestrians and drivers to tolerate a threat to safety. If the business district biking license is inexpensive and widely available, it need be no more onerous than the licenses long accepted by dog owners and fishermen.

929-> SYRIA IS REPORTED AWAITING MISSILE
The Soviet Union has begun making preparations to deploy a mobile missile in Syria that could reach targets in Lebanon, Israel and the American Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, an official traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last night. The official, speaking in New York, said American intelligence had detected signs that the Soviet Union is preparing to send the missile, known as the SS-21, to Syria for the first time. The missile, which can carry nuclear warheads or high explosives, has never been deployed outside the Warsaw Pact nations. The official said, however, that there was no indication the Soviet Union would introduce nuclear weapons into Syria but rather would use conventional explosives on the missile, which has a range of around 75 miles. According to a Pentagon report cited by The Associated Press, the SS-21 is designed to be carried on a six-wheeled transporter that doubles as a launcher. The report said the Soviet Union produced it to replace a less accurate surface-to-surface Warsaw Pact missile known as the Frog 7. Increase in Tension Sighted Mr. Shultz's aide said the United States would be ''gravely concerned'' if the Soviet Union sent any nuclear weapons into the Middle East, even under the control of Soviet troops. He said that although there was no indication Moscow was planning to deploy nuclear warheads in that region, the addition of another advanced weapon in Syria was likely to increase tensions. The Syrians, who have backed the anti-Government forces in Lebanon, indicated concern last month over the shelling of their lines in Lebanon by United States Navy warships that are protecting the marines in Lebanon and the Lebanese Government troops. An American official said the report suggested the Russians were seeking to demonstrate their reliability as an ally of Syria, which suffered heavy losses to Israel last year and which has to consider the possibility of a new Syrian-Israeli conflict over Lebanon as a possibility, given the proximity of each side's forces to the other in Lebanon. Since the beginning of the year, the Soviet Union has deployed new, long- range antiaircraft missiles in Syria and replaced the fighter planes and tanks that Syria lost in combat against Israel in Lebanon last year. The Syrians, with Soviet backing, have sought to undermine the Lebanese Government of President Amin Gemayel and have rejected the idea of United Nations observers to supervise the truce in Lebanon. Earlier yesterday, however, a senior State Department official said there had been movement toward resolving the question of finding neutral observers to police the cease-fire in Lebanon. In a briefing for reporters, the official also expressed satisfaction at the progress he said was being made toward convening a meeting of the leaders of the different political factions in Lebanon for establishing a national unity government under Mr. Gemayel. Meeting in Rome on Observers State Department officials said Robert C. McFarlane, the special Middle East enovy, who has been engaged in discussions on trying to resolve the question of neutral observers in Lebanon, held an unpublicized meeting last weekend in Rome with William Clark, the White House national security adviser. No details of the meeting were provided. Mr. Clark has up to now not played a visible role in Middle East policy. The State Department official said Mr. Clark informed Kenneth Dam, the Deputy Secretary of State, last week that he intended to meet with Mr. McFarlane. Mr. Shultz at that time was in New York meeting with foreign ministers at the United Nations. Mr. Shultz met at the United Nations Plaza Hotel yesterday with the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, and with Foreign Minister Marwan al-Kassem of Jordan to discuss the Middle East. They are in New York for the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. Last week, Mr. Shultz failed to persuade the Syrians to agree to a United Nations truce observer team, and the mood within the American party then was in sharp contradiction to the hopeful remarks expressed yesterday. The senior official declined persistent requests to provide details on the composition of the observers. A Western official at the United Nations who is usually informed on such activities said he did not know what ''movement'' the senior American official was talking about. He said the only reports he had seen suggested a deadlock, but added, ''Perhaps he knows something we don't know.'' Buildup in Angola Reported In another matter, the senior State Department official said there had been intelligence information about a buildup of Cuban troops in Angola. Other officials said 25,000 Cubans were now estimated to be in Angola, an increase from the 19,000 to 20,000 of a few months ago. The increase, the official said, was a result of the increased military pressure on the Angolan Government from the rebels in the south, known by the acronym Unita, who have reported major gains in recent months. The Reagan Administration has been working with other Western nations to arrange a parallel agreement by which South Africa will grant independence to South-West Africa, known as Namibia, and the Cubans will be withdrawn from Angola. But the stepped-up fighting reported in Angola has seemed to dim the prospects for such a deal.

930-> ROENICKE IS ORIOLES' RIGHT-HAND MAN
After what Gary Roenicke called ''the biggest game I've ever had,'' the Orioles' left fielder tonight had no complaints that John Lowenstein would be playing there Friday night in Chicago in the third game of the American League championship series. ''It's not frustrating,'' Roenicke said. ''John has had another great year. That's how we got here, with both of us sharing the position. And the most important thing is to win and get through this series.'' In the Orioles' 4-0 victory tonight behind Mike Boddicker, the rookie right-hander, Roenicke hit a two-run homer in the sixth, doubled and scored the first run in the second, walked and scored the second run in the fourth. He also walked in the eighth. ''From day one this season, I've played against left-handed pitchers,'' Roenicke said, ''and John has played against right-handed pitchers.'' 34 Homers, 124 R.B.I. During the regular season, the Orioles' two-headed left-fielder has produced a total of 34 homers and 124 runs batted in. Roenicke had 19 homers and 64 runs batted in while hitting .260; Lowenstein had 15 homers and 60 runs batted in while hitting .280. ''But tomorrow night,'' Roenicke said, ''Richard Dotson will be pitching for the White Sox, so John will be playing. The next day, if Britt Burns starts for the White Sox like he's supposed to, I'll play because he's a left- hander. It's as simple as that.'' Before tonight, Roenicke had hit only one home run off Floyd Bannister, the White Sox starter. ''Bannister is one of the better left- handers in the league,'' Roenicke said. ''I'm not sure what he threw me, a slow slider or a flat curve, but when he got it up, I just happened to hit it in the air pretty good.'' Roenicke is 6 feet 3 inches and 200 pounds, somewhat bigger than Lowenstein, who is 6-1 and 180. But they are facially similar, particularly since each has a mustache, prompting the suspicion by some television viewers that Lowenstein, known for his sense of humor, had taken Roenicke's dugout bow after the homer. ''No,'' said Lowenstein, seriously, ''I'd never do that, but I guess it would be difficult to detect from a distance.'' Weaver Started Platooning Lowenstein, who went hitless against LaMarr Hoyt in the Orioles' 2-1 loss Wednesday, and Roenicke produced 35 homers and 130 runs batted in during the 1982 season. ''This serious platooning goes back to Earl Weaver, who was such a statistical wizard,'' Lowenstein said of the Oriole manager who retired a year ago. ''Joe Altobelli goes more for the right-left, left-right platooning whereas Earl used Gary against certain right-handed pitchers. We don't have a Jim Rice on this ball club. Basically, we just go out and play. It's terribly uncomplicated.'' Altobelli, meanwhile, announced that Dan Ford, who missed tonight's game because of an ailing foot, was on crutches but that the Oriole right- fielder might return to the lineup for Saturday night's game in Chicago or Sunday night's decisive fifth game, if a fifth game develops. ''Jim Dwyer will probably be the right-fielder tomorrow night,'' Altobelli said.

931-> A LONG HISTORY OF VENGEANCE
The bombing at Orly Airport yesterday and the assassination of a Turkish diplomat in Belgium Thursday were the latest in a long and bloody history of attacks by Armenians to avenge the massacre of hundreds of thousands of their countrymen in Turkey between 1894 and 1915. Despite evidence presented by Armenians, Turkey has denied assertions that the Ottoman Empire systematically killed hundreds of thousands of Armenians or drove the population from their ancestral lands. In response to the rise of Armenian nationalism in the late 19th century, the Armenian quarter of Constantinople was burned by Turks in 1877 and an estimated 200,000 Armenians in Turkey were slain in a series of massacres over two years starting in 1894. After the Young Turk revolt raised false hopes of Turkish-Armenian reconciliation, the massacre of Armenians resumed in 1909 and ended only after other nations, including the United States, intervened. The Armenians' sympathy for the Allied cause in World War I and their assistance to invading Russian armies led to a decision by the Ottoman Turks to deport the whole Armenian population of more than two million to Syria and Mesopotamia. Estimates of the number who died or were massacred en route range from 600,000 to 1.5 million. Thousands were converted from Christianity to Islam, and only a few hundred thousand escaped deportation. Allied promises to set up an independent Armenian state were never carried out and an Armenian Soviet Republic under the protection of the newly founded Soviet Union was proclaimed by the Armenian Communist Party in 1920.

932-> NAVY STUNG BY CRITICISM, DEFENDS COST OF BOMBING RAID IN LEBANON
A senior United States admiral said today that information about Syrian antiaircraft batteries in Lebanon was inadequate and American pilots encountered more intense fire than they expected during Sunday's bombing raid. The admiral, who declined to be identified, said in a briefing that this was among the reasons for the American losses. Two planes were shot down, one of them crashing into a Lebanese home, severely injuring a dozen civilians. A third plane was damaged but made it back to its carrier. One American airman was killed and another captured. The admiral said the losses were within the bounds of what was militarily acceptable, given the intensity of the hostile fire. About 40 missiles and thousands of antiaircraft rounds were fired at the 28 planes. The admiral acknowledged that the battleship New Jersey's nine 16-inch guns could have accomplished the mission without exposing American pilots and planes. He said he did not know why the New Jersey had not been used. Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat who is a candidate for his party's 1984 Presidential nomination, and Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat, urged that Congress be recalled to discuss the military actions in Lebanon. Senator Hart said: ''In light of this weekend's actions and the danger of future attacks on United States military personnel, it is time to call Congress back to reopen the question of military involvement in Lebanon.'' Mr. Panetta said: ''This is not the time for Congress to be sitting at home getting the news on television. We must not affirm by our silence broader military action than we were willing to authorize by our vote.'' The Navy, stung by criticism of Sunday's raid, had invited reporters to hear the admiral's explanation. Among the critics were two former Israeli Air Force commanders, Maj. Gen. Mordechai Hod and Maj. Gen. Benny Peled. General Hod said that, ''on the purely military level the American operation cannot be called a success.'' General Peled said, ''The American pilots paid for a lack of experience.'' Another retired Israeli officer, Maj. Gen. Avraham Adan, said he was not surprised that the Americans had lost two planes. ''Their naval air equipment is generally good,'' he said, ''but when it comes to tactics and precise planning, they are not as good as us.'' In the briefing, the United States admiral defended the tactics of the raid as ''classic,'' the A-6 and A-7 planes as '''capable,'' and the pilots as '''the best in the world.'' He said the 28 planes from the carriers Independence and Kennedy had crossed the coast at 20,000 feet, descended to 10,000 feet for the bombing run, and dived at a 45-degree angle to release their bombs at 3,000 feet. Visibility Is Called Poor The admiral said a morning haze over the targets had hampered visibility. But he said pilots were able to see antiaircraft batteries and radar dishes at three target sites. Visibility was required, the admiral said, because some antiaircraft guns and missile launchers were mobile and could have been moved after reconnaissance on Saturday. The pilots also needed visibility to limit damage outside the targets themselves, he said. The admiral was unable to say why the hostile fire during the bombing raid had been more intense than expected. The reconnaissance planes that flew over the target area the day before also drew fire, and that was the reason for the reprisal strike. Concerning the battleship New Jersey, the admiral said in response to questions that ''the New Jersey has the capability to attack all 20 targets'' from 18 to 20 miles at sea. He said a forward air controller or a spotter on the ground could have been used to direct fire. The admiral said the decision for an air strike had been made by the commander on the scene. That is Rear Adm. Jerry O. Tuttle, commander of Carrier Group Two in the Mediterranean. Admiral Tuttle is an aviator, according to Navy records.

938-> KITCHEN EQUIPMENT; INSULATED COOKIE SHEET
ABAKING sheet is something many home cooks take for granted - such a mundane utensil that little thought goes into the purchase. I have learned over the years that the quality of a baking sheet can make a vast difference in the results. I have always favored heavy-gauge black steel baking sheets because they offer the most even heat distribution, insuring a nicely textured tart crust. When you are baking cookies they minimize the risk of burning the bottoms. Thin aluminum baking sheets are undesirable because they can have hot spots; they can also warp in a hot oven. A company called Rema Bakeware in Salina, Kan., has introduced a baking sheet that may be even better than the black steel ones. Called the Cushion Aire insulated baking sheet and measuring 14 by 16 1/4 inches, it is made of two sheets of aluminum with an air pocket between. When you are baking in a conventional home oven, heat comes up from below, which is why cookies on a thin sheet will burn on the bottom before the tops are done. The air cushion in the new sheet acts as an insulator, taking the brunt of that intense heat and distributing it evenly across the surface. This is not to say that it is impossible to burn things, but the risk is far smaller. As with any baking sheet, this one should be well greased before use. Here is one of my favorite recipes for holiday cookies.

940-> CHICAGO WRITERS WINCE AT THEIR REGIONAL LABEL
Chicago novelists complain that they are still classified as regional writers even though their city continues to have a rich literary life built on the traditions of Theodore Dreiser, Nelson Algren, James T. Farrell, Ben Hecht and Richard Wright. Chicago, they maintain, cannot shake A. J. Liebling's label of ''The Second City''; as far as writers are concerned it is viewed as a place where good authors start out, begin to sell and grab their already packed suitcases and head east. Those who remain are suspect, they believe, with the notable exception of Saul Bellow, who is seen as so big that he can live anywhere he wants. Regionalism was the point that emerged frequently at ''Write On Chicago,'' a five-day gathering of authors at the Cultural Center sponsored by the Public Library. Participating were successful writers who have their roots here and others who have chosen Chicago as the locale from which they hope to ''make it.'' There is a good deal of fiction being written here, as the conference's readings affirmed. Harry Mark Petrakis, Leon Forrest, Bette Howland and Florence Cohen were among those authors who read from their own works. But the feeling of being trapped in a ''regionalism'' classification persisted. Some Seen as 'Chicago Writers' ''Writing from here, you have to win one of the major awards, the Pulitzer, the National Book Award or the Nobel before you are labeled a writer of the cosmos and not just Chicago,'' said William Brashler, whose novels are set in the city and which, despite his protests, are often seen as ''Chicago books.'' ''People think Chicago is a brute, a wrestler,'' said Eugene Kennedy, whose recent novel ''Queen Bee'' is about a woman's climb to become mayor of Chicago. ''The term 'Chicago writer' has become devalued,'' said Michael Anania, a poet whose first novel, ''The Red Menace,'' is to be published this winter. While much of poetry, especially black poetry, and drama have retained strong Chicago identities, it was argued that the old ''Chicago School'' identity is no longer appropriate because the city itself has changed. The traditional Chicago writing school, from the late 19th century through the 1930's or 40's, was ''the response of the writer to the modern urban industrial capitalist,'' said Carl Smith, a professor of English at Northwestern. Out of this response, he said, came Carl Sandburg's ''City of Big Shoulders,'' Mr. Algren's ''City on the Make,'' Mr. Bellow's ''Adventures of Augie March,'' James T. Farrell's ''Studs Lonigan'' trilogy, Mr. Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie,'' Upton Sinclair's ''Jungle,'' and dozens of other Chicago novels telling of the city's crushing effect on the proletariat. Old Challenges Become 'Myths' Few participants doubted that Chicago's capitalistic heart pounds strong and that the ethnic neighborhoods remain its soul, but many participants noted that it had evolved into an international business center, a different place than that which challenged the older writers. ''Anyone who continues to write in the strong Chicago tradition, as does J. Robert Nash, about tough guys and criminals, is writing about the myths of Chicago,'' Mr. Anania said. ''The city has an influence on individual writers,'' said Lee Webster, editor of Another Chicago magazine, one of the city's several dozen literary magazines. ''But there is no school, no genre, and the city doesn't necessarily have a unitary influence on the writers anymore.'' Another author, James Park Sloan, maintained that ''Chicago is a city with a character that writers respond to.'' ''It does put its imprint on the people who live there,'' he said. ''But there are two sides to that. Great literature is often about the aspirations of the human heart, and the defeat of them. Chicago is an underdog. Its literature looks at people predestined to defeat early in their life. It's drawn from the Chicago ethic, which is a shrinking from the extreme definitions of excellence.'' He said that some Chicago works fall short because ''great literature is about the great losing, not about losers.''

941-> VOLCKER SUGGESTS HE MAY NOT SERVE FULL 4-YEAR TERM
Paul A. Volcker indicated today that he might not remain as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for the full four years of a second term, and that he might resign in the months following the Presidential election next year. ''I don't want to absolutely promise that I would stay the full, four-year term,'' Mr. Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee during confirmation hearings on his reappointment to lead the central bank. In his comments on monetary policy, Mr. Volcker confirmed what Wall Street has been saying for weeks about Federal Reserve policy: that the central bank had already acted to tighten the availability of credit, and that these steps had pushed up interest rates about a percentage point since May. Policy Deliberations But Mr. Volcker said the tightening had not been enough to upset an economy that appeared to be growing satisfactorily. Mr. Volcker referred to the closed-door, two-day meeting this week of the Open Market Committee, the bank's principal policy-making body, when he said: ''I don't think you will find these decisions terribly dramatic.'' This was taken as a suggestion that the committee did not decide upon a severe tightening of the basic money supply, which many conservative economists believe has been growing at a pace that could lead to a new bout of inflation. The committee usually keeps its minutes secret for six weeks. Because Mr. Volcker's characterization of monetary policy had been widely anticipated on Wall Street, his comments did not affect stock prices, nor trading in Government securities. No New Insights Michael Sherman, chairman of the investment policy committee of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., said Mr. Volcker's testimony ''came in right where the market thought it would.'' Analysts said the chairman's remarks contained no new insights into what the Federal Reserve might do to interest rates. Nor was there any clear indication of how the board would face the problem of trying to prevent new inflation by curbing the growth of the money supply, without at the same time pushing up interest rates to the point where they would choke off the economic recovery that began last November. Mr. Volcker's comments about the length of his second term as chairman, which is to start Aug.6, drew a strong reaction from William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is the ranking minority member of the committee: ''I'm somewhat shaken by this notion that you might not serve a full, four-year term,'' he said. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat from Maryland, asked Mr. Volcker whether a newly elected President should have the authority to name his own chairman. ''On balance,'' Mr. Volcker said, ''I think that's desirable.'' Mr. Volcker said that if a newly elected President chose his own bank chairman, he could avoid the policy conflicts that have dogged Presidents and chairmen for years, including Mr. Reagan and Mr. Volcker. No time for such an appointment is ideal, he said, ''but the least worse time for picking a Federal Reserve chairman might be a year or so after a Presidential election.'' Mr. Volcker did not actually say he would resign early. ''What I don't want to do is to suggest to the committee that I don't feel obligated to stay the full term,'' he said. ''But I don't want to suggest there's a commitment one way or another.'' Was Mr. Volcker saying, in fact, that he would resign, perhaps sometime in 1985, Senator Proxmire was asked after the hearing. ''I think that's the way President Reagan understands it,'' he replied. ''Now that he said it, yes, I think he'll go.'' Two Cigars in 3 1/2 Hours Mr. Volcker was on stage throughout the three-and-a-half-hour hearing, facing his interrogators from a small table covered with green felt, with a black looseleaf notebook he never consulted and a legal pad. Fifteen television cameras were trained on him from one corner, and a score of still photographers bobbed around him, shooting portraits barely four feet from his chin. During his appearance, Mr. Volcker smoked two long cigars. The audience, mostly from a financial community that has been skittish about Federal Reserve policies in recent weeks, filled the seats and lined the walls of the Senate Russell Building's large caucus room. ''I realize it's facetious,'' said Robert D. Allen, a partner of Albert Ehinger & Partners, a Wall Street firms that deals in Government securities, ''but the question I'd ask him is, how's his health? If it's O.K., I'd confirm him.'' It was one question that wasn't asked. Senate Approval Likely Mr. Volcker ran into surprisingly little criticism of the Federal Reserve policies that many say contributed to the long 1981-82 recession. Thus, the committee's proceedings seemed to be a further sign that Mr. Volcker would be confirmed by the full Senate. Jake Garn, the Utah Republican who is the committee chairman, said the committee would vote on its recommendation after Mr. Volcker returned to Capitol Hill next week to testify in more detail on monetary policy. ''I have to say that the vote will not be unanimous,'' said Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee. He said Mr. Volcker ''must bear responsibility for the dismal performance of the economy.'' Mr. Volcker and many members of the committee cited one cloud over the economy that the Fed can do nothing about - the Federal budget deficit of $200 billion this year. Spending and taxes, the tools that affect the deficit, are the province of Congress. ''We are the only people under the Constituion with the ability to change that,'' said Senator Garn, who has often termed the deficit the root of the economy's difficulties. Competition for Credit Mr. Volcker, like most mainstream economists, contends that borrowing to finance the deficit makes the Treasury a competitor with business for loans, thus putting upward pressure on interest rates. ''The United States is borrowing $750 million an average weekday,'' Mr. Volcker said. ''That's a lot of money to be taking out of the market.'' Concerning the recent increases in the money supply, the Reagan Administration, prominent Democrats in Congress and much of the financial community have contested the view that they are inevitably inflationary. The White House and others have been trying vigorously to persuade the Federal Reserve to shun the kind of drastic policy shift that would be implied by raising the discount rate, now at 8.5 percent, which the central bank charges on its loans to financial institutions. Such a move would signal the central bank's intention to take steps that would push up other interest rates, such as those on home mortgages and credit cards. Focus on Federal Funds Rate Instead, Mr. Volcker said, the Federal Reserve has been acting in recent weeks to force up the symbolically less important Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans. ''You could characterize policy as being slightly less accommodating'' to growth of M-1, the basic money supply measure of cash and deposits in checking accounts, he said. M-1, he said, had been growing beyond the range of 4 percent to 8 percent that the Federal Reserve has set for it this year. But he added that two broader measures of the money supply were within their growth limits. Beyond those figures, he said, the bank is also basing policy decisions on other gauges of economic activity and many of these, he said, appeared reassuring. Should the money supply move further off target, he indicated, the bank would intervene to cool the growth. ''Our aim,'' Mr. Volcker said, ''is to have an economy in which unemployment is reduced and the economy can be prosperous. We're interested in being able to say that through the years - sustaining the advance. It's much more important that that condition be sustained than to worry about next month or next quarter.''

942-> SECURITY BREACH, NOT RIVALRY, SPURRED INQUIRY, MEESE SAYS
President Reagan's counselor, Edwin Meese 3d, said today that the current investigation into unauthorized disclosures by Administration officials was a move against a potential criminal violation of national security laws and ''absolutely not'' a result of rivalries among the President's aides. Some officials, none of them willing to be quoted by name, have suggested that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's inquiry was motivated by White House political infighting and that the presence of Government agents questioning their conduct had inhibited them in their jobs. But Mr. Meese, in an interview today, said the incident that prompted the inquiry was a serious breach of security and should not impede the work of the President's advisers. ''I don't think there are civil liberties issues so long as there is a criminal violation and you use accepted techniques,'' Mr. Meese said. ''It should not inhibit at all the White House staff as far as freedom of expression. It's a simple matter of professional responsibility. If you can't accept that, you shouldn't be in government. The case that caused Mr. Reagan to order an inquiry involved a disclosure about United States military options in Lebanon to news organizations in September, soon after these were discussed before the President at a National Security Council meeting. Other officials have characterized this ''leak'' as not substantially different from countless others in the past, designed by the Administration to bolster its public relations image. Baker-Clark Rivalry The recollection of various officials and reporters is that the September disclosure, which was about American willingness to use warplanes against anti-Government factions in Lebanon, was accomplished in virtually routine blanket form to major newspaper and television reporters in order to depict Administration firmness in its Middle East mission. White House officials casually confirmed the bit of information publicly within a day or two of the Security Council meeting. Some officials, accordingly, suspect that something other than national security concerns are involved in the F.B.I. inquiry. There is speculation that rivals of James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, have pressed the issue in hopes of damaging his standing within the Administration. Aides holding this view suggest that the current inquiry is a ''shot across the bow'' of Mr. Baker's office by his rival, William P. Clark, the Presidential confidant who was national security adviser at the time of the disputed disclosure and is now Secretary of the Interior. Their thinking is that Mr. Clark and his allies believe that Mr. Baker or his staff was the source of the disclosure. Mr. Meese said, however, that the President's only concern was over ''a serious breach of national security.'' ''When there is a criminal violation of national security law relating to national security information, then whoever has perpetrated that crime should be investigated, discovered, prosecuted and convicted,'' he said. An earlier Administration report on the subject concluded that it would be very difficult to build a criminal case out of internal disclosures. Theoretically, espionage or theft laws could be invoked, the report said, but would entail ''a variety of legal and practical problems'' in trying to apply them to the President's closest advisers. The nature of the current controversy, which finds officials ''leaking'' about a story leaked earlier, was characterized this way be one Administration official: ''We've gone from strategic leaks to guerrilla leaks.''

943-> PLAYERSMalcolm Moran; Lovely Day to be Able to Run The rain was falling hard enough
to make umbrellas necessary at 7:45 yesterday morning, when Sebastian Coe went for his run, and the wind was strong enough to turn those umbrellas inside out. On a morning that was perfect only for rolling over and going back to sleep, Coe left his hotel room, crossed the street, and took off on his first run in Central Park. For Sebastian Coe, it was a lovely day for a run. When he awoke, unlike so many other mornings until the last three- and-a-half weeks, there was nothing wrong. He felt fine. ''Not fit, but healthy,'' he said. ''I don't feel I want to fall asleep all the time.'' The amount of time from now until the 1984 Olympic Games is still large enough to be measured in weeks, or training periods; not days, or individual sessions. The Olympic clock is ticking, but not too loudly. There seems to be enough time for Coe to do what he must do to defend the gold medal he won in the 1,500-meter run at the Moscow games, or improve upon his silver medal in the 800-meter run, or set a standard for 5,000 meters. Coe has been able to run consistently fast partly because he allows common sense to dictate when he should slow down. The illness and injuries that have complicated his preparations for the Olympics appear to have subsided. The stress fractures in his left foot and his right leg, the muscle problems, the soreness in his back, the ache in his stomach, and the case of toxoplasmosis, a glandular infection, all seem to be worries of the past. At the age of 27, Coe's plan for Los Angeles is simple. ''To stay healthy,'' he said. He appeared at Somerset, N.J., yesterday to deliver two lectures: A 45-minute session on ''Olympic Impressions,'' and an hourlong talk entitled ''Evolution of 1:41.8 and 3:47.3.'' Coe is considered an authority on those figures: he ran 800 meters in 1:41.8 (actually 1:41.73) at Florence on June 10, 1981, and he ran a mile in 3:47.33 at at Brussels on Aug. 28 of the same remarkable summer. No one has run faster at those distances. Coe is hoping to become an authority on new, lower figures, and another Olympics. He had originally considered retirement after the Los Angeles Games, but those plans have been changed. Next year, after a second Olympics and nearly two decades of competition, had seemed a good time to go on to something new. ''A reasonable point to leave,'' Coe said. He has his undergraduate degree in economics and social history from Loughborough College, and he is working towards a master's degree in philosophy. Now, he speaks of two lost years of competition, and he challenges the idea that the most productive days of his career would be behind him when he turns 30. ''Try telling that to Mike Boit or Miruts Yifter,'' Coe said. ''They'd laugh.'' He is making a series of appearances on behalf of the Kinney Cross- Country championships for high school runners. Coe's schedule takes him to Hinsdale, Ill., today, then Columbus, Ohio, then Baton Rouge, La., and eventually the West Coast for the national championship meet at San Diego on Dec. 10. Before his serious preparation begins, there is this chance to see America and discover new jazz clubs. ''Where is Baton Rouge?'' Coe asked his father and coach, Peter Coe. ''A little bit inland, left, and up from the water,'' his father said, and winked. Together, they will search for the proper training pace. The process will be delicate and the plans must be flexible. ''It's a long road,'' Sebastian Coe said. ''I don't kid. It's a lot of hard work. It's worked out well so far. I've been able to start a little earlier than I thought I'd be able to. It's not quite the rush to get back. The most important thing is I don't have any pressures now, as far as competing, or feeling I have to compete. I'll pick and choose where and when I want to.'' Coe said he may not race until June, and he may use relay legs to develop his speed. ''I have to be very aware of how I feel, probably more so than past years,'' Coe said. ''If I still feel the way I did last year, I have to be careful. Last year, I didn't know why I was feeling tired.'' Now he knows, and he can adjust his training schedule if problems develop. ''It's really a management technique,'' his father said. The management of Sebastian Coe, after the Los Angeles Games, is already limited. A three-inch scar remains in his left armpit, a reminder of surgery to remove a gland. ''He'll never be able to advertise an underarm deodorant,'' his father said, and smiled. The pre-Olympic management - how much? how fast? how soon? - is no laughing matter. ''You can break your head,'' Peter Coe said, ''if not your feet.''

The board of directors of the Women's Tennis Association voted on Monday in Detroit to approve a motion that the final in that $500,000 tournament be a three-of-five-set match. Finals in women's tennis have traditionally been two-of-three set affairs.

946-> Suspect in Trooper's Death Is Captured in Oklahoma Pit
An unemployed gun collector accused of killing a highway patrolman eluded 200 officers for more than a day before he was captured today in a gravel pit, officials said. Charles L. Brown, 46 years old, apparently slipped through an intensive manhunt Wednesday night in a heavily wooded area near his mobile home. The slain trooper, Leon Bench, 27, was shot in the head Wednesday morning after stopping an automobile for a routine traffic check. District Attorney David Young of Creek County said Mr. Brown was arrested Aug. 27 for illegal possession of firearms. Two witnesses told the authorities that Mr. Brown had threatened to shoot the next officer who interfered with him. Shortly after stopping a car, the patrol said, Trooper Bench radioed headquarters for a license check on Mr. Brown. Officials said Mr. Brown's license was under suspension and it was found at the scene.

Two fires in subway tunnels yesterday injured 31 people, including 12 firemen, and knocked out service for thousands of riders in Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Transit Authority and the Fire Department said. The first fire started at 9:45 A.M. in a tunnel north of the station near Carnegie Hall, at Seventh Avenue and 57th Street, and stopped service for three hours on several lines of the IND and BMT systems in mid-Manhattan, officials said. One rider required treatment for smoke inhalation and 12 firemen were taken to Roosevelt Hospital after inhaling smoke and fumes, according to a hospital spokesman. Six others were treated at the scene, the Fire Department said, Twelve people suffered smoke inhalation when a fire started at 6:30 P.M. under a No. 5 train in the IRT's Sterling Street station in Brooklyn, the Transit Authority said. The train was evacuated at the station.

Then the Santas, collectors for the Volunteers of America, spread out into the city's blowy, snowy streets. Kimberley Gambino, 4 years old, from Westbury, L.I., told a Santa named Don Gallarelli that she wanted a ''Strawberry Shortcake telephone.'' ''Well, we'll see,'' he said.

951-> Texas Gas-CSX Merger Opposed
The Coastal Corporation has filed suit seeking to block the proposed $1 billion merger of the Texas Gas Resources Corporation and the CSX Corporation. In a suit filed in United States District Court in Louisville on Monday, Coastal charged that Texas Gas and CSX had used ''fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices'' in reaching the merger agreement. John Blewer, Texas Gas spokesman, said his company was aware of the suit but had no comment. Coastal last week offered $45 a share for 52 percent of Texas Gas's shares. Shortly afterward, Texas Gas announced that it had agreed to be absorbed by CSX, a railroad and energy conglomerate. CSX said it would pay $52 a share for 35 percent of Texas Gas's shares as a first step in its acquisition of the Owensboro, Ky., energy concern. In addition to its merger agreement, CSX has alternately agreed to buy up to 3.7 million shares of newly issued Texas Gas stock directly from the Kentucky company.

From the People Who Gave You ZIP: 10128 A new ZIP code on the Upper East Side, the city's first full-scale change since the system began in 1963, will go into effect Aug. 1. It is expected to create some delivery delays for a while - and perhaps a bonanza for stationery printers. The 39th ZIP zone, 10128, will be carved out of the present 10028, the Gracie Station area, according to Samuel Klein, spokesman for the Postal Service in New York. Now extending between Fifth Avenue and the East River from just north of 80th to 96th Street, 10028 will shrink within the boundaries of 80th and 86th. The new 10128 will run from 87th to 96th. The area contains 32,000 to 34,000 mailing addresses, reducing the growing volume in the old zone by more than half, postal officials said yesterday. Three change-of-address cards are being mailed to each known addressee in the new zone and more can be picked up at any post office. Actually, 10128 will be the city's 273d ZIP code number; all but 39 were created for individual buildings or businesses.

953-> POP: TRACY NELSON, VOCALIST
HAVING been a respected cult figure for nearly two decades, the pop-blues singer Tracy Nelson remains a compelling but unjustly overlooked pop talent. Miss Nelson, appearing with Dr. John's band at the Lone Star Cafe, has refined a plain declarative style of interpretation by inflecting the deep blues styles of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith with varying shades of country, folk and gospel. At her best, she instinctively connects contemporary music to its stylistic roots without transforming new songs into ersatz traditional artifacts. On Monday, the first of two scheduled nights, Miss Nelson was in fine voice and had the good fortune to be backed by a quintet that shared her interest in the relationship between the traditional and the contemporary. Her version of the Supremes' hit ''Come See About Me'' emphasized the bluesy feeling beneath the song's cotton candy surface. More recent songs by Michael Smotherman and Larry Hamilton were treated to stately gospel-style readings. Miss Nelson is no ball of fire. But her thoughtfulness and restraint - qualities that may have worked against her becoming a star - gave Monday's first show a satisfying consistency.

954-> ALL ALONG SWEEPS TURF TRIPLE
Walter Swinburn had a wonderfully close-up view of the stretch run of the Washington D.C. International today. The jockey spent most of the final two furlongs looking over his shoulder rather than looking toward the finish line. That's how easily he rode All Along to a historic victory in the 32d International at Laurel Race Course. The victory made All Along a solid contender for the American horse-of- the-year title and extended her unprecedented march through the major grass races of the world. The 4-year-old French-bred daughter of Targowice won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris six weeks ago, the Rothman's International in Toronto 27 days ago and the Aqueduct Turf Classic two weeks ago. Now she may take it even a step further by trying for the Japan Cup in Tokyo Nov. 27. All Along, who paid only $2.80 for $2 to win, scored by 3 1/4 lengths over Welsh Term, with Majesty's Prince finishing third and Hush Dear fourth after a mile and a half on the grass in 2:35. In winning today, All Along set several standards. She became the first horse to win both the Arc and the International, and her victory was the richest in a thoroughbred race because she earned a $1 million bonus for sweeping the Rothman's, Turf Classic and International. That bonus, which is considered part of her official earnings, raised her career total to $2,439,299, fourth highest in racing history behind John Henry, Spectacular Bid and Trinycarol. In winning the bonus, she beat the insurance firm Lloyd's of London at the rate of 60 to 1. Lloyd's wrote a policy against any horse sweeping the three races for a premium of only $16,500, which was shared by the three North American tracks. Her victory today, coupled with the slight injury that forced the undefeated 2-year-old Devil's Bag to miss the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct, strengthened her bid for horse of the year. Her chances were further enhanced when CBS, which had planned to telecast the Remsen because of Devil's Bag, switched its coverage to the International. That move gave her nationwide exposure that may sway Eclipse Award voters who had not seen her. If she wins enough votes, she will be the first horse of the year to make as few as two American starts, the first to race only on the grass, and the first older filly so honored. Twilight Tear and Busher won the award as 3-year- old fillies in 1944 and 1945, and Moccasin won on some polls when she was a 2-year-old filly in 1965. All Along's competition for the award will come from Devil's Bag, whose brilliant speed has stamped him as one of the best 2-year-olds ever, and from Slew o' Gold, the 3-year-old colt who won the Woodward Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup this fall. Despite All Along's domination of the major grass stakes, some voters will argue against her on the basis of her limited American campaign, her racing only on the grass and the relatively weak competition she has been facing. All Along is by Targowice out of the Vieux Manoir mare Agujita. Those bloodlines sound obscure to Americans, but her sire is a son of Tom Rolfe and a Bold Ruler mare. All Along is owned by Daniel Wildenstein, the international art dealer who races a large European stable, and is trained by Patrick-Louis Biancone, a former French jockey who now conditions 90 horses. May Run in California Biancone said yesterday that an official decision on whether to send the filly to Tokyo will not be made for 48 hours. He and Wildenstein are also considering the Hollywood Turf Cup at Hollywood Park. The filly is scheduled to be retired at the end of this year and bred to Great Nephew in England next spring, but Wildenstein today said there was an outside possibility she will race next year. All Along's victory today was as easy as her 8 3/4-length romp in the Turf Classic two weeks ago. Again she was roused for only a quarter of a mile and won galloping the rest of the way. Eight went to the post after Nijinsky's Secret was scratched because of a mild case of colic. Without him in the race there were no front-runners, so the field loped along tightly bunched, with a French colt named Lovely Dancer leading through a first quarter in 0:26 3/5 and a half-mile in 0:51 4/5. All Along, fifth for the first six furlongs, moved through the pack under mild urging from Swinburn and took the lead after a mile in 1:43 1/5. After opening the lead to five lengths in midstretch, she was virtually eased as Swinburn looked over his shoulder five times and saw nothing coming close. He showed her the whip to keep her running straight but was barely urging her with his hands. ''They don't come any easier,'' said Swinburn, ''but then they don't come any better than this filly.''

955-> SHOULDERS FIND A PLACE IN THE SUN ON CITY STREETS
EVERY summer, without fail, a sort of do-it-yourself fashion that bares a part of the anatomy turns up on New York streets as if by spontaneous combustion. Last year it was T-shirts razored into multihole patterns, revealing little patches of tanned skin. This summer, it is sweat shirts and T-shirts with necklines so loose they simply slip over a shoulder, baring considerably larger expanses of epidermis. While it is usually difficult to pinpoint the origin of these fashion forms, this one can be traced to the spring of 1982, or even the winter before, when Zoran's loose-fitting, scoop-neck cashmere sweat shirts inspired women to, well, show a little shoulder. In fact, those necklines were so loose that most women simply had no choice. The idea can be traced even further back, to when Jane Russell wore a red top that bared both shoulders in the film ''The Outlaw.'' Now women are adding their own touches by wearing tank tops beneath their sweat shirts and T-shirts so that at least one strap peeks out. And sometimes the sweat shirt is so droopy it reveals the entire tank top underneath.

957-> Q & A
Q. There is a plant that grows in my neighborhood that I am told is skunk cabbage. Can you tell me how to prepare this for salads? A. I have never eaten skunk cabbage. In fact, until your query sent me to several reference books, I was not even certain that it was edible. Some dictionaries identify skunk cabbage as a broad-leafed, foul-smelling plant of modest height that grows in moist ground. However, in The Wise Encyclopedia of Cookery (Grosset & Dunlap), skunk cabbage is said to be good eating ''when the thick, almost white leaf stalks are boiled and the water is changed two or three times.'' ''Cooked tender, seasoned with butter, pepper and salt,'' the encyclopedia says, ''all the offensiveness disappears with the boiling. In cream or other sauce, or cold in salad form, the skunk cabbage is delicious.'' Q. Fresh coriander appears in more and more recipes these days. My problem is finding a source for it. I live on Long Island and have a garden; is it possible to grow coriander from seed? A. There are many vegetable markets on Long Island that sell fresh coriander, including the Green Thumb in Water Mill. The herb is also quite easy to grow from seeds, which are sold at many gardening centers. It should be planted in a sunny spot. I have grown fresh coriander from dried seeds purchased right off the spice shelf. Coriander can even be grown in a clay pot on the windowsill provided there is sufficient sunlight. Fresh coriander is widely available at greengrocers in Manhattan, in Chinatown and at markets that sell produce used in Latin cooking. The herb is known as cilantro in Spanish. Q. Many recipes call for light rum and many specify dark. Is there a valid reason for this or will either one do? A. I think it's largely a matter of taste. It would seem logical that you would use dark rum, which has a richer and more potent flavor, if you want a pronounced rum flavor. Light rum would be preferable if you wanted to give a more subtle taste to the dish. If I wanted to flavor a baba au rhum, I would probably use the dark rum, preferring a stronger flavor. If I wanted to flavor fresh berries with a touch of rum, I would probably choose the lighter rum. Q. I have often seen menus that refer to drawn butter, particularly those that serve seafood such as lobster. Is this the same as clarified butter? A. I have always thought that drawn butter and clarified butter are the same. Clarified butter is butter that has been melted and the clear golden liquid poured or drawn away from the liquid sediment or milk solids that settle on the bottom. For what it is worth, there is a recipe for a drawn butter sauce in the earliest edition of ''The Boston Cooking School Cook Book'' by Fannie Merritt Farmer, prepared like a white sauce with flour and butter, using water with a touch of lemon juice as a liquid. However, it is not a sauce of much consequence and does not appear in later editions. Readers are invited to send questions about food and cooking technique to Craig Claiborne, Food Editor, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Unfortunately, unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

959-> REAGAN VISITS TENNESSEE IN ANOTHER SWING TO PRESS EDUCATION ISSUE
President Reagan today urged reducing the Federal Government's powers over education to reflect what he described as its relatively minor financial role. The plan would leave state and local officials with dominant authority. Mr. Reagan, pressing his strategy of making a principal political issue of education, also criticized the ''abandonment'' of compulsory English and mathematics courses in some American schools. ''Maybe we made it too easy,'' he declared at an education forum here, expressing regret that many students were ''not getting the exposure they should get'' to basic courses required for a proper education. The President's comments were offered as he again journeyed from the White House to speak out on the education issue. He moved quickly through a series of schoolhouse tableaux, lunching with teachers in a home economics room and visiting a senior English class here at Farragut High School. He also joined in a panel discussion with Tennessee legislators and educators that was designed to focus attention on a proposal by Gov. Lamar Alexander to set up a merit pay program for teachers in Tennessee. 'Too Soft and Easy' In describing how ''disturbed'' he was at the lack of basic compulsory subjects in many schools, Mr. Reagan recalled observations of foreign exchange students that school curriculums in this country were ''just too soft and easy.'' He said a Presidential commission's recent critique of American education had touched off demands for a return to the days when ''three or four years'' of English, mathematics and science were required in high school. ''I question the abandonment of compulsory courses,'' he said, while emphasizing that he felt the Federal Government's investment in education, accounting for about 8 percent of the total cost, did not justify the use of Federal ''directives'' to reorder priorities. Recalling his own student days, Mr. Reagan said he was once forced to study science and even at the end of the course ''I still didn't want to take it.'' As his audience in the high school auditorium laughed, Mr. Reagan added, ''I guess I learned a little something in exercising my mind.'' Mr. Reagan called for a ''horizontal'' realigning of school authority, rather than what he describes as the current ''vertical'' alignment in which the Federal Government is said to be in a dominant position, far in excess of its budget investment. Mr. Reagan said such a change should reflect ''where the costs should be to each level, based on what its particular interest is.'' He did not elaborate further on what he meant by a horizontal realignment. While the strong role of local and state officials is a tradition in education, Mr. Reagan said, some ''elements'' have advocated a ''nationalized school system.'' ''The Federal Government has sought to have far more control than 8 percent of the money would justify,'' he added. The day was sunny and breezy at Farragut High, where summer school is in session. Mr. Reagan and his entourage, thick with bodyguards and news workers, bathed the corridors of the east Tennessee school with celebrity and lamplight. Two dozen teachers waited for Mr. Reagan in the home economics room. No Specific Program In this latest two-day outing on the education issue, with visits here and to Albuquerque, N.M., on Wednesday, Mr. Reagan continued the theme that he set in a trip last week to Minnesota. He again identified in general terms with improvements in schools. But he offered no detailed Administration program for dealing with the ''mediocrity'' that the Presidential commission criticized in its report in April. Administration officials deny that the current series of trips focusing on the education issue is rooted in the White House's public relations needs. They say a specific education program is being prepared. Mr. Reagan's Democratic critics contend that in concentrating on the education issue he is running, in effect, against his own record of education budget cutbacks and an end to a separate Federal Education Department. But Mr. Reagan expressed interest in Governor Alexander's proposed merit pay program, which would be financed by a state tax increase. ''If we want excellence, we must reward it,'' Mr. Reagan declared. At a panel discussion in the school auditorium, a spokesman for the teachers, James A. Booth, questioned the practicality of the merit pay proposal, noting that the special pay increases would be allotted for no more than 15 percent of the teachers. At another point, in fielding a reporter's question, Mr. Reagan denied assertions by the Civil Rights Commission that the Administration had a weak record in appointing women and members of minority groups to important positions. ''They evidently haven't counted,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''If they look they will find that there's never before been three women in the Cabinet and a woman on the Supreme Court.'' Mr. Reagan said his Administration had appointed ''more women in high policy executive positions'' than any previous administration. Mr. Reagan, whose political strategists are eager to find a positive grasp on the education issue, is attempting to cite merit pay for teachers as a basic distinction between himself and potential Democratic challengers next year, particularly former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. Secretary of Education T.@H. Bell, whose role had been relatively dormant the last two years, has recently been criticizing the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, which considers the merit pay proposal unworkable and which is considered likely to endorse Mr. Mondale. At the panel discussion this afternoon, Mr. Reagan nodded vigorously when participants cautioned that partisan politics should not play a role in the public discussion of the education issue.

962-> CHILDREN TO CHOOSE BOOKS FOR NEW PRIZE
ANEW award for excellence joins the Oscar, Emmy and Newbery. It's called the Irvie, and its full name is the Washington Irving Children's Book Choice Award. The balloting is left to county children in first grade through eighth grade, and the nominees are authors living in Westchester, for their books published in 1981 and 1982. Eighty children's books have been nominated - in fact, the total of all Westchester writers' juvenile works published in the two-year period, according to the organizers at the Westchester Library Association. And 38 Westchester public libraries and about 100 school libraries are eligible to have their young readers take part. Voting in two categories - fiction and nonfiction - began in earnest at the start of the school year and will reach a high point during Children's Book Week, Nov. 14 through 20. Last week, the Library Association announced that voting would be extended to Jan. 15. The two awards will be announced at the end of January. Last week, students at the Todd Elementary School in Briarcliff Manor gathered with their librarian, Betsey Sterman, to discuss the award. Mrs. Sterman, the former chairman of the Westchester Library Association's children and youth section, helped develop plans for the award. Gregg Wilson, 7 years old, said he liked ''Amanda Pig and Her Big Brother'' by Jean Van Leeuwen of Chappaqua because ''it was very funny,'' but declined to commit himself to a choice yet. Meanwhile, he said he was delving into ''The First Tulips in Holland'' by Phyllis Krasilovsky, also of Chappaqua, a more serious work. Noah Leichtling, 9, said he had just started ''Zucchini,'' by Barbara Dana of Chappaqua, and it was too early to tell whether he liked it. ''On the other hand,'' he said, '' 'The Buffalo Nickel Blues Band' - by Judie Angell of South Salem - ''was really interesting and about a boys' band and how they start playing and wind up on TV and everything.'' But these children's choices for reading were not based on whimsy: ''You get recommendations,'' said Ali Richman, 10. ''You look at the title, read the back cover and make up your mind whether the book is going to be funny or interesting or whatever before you start reading it.'' Ali, an avid reader, said her favorite book was ''Me and My Mona Lisa Smile'' by Sheila Hayes of Briarcliff, but, as with the others, she wasn't going to reveal how she would vote. ''Timothy Goes to School'' by Rosemary Wells of Briarcliff was another book she had read. Denise Natter, 8, who announced that she had read 17 books last year, said she enjoyed ''Katy Did It,'' by Victoria Boutis of Ossining, among the nominees. ''Genie and the Witch's Spells'' by Alice Low of Briarcliff was enjoyed by Stacy Daley, 10, and Elissa Konove, 9, who found it ''sort of funny - about a girl who had a witch friend who was always goofing up.'' According to Sara Miller, children's services director at the White Plains Public Library and the chairman of the library association's children and youth section, the awards will be presented at the yearly meeting of the association in May at the Marriott Hotel in Tarrytown. ''We are hoping to tie in with the Sleepy Hollow Restorations, who are celebrating this year the bicentennial of the birth of Washington Irving,'' Mrs. Miller said. ''However, whatever the restorations do, we will maintain the Washington Irving Award each year. Hopefully, we will be able to arrange with a foundation or institution to provide a cash award as well as the plaque bearing the seal of such Irving characters as the Headless Horseman and Rip Van Winkle.'' A unique feature of the award, Mrs. Miller said, is that the children who are selecting the winners do not have to have read the book themselves to vote for it. The books can be read to them by a parent, teacher, librarian, sibling or friend. ''The Westchester Library Association,'' she said, ''is part of a nationwide effort to encourage reading aloud to children and to encourage reading itself - for the joy of it and the benefits it brings to all involved.'' ''The read-aloud aspect of this award,'' Mrs. Miller said, ''also enables children with reading problems or disabilities to enter into the fun of this event.'' The list of titles eligible for this award are available at most public and school libraries as well as book stores in the area, Mrs. Miller added. Other authors included in the list of 80 books are Jean Fritz of Dobbs Ferry, Jean George of Chappaqua, Scott O'Dell of Waccabuc and Ann McGovern of Pleasantville. Mrs. Miller said: ''While we included every Westchester author of 1981 and 1982 this year, we plan to be more selective for our second award campaign. We have asked all elementary and middle school librarians for their suggestions, and we are working very closely with the P.T.A.'s as well.'' But back at Todd Elementary School, Mark Whipple, 9, was holding forth with Mrs. Sterman on the plot line of ''The Friend Stone'' by Martha Derman of Chappaqua. ''I'm not sure I read it,'' he said, ''but it was about . . .'' Meanwhile, Patty Kim, also 9, was extolling the virtues of the book ''Zucchini.''

964-> KNICKS DEFEAT CELTICS
The Knicks took away the fast-break style Boston thrives on and beat the Celtics, 110-103, tonight at Boston Garden. Helped by 32 points from Bernard King, including 15 in the opening quarter and 23 in the first half, the Knicks were in control for much of the game, then kept their composure in the final five minutes, when the Celtics challenged and twice sliced New York's advantage to a point. After the Knicks had piled up a 97-90 edge on Bill Cartwright's baseline jumper off a feed from Ray Williams, Boston closed to 99-98. Len (Truck) Robinson restored the Knick lead to 3 points on a drive down the lane, but two free throws by Dennis Johnson made the score, 101-100, with 75 seconds remaining. At this stage in previous games this season, the Knicks have lost their poise, and often the game. But in the stretch they made 9 of 12 free throws to clinch the game and raise their record to 6-5. The Celtics are 9-3. ''We felt the most important ingredient,'' said Coach Hubie Brown of the Knicks, ''was to get them into a halfcourt game. We did that as well as we could, and when they went to their power game, we did not give them a second shot when it counted at the end. They had 19 second shots, which was a ton in this game, but they got very few down the stretch.'' After Darrell Walker, the Knicks' rookie playmaker, committed four turnovers, Brown played Rory Sparrow for 10 minutes in the second half. Sparrow, whose stubbed toe on his left foot had limited him to only 2 minutes in the preceding four games, scored 9 points and had 6 assists. His most important contribution came with 2:02 to play as he erased a 97-96 Boston advantage with a 3-point play. Sparrow Plays Key Role On that play, Sparrow scored on a twisting underhand shot as he ducked under Robert Parish, the Celtic center. Parish fouled him and Sparrow made the free throw, too. The Knicks, who lead the league in turnovers, committed 27 and that led to 32 Celtic points. By contrast, the Celtics had 20 that cost them 13 points. With Sparrow, the Knicks were able to cut down on turnovers. ''I was glad to be back,'' Sparrow said. ''I didn't feel any pain in my foot. Being able to control the team is a situation that I'm used to.'' While the Knicks were benefitting from King's season-high 32 points, which included hitting his first 9 shots, Coach K. C. Jones was bemoaning the Celtics' 42 percent shooting performance and the 8-for-24 shooting by Larry Bird that produced only 17 points. ''It wasn't getting us into a halfcourt game that stopped us,'' Jones said, contradicting Brown's analysis. ''We have been shooting 52 percent from the field. Tonight, we were missing from the outside. Larry did not have a good shooting game. It's rare that Larry has two straight bad shooting nights.'' Bird made only 4 of 15 shots in the loss to Utah. ''He's got some bumps and pains,'' added Jones. ''And when Larry's going bad and our big men aren't hitting from the inside, we just struggle. Kevin McHale was 4 for 13 and Robert Parish was 6 for 15.'' The Celtics opened with Cedric Maxwell guarding King. If King got by Maxwell, Bird was supposed to pick him up. But King, who shot 13 for 19 for the night, sped by both of them. With a 17-footer from the left side of the key, a 12-footer off the fast break, a drive down the lane and a 14-foot fast-break basket, King scored 9 of the Knicks' first 11 points. ''I was in the rhythm of the offense,'' said King. ''We were just pushing up the ball, and I just got my shots tonight. The other night in Philly, I was 3 for 12. It's like that sometimes.''

965-> MAYOR KOCH'S HELPERS IN PINPOINTING POTHOLES
To the Editor: The sidewalks of New York are no longer those on which Mamie O'Rourke tripped the light fantastic. Your recent two-part news article (Nov. 1 and 2) shows clearly that the price of deferred maintenance is high and that we are unlikely to catch up with progressive deterioration unless a considerable amount of money and manpower is made available. The sniping between Mayor Koch and a group of trial lawyers clouds the issue of personal safety. A Colles fracture of the wrist, i.e., the fracture commonly sustained when one tries to brace oneself against a forward fall, will disable a manual worker or a secretary for eight weeks. It may not be a threat to life, but it is to limb, and to one's earning power. Fractured hips are more disabling, and often fatal to elderly people. No one is so naive as to believe that the group of trial lawyers who prepared maps of potholes was motivated by anything other than selfinterest. And Mayor Koch is on sound ground when he insists on 15 days' prior notice that a pothole or defective pavement has created a hazard. One cannot support a claim of negligence against a property owner unless he has been notified of the hazard. But the trial lawyers have done the Mayor's homework, at their own expense. The Mayor should thank them for it, and then go about his job of seeing to it that citizens can walk the streets of New York, or drive on them, with safety. WILLIAM B. OBER, M.D. Hackensack, N.J., Nov. 4, 1983

966-> AIRPORT EXPANSION UNDER NEW ATTACK
RESIDENTS of Westchester and Connecticut who have recently joined forces to fight expansion of the Westchester County Airport have begun to mount a united campaign to prevent the county's adoption of the airport's controversial master plan. The master plan, prepared for the county with Federal funds in October 1980, calls for $51 million in improvements, including an enlarged passenger terminal, a new general-aviation runway and other facilities for corporate and private planes. The County Board of Legislators would have to approve the plan and its environmental-impact statement before the changes could be adopted. The coalition's plans to defeat the master plan run directly counter to the efforts of aviation and business- oriented groups, who have been seeking in recent years to interest the county in making improvements to the 700-acre facility. The airport, which dates to shortly after World War II, serves as a major base for corporate aircraft, in addition to private and commercial planes. The new opposition group, the Coalition Against Westchester Airport Expansion, says it plans to focus on ''educating'' members of the newly elected Board of Legislators on the plan's ''destructive impact'' on the area's residential communities. The coalition's contention is that adoption of the master plan, prepared for the county with Federal Aviation Administration funds, would expand the airport and lead to increased aviation activity and ''urbanization'' harmful to the local environment. It could also result, the group contends, in ''surrender'' of county control over the airport to the Federal Government. In the words of the coalition's spokesman, Sharon Tomback, the master plan ''would hatch an environmental disaster on all of us'' and ''we could never turn back the clock.'' The county's environmental-impact statement, which must precede adoption of the master plan, is believed to be nearing completion in preparation for public hearings. But county officials have not announced when those hearings will be held. The coalition's formation, according to its sponsors, unites six organizations in Westchester and Fairfield Counties, the two counties that surround the airport. Together, the groups represent more than 15,000 people, most of them Westchester residents, according to coalition officials. It is believed to be the first time that opposition groups have joined in a coordinated effort since the airport expansion issue became prominent in 1980. The groups in the coalition are the Air Conservation Trust and the Airport Concern Team, both of Greenwich, Conn.; Citizens Against Airport Expansion and the Port Chester Airport Committee, both of Port Chester; the Committee on Airport Noise, in Briarcliff Manor, and the Mid- Westchester Citizens Against Airport Noise of Pleasantville. Coalition officials said each of the groups would continue to function as a separate entity, while attempting to strengthen their voice on the issue by participating in the coalition. Mrs. Tomback, head of the Mid- Westchester group and spokesman for the coalition, said the group was distributing pamphlets to residents and contacting local civic groups to seek their endorsements. She said it had also hired a Manhattan public relations firm, surveyed political candidates on their positions on the airport and sent letters to the heads of major companies in the area asking for their support. The survey showed that many politicians favored a new passenger terminal to replace the present aging facility, she said, indicating ''we've got to educate those people to understand that ground-support services are the only way you can limit growth.'' Building a terminal four times bigger in floor area, as suggested in the master plan, she said, would be interpreted by the F.A.A. as a sign the county was inviting more commercial and commuter-airline traffic. According to Mrs. Tomback, a 36- year-old Pleasantville resident and computer-firm employee, one of the messages her group wants to tell residents is that although the airport serves mainly corporate and private planes, it is classified by the F.A.A. as a ''primary'' airport. ''It is not a reliever, it is not general aviation, it is primarily commercial service, the very same rating that Kennedy and La Guardia have,'' she said. ''The way we got that is not because anybody asked for it. It was because of the way we applied for funds. ''The legislators have to understand that by doing those approvals and applying for funds in certain categories, they send very clear signals about the way they want the airport classified in the F.A.A.'s national airport system.'' The coalition leader was referring to Federal airport aid funds designated for the County Airport. The coalition's pamphlet makes some dire predictions. The master plan, if carried out, will produce a ''big'' change in suburban residential communities, the group warns. It suggests that ''another La Guardia in our backyard'' could result and that the expanded airport ''will destroy our present quality of life.'' It notes that the plan places no limit on future growth and charges that the plan is based on ''wrong assumptions.'' Mrs. Tomback said that with the election over representatives of the coalition would seek to meet with newly elected members of the Board of Legislators to discuss the airport issue personally. Janet K. Lockton, a Greenwich resident and president of the Airport Concern Team, confirmed that the two Connecticut organizations had joined the coalition. ''Every group that is a member of the coalition wants to stop expansion of Westchester County Airport,'' she said, adding there were two ways of accomplishing the goal - through political pressure and the courts. The coalition hopes to ''re-educate residents of Westchester to what the expansion of the airport means to their community,'' according to Mrs. Lockton, who said she hoped residents would make their feelings known to their legislators. Mrs. Tomback said the coalition idea followed the striking down by a Federal judge in August of the county's ban against night flights. Airport protest groups suddenly realized they needed to unite, she said. Some of the coalition's work may have already been done for it by an aviation consulting firm hired by the Board of Legislators last January to advise it on airport issues. The firm, Thompson Crenshaw of Falls Church, Va., recently advised Westchester legislators that one major aspect of the proposed master plan, a proposed third runway to serve light planes, no longer had merit and should be reconsidered, partly because of technical improvements in handling air traffic. That report drew a protest from the Westchester Aviation Association, representing aviation interests. But airport opponents were incensed to see $3.9 million in improvements to the airport terminal included in the list of state projects to be undertaken with money from the transportation bond issue. Airport noise, however, never became a a major issue during the recent County Executive race. The reason may have been a basic similarity in the positions of the two major candidates. Both Andrew P. O'Rourke and Ogden R. Reid basically advocated the monitoring of aircraft decibel levels to determine appropriate noise standards. County officials say they are working on such a monitoring system to be installed soon.

967-> FORGOTTEN ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF PROHIBITION
To the Editor: The most interesting aspect of your Nov. 6 Topics item ''Dry History'' is that 50 years have still not been long enough for emotions to recede from false cliches about Prohibition. Briefly, contrary to your assertions, drunkenness did not increase during Prohibition. The per capita consumption of alcohol dropped by a third to a half. Severe results of drunkenness were radically reduced. The death rate from cirrhosis of the liver fell by half (since repeal, that death rate has gradually returned to ''normal''). There were many reasons for advocating repeal (of the 18th Amendment), but the major one, a hope for economic recovery from the Depression, was not even mentioned in your item. The chief argument of the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment was that repeal would bring so much revenue to the Federal Government that the income tax would be unnecessary. Repetition of one-sided interpretations of American history is a disservice to rational debate on contemporary topics. DAVID F. MUSTO, M.D. New Haven, Nov. 8, 1983 The writer is professor of psychiatry and history of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine.

969-> OBSERVER; Your S.P.C.A.S.
I herewith create the Society for the Preservation of Civilized American Speech. I do so at the urging of a gentleman in Kingsville, Tex., who writes that the country needs a revival of the kind of language that once made human discourse possible without savage vulgarity. Many words that are the rootstock of civil American conversation are in danger of going the way of the saber- toothed tiger, he observes, leaving us the poorer for it. The first word he proposes for revival and preservation is ''fiddlesticks,'' a word that people of wisdom and power once used freely to express disgust. ''We are witnessing an insidious erosion, a fading from memory of words like 'fiddlesticks' and terms like 'stick-to-it-iveness,' '' he notes. ''When is the last time you heard anyone but your grandmother exclaim, 'Tush!' '' Preserving such words will help us keep our perspective ''and perhaps allow us to stay in touch with a more genteel time,'' he argues. I find his proposal unassailable. Or, to fall into the spirit of the preservation movement, jim-dandy and double peachy. Here is a man whose sociological thinking has pizzazz. What is needed now are people with the moxie to get the movement started. President Reagan would have been the ideal man to do it, and he had the chance a few days ago when somebody asked him on television if the invasion of Grenada wasn't comparable to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The President could have handled this question memorably if he'd replied, ''Oh, fiddlesticks!'' and moved to the next question. He didn't do that, though he started in the right spirit by saying, ''Well, for heaven sakes . . .'' Since this lacks ''Fiddlesticks!'' finality, however, he had to go on with a long, colorless and unmemorable explanation of why it was nothing at all like invading Afghanistan. I don't blame the President. At the time the Society for the Preservation of Civilized American Speech did not exist. Now that it does, I trust he will take the opportunity to encourage our work. I will even suggest a way he can strike a blow for the cause: Soon he will probably have to denounce again all those people who demonstrate against nuclear weapons. I suggest that instead of some nasty innuendo about their being stupid, naive or dupes of Moscow, he go back to the language of the better old days and deplore their lack of ''gumption.'' I offer him the following line without a ghostwriting fee: ''Oh, they mean well, I reckon, but they've got no more gumption than a bump on a log.'' Conducting public discourse in language of this sort will probably seem to people under 30 as archaic as the front-porch swing and the soda fountain, my Texas correspondent concedes, because of its lack of ferocity. But why should so much American discourse be conducted at the boiling- point level? The notion that it should is quite new. It flowered during the 1960's, that decade of miserable excesses, when it was considered healthy to ''let it all hang out'' and ''tell it like it is,'' preferably in words that had once been confined to graffiti decorating urinals. Crude candor and vulgarity of expression infected the thinking and governing classes, producing even among the elegant a coarsened vocabulary that encouraged instead of calming the human impulses toward violence. Many of the words that became commonplace in living rooms were lifted from the traditional vocabulary of men being trained to kill in war. Thus women who were insulted by loutish male proposals no longer murmured, ''Goodness gracious!'' and walked away. They were more likely to respond in language that would make a drill sergeant fight. Lately Senator Glenn and Walter Mondale, in their argument about the Democratic nomination, have been arguing about which would make a more sagacious warrior in the White House. This week's polls show the country in a yeasty mood about the Pentagon after the Grenada excursion, and Senator Glenn has accused Mr. Mondale of being softer on the Pentagon than he is. Mr. Mondale answered in the usual detailed, wordy and forgettable rebuttal. If the Society for the Preservation of Civilized American Speech had been firmly established, Mr. Mondale could have replied far more concisely and effectively with: ''My goodness! My goodness! Poor Glenn is lost in his own horsefeathers. He doesn't know any more about the Pentagon than a hog knows about holiday.'' Wouldn't you feel better living in a country where politicians could talk like that?

970-> TRIPOLI IS DIVIDED ON ARAFAT'S STAY IN HIS STRONGHOLD
The leaders of this predominantly Sunni Moslem city were divided today over whether Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, should leave Tripoli and eliminate the threat of heavy fighting here. Mayor Ashir Daye and some other local leaders said they wanted Mr. Arafat to go, and on Thursday a similar appeal was issued by Rashid Karami, a Moslem politician and former Prime Minister. But Sheik Saed Shaaban, a Moslem cleric who controls most of the city with a militia of 600 men, said Mr. Arafat should stay as long as he likes. Day of Little Fighting Tripoli and the surrounding area were mainly quiet today in the third day of a cease-fire between Syrian- backed Palestinian rebels and Arafat loyalists, although some artillery shell explosions and small-arms fire could be heard from the nearby Palestinian refugee camp of Beddawi, Mr. Arafat's last stronghold in Lebanon. The leaders of Tripoli have been extremely cautious in what they say to or about Mr. Arafat because, they say privately, they fear reprisals from his followers. There is no central authority in Tripoli. The police do not venture into several areas, and the gun is the arbiter in many matters. Gemayel and Assad to Talk In Beirut, meanwhile, Lebanese Government officials announced that President Amin Gemayel and the President of Syria, Hafez al-Assad, who have been at bitter odds, had agreed to meet in Damascus early next week, probably on Monday. Western diplomats said they thought Mr. Gemayel would explore with Mr. Assad what conditions the Syrian would insist on for withdrawal of his troops from Lebanon. The sources said that there appeared to be little chance of significant progress but that Mr. Gemayel hoped at least to improve the atmosphere. Last Meeting in May The two leaders have not seen each other since May, when Lebanon signed an agreement with Israel that provided for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. The agreement also permitted the establishment of a zone in which there would be joint patrols by the armies of Lebanon and Israel as a defense against guerrilla attacks on Israel. Soon after Lebanon reached the agreement with Israel, which Syria denounced as inappropriate for an Arab nation, the United States and Israel agreed in a separate understanding that Israel would not withdraw its 10,000 to 15,000 troops until Syria agreed to withdraw its 40,000 soldiers from Lebanon. At the Lebanon reconciliation talks in Geneva last week, opposition leaders called for the agreement with Israel to be either frozen or radically revised. At the talks, Mr. Gemayel was directed to visit Arab and Western capitals to try to resolve the withdrawal stalemate. Western diplomats said they expected Mr. Gemayel to try to determine whether the Syrian President would continue to insist that the Lebanon-Israel agreement be abrogated before he pulled out his forces or whether he would accept a revised agreement as a basis for withdrawal. In Tripoli, since the fighting between the Palestinian factions began on Nov. 3, electricity, water and telephone service have often been unavailable. The boundary between the Beddawi camp and Tripoli is almost imperceptible, and shells aimed at the camp have frequently crashed into the city. The fighting started with the rebels also shelling the nearby Palestinian camp of Nahr al Bared, and it fell after three days. A Pullback Into Tripoli With the rebels then concentrating on striking at Beddawi with artillery and rockets, many of its residents and defenders have withdrawn into Tripoli. Some of the pro-Arafat guerrillas have been shelling their opponents from the heart of Tripoli, and their guns and rocket launchers have drawn answering fire. On Thursday afternoon four neighborhoods in the city came under ''very terrible shelling,'' according to Lieut. Col. Abdul Karim Ghandour of the police. He said he did not know how many people were wounded. Government officials in Beirut said that as many of 150,000 of the city's 600,000 residents might have temporarily abandoned Tripoli. 'With All His Brothers' At the dimly lit Municipal Palace, Mayor Daye said he agreed with Mr. Karami's statement on Thursday in Damascus that it would be best if Mr. Arafat left Tripoli and that he should ''leave with all his brothers.'' ''What Karami announced was no doubt the result of intensive contacts and efforts,'' the Mayor said. ''I call on the various sides to respond to it for the sake of Lebanon and the Palestinian cause.'' Wassaf Fattal, a short, heavy-set businessman in a short-sleeved white shirt, said he and other members of the municipal committee that is trying to persuade the Palestinians to take their fighting elsewhere talked with Mr. Arafat on Thursday afternoon. ''We asked Mr. Arafat what he wanted to do,'' Mr. Fattal said, ''and Mr. Arafat said the power is with the Mayor and the committee. What the committee says, he will do.'' Mr. Fattal said the committee had not directly asked Mr. Arafat to leave. But he said the committee hoped to meet with the Palestinian leader later in the day to discuss ''many, many matters,'' including how a departure could be carried out. Arafat 'Willing and Ready' Mr. Arafat said Thursday afternoon that if the city leaders asked him to leave he was ''willing and ready to accept their decision.'' But in a late-night meeting with several reporters after Mr. Karami issued the statement saying that Mr. Arafat should leave, Mr. Arafat said he could not depart ''while my volunteers are facing death daily.'' He said that he had spoken with Mr. Karami by telephone and that the former Prime Minister had also not directly asked him to leave but had told Mr. Arafat he was ''an important leader and he must not stay too long because he has duties elsewhere.'' The most influential armed force in the city is the Islamic Unification Movement, under the direction of Sheik Shaaban, the Moslem clergyman. Since founding the movement, a coalition of three fundamentalist Moslem groups, about a year ago, he has been allied with Mr. Arafat and is believed to have received money and supplies from him. Ninety percent of the people of Tripoli are Sunni Moslems, like Sheik Shaaban, and he is believed to have a wide following beyond his militia. 'An Ungenerous Idea' Talking with reporters today in the bare apartment building that serves as his headquarters, Sheik Shaaban said: ''The idea that Arafat should leave Tripoli is an ungenerous idea. The right thing for Arafat is to stay. His home is with us until he goes back to Palestine.'' Sheik Shaaban, a short, thick-set, bearded man in a long gray gown and white turban, said he regarded the anti- Arafat forces as his enemy. He said he hoped there would not be fighting in Tripoli. But he added: ''The decision is not in our hands. The decision is in the hands of our enemies. If they decide to fight, we shall find ourselves obliged to defend ourselves.'' At the Municipal Palace, Mr. Fattal said the committee had met Thursday afternoon with Col. Saed Musa, the leader of the rebel Palestinians, at his headquarters east of Tripoli. ''We asked him not to shell Tripoli anymore,'' Mr. Fattal said, ''and he promised he would not. He said he only wants Mr. Arafat to leave.'' The meeting with Colonel Musa was at 1 P.M. Three hours later, the police said, the city received some of its heaviest shelling since the Palestinian fighting began.

971-> Joseph H. Weston, Publisher Of an Arkansas Newspaper
Joseph H. Weston, whose mimeographed newspaper, The Sharp Citizen, led to a change in Arkansas criminal libel law, died Tuesday in a Veterans Administration hospital at Poplar Bluff, Mo. He was 72 years old. Mr. Weston, who referred to himself as ''Editor Weston,'' started the publication in 1972 and published it sporadically until 1978. In 1974, he was convicted of criminal libel for an article in The Citizen about a sheriff. The State Supreme Court overturned a jail sentence and fine, striking down the libel law because it did not include truth as a defense or require proof of malice in the case of false statements about public officials.

972-> A POLISH POPE COMPOUNDS KREMLIN'S FEARS
The smoke from the Vatican roof that heralded the election of a Polish Pope in October 1978 can have brought no joy to the Kremlin. Seating the Archbishop of Cracow on the throne of St. Peter would be sure to arouse the pride of 35 million Poles, and to signal nothing good for Soviet dominion over Karol Wojtyla's homeland. That Soviet leaders would have preferred almost any other choice seems sure. Equally, few Westerners with knowledge of the K.G.B. would doubt that, at some level, the secret police and intelligence apparatus would have listed the removal of Pope John Paul II among its options. Murdering foreign leaders has not been a K.G.B. specialty, but the Pope and the situation in Poland by 1981 posed an unprecedented problem. Still, many Western diplomats wonder whether the man who runs the country now, Yuri V. Andropov, then head of the K.G.B., would have countenanced a plot of the sort being imputed in Rome. The average Russian shakes his head incredulously at the suggestion that such a delicate operation would be entrusted to a Turk being run by Bulgarians. Nor do many think that a man as shrewd as Mr. Andropov could have believed that killing the Pope would have solved the Kremlin's troubles in Poland. But speculation linking the shooting in St. Peter's Square to the Soviet leader has created new strains in a relationship with the Roman Catholic church that has been wary at best and, more often, appalling. The strains may be exacerbated by the Pope's announcement last week that he will elevate a Soviet citizen to the rank of Cardinal. At the age of 87, Julijan Vaivods, the apostolic administrator of Latvia, seemed hardly likely to start any brushfires. Yet from the Kremlin's standpoint, the move had the look of a challenge that made some riposte seem inevitable. The Pope evidently calculated that by naming Monsignor Vaivods he would signal concern for Catholics throughout the Soviet Union who suffer demoralizing repression and that by drawing attention to their plight, he might extend them some protection. No Pope had publicly named a Soviet cardinal before. There are persistent, although unconfirmed, reports that Julijonas Steponavicius, Bishop of Vilnius in Lithuania, was the unnamed prelate whom Pope John Paul appointed cardinal in pectore, or secretly, in May 1979. The Bishop has been exiled to the Lithuanian town of Zagare since 1961, unable to perform his duties in the archdiocese. Bishop Steponavicius is a clear symbol of faith under duress. Lithuania accounts for perhaps half of the Soviet Union's two million Roman Catholics, concentrated in the Baltic republics and the Ukraine. But the Pope apparently wanted to name a cardinal without the consequences an announcement might have had on Bishop Steponavicius and on the Catholic church as a whole.(More on the College of Cardinals, page 8.) Catholics, and other believers, have known worse times - when priests and followers were shipped to Siberia without trial to die or languish in labor camps. In 1917, there were 1.5 million Soviet Roman Catholics, mostly in western Russia and the Ukraine. Under Stalin their church almost ceased to exist. Soviet annexation of eastern Poland and the Baltic states in 1940 added five million more who suffered grievously until Stalin died. An underground publication, the Chronicle of the Lithuanian Catholic Church, records the excesses - churches burned, priests and parishioners beaten by ''Communist thugs'' and confined illegally to psychiatric hospitals. One priest died after being pushed beneath a bus, another succumbed in 1980 after a beating that followed denunciations in the Lithuanian Communist paper, Tiesa. Beyond episodic violence, there is slow strangulation. The Government's Council for Religious Affairs sharply restricts seminary entrants and those admitted have often included K.G.B. stooges and people with psychiatric disorders. Night marauders have vandalized crosses in believers' gardens. Catholic children have been ridiculed in school and have been interrogated by the K.G.B. If Catholics are singled out among Christian denominations, this may be because of a characteristic that has always aroused Russia's rulers - their loyalty to a foreign authority, the Pope. Pogroms and prejudice directed at ''papists'' in Protestant countries in an earlier age have never relented here. Traditional enmities between Russians and Poles compounded suspicions of the Polish Pope. From the outset the Kremlin has oscillated between appreciation - of John Paul's support for disarmament, his criticism of capitalism, his embrace of the third world - and more visceral assessments. Sovietskaya Rossiya recently related approvingly that the Pope ''stunned power brokers in the U.S.A.'' by attacking capitalism at the United Nations in 1979, and that ''he further damaged his reputation in Washington'' by withholding endorsement of the American-sponsored boycott of the 1980 Olympic games in Moscow. But a Communist Party doctrinal journal, Politicheskoye Samoobrazovanie, portrayed the ''vice-regent of St. Peter'' as a rigid anti-Communist who fomented the rise of Solidarity in Poland and ''subversive activity'' elsewhere in Eastern Europe. As the controversy over the assassination attempt continues, the Kremlin faces a fresh challenge, the Pope's planned return to Poland in June. It succeeded in putting off a papal visit last year and only a few days ago, a Soviet television commentator demanded assurances that the visit would not be used for the same ''political'' purposes as the 1979 Polish tour, when tumultous crowds gathered wherever the Pope appeared.

973-> A Pipe Bomb Blast Damages Eo
A pipe bomb exploded early yesterday outside an empty Brooklyn grocery store, shattering an iron security gate and rattling apartments above, the police said. There were no injuries reported. The bomb, described as a plumbing pipe loaded with gunpower, went off a 3:55 A.M. in front of the store, Sal's Grocery, at 209 Cortelyou Road in the Flatbush section, according to Detective Mike Gaynor of the 70th Precinct. The explosion blew out the store's front window, door and security gate, shattered the windows of several apartments above the store and caused minor damage to a car and a house across the street, the detective said. The store did not have any groceries in it. The police said they were trying to determine the motive for the bombing. They were also seeking the owner of the store for questioning.

974-> A NEW YORK SCHOOL FOR 'STREET KIDS'
Drum roll, please,'' said a student in the Living Language class at the Satellite Academy on Forsyth Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side. ''Start a beat, somebody,'' yelled another. Soon three girls, who called themselves the Double Negative Crew, put a grammar exercise in perspective through a rap music beat - sharply rhythmic delivery of pedagogical patter. D'ya know what a double negative is? Just listen up and we'll tell you this: I haven't got no money, that's a double negative. What other examples can I give? The Satellite Academy of Career Education, an alternative high school established 11 years ago, offers some 700 students another chance to get high school diplomas. Half of them are former dropouts, at least 30 percent are parents, 10 to 15 percent are pregnant and between 5 and 10 percent have had run-ins with the law. After a rigorous intake process, only half the 800 students who applied last year were accepted. ''Hopefully, after I graduate I'll go to Syracuse University,'' said 17-year-old Ricky Arnau, who plans to complete his requirements by this month. ''But if that doesn't work out I'll go work with my uncle who's in Puerto Rico or maybe I'll run my own business - sell ladies' shoes and clothes- hey, who knows?'' At Norman Thomas High School, Ricky got involved in nearly 20 fights. Before that he was suspended from Seward High School. Alan Baratz, who teaches art and English at the school, says of the students: ''These are street kids, who want to be here. They're bright, but weren't cutting it.'' ''It's not that they've failed,'' said Gloria Rakovic, principal of the school. ''It's that the system has failed them.'' Clearly it's not elegance that attracts students to any of the four Satellite Academy sites: the abandoned public school building, which is shared with other city-run programs on Forsyth Street, or the one floor used for both classroom and administrative purposes in an office building on Chambers Street. It's not even the recently built junior high school used by other alternative programs on Stebbins Avenue in the South Bronx, or the old elementary school building, also occupied by the General Equivalency Diplomas program on Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens. Last year 93 percent of the school's seniors received diplomas. Over the last five years, Satellite either had the highest or second highest number of graduating seniors of all alternative schools in the city. In June, the school not only outscored the borough of Brooklyn in the Regent's Competency Tests in reading and math, but also scored several points above citywide levels. This fall, Satellite finally received a certicate of registration from the New York State Board of Education. The school, which started in 1971 as a program funded by the Human Resources Administration, the City Planning Commission and the Board of Education, was recognized as an alternative public high school by the New York City Board of Education three years later. Perhaps the core philosophy - improvement of academic achievement, emotional growth and exposure to career education options has something to do with the school's success. The informal but serious repartee between teachers and students in hallways and classrooms no doubt adds to its appeal. NEW students at Satellite must sign a code of ethics and a drug c ontract. The code takes nothing for granted. ''Must report to schoola nd all classes every day,'' is the first rule. ''Personal problems w ith other students must be resolved before entrance to Satellite,'' i s the next. As far as drugs go, ''No one is allowed to bring drugs t o school, come to school high or get high during school-related a ctivities.'' A bout 10 percent of the approximately 385 girls at Satellite get pregnant each year. Despite the odds, 85 percent of the students make it to school every day. Satellite students can take a wide variety of offbeat courses to satisfy requirements. Every 10 weeks a new ''cycle'' begins, and course contracts are negotiated with teachers. ''Students negotiate expectations - how many absences and latenesses and how much work goes into an 'A,' 'B' or 'C,' '' according to Miss Rakovic. Typical courses range from ''E.T.'' Chemistry (Experimental Techniques in chemistry) to Harlem Renaissance; from Disco Writing to Rocky IV (Geology). At the moment 80 students are involved in the 10-week mandatory experiential work program. One student works as a clerk at York College, another is a hospital helper at Queens General. Last term, a student conducted radio interviews with the school principal, her high school teachers and others on the topic of tax tuition credit for the program ''Advocates for Children.''Over the summer three Satellite students were the only minority applicants accepted into the New York State School of the Arts on a full scholarship. School spirit at Satellite extends far beyond the classroom. Teachers, students and principal together have kept the school in good running order by painting halls at Chambers Street and renting a van to salvage leftover supplies from a vacant school. One teacher stayed after class so a student could earn extra credit. Twenty percent of the students do not make it through Satellite. But of those who do, 65 percent enter the job market with entry-level skills, and 35 percent go on to college. As graduation looms, the student most likely to be class valedictorian is not the one with the highest grades, said Miss Rakovic, ''but the student who came in with a fourth-grade reading level and is going out with a ninth-grade level.''

The United Nations World Conference to Combat Racism ended today with a call for stronger sanctions against South Africa and criticism of Israel's policies in the territories it occupies. Most Western delegations, while condemning South Africa's policy of racial separation, abstained or voted against the measures. The United States and Israel boycotted the two-week conference attended by 124 nations because of a United Nations resolution associating Zionism with racism. The conference voted 104 to 0 for proposed measures to combat South Africa's apartheid system, ranging from economic sanctions to a complete cutoff of all sports, cultural and scientific contacts. The conference also approved a final declaration that included a paragraph condemning Israel for what was described as intensified cooperation with South Africa and another paragraph about Israeli ''racial discrimination against inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories.''

980-> BUSES TO MANHATTAN: AN EXPRESS SUCCESS
POUND RIDGE HERBERT ZELTNER, a marketing and advertising consultant who commutes to 42d Street in Manhattan by bus from northern Westchester, says his only problem with the commuting service is its popularity. ''This morning was something else again,'' the former rail commuter said the other day. ''By the time we got to Armonk every single seat was taken.'' Vanguard Tours, an Ossining bus company, began its ''commuter alternative'' service a little more than two months ago in competititon with the railroad. Since then, its dozen daily express buses into Manhattan and back each day have been steadily increasing in ridership. John Silvanie, the company's vice president and general manager, said that compared with 35 percent of the seats filled in November, the service's first month, 60 percent were filled in December - ''significantly ahead of what we anticipated'' - and another rise was expected this month. ''It shows we provide a service that is both wanted and needed by the peo ple who live in these communities,'' he said. Vanguard's service here is one of four express bus services to Manhattan that have become available to Westchester commut ers since last June. Carrying about 750 passengers daily, it is one of the fastest growing of the group. It is also the only one in northern Westchester. Until June there had been only one express bus into Manhattan from the county, a Liberty Lines service serving Tarrytown, Dobbs Ferry and Ardsley. That meant the choice for most commuters was between taking the railroad and driving. In addition to Vanguard's ''commuter alternative'' here, the new services are a second Vanguard express service carrying members of the ''Hartsdale/ Scarsdale VIP Commuters Association,'' the Service Transit Corporation's service from 10 communities from Hartsdale to Yonkers and the Liberty Lines service along Central Park Avenue starting at the Greenburgh-White Plains line. In general the express services operate to midtown or the Wall Street area at fares ranging from $2.50 to $4, one way, with 10-trip tickets or with monthly rates offered from $92 to $120 in some cases. Together, the four express services carry about 2,300 commuters a day, based on individual reports. This compares with 90,000 a day on the railroad, now known as Metro-North. Most bus operators acknowledge that they compete with the rails for business, the exception being Westchester County, which subsidizes Liberty Lines. Westchester says the Central Park Avenue service competes with private cars and bus-subway journeys. Vanguard introduced its ''commuter alternative'' service in an area served by the upper Harlem Line, on which conditions have deteriorated for many years, giving rise to commuter organizations that demanded improvement. About $75 million in improvements, including electrification, are under way. But the upper Harlem's debut as a modern railroad is still a year off and meanwhile the bus company is apparently benefiting from commuter unhappiness. Some people contend that if Vanguard and other companies had tried to establish their express bus services earlier, they might have run into sharp opposition by the very people they set themselves up to serve - commuters. Recently a former leader of one commuter group, the Upper Harlem Commuters Council - a powerful and politically influential commuter group - said his organization would probably have opposed the express bus services if they had appeared during the period several years ago when they were seeking to persuade government officials to fix the railroad. Now that the upper Harlem electrification is an established project, he said, the express runs are welcomed as a bonus for commuters. Three of the expresses, those operated by Vanguard and Service Transit, got an unorthodox start in life - encouraged by commuter interests but frowned on by established transportation agencies, especially the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose officials saw a potential threat to the public's investment in the railroad if the newcomers drew away its riders and revenues. The concern was for the state and Federal funds that are being spent to improve the railroad as well as the public funds supporting the fare levels. The express-bus supporters argued that bus-rail competition would benefit commuters, giving the M.T.A. some needed competition and a yardstick to measure its progress. They argued that commuters were ''captives'' of the railroad with little choice but to ride or add to highway congestion and pollution. Eventually, the state's Department of Transportation, which oversees intrastate bus runs, approved two express bus services, over the M.T.A.'s objections. The ''commuter alternative'' was established under Federal authority. Because its routes cross a corner of Connecticut, the Federal Interstate Commerce Commission took jurisdiction, rebuffing the state objections. Of the four new express-bus services only Liberty Lines is being subsidized. The subsidy is paid for by the county, whose officials have said they hope the service will be profitable by early 1984. Liberty's service along Central Park Avenue is the only one so far offering express runs in the middle of the day, in contrast with rush-hour-only service of the others. Liberty also carries more riders than the others, about 1,100 to 1,300 a day, according to Keith Barber, director of passenger services for the county's Transportation Department. Like Vanguard's Commuter Alternative in the northern half of the county, Liberty's service in the southern half has experienced a rapid increase in ridership. Liberty began the express runs on Sept. 7. That month the daily passenger count did not rise above 790. Seeking to make the service even more attractive, county officials are considering moving the starting point back to the County Center in White Plains. In contrast, relatively slow growth has been experienced by the other two services, which officials estimated were each carrying 200 passengers daily. So far, the operators of express-bus services all indicate that they plan to continue and will expand as need develops. Mr. Silvanie of Vanguard, for example, says his company is considering midday express runs and a ''luxury'' service with added leg room, a galley and a stewardess. ''We believe there is a group of commuters who would pay for better transportation services,'' he said. An M.T.A. lawyer, Walter E. Zullig Jr., said his agency, after objecting to express-bus runs and being overruled by the state, had no plans to oppose them further. The only course left to the agency he said, was suing the state but ''we haven't done that, and we will not be doing that.'' Meanwhile express buses appear to be generating local political support. When state officials challenged Vanguard's right to set up its ''Commuter Alternative,'' three County Legislators, Sandra R. Galef, Edward J. Brady and John E. Hand, introduced a resolution of support in the County Board of Legislators. The resolution, referring to the service as ''a viable alternative'' for commuters, was passed by the Board. Similarly, State Senator Mary Goodhue also recently came to its support before the state's Transportation Department. Each of the express services differs in fares, schedules and routes. The Liberty Lines route along Central Park Avenue, designated Route BXM4C, picks up passengers at 17 stops between White Plains and Yonkers. In Manhattan, passengers are discharged at stops along Fifth Avenue from 85th to 26th Streets, with some buses going on to the Wall Street area. The fare is $3 one way. Vanguard's ''commuter alternative'' provides service in North Salem, Lewisboro, Pound Ridge, North Castle, Somers, New Castle and Bedford. In Manhattan, it discharges from 85th Street to 26th Street along Fifth Avenue, then continues on to the Battery Park area. The fare is $4 one way with a 50 cent surcharge below 34th Street. There is also a $120 monthly commutation and a $35 10-trip ticket. By comparison, the monthly rail commutation from Mount Kisco and Bedford Hills is $104. Service Transit, a subsidiary of the Service Bus Company, picks up passengers in Hartsdale, Eastchester, Crestwood, Tuckahoe, Bronxville, Fleetwood, Mount Vernon and Yonkers, largely paralleling the railroad, then drops off passengers along Second Avenue from 86th to 14th Streets. Buses then go on to the Wall Street area. The fares are $2.50 for rides as far as 42d Street and $3 beyond that point. There is a monthly rate of $90 to midtown and $110 to Wall Street. The service Vanguard operates for the Hartsdale/Scarsdale VIP Commuter Association carries members of the organization only, who pay a $10 yearly membership fee. The rates are by the month and are $85 to midtown and $105 to the Wall Street area. The service was started by Paul Feiner, the Scarsdale activist and chairman of the association.

Mathias Jr., a Maryland Republican, said today that although President Reagan apparently had the ''raw, naked legal power'' to dismiss members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights he would damage the agency by doing so. Mr. Mathias, commenting at the Senate Judiciary Committee's second confirmation hearing on Mr. Reagan's nominations, joined Democrats in warning that Senate approval of the President's nominees could harm the independence of the commission. If the three nominations are confirmed, five of the six commission members will have been appointed by Mr. Reagan. Three incumbent members of the commission will be replaced if these nominations are confirmed. Busing and Quotas Opposed Mr. Reagan's nominees are Morris B. Abram, a New York lawyer who is a former president of Brandeis University; John H. Bunzel, a senior research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, and Robert A. Destro, an assistant professor of law at Catholic University here. In earlier confirmation hearings, the three nominees said that they opposed racial quotas as a basis for hiring and job promotion and that they generally opposed court-ordered busing to end racial segregation in schools, positions also held by the Administration. Mr. Mathias suggested that the President was ''mad'' at the commission, which has repeatedly criticized the civil rights policies of his Administration. He said Mr. Reagan was trying to ''exercise his raw, naked legal power in a way that will diminish'' the commission's independence. Good will, Mr. Mathias said, is the ''lubricant'' that averts collision and stalemate between the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government. ''We find ourselves in the unhappy position of considering otherwise talented nominees in the absence of that lubricant of good will,'' Mr. Mathias said. Nominations Are Defended Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, testified in support of the three nominees. He said they were all Democrats and supporters of civil rights who could have been appointed by Presidents Kennedy or Johnson. Mr. Shanker said that President Reagan could be criticized for many of his actions on civil rights but that his nominees to the commission should be confirmed. ''If a President does 200 bad things, we oppose him on the 200 bad things, and if he occasionally does something right, we ought to support him on that one,'' Mr. Shanker said. State Senator Julian Bond of Georgia; Kathy Wilson, chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus, and Althea T.L. Simmons of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People urged the Senate to reject Mr. Reagan's nominees. They did not attack the nominees' qualifications but said it was essential for the Senate to preserve the independence of the commission. Cass R. Sunstein, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said the Civil Rights Act of 1957, which created the commission, made clear that it was ''in the executive branch of the Government.'' He testified, ''As a matter of law, the President may remove members of the commission.'' Set Term for Members Urged Eighteen House Republicans, led by Representatives William F. Clinger Jr. of Pennsylvania and Hamilton Fish Jr. of upstate New York, have sent a letter to Mr. Reagan urging him to support a proposal establishing a seven-year term of office for members of the Civil Rights Commission. The existing law does not specify the term of service. The proposal would also create standards for removal of commission members. Mr. Shanker and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said they saw the fight over the Civil Rights Commission as a debate over the propriety of quotas. Mr. Hatch said ''people in the civil rights community'' opposed the nominees because of their position to quotas. However, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, disagreed with this interpretation. ''This debate is not about busing and quotas,'' he said, and it is ''absolute malarkey'' to suggest that quotas are the main issue. The true issue, he said, is the ''civil rights agenda of the Reagan Administration.'' If people focused on that record, they would find it ''abysmal,'' he said.

982-> A $1 MILLION GIFT FOR CANCER RESEARCH
FOUR years ago, Harry D. Williams 2d, a builder of low-cost homes in southern Connecticut, set out to raise money from corporations and foundations to support research into the causes of cancer. Recently the foundation he set up in Southport received a $1 million grant, the largest single gift received by the American Business Cancer Research Foundation, which he heads. The money, from the J. M. Foundation of New York, a frequent supporter of medical research undertakings, will be used to help two teams of cancer researchers with their promising but underfinanced scientific inquiries. Three other teams were financed earlier by the ABC foundation, as its president calls it. All of the teams are trying to find out why normal cells become malignant. ''The field is one about which we are woefully ignorant,'' said Mr. Williams, who believes that carcinogenesis receives an inadequate share of cancer grants, with more money going to research into cancer cures or treatment. While some specialists at the National Cancer Institute dispute this view, they agree that research in this field deserves to be better financed and regard the J. M. Foundation grant as a substantial one. The same foundation last year provided a $200,000 grant to the ABC foundation. The $1 million is ''as large as any we have made,'' said Jeremiah Milbank Jr., president of the philanthropy. Mr. Milbank said that the grant reflects the foundation's recognition of the ''importance of long-term investigation into the most fundamental aspects of carcinogenesis.'' In philanthropy circles, a $1 million grant would be a coup for even a prominent foundation. ABC has its headquarters in a modest, two-room office overlooking Southport Harbor that Mr. Williams used during his 20- year career as a builder. There are no glossy brochures to attract donors and no professional fund-raisers. Mr. Williams does it all and the style is unconventional. ''I do not try to persuade corporations to give us grants for philanthropic reasons because I do not believe companies should be in the business of giving away money,'' he said. He maintains that business profits belong to the stockholders, who as individuals should decide how they want their charitable dollars spent. Instead, Mr. Williams takes an entrepreneur's approach, telling business leaders that money given for cancer research is in the company's interest. His argument boils down to a few essentials: He reminds company leaders that money for cancer research is an investment in their future because industries can lose millions if the products they make turn out to be cancer-causing. He also emphasizes that employees and stockholders have a large stake in such research because two out of three families will be touched by the disease. With chemical companies especially, he argues that research findings could have a substantial impact on their business. ''We take it for granted no company wants to turn out a harm-causing product,'' he said. ''But supporting research into cancer causes also is a way of demonstrating that a company is taking measures to safeguard customers and also employees.'' He maintains that companies facing lawsuits for liability have found it helps to be able to show ''we have not been negligent, we've been solicitous and we have financed researchers looking for answers.'' Mr. Williams' contributors include some of the biggest industries because many have a chemical division: On the list are the Exxon and Mobil Corporations, Monsanto and Schering Plough, Union Carbide and Proctor & Gamble, Dow Chemical and the Olin Corporation. The research teams to be helped were selected by a panel of six people, three of whom were Nobel Prize winners. The selected teams were awarded grants of $600,000 to be dispensed over a five-year period, rather than the more customary practice of one-or two-year grants, which Mr. Williams argued left the researchers distracted by the need to search frequently for financing. Mr. Williams acknowledges that some of his support has come from industries that say they are frustrated by government regulations imposed as health or safety precautions. They say they hope research findings will lead to fewer rules on their business. The three teams now receiving ABC help have all been able to report encouraging findings. One is headed by Dr. Raymond L. Erikson, professor of pathology at the University of Colorado, who is studying the action of amino acids called peptides in promoting cell transformation. Dr. Philip Leder, chairman of the department of genetics at Harvard Medical School, is examining genetic control in the transformation of cells to malignancy. Dr. Michael Wigler, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, heads the third team. All three receive a substantial share, usually about a third of their research money, from the ABC foundation. Mr. Williams started on his venture after he learned that his wife, Jayne, had cancer. Although he had no medical background - he was a Yale-educated economist - he set out to try to understand his wife's illness. His choice, he said, was to spend eight years studying and hope to become a specialist or raise money that would finance the best scientific talent available. He opted for fund-raising. ''I'm a businessman,'' he said. ''I know how to put together people and money and make things happen.'' Mr. Williams,who has retired from home-construction to devote himself to the foundation, says he generally finds that company executives are sympathetic to his approach. ''When I was building low-priced homes, the homeowners loved me but the communities were not so happy because new housing developments had an impact on schools and local services,'' he said. ''I was the guy in the black hat. But now, I'm welcomed and these days, I'm wearing a white hat.''

983-> Strike in Britain Raises Fears of Health Risks
About 29,000 water and sewerage workers went on strike in Britain at midnight as contract talks broke down, raising fears for the health of millions of Britons. Talks adjourned late Sunday night with union officials ''bitterly disappointed'' at a mediator's offer of a 7.3 percent wage increase, less than half the workers' original 15 percent demand. Officials of 10 water board authorities said they were pleased with the 7.3 percent figure. New talks were scheduled for today. ''Save water in every way you can,'' newspaper advertisements urged. Supermarkets reported big increases in the sale of mineral water. The 29,000 blue-collar water and sewerage employees work in the state-run industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The workers in Scotland are members of a diferent union and are not involved in the strike. The water workers' average weekly wage is about $217 a week. The 2.5 million residents of Manchester, 180 miles northwest of London, were urged to boil tap water.

986-> AROUND THE WORLD; China-U.S. Coal Project Is Delayed for 90 Days
Construction on a huge Chinese-American coal-mining project has been delayed for a further 90 days while the two sides discuss pricing problems, the official New China News Agency said today. The Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corporation, headed by Armand Hammer, was to have started work on the mine by July 1 but the project has run into difficulties because of a sharp drop in the world price of coal. The press agency said Occidental and Chinese officials had agreed to discuss the problem while they continue exploratory drilling and analysis of samples in the northern province of Shanxi. The agency quoted Mr. Hammer as saying he planned to go ahead with the project, and said the Chinese side was confident a satisfactory solution to the problems could be found.

988-> About Men; A Wardrobe For Starting Out
THERE ARE TWO MALE FASHION WORLDS One is what appears in the men's magazines and fashion sections - and all too often in the stores. The other is what people are wearing in business. Just at the moment, for example, young people have taken up the fashionable 1920's WASP-Ivy League clothing as a look: narrow ties tiny collars, baggy trousers, bulky tweed sports jackest. To most people over 40, this naturally represents improvement over the era when young people wore torn blue jeans and Army surplus combat jackets festooned with obligatory buttons announcing messages of peace or dire threats; however, and this is a big hovever, most of the people who have the power to give you a job or a raise in the business world still wear dark suits, shirts with conventional collars and sober, medium width ties. The first lesson of business life is that you are dressing to please them not yourself. Of course, this doesn't apply to every profession; these days, art directors and ''creative people'' in general can get away with a good deal, but even in the movie business I note that the dark suit has come into fashion. I suspect that it's about three generations - two, anyway - since the question of what a young man should wear to start out on his career last came up as a problem for anyone. In the 1950's, a whole culture existed whose sole purpose was to provide this information, either by example or instruction. Young men went to J. Press or Brooks Brothers, or their less expensive equivalents in cities all over the country, and were basically outfitted in what their fathers had worn. In the 1960's and 1970's, all of this vanished, or went under ground, under the weight of social change. As hair grew longer, clothes grew more eccentric and shabby, and corporations bent with the wind, afraid that they might not be able to recruit anyone at all. Now, in the 1980's, the circle has turned.Ther are more people looking for jobs than there are jobs; it's once again respectable to have conservative attitudes (including attitudes about clothing) and a great many young men entering business, in fact, would like to dress the way their fathers and grandfathers did, but aren't sure how to do it. Dressing for business has become a half forgotten art, with a certain nostalgic quality, like blacksmithing or sailmaking. There is no area in which it is easier to make a wrong impression or wast money more quickly than in buying clothes. Even the most knowledgeable people have closets full of clothes that were mistakes, so it's sensible for a young person starting out in business to cling to a few basic rules. The first rule is simple: Put your money into suits, not accessories. A ''name brand'' belt buckle or Gucci loafers won't help if the suit is badly fitted or made of cheap mterial. An expensive shirt is nice, if one can afford it, but it's not necessary. Ties, socks and underwear need not be expensive. Spend money on the basics. If you go up in the world you can then add the accessories. For any kind of business career, one needs, at minimum, three good suits. They do not have to be tailor made, but you should go to some trouble to make sure they fit. If you can find a good custom tailor who will do alterations, it's worth the time and the effort. These suits, which will provide a basic wardrobe for business success, should be of a wool blend. All wool is more expensive; all-synthetic material tends to look cheap and shiny, and wrinkles easily. Wool or wool blends have the advantage of keeping a crease; and if you hang the suit up in the bathroom while taking a shower, you can usually get a week's wear out of it before it needs pressing. The material should also be medium weight. Light weight suits wrinkle the moment they are put on, while the heavier fabrics are too uncomfortable to wear for eight hours in a heated office. As for color, my suggestion would be: one dark blue single breasted suit with a faint, narrow stripe; one plain, dark-blue single brested suit, and one dark-gray suit, also single breasted. The lapels should be medium width. There should be at least three buttons on the sleeves. And trousers with cuffs hang better. If yours is a kind of office where people work in their shirtsleeves (the main question is: does your boss work in shirtsleeves?), then it makes sense to buy some good shirts, preferablyy fitted at the waist, since most shirts seem to be made with a hippo in mind. The shirts, in any case, should be white or a plain light blue; cotton is best. Theyshould not have contrasting collars, oddly shaped collars or French cuffs, which are generally more appropriate for evening wear than business. The Duchess of Windsor is said to have once remarked, ''You can never be too rich or too thin.'' This is probably true, but you can add to this peice of wisdom that your ties can never be too dark or too simple. Buying a tie should be easy. It should be medium width, a dark color and a muted pattern, if any. Silk knit ties in navy blue, burgundy or dark green are easy to find and appropriste with any suit. Fancy ties make you look like someone starting out on a business career with Nathan Detroit as your role model. Shoes should be simple, too. Plain black lace up shoes, without fancy stitching or thick soles, are all one needs; and they should be meticulously polished. Since it's considered rude to look people in the eyes, most of us unconsciously look down when we're talking to someone, and the first thing we see is their shoes. Hence, scruffy shoes make an immediate impression. Overcoats are expensive. Here, I would suggest a lifetime investment in one of those Burberry trench coats (or a good imitation) that has a button in camel' hair lining. It's expensive, but less expensive than buying both a raincoat and a topcoat, and it serves both funcitions rather elegantly. With the lining buttoned in and perhaps a camel's hair scarf, it should keep you warm until you reach the point where you'll be using the corporate limo. AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS THE point. If you want to get ahead, you should dress for success before you are a success. Different companies have different standards, and God knows no subject produces more prejudices than men's clothes, but to my knowledge nobody objects to a dark-blue suit, a plain shirt and a dark tie, and why give yourself more trouble than you need? What you don't need is: a bow tie (except in very WASPish law firms, with a senior partner who looks like John Houseman or is John Houseman): cuff links, unless you're going to be a show-biz agent; a tie clip; pens or pencils in your jacket breast pocket; a shoulder bag or a man's purse - businessmen carry a briefcase, even if it contains only Playboy magazine; socks that fall down around your ankles - buy black stretch socks; double-breasted suits - unless they are tailor made, the jackets tend to bulge and wrinkle when you sit down; hats, unless you really look good in them. You may also want to consider the advantage of a gray suit, with two pairs of trousers and a dark blue blazer (with plain gold plated buttons). This creates the equivalent of two sutis, plus something that will do for more informal wear - sales conferences, conventions, etc. And one final point: When in doubt, look at what the man who has the power to hire or fire you, or determine your raise or promotion, is wearing, and model yourself on that. And if he's a she as may be the case look at the nearest male authority figure you can find, if there still is one.

989-> ABOUT EDUCATION
AMERICAN high schools are in disarray because the necessary policy decisions are being left unmade by so many - by local authorities, by state governments, the universities and the Federal Government. This charge is brought by Michael W. Kirst, professor of education at Stanford University and former president of the California State Board of Education, in a policy paper for the Institute for Research on Educational Finance and Governance at Stanford. The paper was prepared for the 1983 yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education, to be published later in the spring. In the absence of effective policy-making by others, teachers are forced to make their own, and many are ill prepared to do so. Students are given choices which, in the absence of sound adult guidance, leave all but the most capable among them floundering without a meaningful educational road map. Crucial issues about what should be learned, Professor Kirst charges, ''are resolved through capitulating to recurrent cycles. This year's emphasis on back-to-basics gives way to next year's concern that electives need to be reinstated to prevent dropouts.'' The policy-making process, he adds, ''is pervaded with politics and pressures'' often unrelated to the students' educational needs. He sees the universities as a major culprit in the debasement of the high school curriculum because higher education ''has lost all sense of coherence, integration, sequencing and priority.'' Professor Kirst finds college students wandering ''through a disconnected maze,'' and since the college curriculum has no common core, the high schools are left in the dark about what is important. Citing the example of California's state universities, he says ''An A in photography or typing counts the same as an A in English or physics'' in determining who is to be admitted. Moreover, Professor Kirst continues, ''As the universities provided more remedial work in basic skills, the need to learn academic skills in high school became less urgent.'' In the academic year 1979-80, he says by way of illustration, the University of California spent $5.3 million on teaching high school-level basic skills, with a full-time staff of 280 remedial instructors. Universities, Professor Kirst says, could have a powerful impact on the high school curriculum if they themselves had a sense of their own students' direction. But, he observes, few university presidents, trustees or faculty senates are willing to re-examine the education that ought to govern the common cause of their own undergraduates. Despite all the public statements about the importance of local control of the schools, Professor Kirst finds that local school boards rarely think about overall curriculum policies. Instead, these boards ''react to lobby groups,'' and the lobbyists generally want to add subjects close to their hearts, thus cluttering up the curriculum rather than giving it direction and cohesion. Schools in that way have been pushed into offering courses on drug abuse, moral education, energy, career education, ethnic studies, parenting, environment and so forth. ''Indeed, the weakest lobbies,'' Professor Kirst says, ''are in such established subject areas as English and math.'' He offers as a fairly typical example a high school in suburban Chicago that provides 252 courses. At the same time, Dr. Kirst found, the states rarely contribute much to the prescription of a common curriculum, except for setting down some minimal requirements for graduation. A review of some state requirements turns up examples that range from platitudinous to absurd. In Maine, for example, the schools are required to teach virtue and morality for not less than half an hour a week, including ''principles of morality and justice and a sacred regard for truth, love of country, humanity, a universal benevolence, sobriety, industry and frugality, chastity, moderation and temperance, and all other virtues that ornament human society.'' Alabama requires a course on ''disaster preparedness'' of all ninth graders. Arkansas calls for a semester course on ''essentials and benefits of the free enterprise system.'' Wisconsin demands instruction on the benefits of dairy products. Professor Kirst hopes that the next generation of reformers may have to come to grips with the central question of upgrading ''the core of schooling'' - the courses vital to all students. Why? Because the days of merely making costly additions are past; money is scarce; the Federal Government can no longer be counted on to be of much help; many specialists will be phased out and regular teachers will have to shoulder most of the burden. ''Low priority or repetitive content can be deleted,'' Professor Kirst says. Still, he sees hard battles ahead. Many students and parents, wary of an unfavorable job market, push for specialization at the same time as school leaders increasingly believe that a common curriculum is needed to clean up the educational chaos. All that is clear at the moment is that the schools will continue to be buffeted by conflicting forces and special-interest lobbies unless policy makers on the state and local level and at the universities join forces in charting a course that puts educational goals ahead of short-term fads, fears and politics.

990-> TV: 'FRONTLINE' EXAMINES FIVE DEATHS IN GREENSBORO
THE gunning down in Greensboro, N.C., in November 1979 of five members of the Communist Workers Party by Ku Klux Klansmen while the Greensboro police were on their lunch break is the subject of tonight's ''Frontline,'' the new public television documentary series, on Channel 13 at 8 o'clock. It is a more provocative piece of journalism than last week's somewhat fuzzy opening program on football gambling, owing largely to interviews with a Klansman-police informer named Ed Dawson, who appears to have played only too active a part in the bloody events. Four Ku Klux Klan members and two American Nazis were acquitted of murder charges in the case by a Greensboro jury. Questions about the quality of justice in Greensboro brought the impaneling last year of a Federal grand jury to look into the shootings. The main focus of the program is on the uses of such police informers as Mr. Dawson, who, for reasons of his own, approached James Reston Jr., a freelance writer, with his story. Mr. Dawson tells it here to a background of television footage of the shootings and of scenes along the route that armed Klansmen took to the black housing project where the Communist Workers Party members were holding a ''Death to the Klan'' rally. According to the documentary, Ed Dawson had been an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a number of years, at $25 a meeting and 10 cents a mile, before being hired by the Greensboro police. The Greensboro police acknowledge that the force used Mr. Dawson, and, indeed, such people may be indispensable for keeping an official eye on groups with a propensity for violence, but as we see in the Dawson case, they themselves tend to be dubious figures, with tainted records and erratic impulses. Keeping them under control while permitting them to function as members and even leaders of a suspect band is not easy, and in this instance, it appears, no one seems to have tried very hard. Asked whether the F.B.I. had ever given him guidelines regarding his participation in violence, Mr. Dawson says, ''They never told you what to do, what not to do.'' On that fateful day in Greensboro, by his account, he played a key role in organizing his fellow Klansmen and leading them to the Communist Workers Party rally. Although the sponsors of the demonstration - ''highly motivated organizers,'' as Mr. Reston describes them, and ''deeply committed people'' -are treated with appropriate sympathy, there is no effort to conceal their commitment to the overthrow of the system. We learn that to them the brown lung disease that afflicts textile workers is ''the sickness caused by capitalism'' and that capitalism is ''an economic system that puts a priority on profits over people.'' Even as their husbands lay daying in their arms, two women give vent to party slogans. One shouts: ''Long live the Communist Workers Party! Long live the working class!'' Many viewers, whatever their politics, are likely to nod agreement with the emotional recollection of a young eyewitness who testified at the trial under hypnosis. Frightened and sickened by the shooting and its aftermath, she said of the wives, ''They're crazy.'' Mr. Reston says at the graves of the murdered five that they were ''far from innocent victims.'' But part of the unexceptionable message of this workmanlike report is that even fanatics bent on provocation deserve police protection - and on the evidence presented here the Communist Workers Party received precious little of that in Greensboro, despite ample warnings that the Klan and the Nazis were on the prowl. The point, of course, applies with equal force to the right of Klansmen to engage in their particular provocations, such as showing ''The Birth of a Nation,'' D.W. Griffith's Civil War film, which glorifies the Klan and makes villains of newly freed blacks. The documentary informs us that a confrontation over such an event preceded the Greensboro killings, and in this case Mr. Reston expresses sympathy for those who tried to stop the screening. The explanations of police officials that there was some confusion over the location and time of the Communist Workers Party rally is rebutted in the documentary by other evidence that both had been well publicized. Mr. Reston is careful to make no accusations against specific individuals, but one need not accept the Communist Workers Party version of ''police complicity'' to conclude on the basis of the material here that, with a semblance of precaution, the murders could have been prevented.

992-> 150 FRENCH TROOPS DEPLOYED IN TOWN IN EASTERN CHAD
French paratroops, backed by helicopters and with orders to return fire if attacked, were deployed today in Chad's eastern town of Abeche. The move came as the Government forces they are supporting pulled back to a new defense line in the face of continued Libyan air strikes. The French move, involving a force of 150 men and three Puma helicopters, was apparently designed as a signal to Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's leader, to refrain from any attack by his forces on Abeche or on Chad's capital, where French paratroops are also deployed. The development came in the sixth week of a conflict between Libyan- backed rebels under former President Goukouni Oueddei and forces loyal to President Hissen Habre, who overthrew Mr. Goukouni 13 months ago. President Habre is supported by the United States and France. Going as 'Instructors' Col. Bernard Messana, the commander of 500-strong French force that began arriving here this week, said a contingent of his troops was going to Abeche, 300 miles east of Ndjamena, as ''instructors.'' Colonel Messana, speaking on the banks of the Shari River that forms the border between Chad and Cameroon, said: ''If attacked they will respond in self-defense. If we are attacked, we shall defend ourselves. We have the means to do so including antiaircraft weapons.'' Reports reaching here from Paris quoted Defense Minister Charles Hernu as saying that France was considering sending more troops here. Libyan Air Raids Continue France has said that the troops are being sent to Chad to train Government forces, but Westerners and Chadians alike believe the French role is to support the Government's defense line with the threat of direct intervention on a larger scale. Information Minister Soumalia Mahamat said today that Government troops, retreating from the northern settlement of Faya-Largeau, which was taken by the Libyan-backed rebels on Wednesday, had regrouped in the town of Salal, an oasis about 200 miles from the capital. Libyan aircraft, Mr. Soumalia said, were continuing intense air raids against a small Government garrison further north, at Koro Toro, 100 miles south of Faya-Largeau on the road to Ndjamena, and against a more substantial pro-Habre force to the east at Oum Chalouba, on the road from Faya- Largeau to Abeche. ''It looks as if the lines have been drawn,'' a Western military source said. ''The Government line is from Salal to Oum Chalouba. Behind them are the French in Ndjamena and Abeche.'' Mr. Soumalia did not, however, rule out a further withdrawal by Government forces. ''It could change tomorrow,'' he said. ''If we are helped, the line could be at Faya. If we are not, it could be Moussoro,'' he added, referring to a town about 100 miles north of Ndjamena. A Western diplomat said optimists had speculated that Colonel Qaddafi would be content with the seizure of Faya-Largeau. But, the diplomat said, Libya is reinforcing the northern oasis. ''We are not yet at the turning point,'' he said. ''The process is going on.'' Government on Defensive Chadian authorities, who have appealed for direct intervention by the United States and France, now appear to acknowledge that Libya has the initiative and that the Government role is defensive. ''We have taken all dispositions to defend Chad, including Ndjamena,'' the Information Minister said. There was no direct comment on rebel claims that they had taken Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Biltine, a town just north of Abeche. The minister also said a ''general mobilization'' was under way with ''volunteers'' being sought to increase the Government ranks. It is not clear how badly the Government garrison at Faya-Largeau fared during the Libyan offensive there on Wednesday using air strikes, heavy artillery and armor. The Information Minister said 80 percent of the survivors of Faya-Largeau had regrouped at Salal. French Troops on Streets French paratroops, meanwhile, were strongly in evidence on the streets of Ndjamena, carrying automatic riles and wearing maroon berets. Their presence appeared to be a flag-showing act to reassure the local population. The conflict pits disparate forces against each other. President Habre's 4,000 fighters are largely men of the desert, used to guerrilla tactics and said to excel at close, hand-to-hand fighting. Mr. Goukouni, whose army is said to number 3,000, was once a guerrilla fighter and comrade in arms of Mr. Habre's. But the 2,000-strong Libyan force supporting Mr. Goukouni is apparently is styled on more conventional lines, supported by supplies from Colonel Qaddafi's large arsenal of Soviet-supplied weaponry. Aircraft have been used, for instance, not only to bomb Government positions, but also to strafe the retreating pro-Habre forces after the fall of Faya-Largeau. Each day the campaign brings news of bigger Government withdrawals and continued Libyan efforts to push pro- Habre forces to the south. The question that is not answered is whether Colonel Qaddafi will risk direct combat with the French in Ndjamena or Abeche, and whether the French Government, reportedly divided on the French role in Chad, will back up its deterrent by committing its troops to combat. U.S. Aid Arriving The United States has so far supplied about $10 million worth of military equipment from a package of $25 million of emergency assistance. Western diplomats said United States C-141 StarLifter transport planes had also flown in some of the 700 Zairian troops promised by President Mobutu Sese Seko to reinforce the existing Zaire garrison here, said to number 2,000 men. The diplomats said the Zairian numbers were not, however, as high as had been announced in Kinshasa. Thirteen Libyan prisoners, said to have been captured July 30, were displayed today to reporters at the Chamber of Commerce building here. Stumbling and roped together, the Libyans were paraded on a low stage in a meeting room. Chadian authorities say the attacking force includes mercenaries recruited in Libya for Colonel Qaddafi's ''Islamic Legion.'' Prisoners taken when Government forces retook Oum Chalouba last Wednesday were said today to include 160 Sudanese, who had presumably been working in Libya and recruited into the legion.

993-> AN INN'S LESSON: IT'S NOT RUN BY POPOVERS ALONE
This is a story of New England country inns, of those who yearn to live, for a time, the country life, and of one family that made the transition from the suburban forefront of the American present to the back roads of the American past. There, they keep an inn, and offer others who have that dream a chance to try it on, to see if the reality is warm, or numbing in its routine. The progression is wonderfully improbable: Margaret Lobenstine's parents left Hitler's Germany in the 1930's and came to the United States. She grew up in Kansas. Geoffrey Lobenstine's family roots were in New England, but his childhood traced the career of his father, a Foreign Service officer posted to distant continents. They met, married, had twins, settled in a tiny house with a postage-stamp yard in Berkeley, Calif., small dots in the mass of population clustered on the expensive West Coast. They worked for the Postal Service. Five years ago, sightseeing on a trip back east for a family reunion, they took a wrong turn from Exit 8 on the Massachusetts Turnpike and traveled a winding, wooded state road between two small towns, past signs for a state salmon hatchery, Alvin Rondeau's Dairy Bar, the Knights of Columbus, Palmer Chapter. They came to the town of Ware. Whereabouts of Ware ''Where?'' Mrs. Lobenstine laughs now, at the pun that has become a staple of life for her and her husband, both 39 years old. ''Where?'' Ware. In Massachusetts, where culture, charm and the historic sights worth seeing are thought to lie on the coast to the east, and in the Berkshires to the west, Ware is nowhere in particular. It is 80 miles west of Boston, off the beaten track, an old mill town of 8,000 souls and one bed and breakfast country inn - the Wildwood Inn. The Lobenstines'. Like untold numbers of stressed and crowded urban residents, Mrs. Lobenstine had a fantasy, a vision of fields and streams, of smalltown culture, a wandering old house, a cheerful hearth. ''I always wanted to live in New England ever since I read 'Little Women,' '' she said. ''I wanted a big house in the country with a wraparound porch. And the only way we could have a big house with no money was to run an inn.'' They knew nothing of innkeeping, of ironing sheets and plumping pillows for strangers, of keeping the coal bin full and the reservation ledger and bank accounts straight, the havoc that someone else's pet or child can wreak, the importance of hot mulled cider, of nearby restaurants, of sights to see. They knew nothing of the daily test of chemistry between a group of strangers come together in one's living room, or the trick of maintaining some private life in a public house. ''I wish I'd had some opportunity to try it out,'' Mrs. Lobenstine says now. Now that she knows the life and the attraction it holds for the untutored, she lets aspiring innkeepers take her place on occasional weekends, to give herself a break and to give them an education before joining the swelling ranks of keepers of country inns. 'Staggering' Rate of Growth ''The numbers have grown at a staggering rate - we are now in touch with about 300 country inns,'' said Linda Kennedy, vice president of the Globe-Pequot Press, publishers of the Guide to Recommended Country Inns in New England. ''I would say that three years ago it was closer to 200 inns that we were checking out.'' The new innkeepers tend to be people like the Lobenstines, who have broken off life elsewhere to convert some old farmhouse or mill or small-town Victorian home into an inn of half a dozen rooms. When the Lobenstines took the wrong turn that led them into Ware, they stopped on impulse and called a real estate office. At the time, they were in their mid-30's. The twins, Lori and Heather, would soon finish sixth grade, and face a change in schools. If the Lobenstines were serious about moving to New England to keep an inn, the time to plan was at hand. They saw two houses. The second, a Victorian just off Main Street, backed up to a park threaded by the River Ware. It had a carriage house, apple and chestnut trees, five bedrooms and three baths on the second floor, and enough space on the third for the Lobenstines to live. After an agony of months spent dredging up money, negotiating from California for the house and for a license from the town Board of Selectmen - no one had ever wanted to open an inn in Ware - and trying to arrange a transfer in the Postal Service for Mr. Lobenstine, the equation came together. New Paint and Paper They moved, painted, repapered, joined the Chamber of Commerce and opened just in time to catch the overflow from the annual trek of city dwellers who had come to watch the leaves turn in the fall. Mrs. Lobenstine is a woman of energy and warmth, able to hug strangers she has only spoken to on the phone. Gradually, she and her husband filled the house with primitive American antiques, artifacts that act as a balm on guests seeking a few days of a simpler life. Gradually she learned to mull cider, bake country breads and tender a cheerful greeting to a guest whose arrival interrupted a family fight. ''For us, there never is a Friday at 5 o'clock,'' she says. But for company, she says, they have had some 1,800 guests in the last four years: law and medical students studying for exams, people in search of their genealogy, young honeymooners in search of inexpensive privacy, old honeymooners in search of old times, people who want to spend time with a game of checkers or a book away from television and the phone, people who like to wander small towns as they would a museum in the city. In some of the guests, their reserve thawed by the fireplace and the absence of clammy city tensions, warm feelings rise like the sap in the apple trees in spring. ''Friendly, real, heartwarming, yummy puff pancakes, all-around homey, caring, open feeling,'' Sam Weintraub wrote in the guestbook before driving back home to West 110th Street in Manhattan. In the middle of this month Patricia Guarino, 47 years old, of Huntington, L.I., came back for the fourth time. She had found an old manor house for sale in Greenlawn, L.I. She is thinking of opening an inn, and she and Lisa Hempel, 24, of Centerport, L.I., who is thinking of being a partner, came up here for a weekend. That Thursday evening and Friday, Mrs. Lobenstine instructed them in her bookkeeping, the inn's routine, and the contents of her cupboards, and Friday afternoon, she went away for the weekend. That night, like nervous parents, the women lay awake in their room until they heard all six guests come in. At 6:30 Saturday morning, as it began to snow, they woke and went downstairs to make popovers and cranberry nut bread for breakfast. They dispensed cider and chipmunk pie at midday, did crewel stitchery in the afternoon, made more popovers Sunday morning, went for a sleigh ride in the snowstorm that afternoon, and worked a jigsaw puzzle till late that night - ''the things you don't have time to do at home,'' Mrs. Guarino said. Quiet as the weekend was, it left Mrs. Guarino convinced she should open a country inn. ''On Long Island,'' she said, ''there are so many more activities.'' Like the Lobenstines, however, she faces the pioneer's problem of persuading the town authorities to allow something new. No one has ever opened a country inn in Greenlawn, near the north shore of Long Island.

994-> AROUND THE NATION; Pact Reached on Defects in 4 Million G.M. Cars
The General Motors Corporation and the Federal Trade Commission have tentatively settled a dispute over purported defects in at least 4 million automobile transmissions and engines, a spokesman for the automobile maker said. However, it remained unclear whether customers would receive refunds for any money they spent repairing the disputed vehicles. Neither Government nor company officials would give details of the proposed agreement, which must be approved by the five-member commission. The case stems from a commission filing in 1980 that asserted G.M. knew or should have known about the defects and failed to tell consumers. As examples of problems, the commission cited failures of the THM-200 automatic transmission; premature wear problems in the camshaft and lifters in the 305-@ and 350-cubic-inch V-8 engines built by Chevrolet from 1975 to 1980 and used in Buicks, Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles, and problems in the fuel-injection pumps or fuel injectors in the 350-cubic-inch V-8 Oldsmobile diesel produced first in 1977.

995-> RUSSIAN SATELLITE FALLS HARMLESSLY OVER INDIAN OCEAN
The nuclear-powered Soviet satellite Cosmos 1402 plunged through the atmosphere today and, if any of it survived, the debris apparently fell harmlessly into a section of the Indian Ocean. The satellite broke apart into burning pieces as it approached the earth. Whether any of the fragments reached the ocean was not immediately known, and Defense Department officials said it might never be determined. The North American Aerospace Defense Command estimated that the crippled satellite penetrated dense atmosphere at 5:21 P.M. Eastern standard time in an area far south of the Indian subcontinent, far west of Australia and not even near any islands. The ''impact area'' was about 1,100 miles southeast of the British-owned island of Diego Garcia, where the United States maintains a major naval base. The Soviet Union acknowledged the satellite's re-entry with a twoparagraph dispatch from Tass, the Government press agency. Close to Soviet Prediction In a statement based on preliminary analysis of tracking data, the United States Defense Department said: ''We do not know at this time whether any portion of the satellite reached the earth's surface intact.'' It was thus an anticlimactic end to three weeks of anxious watching and waiting during which no one could be sure exactly where or when the four-ton craft would fall out of space or whether it might rain radioactive debris over land, as a similar satellite, Cosmos 954, did five years ago. As it turned out, both the time and area of Cosmos 1402's re-entry were relatively close to predictions issued Friday by the Soviet Union. Soviet officials had said the satellite should dive into the dense atmosphere tonight between 6 P.M. and 1 A.M., when it was ''in the region of the Arabian Sea.'' They also insisted that the reentering craft posed no danger. According to American calculations, the satellite's final orbit took it over Scandanavia, European Russia, Iran and across the Arabian Sea. By midafternoon, the Pentagon had announced that the satellite would most likely fall in the Indian Ocean within 15 minutes of 5:22 P.M. American military personnel on Diego Garcia reported seeing the satellite aflame for 40 seconds as it streaked across the sky. The cylindrical vehicle presumably tore apart and burned from the atmospheric friction, as happens to meteoroids falling from space. The impact area was located by the Pentagon at 25 degrees south latitude and 84 degrees east longitude. In an earlier orbit, at 12:24 P.M., the satellite was already glowing from frictional heat: astronomers at the Royal Greenwich Observatory near London reported seeing it in one piece ''like a bright, fast-moving star.'' The Pentagon said that United States facilities to monitor nuclear fallout had been instructed to watch for any increase in levels of atmospheric radiation stemming from the satellite. ''It is impossible to say at this time what the results of this effort might be,'' a Pentagon statement said. One source of American official concern had been the possibility that the satellite, which was thought to still contain its nuclear reactor, could scatter radioactive fragments on the earth. Smaller Piece Still Up A second and smaller piece of Cosmos 1402 remained in orbit and is expected to plunge into the atmosphere in early February. Soviet scientists said the second section included the nuclear fuel, but should burn up and present no problem. Cosmos 1402 was launched Aug. 30 as another in the Soviet series of naval reconnaissance satellites. The Soviet practice is to assign the Cosmos label to nearly all its space missions, except for manned and interplanetary trips and some communications and weather satellites. All military and secret experimental flights, as well as some apparently failed missions for other purposes, carry the Cosmos designation. According to American space experts, Cosmos 1402 was similar to some 20 of its predecessors. At launching, the 46-foot-long cylindrical craft weighed about 11,000 pounds and carried a radar antenna 30 feet in diameter for monitoring the movements of the world's navies. A nuclear reactor, housed in the 23-foot rear section, generated electricity to operate the powerful radar. Solar cells and batteries, which usually supply electricity for earthorbiting satellites, would have been inadequate for the radar's power needs. Sent to Higher Orbit These reconnaissance satellites usually operate six to seven months, about 155 miles above the earth. Afterward the reactor section, including the uranium fuel core, is separated from the rest of the craft and boosted to an altitude of 600 miles, where it should remain for about 600 years, until there is little or no risk from radiation. Cosmos 1402 apparently operated normally until Dec. 28. Every hour and a half it made a complete revolution of the earth in an orbit that ranged between 65 degrees north latitude and 65 degrees south. Over the course of a day, the satellite flew over all of the continents and nearly all populated lands. But Dec. 28, after the reactor had been shut down, Soviet controllers radioed signals for the reactor separation and the rocket firing to propel that unit to its high, safe orbit. Something went wrong. No subsequent Soviet statements have given any explanation. Defense Department analysts suspect a rocket-system malfunction, an improper separation, or a combination of the two problems. Soviet controllers may have tried for several days to fire the rocket, giving up only after the satellite's batteries died. Different From Earlier Case In any event, the failure of Cosmos 1402 differed from the failure of Cosmos 954 in 1978. Then the malfunction, still not explained to the public, occurred before the reactor separation maneuver was attempted. Control was somehow lost and the whole craft, reactor and all, tumbled out of orbit. In that instance, the uranium fuel burned up high in the atmosphere, causing no problem, but several fragments from the rest of the craft survived to fall over northern Canada. The search for debris, conducted by nuclear emergency teams from Canada and the United States, took several weeks. Several pieces found near Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories were radioactive, but no injuries were reported. Canada estimated the cleanup operation cost $12 million and so billed the Soviet Union, which later paid $3 million. After Cosmos 1402's malfunction, the American space-tracking network, as well as the Kettering Space Observer Group in England, began observing three pieces associated with the satellite. One piece, perhaps the antenna, dropped rapidly out of orbit, plunging to its destruction in the atmosphere Dec. 30. No debris from it seems to have reached the surface. U.S. Officials Concerned The other two pieces were the satellite's main body and what American officials usually described as a ''smaller object.'' Soviet officials later identified it as the fuel core. From almost the beginning, American officials concentrated their attention on the larger fragment, which was tumbling and descending at an ever-quickening rate. With the Cosmos 954 experience in mind, the officials became concerned that pieces of the larger body might survive re-entry and might be radioactive. Jan. 5, the Defense Department issued the first announcement that Cosmos 1402 was falling, predicting it would plunge into the atmosphere by the end of January. At first, the Soviet Union denied that the satellite was out of control. Jan. 15, a Soviet scientist said the fuel core would enter the atmosphere in mid-February and destroy itself. Any radioactive fallout, the scientist said, would be within limits recognized internationally as safe. No mention was made then of the rest of the satellite. Teams Put on Alert Early last week, as the four-ton hulk began dropping at a rate of several miles a day, the Pentagon predicted it would probably make its final plunge this weekend. The Energy Department's nuclear emergency search team at Las Vegas, Nev., went on alert, as did a similar team in Canada. Other countries also put military units on standby alert in case of a disaster. On Friday, the Soviet Union issued its first acknowledgment that something was coming down this weekend, indicating that the most probable time would be tonight and the place could be over the region of the Arabian Sea. American officials felt that no such precise reentry locations could be predicted that soon. At the same time, the Soviet Government press agency Tass accused the United States of exaggerating the risks to deflect attention from its military buildup. Even as the satellite dipped into the outer fringes of the atmosphere, at about 100 miles, last night, no one could predict with any certainty exactly when or where it might come crashing in. There were too many imponderables. No More Soviet Predictions If, for example, the satellite hit the ceiling of denser air at too shallow an angle, it could skip off and circle the earth several more times before plunging in. Its rate of final descent could also be affected by the steepness of the entry angle as well as slight variations in the earth's gravitational pull from place to place. Or if the satellite was tumbling end over end in the upper atmosphere, the effects of atmospheric drag would be increased and thus its fall would be hastened. For several days, all Pentagon officials would say was that given the satellite's orbital range, there was a 70 percent chance that the Cosmos would fall over ocean and be of no danger, a 15 percent chance it would fall over the Soviet Union, a 3 percent possibility it would come down over Canada and a 2 percent chance it would fall over the United States. Soviet officials announced no new predictions in the satellite's final hours. By 1 P.M. today, with the satellite down to 83 miles and sinking faster, the Pentagon said the Cosmos could not last much longer - but approximately where it would fall remained a matter of conjecture until almost the end. Russians Note Re-entry MOSCOW, Monday, Jan. 24 (AP) - Tass issued the following statement early today: ''According to competent Soviet organizations monitoring the flight of the Cosmos 1402 satellite, its fragment that is the main part of the satellite's structure entered the dense layers of the atmosphere over the central area of the Indian Ocean at 01.10 Moscow time on Jan. 24, 1983, and ceased its existence. ''The other fragment of the satellite, the fuel core of the power plant's reactor, is forecast to enter the dense layers of the atmosphere on Feb. 3-8, 1983, and to burn up.''

France and the United States have agreed to allow citizens of one country convicted of crimes in the other to serve their prison terms at home, France's Justice Minister said yesterday. The Justice Minister, Robert Badinter, said he and Attorney General William French Smith would sign the treaty today in Washington. Mr. Badinter arrived in New York yesterday. Mr. Badinter said there are about 50 Americans in French jails and 40 French nationals in prisons in the United States. He said that most of the crimes were drug-related and that no terrorists were involved. He also said the treaty would apply to sentences for all types of crimes, but that the decision on whether a prisoner would be able to serve his time in his own country would be up to the prisoner and his government.

998-> Washington Watch; Lapse of Curbs Ends TV Saga
WASHINGTON FOREIGN policy controls barring American participation in the Moscow Olympics back in the summer of 1980 will quietly expire at the end of February. One result: the Russians will get a $14 million check from NBC. The check is the final chapter in the saga of the contract to televise the Olympic Games that the network won in 1977 - only to rue the coup in 1980 when President Carter slapped on the export controls in response to the Russian intervention in Afghanistan. NBC won the contract for $87 million, ending ABC's dominance of Olympic coverage, but it couldn't televise the games after the controls were imposed and it still had a contract to pay off. Even after insurance payments, mainly from Lloyd's of London underwriters, it took a loss of $34 million. The $14 million represents the $8 million that was still owed to the Soviet Union when the boom fell, plus accumulated interest of $6 million. ''We have said repeatedly that we will pay the Russians as soon as the U.S. Government says we can,'' said a network vice president, J. Alan Baker. Commerce Department officials said the Olympic controls were renewed last year because easing them then would have sent the wrong signal to Moscow after the imposition of martial law in Poland. But they cautioned that this year's decision to let the controls expire should not be given undue import. ''It's hard to read the tea leaves on this one,'' one official said. No Word Yet on Fed Chief Friends say that Paul A. Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has yet to hear any word - or even a hint - from the Administration about whether President Reagan is interested in reappointing him when his four-year term expires in August. Friends also indicate that Mr. Volcker has said nothing to the Administration. And some have said that the chairman has made clear to his wife, Barbara, that he will be back in New York by fall. The appointment is bound to be one of the most important that the President will make and will be watched closely here and abroad. No matter what the decision, the appointment will be interpreted as a key signal as to the overall direction of economic policy that Mr. Reagan wants, especially as he moves into the 1984 Presidential election year. Preston Martin, the vice chairman of the Fed, is not talking about his ambitions, say some friends. But one noted that in a recent conversation, while avoiding any comment on whether he would like to be chairman, Mr. Martin did note that he is the only one of the seven governors appointed by President Reagan. Replacing Alice Rivlin Although Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, announced her resignation months ago, the chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees have yet to begin to search in earnest for her successor. Rudolph G. Penner of the American Enterprise Institute, a respected conservative expert on the budget, is still the front-runner. But some committee aides say that Mr. Penner may be too conservative for James Wright, the House majority leader from Texas. But Pete Domenici, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and James Jones, the Democratic chairman of the House Budget Committee, have gotten the search process under way. The two, said one aide, want to have an open process and want to look at other applicants. On the House side, said one aide, the Democracts were informed of the start of the process, but the Republicans were not. Mrs. Rivlin, who was the first director of the Budget Office, has agreed to stay on until a successor is chosen. But it is a little hard to figure why the Republicans in the Senate, especially, haven't moved faster to get a new director closer to their own stripe, given the expected struggle over the President's budget this year. Debt Moratorium Administration officials are saying that a debt moratorium - a temporary halt in the repayment of some of the more than $500 billion of debt held by the world's developing nations - is not in the cards at this time. Officials say that Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and others have already chosen to work through the International Monetary Fund and the commercial banks to try to ease the still serious strains on the global financial system. Any unilaterally declared moratorium would hurt the debtors, since they would close themselves off to new financing. ''It would be suicide,'' one Administration official said. If the world economic situation worsens, all bets are off. But officials are hoping that a recovery will ease debt pressures. Third world countries are expected to set up a debt group to discuss the issue at the June meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva.

1001-> Bridge: On Occasion, a Minor Suit May Be Safer Than a Major
In general, it is true that if a partnership planning to play a game contract can locate an eight-card fit in a major suit, it should not consider game in a minor. But like all useful bridge generalities, there are exceptions. On the diagramed deal, from the International Team Trials in Minneapolis last fall, it is easy to see that five clubs is unbeatable, although the defense can give the declarer some problems by leading spades at every opportunity. The alternative contract of four hearts seems sensible, but it can be beaten. This was demonstrated efficiently at a table where East and West were Luella Slaner of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Matt Granovetter of New York. A Jump Lacking Prudence South's eventual jump to four hearts was imaginative; three clubs would have been more prudent. But the Canadian player who faced the situation did not wish to play in the suit that East had bid. One might expect East-West to bid to four spades, but that would have given them a minus score and, as it was, they emerged with a plus. Mrs. Slaner led the club jack, and as East held the ten he knew that he was facing a singleton or a doubleton. South was in some difficulties after winning with the club queen. He led his spade eight, hoping that the defense would play trumps for him in order to prevent an imaginary spade ruff in the dummy. But the defense was not deceived. East overtook his partner's spade ten with the ace and continued clubs. West ruffed and played a diamond. South won with the ace in dummy and led the heart ten. East stepped in with the ace and played another club. West could no longer ruff, but South was locked in his hand and had to concede a fourth and decisive trick to East's heart queen. At the other table, West played five spades, and was lucky to escape with a loss of 100 points for down two. A double combined with perfect defense would result in a penalty of 500 points. Winners of the New Jersey winter sectional over the weekend were: Master Pairs - Barbara Tepper and Lester Sokolower of Verona, N.J.

1002-> A DRAMATIC CHANGE AT THE I.M.F.
WASHINGTON IN an oak-paneled board room 12 stories above Pennsylvania Avenue, a wiry, grave-looking Frenchman named Jacques de Larosiere, with only the merest wisp of an accent in English, gently but firmly called the meeting to order. It was the day before the day before Christmas and the executive directors of the International Monetary Fund were about to approve a $3.9 billion loan to Mexico, an emergency bailout arranged after three months of painstaking negotiations among the fund's experts, two Mexican presidents, the finance ministers of a dozen Western nations and several hundred private bankers. There have been dozens of such meetings in recent years to approve the I.M.F.'s $21 billion of outstanding loans. But the Christmas session marked an historic change. The fund, created near the end of World War II to encourage trade and help a few industrial nations stabilize their currencies, had been forced by Mexico's nearbankruptcy - and subsequent severe strains in Argentina and Brazil - into a new, activist role, designed to hold together a world financial system under enormous stress. Some are already describing the fund as the world's bank of last resort, the institution that will stand behind third-world countries and their bankers trying to guarantee the good faith of both borrower and lender. ''Looking back from the year 2000,'' said Richard N. Cooper, a Harvard professor and former Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, ''this period may be recorded as a turning point in the creating of a true world central bank.'' Added Robert Solomon, former adviser to the Federal Reserve Board: ''The I.M.F. has sprung into action, with Mr. de Larosiere playing a role as a world statesman as well as a world central banker.'' For 53-year-old Mr. de Larosiere, a rather publicity-shy former director of the French Treasury, the Mexican deal was a triumph. In the negotiations, the fund's silver-haired managing director struggled like a dealer in a card game to keep the players at the table. He warned private banks that had already lent billions to Mexico that unless they came up with more, they might find themselves left with nothing at all. He also had to urge the Mexicans not to quit the game. Many feared in the fall of 1982 that Mexico would simply refuse to make payments on its $85 billion foreign debt, thereby causing an even worse international financial crisis. The tactic has worked with Mexico, so far. But Mr. de Larosiere's task is not over. A package for Argentina, following the Mexican pattern, was agreed to in the last days of December. A package for Brazil is almost complete. Lined up already for help from the fund - which has loans out now to 33 hard-pressed countries -are Chile, the Philippines and Portugal. And if the worldwide recession does not soon lift, the queue could grow. Help from the fund comes with strings attached - too many, some say. Mexico, like most other borrowers, has had to ''adjust'' its domestic economic policy in return for more borrowings. The Government agreed to adjust exchange rates, cut back subsidies for basic food items (like beans and corn tortillas) and reduce purchasing power - all a prelude to slower growth. For some in Washington, the imposition of such austerity policies on the economies of an already-weakened third world has created concern. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan are worried that too much I.M.F.-induced austerity could bring about even sharper contractions in world economic activity. Debtor countries ''are being told one thing by the I.M.F.,'' said Secretary Regan recently, ''to import less and export more. How can the whole world do this simultaneously and still maintain a trading system?'' Earlier, Secretary Shultz criticized the proliferation of ''austerity-type programs'' throughout the world and urged that economic policies in 1983 be aimed at achieving expansion. The fund denies that its adjustment policies are a threat to growth. Mr. de Larosiere points with some satisfaction to the reduced deficit in the balance of payments of the developing countries that is expected this year, claiming that ''a significant adjustment'' has taken place in the economic prospects of such nations. ''There is a gross misunderstanding of our policies,'' said one high official at the fund. ''We are not imposing austerity. We are providing additional resources to limit the decline in economic activity that is threatened by financial collapse.'' Even in Mexico, he points out, there will be some nominal growth this year, though less than the 6 percent to 8 percent range of earlier years. And imports are projected to rise by about 2 percent. Ironically, the fund has also been attacked from the other side, by those who think that in its effort to avoid a breakdown in the international financial system it has agreed to lend money willynilly to nations already heavily burdened with debt. Though the fund insists that its lending policies have not changed of late, one official conceded that a recent deal was worked out faster than usual because of pressure from the Reagan Administration, suggesting that the adjustments imposed on the borrower were somewhat less draconian than they might have been in an earlier era. Despite its worries about growth, the Administration seems generally pleased with Mr. de Larosiere's initiatives. The United States is expected to recommend a second five-year term for Mr. de Larosiere when his current term expires at midyear. Strong support for the director's new activism has come from the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, who has encouraged bankers to cooperate in the effort to finance third-world countries through this difficult period. He has brushed aside some regulatory obstacles that might have inhibited the banks. New loans to nations working out deals with the I.M.F. will not be classified as substandard, doubtful or losses - all categories that could call for extra reserve requirements for the banks. ''Lending banks, working effectively together to meet a clearly justified transitional need, should be able to provide the necessary margin of finance,'' Mr. Volcker said. Despite such encouragement, however, the hundreds of banks with loans out to the weak countries of the world have not all been eager to ante up more money. Mr. de Larosiere had to ''to knock heads together,'' as one official phrased it, to get the Mexican package wrapped up last month. In part he could draw on the fund's long history as a provider of seed money for borrower nations. Its loans have not been made in isolation, but rather as a way to attract far greater funding from other sources, funding inspired in part by the I.M.F.'s ability to pursuade debtor nations to take measures to strengthen their economies so that eventually they might be able to repay the loans. But in today's unusually shaky world economy, many banks, particularly small and medium-sized ones, have not been eager to follow where the I.M.F. leads. This has forced Mr. de Larosiere, a consummate diplomat, to cajole, prod and do whatever else he could to pull them along. In the case of Mexico - and in a more recent package nailed down for Argentina and one being prepared for Brazil -he went nose to nose with the commercial banks and industrial countries involved, insisting that they put up money to buy more time for the countries' adjustment programs to work or risk the loss of all that they had put up before if the borrowers were forced into default. ''Banks will have to continue to increase their exposures in the developing countries - albeit at a more modest pace than in the past - if widespread debt financing problems are to be avoided,'' said the I.M.F. chief. The message was first delivered at a meeting in New York in late November where Mr. de Larosiere met a delegation representing 1,400 commercial banks with loans out to Mexico. Before one additional cent would be put up by the I.M.F., he said, the private banks would have to roll over $20 billion of Mexican credits maturing between August 1982 and the end of 1984 and also an additional $5 billion in fresh loans. The same principle, with different numbers attached, was later applied to Argentina and Brazil. Some who attended the New York meeting describe it as a calm, business-like affair. ''It was a dialogue,'' said one participant. ''All of the banks must be involved in this process,'' said Mr. de Larosiere. ''But a lot of them were looking the other way,'' said one commercial banker. ''There was an awful lot of peer pressure,'' another banker commented. The large multinational banks endorsed the I.M.F.'s package first and smaller regional banks jumped aboard second - or most of them did. So on Dec. 23, Mr. de Larosiere told his directors that he could recommend doling out more international resources to Mexico because of assurances not only from the banks but also from a group of richer countries that they would join in the effort to help the Latin country. The I.M.F. loan of $3.9 billion had triggered $5 billion of new commercial bank credits for Mexico and $2 billion of industrial government trade credits. Mexico got a reprieve, time to keep its creditors at bay and to rebuild its economy. And Mr. de Larosiere got a financial package that he thought would assure the success of the I.M.F. program in 1983. There are those who contend that what he actually achieved in the Mexican instance was a bailout for banks that had lent more money than was wise to lend or for Mexico to borrow. The charge is rejected by the fund's deputy managing director, William B. Dale. ''The I.M.F. is not bailing out the banks,'' he said, ''it's really bailing them in.'' For their part, the big banks seem pleased with the fund's initiatives. ''The I.M.F. sensed a vacuum and properly stepped into it,'' commented Irwin L. Kellner, senior vice president and chief economist of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''We are not taken aback by what the I.M.F. is doing. Whatever happens there is a spirit of cooperation that will get this issue back on the back burner where it belongs.'' ''It was clear that somebody had to step in and play a leadership role,'' said Walter B. Wriston, chairman of Citicorp. ''We have the best managing director since Per Jacobbson.'' The sixth director the fund has had since its founding in 1944, Mr. de Larosiere works in a two-story, cherry wood-paneled office down the hall from the board room in the agency's elegant, modern headquarters building. By his desk is a computer terminal, which he uses himself to juggle data in making decisions on fund loans. Nearby is a a bronze bust of Lord Keynes, the British economist who was one of the founding fathers of the I.M.F. and who recognized the need for a world central bank in 1942, when world war was still a preoccupation of most people. Mr. de Larosiere has won strong support abroad. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the departing chairman of Britain's National Westminster Bank who will become the next Governor of the Bank of England, praised the ''tripartite effort'' among the governments of major countries, commercial banks and the fund. Although ''a degree of pressure'' may still have to be applied to commercial banks, he said, the debt crisis may well be over. West Germany's Finance Minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, said that commercial bankers could safely lend to developing countries because the I.M.F. would soon have the resources to do its share. Finance ministers from the United States, Britain, France, West Germany and Japan met early last December in Frankfurt to coordinate positions on the overall debt situation and to end a dispute over the amount by which I.M.F. resources should be increased to make way for major loan extensions during the sticky recession. They agreed that the pool of currencies and special drawing rights that members put up as a lending base for their financially strapped brethren should increase by about 50 percent, to $100 billion (much of it in minor currencies that are not useful for lending), and that an additional $15 billion to $20 billion should become available under an arrangement among richer countries known as the General Arrangements to Borrow. Further action will be necessary this year to put these agreements into effect so that actual borrowings can begin. In the meantime, I.M.F. officials are worried. Some continue to press -as they have for years - for the fund to raise money by borrowing itself in international money markets (as its sister agency, the World Bank, has done for years). The fund's executive board has had a proposal to pursue this course on the table since the late 1970's, but for now it is giving top priority to increasing members' quotas to raise money. After that, said one official, the I.M.F. may well make its first move into the market. After present and immediately contemplated loan commitments, officials say, there will be only $26 billion of lendable currencies left in the fund's kitty. This is barely enough to cover that portion of the fund that members count as reserves and are entitled to withdraw on just two days' notice. ''I am hopeful that an early agreement on the quota review can be concluded,'' said Mr. de Larosiere, ''and we will be working toward that end in the coming months.'' Last Wednesday, the director and a mission left for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to ask that country to lend the fund roughly $5 billion, on top of $10 billion already provided over the last two years. There are still worries that all the efforts of the I.M.F. can only paper over the crisis temporarily. This concern reflects the belief - shared by the fund itself - that what has really gone wrong in the third world can be traced to the weak world economy rather than to an overextension of credit by greedy commercial bankers or extravagant borrowing by imprudent leaders of developing nations. If so, the only way to bring the borrower nations back to health is to restore the world economy to growth. Because of balance of payments constraints forced on so much of the world, such growth, most economists agree, must come from the industrial countries and chiefly from the United States. A group of 26 prominent international economists, brought together in Washington by the Institute for International Economics, said that the major industrialized countries had to relax their antiinflationary policies and reduce interest rates to spur new economic expansion. The impact of easier money was dramatically underscored by Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, who noted that a three percentage point drop in rates would increase world economic growth by one percentage point in 1984 and again in 1985. But the prospect for a revival of the world economy is uncertain at best. Much depends on whether the Reagan Administration can get this country -which still acounts for a quarter of global gross national product- into a new growth cycle. Much also depends on whether international trade will flourish or whether protectionists in many countries will win out in their increasingly active efforts to preserve jobs by closing frontiers.

1003-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Morris Accusations
Reports filed by inmates and guards at the Dade County Jail accuse Eugene (Mercury) Morris of roughing up a juvenile inmate and having unauthorized contact with a female visitor, according to The Miami Herald, which says it obtained a copy of the reports. Ronald Strauss, an attorney for Morris, the former Miami Dolphin running back who is serving a minimum prison term of 15 years for trafficking in cocaine, said the reports were generally ''fallacious.'' He said they stemmed from resentment of what some inmates and guards regard as special treatment for Morris. According to the report, an unidentified juvenile prisoner complained that during a ''rap session'' among young offenders who were being counseled by Morris, the former player slammed him against a desk, causing injury. Morris claimed the youth fell out of the chair after Morris hit the desk at which he was sitting.

1004-> STAGE VIEW; WHY MAKE THE AUDIENCE DO ALL THE WORK?
In the course of ''Merlin,'' which magician Doug Henning has caused to appear at the Hellinger, a number of very tricky tricks are offered for our astonished inspection between musical-comedy songs, dances and - God save the mark - jokes. The illusion you've probably heard most about involves Mr. Henning, as the Merlin who's gone vagabonding along the byways of ancient England, mounting his white horse, entering a slatted crate and riding upward therein, and, as the crate suddenly collapses with a great empty clatter, appearing astride the same horse in a gypsy caravan half a stage away. That one's nifty, all right. Then there's the live (and suitably caged) black panther who was turned into a treacherous young lady (''Oh, no, not a girl!'' she cries in dismay as she realizes what this latest transformation has made of her). There's the perfectly cheerful damsel who's suspended on nothing but jets of water (if you'll believe your eyes, you'll believe anything), and there's Queen Mother Chita Rivera behaving like the wiliest witch ever to enter in butterfly robes (you know, with those stick arms that help her to look winged). Miss Rivera is of course a dancer, and a very good one, but I don't think she's ever before managed to slip out of her costume and have it (the costume) continue dancing beside her, later splitting itself into two costumes so that she'll have even more lightfooted company. These are all admirably worked out so that we don't catch anybody half-visible where they shouldn't be, and, even if you've seen it before, Mr. Henning's version of sawing a woman in half is both mystifying and funny. What he does is saw two women in half simultaneously, check to make sure that all the disconnected toes wiggle properly, and then restore both women to bouncing life by supplying the upper half of one with the lower half of the other, without mishap or complaint. The two victims (who now amount to what is called mixed company) go dancing cheerfully away, and putting the wrong halves together turns out to be a fine thing to do. It only works with women, however. Putting the wrong halves together doesn't work with a show. ''Merlin'' is made up of wrong halves, which means that 50 percent of it keeps tugging our interest in one direction (the ingenious magic show) and 50 percent in another (a standard song-and-dance musical with what pretends to be a plot), never the twain meeting. Though an enormous amount of fairy-tale scenery is wasted - griffins supporting candelabra, triple arches prettily fringed with skulls, a vast castle tower complete with circular staircase that can be knocked apart by a green-eyed robot in a matter of seconds - we find it utterly impossible to work up any interest in whether or not Miss Rivera can plant her reluctant son on the throne of pre-Arthurian England because we know perfectly well that the plot isn't a true plot. It's a fake plot meant to cover for Mr. Henning while he gets his next remote-control flamethrower ready. So are the songs, so are the dances, whether they're done by a lithe little unicorn played by Rebecca Wright (whom I shall hereafter think of as The Return of Tinker Bell) or by a bunch of pea-green devils straight out of Bosch. The magic show, on the other hand, is plainly embarrassed by its inability to belong to the tunes and by Mr. Henning's pronounced inability to act. Mr. Henning is, as we've known for some time now, an affable fellow with a Bugs Bunny smile who's very easy to like so long as he's plying his specific trade. It's something else again to have him brace his shoulders and attempt to display heroic determination when a wizard warns him that ''Forces are gathering - show them what you can accomplish with the universal elements!'' Personally, I blame the whole thing on ''Star Wars.'' The business of putting the wrong halves together -or, for that matter, the right halves - is something that has, to a surprising degree, been occupying us more and more in our experience of straight plays. Quite often lately it's become our obligation to piece the evening's play together out of whatever mismatched bones, half-hints and rumors of rumors the dramatist cares to toss our way between bouts of somewhat random chatter. The technique is being increasingly employed by the newer British playwrights. Certainly it's in use throughout Catherine Hayes's ''Skirmishes,'' it's there in the realistic portions of Caryl Churchill's ''Top Girls,'' and now the Manhattan Theater Club is giving us a handsomely mounted, rigorously well-acted sample of it in Edward Bond's ''Summer.'' What seems to be happening in ''Summer,'' and what is really happening in ''Summer,'' are two quite different things, even though no magician is present to saw them into separate portions. What seems to be happening? A mother who is also a successful businesswoman, Frances Sternhagen, arrives for her annual vacation at a cliff house overlooking the sea somewhere in Eastern Europe. She has a most attractive daughter, Caitlin Clarke, under her wing though not under her thumb. Miss Sternhagen is addled, given to blaming others for the constant loss of her keys, eternally quick to answer her own questions before anyone can say something she mightn't care to hear, obtuse in a forward-looking way (told that her old friend and former servant, Betty Miller, has contracted a disease that is ''fatal,'' she promptly and confidently comes right back with a quick ''But she'll get better?''). We are spoon-fed a few bits of information that may or may not be vital reasonably early. Miss Sternhagen was born in the seaside village and lived there for 20 years. Miss Miller lives in it, or rather is dying in it, now. She is attended by her young son, David Pierce, who is a doctor. Last summer, during vacation time, he and Miss Sternhagen's daughter slept together, though the girl seems reluctant to revive the relationship this trip. Otherwise trivia continues to dominate the reunion. Miss Sternhagen takes a positively childlike pleasure in presenting Miss Miller with a childlike gift: a waiter's crumb-brush, which she can use while feeding birds. Miss Miller is stubbornly insistent that a violent storm she heard during the night was not a dream, but real. There is, in passing, a great deal of talk about beauty, death and eternity. Behind all of this placid vamping-till-ready another story lurks, an actual story. It is, however, a story that happened more than 35 years ago, at the end of World War II, which means that it must be filtered to us in fragments, inch by inch and elliptically. It becomes our task - a task that requires two full hours - to sort out its relevant parts from the bits and pieces of casual conversation that litter the terrace in the noonday sun. Sorted out, the facts run something like this: In this part of Eastern Europe there's been a complete social overturn. Miss Sternhagen's family once ''owned the town.'' During the war her father hobnobbed with the German occupying forces, feted them at dinner - though Miss Sternhagen insists that he used these occasions to pick up information he could pass on to the local partisans. Later during the war Miss Sternhagen saved Miss Miller from execution by a German firing squad. At the end of the war all property was seized by the partisans, and the members of Miss Sternhagen's family were executed or exiled. Miss Miller testified against Miss Sternhagen. Yes, the family was beloved by the people, the family was kind. But its kindness was ''corrupting.'' It had led the lower classes into confusing kindness with justice, something that must never be allowed to happen again. (Now, in the present, Miss Miller at last concludes the underlying argument by spitting in Miss Sternhagen's face.) During this uneasy mix of present and past, of friendliness and venom, a few fine discoveries come along. I found myself genuinely touched by Miss Sternhagen's sudden awareness that she is forever trapped in a role she cannot bear. Spending an afternoon on a nearby island, she meets a German tourist who - most coincidentally -was stationed on the spot during the war. He speaks longingly of a young woman in white, lonely but dignified, who appeared on the distant balcony of the cliff house each evening. Miss Sternhagen is stunned to realize, slowly, that it was she. She is even more stunned to hear that all of the German soldiers gathered nightly to admire her. Why?, she demands to know, horrified. The answer: because they knew her to belong to ''the same class'' as their officers. Nothing she has ever done has helped her to shake the luck she was born with, the bad luck of being born at the top. Miss Sternhagen's utter dismay is a complex emotion, graphically conveyed in near-silence. Just as close to the heart of things, to the essential character she can never alter, is what she does after her dying servant-friend has spat on her. She fights for control of herself, then stalks from the terrace. Within seconds she has returned. ''Are you all right?,'' she asks Miss Miller, compulsively concerned. Yet there is a limit to the indirection a playwright can safely employ. Before it is done, ''Summer'' is exasperating, and not only because Tom Brennan's German tourist is so opportunistically conceived and such a windbag to boot. The facade of the play is uncomfortably languid, giving the characters little to do, while we are required to do a very great deal if we are at last to assemble the substance behind the shadow. We are forced to edit, edit all night long, discarding what is near character-color, what is minorleague symbolism, what has been introduced merely to stir up the sound of drama (does the doctor-son really need to batter his mother so mercilessly with details of the cancer that will kill her?). Having discarded half the play, we must now fit together what is left, hoping we've made the right choices. It's all rather like trying to see the play through a rear-view mirror. That's more than a chore. It's an invitation to accident.

1005-> PERSONAL FINANCE; MASTERING THE MYSTERY OF FINE PRINT
''I T'S just a standard form,'' says the bank employee, handing you a loan or credit-card application or contract. Of course, you are going to sign. The interest rates are affordable. The repayment schedule is something you can live with. And because it is a standard form, all those pages of writing are probably just legal boilerplate, right? Not exactly. In a review of some of the standard credit applications and contracts used by five major banks in New York City, a consumer attorney found dozens of clauses that give the banks rights that most consumers would never imagine they were signing away. Now, as interest rates decline and consumers are likely to find more credit available, it makes all the more sense to read contracts carefully and to understand their provisions. The contracts can be ''sort of legal land mines,'' said Michael I. Meyerson, a lawyer formerly with the New York State Consumer Protection Board, who teaches at Brooklyn Law School. ''They remain hidden unless you step on them. These are burdens that consumers don't bargain for and generally don't know about.'' For example, the co-op loan agreement of the Dime Savings Bank of New York includes a clause that permits the bank to declare the borrower in default if the co-op is sublet without the bank's permission. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company's consumer loan note says the signer can be declared in default, even if payments are made on time, if in the bank's judgment ''ability to make timely payments is impaired'' - for instance, if the borrower is laid off. Chase Manhattan's simple annual interest loan says that the borrower can be declared in default if any person begins legal action to take any of the borrower's property. ''The bank can declare default at the filing of the suit,'' Mr. Meyerson said. ''Even if the property has nothing to do with the loan. It doesn't matter that the borrower may eventually win the suit.'' Spokesmen for the banks said that such provisions were necessary to protect the banks, and that they were rarely used. ''You create great defense budgets in the hopes you will never use them,'' said Donald Phelps, a spokesman for Irving Trust. ''We don't want people to get into financial trouble.'' Gail Berry, an assistant vice president with Manufacturers Hanover, said, ''Everyone, including banks, has to have clearly spelled out ways of dealing with financial uncertainty. Those clauses are there to give us some way to recover if needed.'' Consumer activists familiar with banking practices agreed that most financial institutions prefer not to call in loans. ''If the bank is well-run and rational, it will knock itself out to rearrange credit terms,'' said Mark Leymaster, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit organization based in Boston. ''But there are some lenders that repossess first and ask questions later.'' The clauses found in Mr. Meyerson's study are also found at banks outside New York, Mr. Leymaster said. Laws and regulations vary greatly from state to state. For example, confession-of-judgment clauses - in which a borrower signs away the right to dispute a bank's claims in case of default - are illegal in 33 states and the District of Columbia. But they are common in creditor contracts in Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Illinois. In 1980 the staff of the Federal Trade Commission proposed a prohibition on certain credit-contract clauses, such as confession of judgment, and limitations on others - such as those that make borrowers responsible for the bank's legal fees in case of default. The commission has not yet acted on the staff proposal. Some of the more common problem clauses in credit contracts are the following: Co-signers: Parents and friends sometimes agree to help someone obtain a loan by co-signing. If they think that a lender can make a claim against the co-signer only after trying to get money from the principal borrower or by claiming the collateral, they are wrong. Under most contracts, the lender can go straight to the co-signer for the balance due on a loan. Attorneys' fees: Clauses often obligate the borrower to pay the legal costs of collection. Chase Manhattan's simple-interest loan requires the borrower to pay attorney's fees ''if we hire an outside attorney.'' Forms from the other banks had similar provisions. The right to take money from other accounts or assets to meet loan payments: Clauses often permit a lender to take assets of a debtor, such as a savings account, to satisfy debt payments, without going to court. In New York State, the lender cannot take money from accounts used for the deposit of Social Security checks. Federal law prohibits lenders from touching trust funds, including Individual Retirement Accounts. Late charges: A bank may impose penalties for late payments. With an Irving Cashline account, for instance, the payment must be received at the main branch by noon on the day specified. A payment made at another branch before the deadline but not received in time could be penalized. ''It's rare,'' said Mr. Phelps of Irving, ''but it can happen.'' With a Chemical Visa or Mastercard, if the date of payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, payment must be received on the preceding workday to avoid penalties. Wage assignments: The lender has the right to seize a debtor's wages in case of default, without going to court. This clause can be a problem for people who do not want an employer to know about their debt problems. Waiver-of-exemption: Under the law, certain property, including shelter and the tools necessary for work, may not be taken from borrowers who default. These clauses give lenders the right to take such property. Deficiency judgment: These clauses permit the lender to repossess property, charge for the cost of repossession, and sell the goods at market value. What is left goes toward debt payment. For example, if a consumer defaults while still owing a bank $2,000 for a car, the bank may take the car and sell it for $1,000 on the open market. If the bank says the cost of repossession was $200, it would apply $800 to the loan; the consumer would still owe $1,200. Confession-of-judgment: In these clauses, borrowers sign away their right to dispute the lender's claims in case of a default. ''You are appointing the lender as your lawyer,'' Mr. Leymaster said. ''It's like a plea of guilty before you are arraigned.''

1006-> GILDER TRIUMPHS IN 8 EXTRA HOLES
Bob Gilder won the Phoenix Open golf tournament today, beating Rex Caldwell on the eighth hole of a playoff. The exhausting finish was a sort of reprise for Gilder, because it was here in 1976 that the former Arizona State star won his first professional tournament. ''I tell you, I was churning inside,'' said the 32-year-old Oregonian. ''I gave away the tournament twice, and I didn't want to give it away a third time.'' The outcome was a crushing setback for Caldwell, because this was the second consecutive Sunday on which he lost a playoff. Last week, he was defeated by Keith Fergus on the first extra hole in the Bob Hope Desert Classic. There was a four-man tie at 271 at the end of the regulation 72 holes. The others were Johnny Miller, twice the winner of the tournament, and Mark O'Meara. They dropped out on the second hole. He Faced a Bogey Caldwell's entry into the playoff was a small miracle, as he made a birdie when facing a bogey. On the par-5 18th hole, he hooked his second shot into a grove near the green. Through a tiny opening, he chipped on the only line possible, to the front edge of the green, 40 feet from the pin. From there, he snaked in the putt for the birdie. On the same green, Gilder, playing head-to-head with Caldwell, gave away victory as he missed a five-foot birdie putt. Gilder's putter was his worst enemy. On the first playoff hole, he missed a threeand-one-half-foot birdie putt that would have closed out the others. His score in the fourth round was 69, two under par for the Phoenix Country Club, and his total was 13 under. Caldwell shot a closing 70. This was the sixth tournament Gilder had won since joining the tour in 1976. The $63,000 top prize raised his season total to $76,729. Caldwell, Miller and O'Meara shared second-place money, $26,133 each. The tense playoff was the climax of an action-filled final round; at one point in the home stretch, seven players were tied for the lead. Caldwell led the field into the final round with a cumulative score of 12 under after 54 holes. He was assigned to the final threesome of the day with Gilder, who was 11, and Mike Reid, 10 under. Caldwell and Gilder each gained two strokes on the front nine. They exchanged the lead at the 10th, where Caldwell bogeyed and Gilder birdied. On the subsequent holes, each dropped to 12 under and recovered to 13 under at the finish. Victory Eludes Him The first extra hole was the par-3 15th of the course. All four parred. Gilder could have ended it there by sinking the short birdie putt. The others also two-putted for par. Miller and O'Meara were eliminated on the second hole, No. 16 of the course. They took pars while Gilder and Caldwell scored birdies, Caldwell from 14 feet and Gilder from 10. From then on, between Gilder and Caldwell, it was par all the way. They halved No.17 on two-putt pars. On the par-5 18th, each laid up in the hope of pitching his third shot close. Each took two shots for par. As the two walked off the green of the fourth playoff hole, they put their arms around each other's shoulders in friendship. Both were smiling. Back they went to No. 15, now the fifth extra hole. Gilder took two putts from 15 feet. Caldwell hit his second shot into an embedded lie on the bank of a water hazard, and got a free drop. He chipped to one and one-half feet, and tapped in for par. They parred Nos. 16 and 17 routinely. On the par-5 18th, the eighth extra hole, each went for the green in two, but came up short. Gilder pitched up to four feet. Caldwell was in light rough off the green, and attempted a chip. The ball had a bit of mud on it, and he did not connect properly. It fell 15 feet from the cup. Caldwell putted first, and missed. Then Gilder sank his short putt for the birdie, and the tournament was over. The eight-hole playoff was not a record. There was an 11-hole overtime in the 1949 Motor City Open, and eight-hole playoffs in 1965, 1978 and 1981.

1007-> TRAVEL ADVISORY; A Ride to Test The Fearless
Coney Island's parachute jump may be but a fond memory (though its skeleton still stands), but for thrill seekers who might like to equal its sensations, the opportunity is at hand. When Marriott's Great America amusement park in Gurnee, Ill., opens for its eighth season May 7, the fearless will have the opportunity to test their nerve against a $2.5-million ride called The Edge, an experience likened to plummeting from a 10-story building. Participants enter a car and ascend in six seconds to the top of a 131-foot tower for a clear view of the park, situated on Interstate 94 midway between Chicago and Milwaukee. The car moves horizontally to the edge of the tower, hangs suspended for 10 seconds, then drops in a 60-foot free fall before hurtling 39 feet into a curve, leaving riders on their backs facing the sky just before the car comes to a halt. A chance to ride The Edge is included in the price of admission, which, at $12.95, plus 25 cents tax, is $1.55 lower than last year's and entitles the ticketholder to unlimited use of rides, shows and attractions. The regular ticket price is applicable to individuals from 4 to 54 years old. Younger people are admitted free. Those 55 and over pay $7.75 plus tax, up 25 cents from last year. (The Edge is also being installed in the Marriott Great America park in Santa Clara, Calif.) Additional details are available from Park Information, Marriott's Great America, P.O. Box 1776, Gurnee, Ill. 60031 (312-249-1776). Traveling Companions Everybody knows about safety in numbers. But the way Jens Jurgen sees it, there are savings, too. In these days when sometimes heavy surcharges in the form of the ''single supplement'' are imposed on the solitary traveler by hotels, cruise lines and tour operators, Mr. Jurgens asks: Why travel alone? In response he has formed the Travel Companion Exchange, which endeavors to find suitable companions for those who would otherwise unwillingly bear the cost of going it alone. His Travel Companion Exchange, functioning on a membership basis, employs a questionnaire and a shorter (50-word maximum) ''mini listing.'' The latter, similar to a personal ad, but bearing an identification number instead of an age, is circulated among other members. Should its contents - age, height, weight, marital status, education and occupation, travel plans - seem appealing, a fellow member may then apply (at an additional cost of $1 each) for the complete questionnaire. At that point, it is up to the recipient to make further contact. Membership in the Travel Companion Exchange costs $18 for six months. More information, including sample listings, and blank application and profile page forms are available from Travel Companion Exchange, Box 833 Amityville, L.I. 11701 (516-454-0673). Business Tour Of Japan Maps Success Story Does Japan have a corner on business expertise? Can Japanese management methods be adapted by Americans? When it comes to such questions, there is no end of literature. Books and magazine articles appear frequently. But now comes the opportunity to obtain answers at first hand. It's the ''Business and Management Tour of Japan,'' organized by the Sagamore Institute, a nonprofit educational training organization in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and designed for managers, executives and others interested in the Japanese way of conducting business. The tour leaves Los Angeles April 14 and returns April 23. Instead of the customary sightseeing excursions, tour participants will visit two or three businesses, factories, other commercial establishments or schools each day. The agenda calls for meetings with Japanese executives and educators and evening seminars to discuss the day's activities. In addition, there will be an opportunity to have dinner in the homes of Japanese managers and other executives. Leading the tour will be Elliott Masie, the project director of Sagamore Institute, who will be assisted by American and Japanese management experts. The program is priced at $2,950, covering transportation, accommodations, breakfasts, transfers, guides and seminars. A brochure and further information are available from Elliott Masie, Sagamore Institute, 110 Spring Street, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 12866 (518-587-8770). Design Schools Sponsor Tours For two schools of design, the pattern that is forming this spring and summer is traceable on the world globe. For the Parsons School of Design in New York, such destinations as Japan, Italy and France are highlights of programs that explore Japanese ceramics, textiles and jewelry; Italian architecture and interior and industrial design; and, in Paris, the history of Western fashion, photography, decorative arts and architecture, painting, drawing, French history and language. Participants may earn academic credits in the course of these programs abroad, which range in price from to $2,075 to $3,475, although in some instances prices are lower when individuals make their own transportation and living arrangements. Information, brochures and applications are available from the Office of Special Programs, Parsons School of Design, 66 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10011 (212-741-8975). For the Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence, the destinations are France, Finland and the Galapagos Islands, where, respectively, the attractions are the Cordon Bleu Cooking School (April 23-June 1); Finnish design (June 5-12); and natural history (June 14-28). For these continuing education programs, prices range from $1,666 for the Cordon Bleu and Finnish expeditions, to $2,500 to $3,000 (including a $300 tax deductible contribution to the school) for the Galapagos Islands tour. Prices cover air fare. Additional details may be obtained from Marisa Parente, Continuing Education, Rhode Island School of Design, 2 College Street, Providence, R.I. 02903 (401-331-3511, Ext. 281).

1008-> POPE, IN PANAMA, CAUTIONS AGAINST GUERRILLA WAR
Pope John Paul II arrived here today on the third stop of his tour of eight countries and urged Central America's peasants to reject ''the temptation of violence, armed guerrilla struggle and the egoistic struggle of classes.'' ''This is not the path of Jesus Christ, the Church, or your Christian faith,'' he told a rally in Stadium of the Revolution. He expressed sympathy for people who live in ''conditions of misery'' and said he supported ''urgent reforms'' to improve their lives. The Pope flew here from San Jose, Costa Rica, where he had been spent the night after a visit to Managua, Nicaragua, on Friday. Against Taking Up 'Arms of Hate' Making clear that he was speaking to all rural workers in Central America, not only Panamanians, the Pope condemned guerrilla warfare. ''There are those who wish you to abandon your work and take up the arms of hate to struggle against your brothers,'' he said. ''You should not follow them. Where does this path of violence lead? Without a doubt, it increases hatred and the distance between social groups. ''These methods, completely contrary to the love of God and the teachings of your Church and of Jesus Christ, mock the reality of your noble aspirations and provoke new evils of social and moral decay.'' Groups of peasants and Indians were brought here from outlying parts of Panama in buses supplied by local churches. A capacity crowd of 30,000 filled the stadium, which is Panama's largest enclosed arena. Before he spoke, the Pontiff was entertained by costumed dancers who serenaded him with Panamanian songs. He appeared absorbed in their presentation and expressed his thanks before beginning his homily. Earlier in the day, John Paul gave an outdoor mass at which he exhorted his audience to respect the sanctity of the family and reject divorce, contraception and abortion. The Pope was met at Omar Torrijos International Airport by President Ricardo de la Espriella and other leaders. The man considered to hold ultimate power in Panama, Brig. Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes, who is the National Guard commander, was not present but greeted the Pope during a brief stop before the outdoor mass. Security officers estimated that more than 100,000 people were gathered for the mass at Simon Bolivar Industrial Center when the Pope arrived by helicopter. From there, the Pope made a brief helicopter trip to the Papal Nuncio's residence, where he had lunch with Roman Catholic prelates. The Pope also paid a courtesy call on President de la Espriella, and addressed priests and seminarians at the cathedral. He was to return to San Jose tonight by helicopter before going on to El Salvador on Sunday. The Panamanian crowds were large and enthusiastic and flags and banners lined the Pope's route through the city, but not nearly in as great numbers as he has seen elsewhere in Latin America. Many of the banners were provided by corporations that identified themselves prominently below messages of welcome. The only unofficial sign seen along the route was painted in large red letters on a wall near the National University. It urged John Paul to ''demand freedom for political prisoners in Central America.'' The Government declared a ''day of national rejoicing'' and urged businesses to release as employees rom their normal duties so they could see the Pope, either in person or on television. Bars, casinos and many shops did not open for business, the major thoroughfares were all but empty and the airport was closed. The Minister of Justice, Justo Fidel Palacios, said Thursday that, as a gesture of good will, he would order the release of some prisoners convicted of nonviolent crimes. In contrast to some other countries in the region, Panama has avoided conflicts between Catholic leaders and the Government.

1009-> Japan Vehicle Exports Rise
Japanese vehicle exports rose to 485,800 in February, from 471,890 in January and 472,980 a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said today. February export value, including parts and components, rose to $2.57 billion from $2.48 billion in January and $2.5 billion a year earlier, it said. February exports consisted of 341,860 cars, up 11.2 percent from a year earlier, 139,450 trucks, down 13.7 percent, and 4,490 buses, up 7.9 percent, it said. Vehicle exports last month to the European Economic Community rose to 92,020 from 72,020 a year earlier, but those to the United States fell to 164,420 from 174,040, the association said. Those to Canada increased to 23,300 from 14,890.

1010-> Topics; Beneath Life's Fa,cade; The Interview Cure
The fun, or horror, of a press conference is that almost anything can happen. As in an unscripted drama, the chief actor can forget his proper lines, lose his head, or spectacularly depart from the norms of decorum. Take the press conference once held by the English composer William Walton, who died last week. When he arrived in Argentina many years ago, a reporter, evidently running out of fittingly musical questions, asked him what he thought of Argentine women. The composer, no doubt fatigued by the long journey from home, replied he liked them so well that - pointing to a woman he had never seen before - he was going to marry that one. Three weeks later, he did. At a later interview, according to his obituary, his wife offered the surprising reflection that ''William doesn't really like music that much.'' He agreed: ''A lot of the time I don't. It irritates me to madness, especially my own.'' If you feel stuck in a rut, or unsure how to choose a wife or career, why not hold a press conference? Compose a work as startling as Sir William Walton's ''Fa,cade'' first, please, and we'll come.

1013-> THE WORLD; Human Rights, Such as They Are
On the whole, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said last week, Vietnam may be ''the worse country to live in'' for people who value human rights. Some 60,000 Vietnamese are political prisoners, according to the Administration's annual survey of what countries around the world have been doing to the lives and liberties of their citizens. The report presented by Mr. Abrams was harsh on Communist countries, although it didn't completely spare regimes friendlier to Washington. The Soviet Union was accused of stepping up ''repression of dissent,'' notably by committing dissidents to cruel and degrading psychiatric treatment with painful drugs. Jumping before they could be pushed, the Russians last week withdrew from the World Psychiatric Association where British and American psychiatrists were discussing suspension or expulsion proceedings against them (Details, page 18). Rights violations also reportedly increased last year in Czechoslovakia, Iran, Lebanon and Nicaragua. Brazil, Uruguay and El Salvador were among the countries said to be making progress. Disputing some of the upbeat conclusions, Michael Posner, representing private rights groups accused the report of showing biases in countries such as El Salvador, Turkey, Zaire and Yugoslavia ''where the Administration has a strong political stake.'' ''With friendly countries,'' the official report said, ''we prefer to use diplomacy, not public pronouncements.'' However, it cited examples of torture, brutality or violence in such friendlies as Pakistan and the Philippines. And Israel was criticized for expanding Jewish settlements in occupied Arab territories, for ''roughing up'' Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, and imprisoning Arabs for months without formal charges or trial. The situation in South Africa went ''up and down,'' Mr. Abrams said. While acknowledging Pretoria's proposals for limited political representation for nonwhites, the report cited a ''vicious cycle of violence'' -stepped-up South African attacks on neighboring countries in reprisal for damaging raids by African National Congress guerrillas.

1014-> THE NATION IN SUMMARY; DETROIT CENTERCHANGES HANDS
At its grand opening five years ago, it was hoped that Detroit's gleaming Renaissance Center hotel and office complex would spark a wave of new downtown growth. But the $356 million development proved to be an only child and a sickly one, and last week its parent, the Ford Motor Company, gave it up for adoption. Under a deal approved by Ford directors, the company's Ford Land Development subsidiary, which OWNED 65 PERCENT OF THE PROJECT AND DEFAULTED ON ITS $200 MILLION MORTGAGE IN JANUARY, Transferred majority ownership to the lenders. In return, the lenders erased the mortgage debt and assumed $13 million in other liabilities. Under the new ownership structure, Ford Land's share of the 70-story hotel and four matching 39-story office buildings shrank to 43 percent. The remaining 53 percent fell to a consortium of insurance firms including Aetna Life Insurance Company, Equitable Life Assurance Society, John Hancock Mutual and the Travelers Insurance Company. Renaissance Center's failure to make money or prompt other new construction was due mainly to the devastating local impact of the national recession. As unemployment rose in the Motor City, all downtown business declined; few of the hoped-for conventions materialized. ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1015-> THE AGING OF JAPAN'S AUTO INDUSTRY
NOT long ago, seated in a bar in Tokyo's Ginza District, a Japanese auto executive offered the kind of personal view of his industry that seems fairly common here these days. He made no mention of profit projections or engine specifications or miles per gallon. Instead, he talked about his son, who was leaning toward a career in computers or electronics and was aiming to land a job with Hitachi, Fujitsu or Nippon Electric. ''I don't blame him,'' the highranking businessman said. ''I wouldn't join my company today or any auto company. I'm pessimistic about the future of the Japanese automobile industry.'' That rather bleak view, from a man who entered the auto business in the mid-1950's, when things were so bad that the Japanese Prime Minister refused to be driven in domestic-made cars for fear they would break down, is shared by many others. ''The days of high growth for the Japanese auto industry are over,'' said Takayuki Murakami, senior analyst for the Daiwa Securities Company. And Noritake Kobayashi, director of the Keio Business School and board member of the Toyo Kogyo Company, openly voices discouragement over the industry's ''diminishing competitive advantage.'' The reasons for such dampened spirits are many, and were underscored last week when Japan said it would again limit auto exports to the United States and Toyota reluctantly agreed to manufacture cars in America with General Motors. Some cite export controls on shipments to a host of countries and the possibility of further protectionist steps; others, the apparent saturation of the domestic market, the prospect of sluggish economic growth worldwide, and the belief that foreign car makers, especially in the United States, are bound to become more competitive as they strive to improve their products, manufacturing techniques and labor relations. Already, the toll taken by export curbs and the economic slowdown has become apparent. Last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, Japan's exports of motor vehicles fell 7.6 percent, the first significant year-to-year drop since 1954. Total production declined last year, too, after more than two decades of expansion. Efforts to offset lagging exports were also disappointing. The Japanese felt they could at least maintain profit growth by selling more expensive and technologically sophisticated models. But the value of the country's auto exports fell by a nearly identical amount - 7.4 percent. Yet to say that the Japanese auto industry has matured is not to say that it is faltering or enfeebled. Its competitive edge, particularly in terms of cost of production, can diminish and still remain sizable. And the Japanese often tend to overestimate the threat posed by competitors and overstate their own problems. That is part of Japan's small-island-nation complex, which serves to steel its citizens and workers for greater sacrifice in the interest of the nation or the company, as the case may be. The auto industry, more than any other, has been the symbol of Japan's economic ascent. It was in 1980, when for the first time Japanese auto makers outproduced their Detroit counterparts, that Americans started to take seriously Ezra Vogel's notion of ''Japan as No.1,'' the title of the Harvard professor's book published the previous year. But the Japanese auto business is now facing two big problems: limits on its exports to the United States and the risks of manufacturing cars abroad, particularly in America. The Japanese Government's approval of export restraints, for a third consecutive year, was expected, and Toyota's decision to build cars with G.M. in California was almost inevitable, given the growing belief in the United States that if Japan's auto makers want to sell cars in America they should build them there. But the process leading up to the decisions, with Congressmen howling about Japan's penetration into most major American markets, served to remind the Japanese of the political sensitivity of the issue. Just how much the contraction of growth will hurt the Japanese auto makers is impossible to say. But Mr. Kobayashi of Keio University points out that ''the whole system of the Japanese auto industry was based on the assumption that production was always increasing. Some of the incentives for keeping the system working so hard for further improvements will not be there.'' Workers, for example, are more likely to be cooperative when wages are rising sharply each year, gains made possible only by robust sales and profit growth. Also, it is easier for a company to press a supplier to make extra efforts to deliver parts on time and at a favorable price if he is promised this year's sacrifice will be rewarded by more business next year. Furthermore, the slowing of growth in the 1980's is expected to be substantial, with yearly increases in unit sales falling to 2 or 3 percent from the double-digit levels of the 1970's. For 1983, Japanese auto companies are forecasting that, with a modest worldwide recovery, last year's export dip will reverse itself. They predict a 1 percent increase in auto exports this year and a 4.9 percent advance in total production, compared with a 4 percent production decline last year. Some analysts say, however, that such predictions are probably a bit optimistic, as corporate forecasts tend to be. Roughly 40 percent of Japan's car exports go to the United States and a disproportionate share of industry profits come from America, since the prices Japanese auto makers can charge there are higher than in Japan, given the cost-of-production edge they enjoy over Detroit. Accordingly, the restraints on exports to the United States that began in 1981 forced the companies to look for ways to maintain and expand their high profits there. With the numerical limits, the only course is to sell more expensive cars. Though cautiously, the Japanese companies are moving in that direction. A harbinger of the future may be the approach taken by the Mitsubishi Motor Sales Company of America, which last fall began its limited entry into the American market on its own rather than selling cars to Chrysler. It is selling three models and not one of them is an ''econobox,'' the small inexpensive sedans for which Japanese makers are best known. ''I think you will see more and more larger and more expensive Japanese cars in the American market,'' said Komakichi Sugiyama, a senior executive for the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. ''By now, the image of Japanese cars as high-quality automobiles is wellestablished and will extend beyond small models.'' While the Japanese auto industry bridles at restrictions on its exports to the United States, the American market is more open than that of most other industrialized nations. Last year, Japanese imports took 23 percent of the American market, while Britain limited Japanese imports to 11 percent of its market and France put its ceiling at 3 percent. Thus growth in the Japanese automobile industry's most profitable markets, the advanced countries, will apparently be stopped for years, not for reasons of economic competitiveness but because of politics. Indeed, the G.M.-Toyota announcement is, to be sure, an admission that the world's biggest car maker needs Toyota's help to efficiently produce a subcompact car. Toyota, Japan's largest auto company and No.3 in the world, will design the small car. In addition, the engine and transmission for the new product will be supplied by Toyota, as will the chief executive. So structured, the deal is testimony to Toyota's superiority in manufacturing efficiency. Its plant design, tooling, materials handling, inventory control and labor practices enable the Japanese company to produce and ship a small car to the United States for $1,500 to $2,000 less than American companies can make a comparable model, according to various studies. ''I'm convinced that G.M.'s main reason for getting involved with Toyota on this joint venture is to see how Toyota runs a factory,'' said James C. Abegglen, vice president of the Boston Consulting Group in Tokyo. For Toyota, the venture is the big manufacturing step into the American market that it has so long avoided. (In 1972, it established a manufacturing subsidiary in Long Beach, Calif., but it is small and limited to assembling truck beds.) Toyota is renowned for its conservatism. Its Japanese production operations are clustered around Toyota City, an aptly named community 150 miles west of Tokyo. Analysts question the company's ability to maintain its manufacturing edge as it moves away from its secure enclave, where its workers live in company housing and suppliers are situated next to its factories. Toyota's reluctance to start producing in the United States seems to indicate that the company has doubts about the portability of its manufacturing system as well. Still, with a joint venture, Toyota has chosen the least costly and risky approach. The Nissan Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company have taken the more expensive and chancy course of setting up factories alone. Nissan, Japan's second largest auto maker, is investing $660 million, by the most recent estimate, in its lighttruck plant in Smyrna, Tenn., which will start up in August. For its part, Honda invested $250 million in its small-car factory in Marysville, Ohio, which began operations last November. The initial investment costs, while considerable, may be just the start. The extra expense of training workers, raising the efficiency and standards of suppliers and so on will also increase the costs of producing abroad, which may well erode the profitability of Japanese companies. ''We must tackle and solve these problems,'' Masataka Okuma, an executive vice president of Nissan, said recently. ''From a broader perspective, we must overcome those difficulties to help Japan fulfill its responsibilities in the world.'' In assuming those responsibilities - namely, insuring that the major employment and other economic benefits stay in the nations where Japanese products are sold -the automobile industry moved too slowly, some analysts say. In the 1970's, much of the growth of the industry was attributable to the rapid penetration of foreign markets by exports. For example, from 1970 to 1980, Japanese total car production doubled, to 11 million units. Over the same period, its exports increased more than fivefold, to 6 million vehicles. In short, the Japanese industry in the 1970's reaped the high rewards of grabbing foreign markets through exports. But in the current decade, faced with the threat of more harsh protectionist measures, those companies that hold a large share of the market in a nation will be forced to maintain or increase sales the more expensive way - via local production. Toyota, Nissan and Honda are the big sellers to the American market. For the next four companies - Toyo Kogyo, Mitsubishi, Isuzu and Suzuki - most analysts agree that their sales in the United States are not large enough to justify production in America. Each of the four has a capital tie-in and marketing link with Detroit auto makers; Chrysler owns 15 percent of Mitsubishi, which supplies the American company with technical assistance and subcompact cars; Ford owns 24.5 percent of Toyo Kogyo, which sells it light trucks; General Motors holds 34.2 percent of Isuzu, which plans to sell it small cars, and G.M. also owns 5 percent of Suzuki. Despite such associations, Detroit's attempt to close the gap with Japan on production efficiency promises to be a long uphill climb. It will require changes in plant layout, labor-management relations, tooling and equipment, analysts say. Today, as before, the Japanese auto industry seems representative of the Japanese economy. The era of rapid economic expansion and free trade that allowed it to grow and prosper so quickly seems to be over. Yet, despite slower growth, it is still powerful, still viewed with justifiable envy by its overseas counterparts. ''The Japanese auto industry does not have exciting growth prospects anymore,'' said Kevin Radley, an auto analyst for Jardine Fleming Investment Services Ltd. in Tokyo. ''But it is still strong compared to the competition.'' Predict a 1 percent increase in auto exports this year and a 4.9 percent advance in total production, compared with a 4 percent production decline last year. Some analysts say, however, that such predictions are probably a bit optimistic, as corporate forecasts tend to be. Roughly 40 percent of Japan's car exports go to the United States and a disproportionate share of industry profits come from America, since the prices Japanese auto makers can charge there are higher than in Japan, given the cost-of-production edge they enjoy over Detroit.

In assuming those responsibilities - namely, insuring that the major employment and other economic benefits stay in the nations where Japanese products are sold - the automobile industry moved too slowly, some analysts say. In the 1970's, much of the growth of the industry was attributable to the rapid penetration of foreign markets by exports. For example, from 1970 to 1980, Japanese total car production doubled, to 11 million units. Over the same period, its exports increased more than fivefold, to 6 million vehicles. In short, the Japanese industry in the 1970's reaped the high rewards of grabbing foreign markets through exports. But in the current decade, faced with the threat of more harsh protectionist measures, those companies that hold a large share of the market in a nation will be forced to maintain or increase sales the more expensive way - via local production. Toyota, Nissan and Honda are the big sellers to the American market. For the next four companies - Toyo Kogyo, Mitsubishi, Isuzu and Suzuki - most analysts agree that their sales in the United States are not large enough to justify production in America. Each of the four has a capital tie-in and marketing link with Detroit auto makers; Chrysler owns 15 percent of Mitsubishi, which supplies the American company with technical assistance and subcompact cars; Ford owns 24.5 percent of Toyo Kogyo, which sells it light trucks; General Motors holds 34.2 percent of Isuzu, which plans to sell it small cars, and G.M. also owns 5 percent of Suzuki. DESPITE such associations, Detroit's attempt to close the gap with Japan on production efficiency promises to be a long uphill climb. It will require changes in plant layout, labor-management relations, tooling and equipment, analysts say. ''Sure, we are learning what the problems are,'' said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst for Paine Webber in New York. ''But correcting them is not something that is going to take a few years. It's more like a decade. And the Japanese aren't sitting still; they are constantly making improvements.'' Moreover, the Japanese producers' cost-of-production advantage generates a hefty and steady cash flow that is being used to bankroll new product innovations, making it increasingly difficult for their Detroit rivals to keep pace. Martin L. Anderson, director of the Future of the Automobile Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that Japanese companies can make a small car for $3,000 that can sell for $8,000 or more in America. ''Admittedly, there are shipping, distribution and marketing costs that have to be paid,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''But there's also a lot of profit in there for the Japanese companies.'' Mr. Anderson also calculates that the earnings of the Japanese producers are under-reported by American standards. For example, most Japanese companies do not report their equity shares of the earnings of suppliers and affiliated concerns in which they hold a stake. Nevertheless, today, as before, the auto industry seems representative of the Japanese economy. The era of rapid economic expansion and free trade that allowed it to grow and prosper so quickly seems to be over. Yet, despite slower growth, it is still powerful, still viewed with justifiable envy by its overseas counterparts. ''The Japanese auto industry does not have exciting growth prospects anymore,'' said Kevin Radley, an auto analyst for Jardine Fleming Investment Services Ltd. in Tokyo. ''But it is still strong compared to the competition.'' DETROIT'S GRIPE: THE DECK IS STACKED Frustrated American auto executives complain their basic problem is that they are not competing with Toyota, Nissan or Honda as much as with the entire nation of Japan. Japanese auto companies, they say, are favored with low-interest financing, a tax structure that favors exports and a benevolent Government dedicated to fostering their welfare. W. Paul Tippett, chairman of the American Motors Corporation, declared in a recent speech: ''Japan's success in the U.S. market stems largely from differences in the two countries' political treatment of industrial growth and foreign trade, not differences in culture or management style.'' He believes the Japanese Government selects industries for growth and develops them in a protected home market. ''When these companies are ready to enter foreign markets, they enjoy such advantages as accelerated depreciation and special reserves for tax purposes, exception from antitrust laws, subsidized low-interest loans, government-funded research and development programs and an undervalued currency - advantages no American company can either obtain or effectively compete with.'' Other auto executives are less strident, conceding the Japanese car companies' advances in product quality and production efficiency. But they, too, complain the deck is stacked against them. Philip Caldwell, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, arguing that Japan's tax policies and a weak yen give its auto companies a $900-per-car advantage, said: ''The magnitude of these distortions - the solutions to which fall entirely within Government control -swamps even the most outstanding accomplishments in improved productivity, efficiency and inventiveness.''

1016-> SPORTS PEOPLE;
Thirty-six women, many of them mothers of football players at Althoff High School in Belleville, Ill., took to the field last week for some first-hand experience in blocking and tackling. Glenn Schott, the high school football coach, said he invited the women to participate in the practice so they could learn the sport and dispel some of the fear and apprehension that many mothers have about their sons playing the game. ''They say behind every great man is a woman,'' said Schott. ''I really believe that behind every great football player is a mother.''

1019-> THE WORLD; Israel, Lebanon Will Talk Faster As Risks Rise
With the risks and penalties of delay increasingly apparent, Israel and Lebanon last week agreed to speed up their talks on withdrawal of foreign forces. The negotiators will hold three plenary meetings this week instead of two. Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, impatient at Lebanon's refusal to accept a permanent Israeli presence to seek out Palestinian enemies in southern Lebanon, reportedly threatened to cut off Israeli support for the Christian Phalangist militia. Mr. Sharon met Pierre Gemayel, the Phalangist leader, and complained that his son, President Amin Gemayel, was taking orders from Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Not so, the elder Gemayel said. Yesterday, in the second attack in nine days on a P.L.O. headquarters in Lebanon, the main Palestinian office in Beirut was blown apart. A car bomb set the building afire, killing more than a dozen people and injuring at least 60 others. On other disputed terrain, an American marine captain brandished a loaded pistol and jumped onto an Israeli tank before its commander could be persuaded to back off from the edge of marine-patrolled territory in South Beirut. The State Department protested to Israel and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said the marine, Capt. Charles Johnson, should be commended for standing up to ''threatening moves.'' Israeli officials had a different version, calling the encounter ''a sad joke'' in a location that would continue under Israeli jurisdiction. Then, to head off more such clashes, Israeli and American commanders in Beirut agreed to mark a formal boundary.

1021-> TRAVEL ADVISORY: BARGAIN RAIL TRIPS, NEW THAMES LANDMARK; Amtrak's 'All Aboard America'
''All Aboard America.'' Those words constitute a summons from Amtrak to partake of a travel bargain. They are also the title bestowed on an Amtrak reduced-fare program that took effect Feb. 1 and expires May 30. Under the program, $125 buys a ticket valid for 30 days for coach travel on round-trip rail journeys within each of three regions - East, Central or West - into which Amtrak has divided the United States. One stopover is permitted on each leg of the trip in addition to the destination. For example, the eastern region encompasses such cities as Chicago, New Orleans, New York, Washington, Montreal and Miami. So, for $125, a traveler could proceed from Montreal to Miami, stopping in New York on the way south and in Washington on the way north. A ticket combining travel within two regions, including one stopover in each direction, costs $225; and a ticket valid for all three regions, which could take a traveler from coast to coast with a stopover in each direction, costs $299. An Amtrak spokesman said that under normal circumstances, a New York to Los Angeles fare, with a stopover westbound in San Francisco and eastbound in Denver, could amount to $696. Children from 2 through 11 accompanied by an adult may travel at $62.50 through one region, $112.50 through two and $149.50 through three. The tickets are also valid for travel in sleeping cars upon payment of a supplemental charge. The supplemental charge for the cheapest one-way sleeping accommodations from New York to Miami, for example, would be $45, and between New York and Chicago, $30 one way.''All Aboard America'' tickets, however, are not valid for any Metroliner services or club car service or aboard the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad, which runs from Denver to Salt Lake City and is the only intercity rail passenger service in the United States that is not part of Amtrak. Ticket sales for the ''All Aboard America'' program will end May 1, although tickets remain valid from that date until May 30, when the program ends. Further details are available through Amtrak agents across the country.. Lighting Up The Thames Visitors to London who favor strolls - or cruises - along the Thames can brace themselves now for a new riparian vista. One of the largest illuminated signboards in Europe has been erected above the National Theater on the south side of the river between Waterloo and Blackfriars bridges. Forty-two feet long and eight feet high, the moving-light signboard, with its 1,536 bulbs, is designed to impart information about performances and ticket availability in the National's three auditoriums and about its bars, buffets and parking lots. A spokesman said the sign cost more than $100,000 and he expressed confidence that it would pay for itself by increasing box-office income by one percent in each of the next three years.

Lawrence Van Gelder club med box: Price Cuts in Mexico Travelers returning from Mexico with tales of bargains are not exaggerating. The steep, swift decline of the peso has meant a surge in the buying power of the dollar, and Club Mediterranee and Alexander Charters & Tours are among the latest concerns to announce reductions. At three Club Med resorts in Mexico -Playa Blanca, Ixtapa and Cancun - the price of a one-week, all-inclusive vacation (not including air fare but covering accommodations, meals, sports and recreation facilities and nightly entertainment) has been reduced by $100 until April 29. Thus, at Playa Blanca on the Pacific Coast, the only Club Med resort in the Western Hemisphere with its own ranch and stable of horses suited to riders at all levels, the price is now $535. At its sister resort, Ixtapa, also on the Pacific, and the only Club Med resort with free golf facilities nearby, the price has dropped to $550. At Cancun on the Caribbean, the price is $650. Weeklong combined land and air packages from New York are also available - to Cancun for $1,050 and to Ixtapa for $970. For more details, write or call Club Med, 3 East 54th Street, New York, N.Y. 10019 (212-308-1700 or 800-528-3100). Alexander Charters & Tours, operating air tour packages involving some 30 hotels in Cozumel and Cancun, reports reductions in its prices of from 20 to 45 percent in comparison to last year's. Prices, based on double occupancy, range from $399 to $819. And seats aboard its chartered United flights, leaving on Saturday and Sunday mornings from John F. Kennedy International Airport, are available separately at a cost of $279 to Cancun and $329 to Cozumel. Children under 12 pay $30 less.

1022-> Two Studies Hint Painkillers Block Weight Loss in Illness
Aspirin and other common painkillers may stop the rapid weight loss often caused by injuries and infections, researchers believe. Two studies published Wednesday show that in illness chemicals are released in the blood that make the muscles waste away, and antiinflammatory drugs should block these effects. This beneficial effect has been confirmed in animals, and one scientist said he hoped the discovery would quickly be verified in humans. Swift loss of weight is a side effect of many injuries and diseases. The body breaks down muscle proteins and uses them for tasks such as producing energy, repairing wounds and making diseasefighting antibodies. One of the studies was conducted by Dr. Alfred L. Goldberg and colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Tufts University School of Medicine. The other was done by Dr. George H.A. Clowes Jr. and others at Harvard and Boston University School of Medicine. Both were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The GNC Energy Corporation said it expected to return to profitable operations in the fiscal year 1984 first quarter ending June 30, basing the forecast on increased coal sales to steel manufacturers and improvement in the housing and road construction industries. GNC has operated at a loss for the past five years. The company also said its Sunnyside Tar Sands joint venture project with the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) could receive a United States Synthetic Fuels Corporation price support contract in 1983.

1024-> POLICE CORRUPTION INVOLVING DRUGS LEADS TO NEW SUPERVISION ACTIONS
The use and sale of narcotics by police officers and other criminal acts by officers involving drugs has become one of the Police Department's most serious corruption problems, according to an annual report submitted to Commissioner Robert J. McGuire. The report, made by Chief John Guido, who heads the department's anticorruption efforts, said there were 317 allegations of wrongdoing by officers that involved drugs in 1982, compared with 288 in 1981. The allegations included using and selling drugs to others, stealing drugs and taking payoffs from drug dealers. All told, the report noted, the department received 2,427 allegations of corruption or serious misconduct involving officers last year. This represented an increase of 108 allegations over 1981, but is not as high as the number of complaints received in other recent years. Officials said that usually about one of every eight allegations are substantiated upon investigation. Meanwhile, in a new move to combat and prevent police corruption, the department has begun sending supervisors out at night to check on ''corruption-prone locations,'' such as after-hours clubs and places where officers are believed to ''coop,'' or sleep, while on duty. In and Out of Uniform The supervisors, who will be accompanied by internal-affairs investigators, will work both in and out of uniform and will ride in police cars and in unmarked cars. Fifty-five supervisors, ranging in rank from captain to assistant chief, have been given these extra duties and will work from midnight to 8 A.M., whenever the supervisors normally assigned to these anticorruption duties are not available. The new program will be tried for two months and evaluated. A department spokesman said that up to six of the supervisors will work each night and that it anticipated that each will put in one or more overnight tours of duty each month. On Tuesday, hours before the program started, two officers assigned to the 77th Precinct in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn were arrested and charged with stealing money from a store owner suspected of selling marijuana. Last month, 26 present and former police officers were summoned before a Federal grand jury investigating allegations of police corruption involving after-hours clubs in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Of the allegations in the report, 520 involved criminal acts committed by police on and off duty, such as robbery, burglary and assault, and 477 involved stealing property during investigations or from people who have been arrested or assisted. Drug-Related Complaints Among 317 drug-related corruption complaints were allegations that 49 police officers used drugs in 1982 and 61 did so in 1981. The department was able to substantiate the charges in one of the 1982 cases - 20 other cases are still open and under investigation - and in eight of the 1981 cases. The report's findings were in line with an earlier report on ''corruption hazards'' made last spring by Chief Guido's office, which pointed up the department's growing concern with internal problems caused by drugs. ''Profit from narcotics are enormous and the potential for corruption is correspondingly high,'' the earlier report said. ''Consequently, there will be members who feel they might as well take a piece of the action and become actively involved in the sale of drugs. ''Another cause for concern,'' the report continued, ''is the use of marijuana and other controlled substances, particularly by the younger members of the department. Many commanders have noted that the newer members grew up in a culture where the use of drugs was socially acceptable, seeing no problem with occasional usage.''

1025-> PLAYERS
During the winter that followed his 30th birthday, as he prepared for the prime of his career as a pitcher, Pete Vuckovich of the Milwaukee Brewers felt a strange sensation in his right arm. It felt fine. ''I was really pleased about it,'' he remembered late Tuesday, the night the Brewers started their season with a game here against the California Angels. ''I said, 'Finally, you don't have any pain.' '' He had become an expert on the subject during the seven seasons he had pitched with the White Sox, the Blue Jays, the Cardinals and the Brewers. His ability to overcome pain had once been a source of pride, a trademark. ''I feel I have a very, very high pain tolerance,'' Vuckovich said, no longer sounding proud. Too high? ''Perhaps,'' Vuckovich said. ''Might well be.'' Last month, after the pain had returned with the start of spring training, Vuckovich finally asked Harry Dalton, the club's executive vice president and general manager, for an arm examination. ''And boom,'' Vuckovich said. He learned that he had a torn rotator cuff in his right arm, a diagnosis that was confirmed by two more examinations. He was placed on the 21-day disabled list, but that figure has more to do with baseball's procedure of transferring bodies than with what is going on in his arm. At best, a conservative exercise and rehabilitation program could allow Vuckovich to return in two months. At worst. ... ''It's heavy duty, psychologically,'' he said, ''the possibility of never being able to play again. You know as soon as you start that your career has to end sometime, whether it's the age or an injury.'' But what adds to the anger within Vuckovich as he starts the season as a spectator - ''I'm ready to go stir crazy,'' he said - is that the overpowering work ethic that pushed him to the Cy Young Award last season has betrayed him. He may have already established his baseball epitaph: Peter Dennis Vuckovich - He always wanted the ball. ''I've had shoulder problems,'' Vuckovich said. ''Routine for a pitcher. I was too smart, too proud to say anything. Any time something would happen, I'd say: 'I'm tough. Give me a shot.' '' Once, he said, the motivation was fueled by the realization that there were always new young arms behind him, waiting for their chance at a spot in the big leagues. Besides, he had undergone far more serious experiences: A brain tumor was removed when he was a child, and a case of appendicitis that was not immediately diagnosed led to gangrene. During an era in which team managements have accused injured pitchers of being hypochondriacs, Vuckovich has been a throwback to a time when complex injuries were simply diagnosed as sore arms and pitchers ignored the pain until it was too late. At 6 feet 4 inches tall and 220 pounds, he has an imposing appearance. He has bushy dark hair, a mustache that curves to his chin, a manner that suggests that he is not in good humor and an attitude that is right out of the 1930's. ''I just figured pitchers always threw with pain,'' Vuckovich said. ''So you take the pain and go out and get 'em.'' ''That's Pete's life style,'' Dalton said. ''His attitude is, 'This is my living. I'm not going to make much of a living if I don't do this.' '' Last year there was also the motivation of a pennant race. He felt pain in his arm through the last month of the season, but this was the season that drove Milwaukee into a frenzy. ''That's why I had to take the ball,'' Vuckovich said. And every five days he did. Vuckovich won eight straight decisions - his second such streak last season - from July 24 through Sept. 20. He won 17 of his last 19 decisions. He won 18 games over all, the most victories in one season in his career, and his record of 18-6 gave him a two-year total of 32-10, the best in the major leagues. But most important, when the Brewers had tied the American League championship series with California, Vuckovich took the ball for the fifth and final game and kept the Brewers close long enough to be able to make up ground, win the first pennant in the club's history and drive the people of Milwaukee screaming onto Wisconsin Avenue. Not until more than five months later did Vuckovich realize he might have been doing more harm than good. He did not pay attention to his arm until after the first game of the spring training season, when the pain refused to go away. ''It got to a point where I had to start thinking about myself,'' Vuckovich said. He now undergoes a program of exercises three times a day that he describes in a sing-song voice, the way a child recites a poem. His hope is to add a schedule of light throwing, progress to a mound and avoid the surgery that would diminish his chances of returning. If Vuckovich does return, he will be forced to re-evaluate the importance of paying attention to pain. ''I'll know what's cooking,'' he said. ''I will be much more careful now.'' If not, he will be left with the memory of a Cy Young season and his contribution to a pennant. ''If I had it all over to do again?'' Vuckovich said. ''No, I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't.''

1028-> FESTIVALS ENDING
NOW that August has arrived, the county's four big summer festivals are concluding their seasons. Last night, in fact, was the end of the musical festivities at Lyndhurst. Today marks the end of the fourth Summerfare at the State University of New York at Purchase, and it is quite a full finale. Performances are scheduled at 3 P.M. and 7:30 P.M. of ''Shakespeare and the Indians,'' which is described as ''a pioneer story set among America's mountain men of the early 1800's'' and ''a hardy, ingratiating family musical that is Americana in every sense of the word.'' A young people's concert at 3 P.M. offers the Baltimore Symphony, with Alan Balter conducting ''An Introduction to the Orchestra'' and ''Tubby the Tuba,'' and the Duke Ellington Orchestra, conducted by the maestro's son, Mercer Ellington, holds forth at 8 P.M. If all that were not enough, visitors this afternoon can look (and listen) for the Skysong Celebration, with the daredevil aerialist Philippe Petit performing way up yonder while the Los Angeles Brass Quintet and the French pianist Evelyne Crochet provide musical encouragement at ground level. ''Summerfare has really proved itself as this point,'' said Brooks Jones, the festival's director, ''and our sponsor, Pepsico, has signed an agreement with S.U.N.Y. guaranteeing us a long-range future. Finally, we can begin thinking about commissioning new works - in fact we've already asked Conrad Susa to write an opera, which we will produce next summer - and all sorts of other new opportunities should be opened up to us.'' Over at the beautiful Untermyer Park in Yonkers, meanwhile, the 1983 Performing Arts Festival has two more major events coming up: this Saturday at 8 P.M., the Rebecca Kelly Dance Company performs a broad range of expressive work ''revealing moods of joy, sadness, stunning design and simple fun.'' Then on Aug. 27, also at 7 P.M., a giant parade from Ghorton Field to Untermyer Park will precede a child's dream come true - an 8 o'clock performance with the clowns, papier-m^ache animals and oversized puppets of the Vermont-based Bread and Puppet Traveling Domestic Resurrection Circus. There is no admission charge at Untermyer, simply bring a blanket or lawn chair and enjoy. Caramoor, the oldest and longest- running of the county's summer festivals, has eight more concerts scheduled, starting at 5:30 this afternoon when the superb Emerson String Quartet plays Mozart, Bartok and Brahms in the Spanish courtyard. On Thursday at 4:15 P.M. the pianist Jeffrey Jacob gives the New York premiere of George Crumb's ''Gnomic Variations,'' on an all-American program that also features works by Persichetti, Mayer, Dello Joio and Samuel Barber's celebrated 1948 piano sonata. This year's Avery Fisher winner, the violinist Elmar Oliveira, and the pianist Robert McDonald team up for sonatas of Pergolesi, Bloch, Brahms and Beethoven at 8:30 P.M. Saturday; then next Sunday at 5:30 P.M. Misha Dichter plays Handel's Suite No. 5, Brahms' Variations and Fugue on a Theme from that same suite, plus Moussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' The final four concerts are equally noteworthy, recitals by the Tokyo String Quartet on Aug. 20, the Beaux Arts Trio on Aug. 21, the pianist Andras Schiff on Aug. 27 and, at the grand finale on Aug. 28, at 5:30 P.M., an all-Vivaldi performance with the New York Chamber Soloists. Some of these events may already be sold out but additional seats are usually put on sale the day of the concerts if there is no chance of rain. To check, call 232- 5035. If this year's New York Renaissance Festival is as much fun as last summer's, it would be worth taking children on a weekend trip across the Tappan Zee Bridge to Sterling Forest, on Route 17 in Tuxedo, N.Y. The attractions are many and varied: One may find a fully staged Shakespearean drama in progress at the outdoor amphitheater while a minstrel sings by the brook and a storytelling session keeps the smaller kids enthralled over on the green. There are puppet shows, juggling acts, bawdy ''soak the wench'' games (in honor of modern sensibilities, these occasionally switch to ''soak the varlet'' games), mock duels, pantomimes and even a full-fledged jousting match with knights on horseback. Most of the fully costumed performers are young actors or mimes, and their high-spirited energy is definitely contagious. Craft displays, many other carnival-type games and dozens of food stands (some of them making valiant attempts at medieval authenticity) complete the picture. The festival runs from 11 A.M to 6 P.M. every Saturday and Sunday, plus Labor Day, through Sept. 11. For more information, call 351-5171.

1029-> PAROLE DENIED MAN IN ESCAPE BID
The United States Parole Commission has denied the parole application of a man convicted of air piracy and kidnapping in a 1981 attempt to free an inmate by helicopter from a Federal jail in lower Manhattan. The convict, 47-year-old Jasper Banks of Atlanta, is serving a 20-year sentence. He was convicted of hijacking a helicopter at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on Jan. 25, 1981, and forcing the pilot to fly at gunpoint to the roof of the Federal Correctional Center. There, Mr. Banks and several associates unsuccessfully tried to free Robert Wyler, a convicted narcotics dealer. Mr. Banks, one of four people convicted in the escape attempt, was arrested in Boston on March 26, 1981, for running a red light.

1030-> THE G. & W. METAMORPHOSIS
From his 42d-floor office on 61st Street, Martin S. Davis, head of Gulf and Western Industries, has a clear view of upper Manhattan. From that vantage point, Central Park seems to neatly divide the crowded island into three distinct pieces. This sense of order appeals to Mr. Davis, who was named vice chairman and chief executive in February after the unexpected death of Gulf and Western's flamboyant founder, Charles G. Bluhdorn. Since he took control of the sprawling conglomerate, Mr. Davis has been pruning and restructuring the company, muscling it, in fact, into three distinct operating units. The vast securities portfolio Mr. Bluhdorn assembled has been sold, businesses have been shed, debt reduced and assets consolidated. All of which is leading to a new image of G. & W. as a consumer products company. Under Mr. Bluhdorn, who amassed more than 100 companies in 25 years, Gulf and Western, with $5.5 billion in annual revenues, was able to boast that its businesses ranged from A to Z, automotive to zinc. 'A Different Mode' ''We're in a different mode,'' Mr. Davis said. Last weekend, Mr. Davis announced that Gulf and Western would divest itself of 20 percent of its assets, or about $1 billion in sales. The company, which once had 21 operating units, will be consolidated into three areas - entertainment, financial services and consumer products. The plan would result in write-offs of $470 million, twice what analysts had anticipated, and a net loss of about $215 million in the fiscal year 1984. But shareholders are to get an increase in the quarterly dividend to 22.5 cents a share from 18.75 cents a share on Oct. 1. And Mr. Davis, who has a reputation for delivering, has promised investors ''a stronger, leaner, more profitable, more growth-oriented company, with a solid base for expansion, both internally and through acquisitions that are compatible with other G. & W. operations.'' A Three-Step Process Michael S. Hope, chief financial officer, discussed the divestiture: ''This is the third step in something that started four or five months ago. The first step was management restructuring and bringing in operating people into the office. The next step was the portfolio sale, which has so far brought in nearly $750 million, most of which has been used to reduce debt. Third, we defined operations.'' The divestiture, Mr. Davis stressed, was begun by Mr. Bluhdorn, who in 1979 began a program to lessen dependence on capital intensive operations. But it has been Mr. Davis who beat out other contenders for Mr. Bluhdorn's job and pushed Gulf and Western rapidly forward. ''These things might have happened anyway,'' said the 56-year-old executive, who began his career as a director of marketing and sales at Paramount Studios. But Mr. Davis acknowledged that his management style called for fast action. Analysts who have followed the sometimes growth-for-growth-sake style of Mr. Bluhdorn's empire building view the changes at Gulf and Western favorably. Many felt that, as structured, the Bluhdorn empire was unmanagemable. ''Mr. Bluhdorn was the only man who understood it,'' said Richard L. Hanley, an analyst for Prescott, Ball & Turben. ''Historically the street shunned the stock because nobody understood it. That's why the stock sold so cheap.'' Following the divestiture announcement on Sunday, investors bid up the price of Gulf and Western stock 87.5 cents, to $25.50 a share on Monday. The stock closed at that price yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The divestiture will not only pare the company's low-growth businesses but also some profitable operations that no longer fit into the company's plan. Nearly half the write-offs will come from the company's ailing Natural Resources division in Nashville and will include the company's 60 percent interest in Jersey Mini ere Zinc in Clarksville, Tenn. Race Track Sold The company is also selling its building products and race tracks. Yesterday, G. & W. announced the sale of Arlington Park race track in Illinois, for about $18 million. Also on the block are the company's video games units and Famous Players theater chain in Canada. According to Neil Call, executive vice president with responsibility for the company's long-term strategic development, negotiations are under way for the sale of several companies, some of which may be sold to the various managements. In March, the Consolidated Cigar subsidiary was sold for $120 million in cash and notes to its management. But Gulf and Western is expected to tenaciously hold on to those companies it sees as vital to its new image as a consumer and communications company. Analysts consider the Paramount Pictures Corporation and Simon & Schuster Inc., Gulf and Western's publishing subsidiary, as the company's two strongest units. Most Powerful President Both fall under Barry Diller, president of the new entertainment and communications group, considered the most powerful of the three Gulf and Western presidents. The other presidents are Reece A. Overcash Jr., president of the Gulf and Western services group and James I. Spiegel, president of the company's consumer and industrial products group. Though Mr. Bluhdorn was aware that his company had grown too large to be managed easily, analysts credit him with building a team capable of making the running of the company look easier than it was. Although many outsiders believed that Mr. Bluhdorn ran the company singlehandedly, ''a company this size can never be run by one man,'' said Lawrence E. Levinson, executive vice president. But, he added, the changes that have occurred during the last few months were necessary to show investors and employees that Gulf and Western would move forward without Mr. Bluhdorn. ''It was a rapid change that was forced on us,'' said Mr. Levinson, who was among the contenders for Mr. Bluhdorn's jobs. A Top Officer Leaves Mr. Levinson spoke of the transition at Gulf and Western as if it had happened almost effortlessly. But, shortly after Mr. Davis was named vice chairman, David N. Judelson, president and chief operating officer, resigned, and Richard E. Snyder, head of Simon & Schuster, was said to have been unhappy after he was told that the restructuring would result in his reporting to Mr. Diller. A Gulf and Western spokesman said that rumors that Mr. Snyder had considered buying the publishing company were untrue. With the major shake-ups over, Mr. Davis said the company was proceeding with its plans. The divestiture may take two years to complete, but the company will not wait to begin the fourth step of its corporate plan. ''Step 4 is to run what we've now identified as a new company,'' Mr. Davis said. That new company, he said, will be a broad-based consumer company. And, yes, he said, it will still be a conglomerate. ''Conglomerate doesn't bother me,'' he stated.

1031-> SENATOR JACKSON, IN PEKING, SAYS BETTER TIES ARE AHEAD
Senator Henry M. Jackson said today that Chinese-American relations were improving at a pace that could soon bring an exchange of visits between President Reagan and Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, commented after a meeting with Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. The Senator, greeting Mr. Deng with a bear hug in the Great Hall of the People, met with him for more than two hours. ''In the recent period there is some improvement in our bilateral relations and I'm hopeful of that,'' Mr. Deng was later quoted as saying. Senator Jackson delivered a letter from President Reagan expressing a desire to continue to improve relations and Mr. Deng said, ''We welcome this,'' according to the official New China News Agency. Chinese ties with the United States, strained since Mr. Reagan was elected, have improved in the last three months and ''the opportunity is now present to expand our relations,'' Senator Jackson said at a news conference. ''I believe we have weathered a very difficult period,'' he said. When questioned about the possibility of a visit by Prime Minister Zhao to the United States, Senator Jackson said, ''I think things are improving for that visit and some time after the first of the year, hopefully, the Premier's visit would be reciprocated by the President of the United States.'' 'Movement Is Favorable' The Senator said no decision has been made, but the ''movement is favorable'' for a Zhao visit in November or December. Mr. Jackson said a Reagan trip to Peking could probably come in early 1984 before United States election campaigns intensify. Mr. Zhao accepted a Reagan invitation last year, but the trip was shelved as relations faltered over continuing United States arms sales to Taiwan and Chinese complaints that Washington was holding back purchases of United States technology. Mr. Jackson, who has had about 20 hours of talks with Chinese officials since his arrival Aug. 15, said Taiwan and technology transfers were still major issues, although Washington recently upgraded China's status as a purchaser.

1032-> THE FIGHT OVER SHOREHAM IS ALSO A FIGHT FOR PUBLIC OPINION
OPINIONS differ on how influential a broad coalition of Long Island groups has been in bringing Peter F. Cohalan, the Suffolk County Executive, the County Legislature and other elected officials around to the view that the Shoreham nuclear power plant should not open. But few doubt that the Island's antinuclear movement, one of the most sustained in the United States, has played a major part in making the future of the Long Island Lighting Company's plant the pre-eminent issue on the Island today. The groups opposing the plant -their ranks swelling with new members - are now rallying in support of the county officials, whose stand is stronger than the coalition had dared to hope for. With their determination last month that no safe evacuation was possible in the event of a serious accident at the Shoreham plant, the county officials have now taken the lead in opposing the plant. Although organizations opposing the plant have come and gone since Lilco proposed it 15 years ago, together they have mounted a continuing campaign of lobbying, demonstrations, legal actions, public meetings and advertising to win support for their conviction that the plant poses too grave a danger to be allowed to operate. Much of the planning and organization of the opposition has been done by a core of about 30 individuals from various groups, some of whom do not know each other. Some are in the highly visible Shoreham Opponents Coalition known as SOC, which has raised $250,000 since its formation in 1979, according to Nora Bredes, executive coordinator of the coalition. The figure appears to be the highest for any organization opposed to the opening of Shoreham. Other groups have subsisted on modest donations and membership fees. Miss Bredes, the prime spokesman for the anti-Shoreham position, said the coalition's funds had come from 20 member groups, individual contributors and foundations that she declined to name. She said the contributors included the writers Kurt Vonnegut, E.L. Doctorow and Shana Alexander, and the fashion model Cheryl Tiegs, all of whom are seasonal residents of the South Fork. Miss Bredes, who holds a degree from Cornell University, said she earned $7.50 an hour working in the coalition's Smithtown office part time. Most of the money the organization raised has been spent on legal fees and in obtaining expert testimony at Federal licensing hearings on the plant, Miss Bredes said. She added that her organization would join other groups now trying to gain support for the county's request that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission immediately terminate the hearings and deny Lilco a license to operate the Shoreham plant. The group is also stepping up its schedule of public forums in communities around the Shoreham plant as part of a drive to gain new members and to solidify opposition to interim Federal licensing of Shoreham for low-power operation. Miss Bredes said the coalition had 1,200 members, including 250 signed up as a result of its recent radio advertisements accusing Lilco of building an unsafe nuclear plant at Shoreham. Active members of the the group's executive committee include Lorna Salzman of Friends of the Earth, the national environmental group; Warren Liebold of the Sierra Club; Theodore Goldfarb, an associate professor of chemistry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Jeffery Kluewer, a teacher at Suffolk Community College. The group's longtime counsel, Stephen Latham of East Hampton, left recently and now represents the Town of Southampton another front of the antinuclear campaign. In the past, other groups have said that Miss Bredes's group is a closed organization in which a small number of people have made most of the decisions, and that it then appears to represent the views of the anti-Shoreham movement. ''SOC was never supposed to be a big group,'' Miss Bredes said. ''It was supposed to be an intervenor in the licensing hearing, and all the other work was supposed to be done by other groups. But we began to take on a greater role'' as a representative of the movement. In its larger role, the group's relations have been harmonious with Mr. Cohalan and Frank R. Jones, the Deputy County Executive, who has handled Shoreham matters for Mr. Cohalan. While the coalition has neither organized nor taken part in demonstrations around Shoreham, another wing of the Long Island movement has made demonstrating central to its strategy. This began in June 1979, when the largest Shoreham demonstration to date was organized by a loose coalition of Long Island, New York City, and upstate groups called the Sound and Hudson Against Atomic Development Alliance, or SHAD. Since then, most of the groups then affiliated with the alliance have faded from view, but former members have joined other groups or started up their own. With the climax of the Shoreham struggle apparently near, a number of the groups opposed to the plant, including SOC and other Long Island antinuclear organizations, have joined in a third organization, the Stop Shoreham Campaign. The campaign -which describes itself as ''a coalition of Long Island and metropolitan New York citizen action groups'' - began a 24-hour-a-day vigil near the Shoreham plant on Feb. 26. This is scheduled to end in mass demonstrations on June 4 and 5. Two staff members, Murray Rosenblith, formerly of WIN magazine and Nancy Greenfield, an organizer, are directing the vigil from campaign headquarters in a trailer behind the Smithtown print shop of Roland Bostrom. Mr. Bostrom, a longtime Shoreham opponent, is the retired head of the medical and biological physics department at Cutler-Hammer Inc. With Esther Pank of Hauppauge and a handful of others, Mr. Bostrom did much of the organizing for the 1979 demonstration. Both have been arrested at Shoreham for trespassing in the course of acts of civil obedience. Mr. Bostrom prints news letters and posters for the Stop Shoreham Campaign and for other groups. Although members of the campaign have hesitated to put their faith in public officials, they are delighted with the position Suffolk County has taken on the Shoreham plant. ''I've never been more hopeful than I have been in the last few weeks,'' said Richard Lercari of East Quogue, a founder of Island Free Press who has taken part in demonstrations at Shoreham since 1976. But if the county government fails to stop the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a license for the Shoreham plant, most members of the Stop Shoreham Campaign are geared for direct action through nonviolent civil disobedience. Such action would probably involve attempted blockades or the scaling of fences around Shoreham similar to the demonstrations in 1979, when more than 600 people were arrested by the Suffolk police after scaling Shoreham's fences. ''We will certainly consider acts of civil disobedience if they actually try to start the plant,'' said the Rev. William Brisotti, the associate pastor of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Roman Catholic Church in Wyandanch. Father Brisotti is a leader of the Long Island Catholic Peace Fellowship, one of the groups in the Stop Shoreham Campaign. The fellowship takes the position that nonviolent acts of civil disobedience are justified in matters of conscience. Father Brisotti said there was a close connection between efforts to ban nuclear arms and the campaign to close down nuclear power plants. Both movements oppose ''a tyrannical use of power over people,'' he said. According to Father Brisotti and others taking a similar stand, public interest in stopping the Shoreham plant has never been higher. ''People who have never responded before are coming out of the woodworks,'' the pastor said. ''It's become a mainstream movement,'' said Sophia Adler of Southold, who with her husband, Fred, a retired engineer, is the founder of North Fork Opponents of Nuclear Exposure. ''There are many new people getting involved.'' She said she had received nearly 6,000 signatures on petitions opposing the opening of Shoreham that the Adlers handed out during one session of hearings on the county's proposed evacuation plan. While most of the opposition to Shoreham has come from groups in Suffolk County, groups in Nassau have recently been picking up their pace, according to Marge Harrison of Baldwin, a spokesman for the Long Island Progressive Coalition and a vice chairman of the State Democratic Committee. The Progressive Coalition, which was formed in 1979, includes in its membership a number of union locals, and political, peace and antinuclear groups. Mrs. Harrison said the coalition was financed through membership fees. She said she had used her position as a Democratic Party official to present to Governor Cuomo a petition with 183 names of public officials and others urging the Governor not to allow state approval of any evacuation plan for the Shoreham plant that did not have approval from Long Island. According to Mrs. Harrison, members of active Nassau groups will redouble their effort to persuade the Nassau Board of Supervisors to hold evacuation hearings. ''There has been a continuing assault on the board because they are not responsive,'' she said. She added that the Nassau groups stayed in touch with one another through a telephone network that operates from the Westbury Peace Center. Mrs. Harrison, a high school librarian, is a founder of the Long Island Citizens in Action, which also opposes the Shoreham plant, An individual in the opposition to the plant is Patricia Bower of St. James, a mother of three children who has recently become involved in the Shoreham issue. Mrs. Bower said that a number of Shoreham workers had told her of flaws in the plant's construction and that she had reported this to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. When a commission investigator interviewed her two weeks ago regarding the allegations, Mrs. Bower said, he threatened her with fines and imprisonment if she did not supply the names of the workers. She refused to give him the names, she said, because the workers had given her the information on the condition that their identities not be disclosed. Mrs. Bower is an artist and an educational therapist employed by United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Suffolk. No organization has been more crucial in the Shoreham opposition than the Lloyd Harbor Study Group, a circle of neighbors who banded together in the mid-1960's to oppose the Shoreham project when it was first announced. The group's founders, Robert Carl, then an engineer at the Grumman Corporation, and his wife, Ann, a conservationist and one of the first women to become a jet pilot, brought Irving Like, a Babylon lawyer, into the case to contest the Lilco construction application before the Atomic Energy Commission, which then handled licensing for nuclear plants.

1033-> IN THE GULF, SPENDING AS USUAL
Snapshots of economic life in this Persian Gulf city-state on the day after Saudi Arabia said it was ready to let oil prices fall: - Two veiled women buy $4,000 worth of trinkets at the Reyadh Jewelry Store in the gold souq, paying cash with bundles of banknotes extracted from beneath their chadors. - Katherine Asquith, a London rare print dealer, arrives to deliver an early 19th-century illustrated book on falconry to a sheikh. Price: $42,500. - The Viking Adventurer, Britain's floating arms showroom, docks on a trip down the Gulf with a tempting cargo of tanks and bombs to show the local military. ''Security spending is as strong as ever with the Ayatollah on the rampage,'' a salesman says. The picture of business as usual that such anecdotes suggest about the mood here is also true of the rest of the Gulf states. For, in contrast to the poorer oil exporters such as Nigeria and Mexico, which spend every penny they earn, the wealthy Gulf producers, with their tiny populations and huge reserves of money and oil, are feeling relatively calm about the prospect of falling oil prices. Saudi Arabia, for example, has already said it will press ahead with its current $230 billion, five-year development plan drawn up in 1979. And Kuwait is budgeting $10.5 billion in Government spending this year, unchanged from 1982. If oil revenues fall short of spending goals, both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait say they will use income from their huge financial investments abroad to plug the gap. Saudi Arabia has at least $170 billion invested around the world, which yields it perhaps $15 billion a year. Kuwait has about $100 billion to shield it from oil price fluctuations. Tiny Qatar, with a population of just 200,000, is also pressing ahead with development plans. Last week it presented plans to spend between $4 billion and $6 billion over the next six years to develop a liquefied natural gas exporting business based on its huge offshore North Field reserves. U.A.E.'s 'Austerity Budget' In the United Arab Emirates, Finance Minister Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid al-Maktum says he is preparing an ''austerity budget.'' But Western diplomats suspect that this is partly a ploy to discourage Iraq from asking for more money for its war against Iran and to discourage panhandlers in general. One source of the Gulf states's apparent equanimity in the face of unstable prices are forecasts that falling oil prices may not necessarily mean lower incomes. In its latest monthly review, the American Express International Banking Corporation calculates that oil revenues of the Gulf states dropped roughly a third between 1981 and 1982, to an estimated $103 billion last year, from $156.1 billion. But this 34 percent decline in revenues came on a 45 percent fall in oil output, to roughly 7.5 million barrels a day, from 13.6 million barrels. To offset the impact of a $4 drop in the oil price now, to $30 a barrel from $34, the Gulf states would need to increase volume by only about 15 percent, the bank notes. ''If prices do fall in 1983, but production is restored, then many would generate higher revenues,'' the bank review says. Only if the oil price drops ''substantially,'' to below $25 a barrel, would revenues start to suffer, it says. Plans for Increased Borrowing But the Gulf states may be able to maintain spending for other reasons too, officials and bankers working in the area believe. Unlike more densely populated oil producers, the Gulf states have not borrowed heavily and, together, they are sitting on more than one-third of the world's proved oil reserves. ''It is logical for them to put less of their own money into projects now and take more credit,'' says Khaled al-Fayez, general manager of the Gulf International Bank in Bahrain. As examples of this developing trend, he points to a recent $300 million syndicated credit by the Government of Bahrain to finance a new petrochemical plant and a planned borrowing by the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation to pay for new industrial investments. ''A few years ago the governments would have paid the whole cost out of revenue; now they are borrowing,'' he points out. Changing Investment Patterns But investment needs are also changing, and this is forcing new spending patterns on the Gulf states. They now have almost all the roads, schools, hospitals and ports they can use and, increasingly, are spending on industrial projects instead. In turn, some of these industrial projects are now being delayed or stretched out because of the general economic uncertainty. It is relatively easy for the Gulf states to do this, bankers and businessmen say, because the only people to suffer are usually foreign minority shareholders. Several big Japanese companies involved in the new Saudi Arabian petrochemical complex at Yanbu, for example, are reportedly furious over project delays imposed by the Saudis. In making spending decisions, Gulf governments do not need to worry about the consequences for local employment. In all of these countries, imported workers - chiefly from India, Pakistan and other poorer Middle East countries - greatly outnumber citizens, often three to one. Kuwait, sensing a slowdown in infrastructure development, has already sent 50,000 Indians home. And Abu Dhabi, where the building boom is also maturing, is tightening up on entry visa rules. Investment vs. Development But the oil glut is also stimulating a new debate in the Gulf over whether to invest oil income at home or abroad. The outcome of the debate could have an important impact on Western companies operating in this area. Kuwait, for example, has spurned the Saudi Arabian policy of building up vast petrochemical works at home with foreign assistance in favor of direct overseas investment. Its biggest such move recently has been the acquisition of Gulf Oil's Rotterdam refinery and a string of 750 service stations in Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland for an undislosed price. The acquisition makes Kuwait the first member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boast a fully-integrated oil industry of its own, extending from desert oil wells to retail gasoline pumps in Europe. Kuwaiti officials say they now believe that, at a time of a glut, oil producing countries must tie up their own market outlets in the consuming world. ''It doesn't make sense to refine oil in the Middle East if you can't sell it - that is what a glut means,'' one banker explained.

1034-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; More Talks Needed
Since Herschel Walker's switch from the University of Georgia of the Southeastern Conference to the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League, the necessity of an accommodation between college and professional football has become clearer than ever. Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach, has been out in front of those seeking a resolution, so that major college teams do not lose stars with eligibility remaining, such as Walker, to the pros. ''We are dealing with rules made 30, 40 and 50 years ago before there were agents and millions of dollars involved,'' Paterno said the other day. ''Something has to be done, and I'm not quite sure what it should be.'' At a recent exploratory meeting between officials of the U.S.F.L. and the College Football Association's coaches committee, which he heads, Paterno offered this idea: What if the athletic scholarship took on the form of a contract, a binding legal document between the athlete and his college setting out the obligations each would have for the other? Assuming that were the case, Paterno asked if the U.S.F.L., and presumedly other professional sports leagues, would honor those contracts. ''We certainly would,'' replied Steve Ehrhart, counsel to the U.S.F.L. In justifying the Generals' signing of Walker, who had a year of eligibility remaining, the U.S.F.L. commissioner, Chet Simmons, had used a legal shield. He claimed that Walker's attorney and agent, Jack Manton, had made it clear that, if Walker was spurned in his desire to play for pay in the league, his client would bring suit on grounds he was being denied an employment opportunity. ''I'm sorry that Chet gave way to the legal threat, which the N.F.L. wouldn't do,'' said Paterno. ''Because other agents may try the same tactic before we've had a chance to solve the problem.'' Paterno's suggestion of a contract arrangement was an attempt to fend off such threats of litigation in the future. ''It's just one of several ideas we have to talk over,'' he said. It is Paterno's belief that there has to be some financial relief for the college football player, something more than the present token payments permitted by National Collegiate Athletic Association. There will be more conversations, many more.

Not since Ronald Reagan took a month off in the summer of 1981 have Type B's had such comforting news. Marathon runners, an article in The New England Journal of Medicine reports, have a personality disorder similar to that of anorectic women. Not that a Type B would wish a personality disorder on a Type A high achiever - e.g. the typical obsessive runner. It's just that in this work-aholic age, he who believes the earth will spin without his pushing it is a guilty man.

''Their behavior becomes pathological,'' he'll murmur, quoting the journal, ''as a result of an extreme degree of constriction, inflexibility, repetitive thoughts, adherence to rituals....'' And knowing that he himself is open to the world, flexible as a cooked noodle and spontaneous to a fault, he'll smile. Very slowly.

1038-> Devils Lose, 6-2; 38th Assist for Housley
Tony McKegney scored two goals and Phil Housley, a rookie defenseman, added three assists to lead the Buffalo Sabres to a 6-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils tonight. McKegney scored his 27th goal of the season during a power play at 14 minutes 56 seconds of the first period to give the Sabres a 3-0 lead. He then beat the defenseman Tapio Levo to the puck and surprised the goaltender Ron Low at 7:36 of the second period for a 5-0 lead. Housley set a club-record for assists by a rookie at 38. He leads all National Hockey League rookies in assists. Phil Myre's bid for a 15th career shutout in his first game as a Sabre ended when Paul Gagne beat him at 2:14 of the final period. Myre, a 34-year-old veteran of 13 N.H.L. seasons, was called up today from Rochester of the American Hockey League. Gilles Hamel, Mike Foligno, Gil Perreault and Paul Cyr also scored for Buffalo. Levo added a goal for the Devils with a power-play goal at 6:54 of the third period. The Sabres, winning their third game in a row, outshot the Devils, 38-17. North Stars 2 Black Hawks 1 CHICAGO (UPI) - Bobby Smith and Neal Broten each scored firstperiod goals to lead the second-place North Stars, who moved 5 points behind the Black Hawks in the Norris Division. Minnesota had a 5-3 player advantage when the defenseman Gordie Roberts fed Smith a pass 15 feet from the net. Smith, a center, beat the goalie Murray Bannerman with a shot into the left corner of the net for his 21st goal at the 13-minute mark. Broten got his 27th goal after he poked the puck from Steve Larmer, skated in on Bannerman and sent a shot into the right corner. Larmer of the Black Hawks scored his 33d goal at 3:44 of the final period on a power play. it was the 70th power-play goal for Chicago, equaling the team record set in the 1965-66 season. Canadiens 4 Red Wings 4 DETROIT (AP) - Mark Osborne scored his 15th goal of the season with 6:10 left for the tie as Detroit overcame a 3-0 deficit. Osborne took a drop pass from Danny Gare and beat the goalie Richard Sevigny with a slap shot from the top of the face-off circle. Steve Shutt and Keith Acton scored first-period goals, and Guy Lafleur added his 18th of the season 6:59 into the second period for the 3-0 lead. Bruins 4, Whalers 3 HARTFORD (AP) - Rick Middleton scored twice for Boston, and Keith Crowder got the game-winning goal early in the third period. Crowder tipped Peter McNab's shot from the top of the right faceoff circle past Greg Millen, the goalie, at 4:20, giving the Bruins only their second victory in the last six games. Oilers 3, Jets 0 EDMONTON, Alberta (UPI) -Andy Moog stopped 25 shots to record the first shutout by an Edmonton goalie in more than four years. Eddie Mio, now with the Rangers, had the only other shutout for the Oilers against the Hartford Whalers by 3-0 on Dec. 9, 1979. Wayne Gretzky got his 100th assist of the season when he set up the defenseman Charlie Huddy at 13:41 of the first period.

1039-> PICKING UP THE PIECES IN THE GREAT BEACHCOMBING DEBATE
THE art of beachcombing is steeped in controversy. There are greater beachcombers and lesser beachcombers, and there is little about the art upon which they agree. The critics of beachcombing, although limited in numbers, are growing increasingly articulate and louder in their criticism. The greater and lesser beachcombers rarely agree with the critics.A greater beachcomber will rarely speak to a lesser beachcomber and will never respond verbally to a critic on the subject of beachcombing. The critic, of course, is the husband or wife of the greater beachcomber. I cannot say that everyone likes the beach. I will say that a majority of the minority of people like the beach. Most people will admit some merit in having beaches, if only that a beach provides some boundary to the vastness of the ocean. But this attitude is merely a reflection of self-serving interest and is far removed from the attitude taken by the beachcomber of either the greater or lesser sort. The attitude of the beachcomber is closely akin to that of the mystic. Both enjoy taking part in and contemplating things that are completely useless and without economic overtones. I cannot stress strongly enough that we are talking about a very strange breed. One major distinction between the greater and the lesser beachcomber is established by the criterion of time invested in actual beachcombing. A lesser beachcomber will generally spend less time beachcombing, in both numbers of days and in numbers of hours during a given day. A greater beachcomber generally practices his art every day and with little regard to time. This is an area that really stirs up the critics. They believe that one should be able to retain one's status as a greater beachcomber if one were to beachcomb less and stay home more. They believe that the focus should be placed on the discriminatory aspect of beachcombing rather than the element of time. Here we come to a very sensitive and potentially explosive area. The selective process of the artist is a very clear demarcation between whether or not he is considered to be of the greater or lesser type. Lesser beachcombers tend to collect only those things that share the universal quality of wholeness. They will pick up only those shells that are not broken and bottles that are intact and fairly clean. Sand clinging to a bottle or shell will not detract the lesser beachcomber, but unfamiliar substances emitting unpleasant odors may supersede the desire for a whole object, and the lesser beachcomber will select something cleaner. The greater beachcomber will pick up just about anything. He is not as concerned with the universal quality of wholeness as he is with the universal quality of uselessness. He might argue that an unbroken shell could easily be used as an ashtray. The pursuit of such an object, being within the dimensions of self-serving interest, is contrary to the definition of beachcombing. At the conclusion of this internal line of protest, he would probably stick out his tongue. Most critics agree that this is a very bad habit of the greater beachcomber and does not do much for the public's view of beachcombing in general. Because of the nature of the selective process of the lesser beachcomber, he is rarely seen carrying a sack. Since there are fewer things possessing the universal quality of wholeness than there are things possessing the universal quality of uselessness, there is less for the lesser beachcomber to carry home. He will usually wear something with large pockets. If the casual observer, better known in the field as a casual observologist, should observe someone leaving the beach with an unusually lumpy body, he can be fairly certain that he has witnessed the lesser beachcomber in his natural habitat. The greater beachcomber carries a large sack. On some days he will carry two sacks. When he is carrying two sacks, one will hang from the shoulder and the other will be held by one hand. This arrangement is very important. All beachcombers must have one free hand with which to pick up objects. This is the major distinction between beachcombing and scavenging. Scavenging has a less pleasant connotation, due in part to the exodus of public relations people from this area into the more lucrative areas of political campaigns and fast-food promotions, and is usually done by seagulls and dogs. The creed is: If you do not have hands, you cannot become a beachcomber. Greater beachcombers never wash their sacks and will replace one only when the bottom of the sack no longer functions to hold the weight of collected objects. Most critics find the smell of the sacks offensive. The greater beachcomber will ignore this kind of criticism in much the same manner as he does any criticism of his art. At best, he may turn his head and spit on the ground. It is more likely he will pretend that the critic does not exist. The lesser beachcomber will occasionally survey his collection and replace less than perfect specimens with more nearly perfect specimens. He is not resistant to the idea of throwing old specimens into the trash. The greater beachcomber never discards anything he collects. The critics hate this about the greater beachcomber. I am sympathetic to the critics on this point. The smell of dead fish and the clutter of ripped-up tires, rusted beer cans, broken bottles and corroded car parts make dinner parties a little difficult. Critics are torn people. They love the greater beachcomber for two reasons: They are married to a greater beachcomber, and they appreciate the purity with which he regards his art. They hate the greater beachcomber for many reasons. Philosophically, the critic is repelled by the lesser beachcomber and really has only one reason to like him: He smells better and is less likely to offend company. The critic is often grist for the psychiatrist's mill. Anyone can become a beachcomber by following the example an established beachcomber to a greater or lesser degree. Becoming a critic is a little more difficult as it involves marrying a greater beachcomber, the desirability of which has been hotly debated.

1041-> Recovery Now, But How Strong?
''We are making a lot of January,'' said Martin S. Feldstein. Indeed, after a midweek report that the index of leading indicators leaped 3.6 percent in January, higher than it has since 1950, economists were celebrating the advent of recovery from four years of back-to-back recessions. The remarks of President Reagan's chief economic adviser were meant as a caution that the January thaw did not mean bright summer was at hand. Friday's employmentfigures demonstrated one reason why. True, the February level for civilian employment showed no increase over January's 10.4 percent, and improvement in the jobless rate generally lags behind a rebound. But the labor force report held little cheer for the 11.5 million Americans on the official lists of the unemployed. The drop to 19.7 percent from 20.8 percent in black unemployment, for instance, merely reflected the fact that large numbers of black males had stopped looking for work, and so were not included in the compilation. And the average factory work week declined to close to 34 hours last month. ''If more people come into the labor force than there are (new) jobs, unemployment will rise,'' Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said. ''It's typical.'' So was the political reaction. In his radio address yesterday, the President declared that ''the other economic factors are too encouraging for (unemployment) to hold out much longer.'' Democrats from national committee leaders to mayors called the jobless report confirmation that recovery was selective and urged speedy Senate action on the $4.9 billion job creation bill that passed the House last week after ritual arguments about porkbarreling, protestations that not enough was being done and admonitions that that more might provoke a Presidential veto. The measure, only half a billion dollars bigger than the White House proposed, would create 300,000 to 600,000 temporary public service and public works posts.

1043-> RECORD NOTES; MUSIC IS RECYCLED
Memory is an elusive thing, of course, but it seems that things were simpler in the ''old days'' - whenever they were. In the days of 78's you had a choice: RCA Victor or Columbia; except for really involved collectors, that was the classical scene in records. Then came the LP and the number of labels burgeoned, but even then it was simple: RCA, CBS, London, Angel, etc. Now, however, it's not that simple anymore. Take Deutsche Grammophon, perhaps the most prolific of all classical companies. There are DG, DG Archiv, DG Privilege, DG Collectors Series, DG Doubletime Tapes and the new DG Special. And, coming up in September, DG Basics. In some cases the sub-label serves to identify a recognizable type of music (early music for Archiv, for example), but in many other cases it is simply a marketing device, mainly for recycling older recordings in new packages. The advantage for the record company is obvious: a new life for a product. For the music lover, the recycling provides a chance to buy performances that have been out of the catalogue and (sometimes) deserve to be brought back into circulation, often at a lower price. Such is the case with DG Basics, which is a subdivision of the DG Doubletime Tapes subdivision. This series, which will be released starting in September, will survey what DG calls ''pivotal'' repertoire of Western music from Gregorian chant to contemporary works. Each tape will be up to 90 minutes in length and, unlike the first Doubletime series, will contain complete works, not excerpts. In a format reminiscent of Vanguard's Historical Anthology of Music (the pioneer in such category marketing and still going strong) the Basics will be issued under various categories, such as Classical, Early Romantic, 18th-Century Slavic, and further subdivided by type, such as concerto, chamber music, etc. The first 10 releases range from Bach to Tchaikovsky, with the latter represented by the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies on one cassette. Two Haydn masses are also paired on a single cassette, as are three Beethoven piano sonatas (the ''Waldstein,'' ''Hammerklavier'' and ''Pathetique'') and three Mozart piano concertos (numbers 19, 20 and 21). Although DG has the most extensive range of sub-labels, it is not alone. Angel markets not only the Angel line, but also Seraphim (and within Seraphim the Great Recordings of the Century), Red Line and Miles of Music. CBS offers regular CBS as well as Great Performances, Masterwork Portraits and Odyssey, while RCA has Red Seal, Gold Seal, Victrola, and Erato, as well as the series of reissues known simply as .5. Vanguard CD's Even the smaller companies are wasting no time getting into the laser-played Compact Disk market. Vanguard, for one, is planning its first releases before the end of the year, according to Seymour Solomon, head of the company. While Vanguard, like the major companies, will offer some staples of the repertoire, it will also issue from its catalogue of digital recordings such fare as Berg's Lyric Suite and the Opus 3 Quartet. Other releases will include Leon Fleisher's performance with the Baltimore Symphony of Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand and the Houston Symphony in performances of Debussy's ''La Mer'' and Nocturnes. Mr. Solomon also said that Vanguard was in the process of taking a large plunge into the cassette field by issuing 400 of its catalogue titles on cassette in addition to LP, ranging from the most expensive audiophile digital recordings to its budget catalogue, and including the historical series. RCA's Mail Marketing RCA has had a record club for many years, but a year ago it added an all- classical club by taking over Polygram's International Preview Society, which sells London, Philips, Deutsche Grammophon and RCA Classical Records. The result, according to Bob Gordon, head of the RCA Club, has been a subscriber list that has almost doubled in a year from 70,000 to more than 125,000, with 15,000 more expected in the next few months as a result of a big direct mail campaign. For 1983, sales of considerably more than a million classical disks are projected, and as of now the operation is in the black, according to RCA. The club's experience under RCA has confirmed what many have said about classical record buyers. They spend more per person than do pop buyers. The average member of the Preview Society spends $200 over 18 months, according to Mr. Gordon, and 30 percent of its subscribers become long-term, indefinite members. Like many other parts of the classical music market these days, the Preview Society concentrates on basic repertoire for its members, a task overseen by an RCA committee headed by Martin Bookspan, the music commentator, author and artist-and-repertoire executive. Mr. Bookspan, who was also involved in the club when Polygram operated it, comes by the basic repertoire concept naturally, having written a column on the subject for Stereo Review for many years. He, along with many others involved in the classical record business, sees great potential still ahead for classical music in the United States, and points to the phenomenon of the new Tower Records store in New York, which has reported that more than 40 percent of its business since it opened recently has been in classical records. In Mr. Bookspan's view, a mail order club is just another way of tapping that potential. According to Mr. Gordon, RCA expected membership rolls to swell to 200,000 in the next year and to gross over $10 million in 1984.

1044-> READING AND WRITING; SICK, SICK
When I read for relaxation, I relish suspense, drama, mystery and thrills as much as anyone else, but don't give me John le Carre or Ross Macdonald. The fixture on my night table is a fat book - covered in brown simulated leather -that, possessing neither plot nor characters, for sheer mesmeric power puts these authors to shame. It's ''The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy'' (14th edition, 1982, edited by Robert Berkow, M.D.), printed on 2,578 pages of tissue-thin Bible paper and known simply as ''Merck'' to me and other card-carrying hypochondriacs. Written for professionals, by a roster of contributors which runs to 16 pages, ''Merck'' uses the kind of technical language that hypochondriacs find reassuring. ''Measles,'' it tells you, can be recognized by, among other symptoms, ''Koplik's spots on the buccal or labial mucosa, and a spreading maculopapular cutaneous rash.'' (I find Koplik, whoever he or she was or is, appealing.) From ''abdomen,'' the first word in its voluminous index, to ''zoophilia,'' the last, its encyclopedic information about what ails the human race not only tends to support hypochondriacal angst but helps to develop an expertise that impresses friends, relatives and people you meet at parties. From reading ''Merck,'' I have diagnosed impetigo in a cousin's itchy infant, proposed hypoglycemia to a dinner partner who complained of palpitations and perspiration two hours after meals and convinced myself for one whole day that I had acromegaly - a rare disorder causing abnormal bone growth - when I couldn't get an old ring back on my finger. By and large, though, hypochondriacs find that their concerns are not taken seriously by those who think they have better things to worry about, such as the prospect of nuclear holocaust. ''Sick, sick,'' they tend to scoff, on hearing of your obsession. It's simply no use to remind them that if, as the late poet Delmore Schwartz observed, even paranoids have enemies, so hypochondriacs too can have genuine physical distress. I am put in mind of a jeering remark addressed to me by a tennis pro who knows of my fixations, when I complained about a very real pain in my arm. ''Cheer up. You can be the next tennis-elbow poster child,'' he told me. What I like about ''Merck'' is it does not jeer. In fact ''Merck'' takes tennis elbow just as seriously as it takes everything else - it doesn't discriminate among diseases - referring to it as ''bilateral humeral epicondylitis.'' And it has wonderful names for other common problems: ''coryza'' for the cold, ''hordeolum'' for sty, ''verrucae'' for warts, ''tyloma'' for callus and ''ichthyosis'' for dry skin. But the gourmet hypochondriac looks for the rare and exotic ailment, of which there's certainly no lack in the manual. Take, for example, dirofilariasis, or heartworm, a worm that lives in dogs' hearts whose microscopic offspring can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Or Cheesewasher's Lung, a lung inflammation afflicting those with a special sensitivity who hang around moldy cheeses. Or even Kuru, which ''Merck'' defines as ''a progressive neurologic disorder transmitted during cannibalistic rites and occurring only in natives of the New Guinea highlands.'' For those smitten with hypochondria, the message is clear. Keep away from dogs, moldy cheeses and New Guinea. The affliction does not encourage an adventurous style of life. In recent years, the consultation of ''Merck'' -and a national upsurge in hypochondriacal visits to specialists' offices - has been fostered by newspapers and television. Not only do they report relentlessly on celebrities' diseases - Ari Onassis's myasthenia gravis (''the most common symptoms are ptosis and diplopia, followed by dysphagia, disarthria, and limb weakness,'' reports ''Merck''); the Shah of Iran's malignancy of the lymphatic system and the growth on Nancy Reagan's lip but on such new or recurring maladies as Legionnaires' disease, toxic shock syndrome, herpes and auto-immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). ''Merck'' keeps rigorously au courant, carefully differentiating Legionnaires' disease, for example, from Pontiac fever, which refers to a similar illness that in 1968 broke out in Pontiac, Mich., which sounds like a good place for hypochondriacs to stay away from. ''Merck'' is not all diseases, however. It offers information and advice on a host of other problems having to do with both psyche and soma, from hirsutism (too much hair) to ''The Medical Examination of the Rape Victim.'' A section ''Poisoning; Venomous Bites and Stings,'' for example, tells how to cope with everything from too much brandy to a bite from c. sculpturatus, a North American scorpion. The section ''Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders'' gently counsels the physician on managing obesity: ''Facing a task of this magnitude requires fortitude, dedication and motivation. The patient must not be made to feel like a glutton or sinner.'' Discussing placebos, the inactive substances used in control studies for comparison with active drugs, the manual observes: ''At least 2 patients have been reported who were addicted to placebos. One consumed 10,000 placebos in one year.'' There is even a section ''Psychiatric Disorders,'' touching on schizophrenia, paranoia, transvestism, pedophila - and, yes, hypochondriasis, defined as ''a neurotic disorder characterized by a preoccupation with bodily functions and a morbid fear that one is suffering from serious disease. The peak incidence of onset is in the 30's in men, the 40's in women.'' Well, with me the condition is congenital. My parents were ''Merck'' addicts, too.

1046-> Upset Follows Hockey's No.1
It seems that one of the surest ways to set a team up for a crashing upset defeat in college football and basketball is to name it as the top team in the country in the polls. That now seems to apply to college hockey as well. Providence received eight of the possible 10 first-place votes in last weekend's national poll of sportswriters and broadcasters after widening its margin since Christmas as the top team the East. It was the first time that the Friars were No.1 nationally, and they promptly lost last Wednesday night to Harvard, 8-5. The night before, Harvard had lost, 5-4, in overtime to Boston College in the opening round of the Beanpot Tournament. The Crimson, the fastest team in the East, used its speed to force Providence out of its deliberate, defense. Harvard's pressure on the young defense resulted in 41 shots on goal to 20 for Providence. Coach Lou Lamoriello replaced his goalie, Mario Proulx, with Chris Terreri after two early third-period goals by Harvard made the score 7-2. Best Record in Nation The Friars had won six in a row before their overall record fell to 24-5, still the best in the nation. Since the middle of January 1982, when a highly touted freshman class began fitting into Lamoriello's system, the record has been 33-7. Those players, now sophomores, give Providence the most raw talent in the East. Four of them - Paul Guay, Steve Rooney, Rich Costello and Tim Army - are playing regularly at the forwards. They are the strong support for the team's best players, Kurt Kleinendorst and Gates Orlando, both centers. Kleinendorst, a senior, was the fourth-round draft selection of the Rangers in 1980. His brother Scot, who was graduated from Providence last year, now plays defense for the Rangers. Orlando, a junior, was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in 1981. Kleinendorst, Orlando and Paul Guay were all among the top six scorers in the East at the beginning of last week. Seven Game-Winning Goals Kleinendorst had seven game-winning goals last season. A durable center, he has played in all but three varsity games during his four seasons at Providence. This season, he had 55 points in the first 26 games. Even though Providence has scored better than six goals a game, its young defense breaks down occasionally, as it did against Harvard. Beyond Bruce Raboin and Randy Zelischek, the defenders had a combined total of four games of varsity experience before this season began. Proulx had a 3.8 goals-against average this season before Harvard reached him for seven goals. ''Our defense men are the key to the whole team,'' said Lamoriello. ''They just concentrate on head-manning the puck out of our zone. We knew we had to work harder on the transition game, going from defense to offense, this year. When you've got experienced defensemen, the forwards can start to break out of the zone a little sooner when they see you're about to gain control of the puck. ''But this year they've got to wait a little longer. I call it keeping both skates going in the same direction all the time rather than keeping one skate on defense and one skate on offense in the transition game.'' Three weeks remain in the regular season, and no other team appears capable of knocking the Friars out of first place in the E.C.A.C. Division I. St. Lawrence and Clarkson, both of whom started fast, had losing streaks of four and three games, respectively, in the league heading into this weekend's action. The Beanpot final tomorrow night at Boston Garden will have Boston College facing Northeastern in a rematch of their 1980 title game, which was won by Northeastern. Boston College has made the final game four years in a row without winning, and the Huskies, who defeated Boston University, 4-3, last Monday night, have not gotten beyond the first round since 1980. Northeastern has made the final only four times in the 31-year history of the event.

1047-> TALENT TEAMS UP ON MUSIC FOR MASSED KEYBOARDS
Allan Kozinn writes frequently about music and musicians. Possibly because they conceive of their instruments as selfcontained orchestras, keyboard players pool their forces comparatively infrequently. There are, of course, a handful of fulltime piano duos touring the world, and on occasion a multiple-keyboard work is dusted off for a chamber or symphony concert. But the available literature for keyboard combinations is larger and broader than most concertgoers suspect. Lately, an unusual number of recordings featuring two, three and even four keyboards have appeared, documenting both familiar works and some of the more obscure corners of this unusual repertory. Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart each composed several works for massed keyboards, and their contributions weigh heavily among the new releases. In the Bach column, two new recordings offer both concertos for three claviers, BWV 1063 and 1064, plus the one for four claviers, BWV 1065 (actually Bach's arrangement of Vivaldi's Op. 3, No. 10); while a third set offers these works as well as the concertos for two claviers, BWV 1060 through 1062. Of the triple and quadruple concerto disks, the first matches Michel Beroff, Jean-Philippe Collard, Bruno Rigutto and Gabriel Tacchino, playing modern concert grands, with Jean-Pierre Wallez and the Ensemble Orchestral de Paris (Angel DS 37897, digital). The keyboard work is all very tasteful and at times quite beautiful, and Mr. Wallez draws a vibrant yet nicely refined sound from his ensemble's strings. Although the four pianists and their orchestral cohorts manage to avoid the ponderousness that too often afflicts modern instrument performances of these scores, the three and four pianos make for an anachronistic grandness that is never fully dispelled. By contrast, lighter textured performances on harpsichords, backed by compact original instruments ensembles, yield readings that breathe more naturally and are ultimately more thrilling. For evidence to support this assertion, one need search no farther than the recent disk featuring the harpsichordists Kenneth Gilbert, Lars Ulrik Mortensen and Nicholas Kraemer, with Trevor Pinnock leading his expert English Concert from the keyboard (Archiv 2534 001, digital), or its closest competitor, by Ton Koopman, Friederike Ernst, David Collyer and Tini Mathot, with the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra (Philips 6769 075, two disks). My own preference is for Mr. Pinnock's brisk, taut account, but that led by Mr. Koopman also has much to recommend it, and includes the double concertos on a second disk. Mozart's multiple keyboard works have also come in for thorough and competitive exploration on both old and new instruments. The most intriguing entry is a collaboration by Steven Lubin and Anthony Newman, who address the four-hand Sonata in F, K.497, and the Sonata for Two Pianos in D, K.448 (Arabesque 8125). Playing slightly jangly, brighttoned fortepianos, Messrs. Lubin and Newman light into the quick movements with a gripping vehemence, and turn the slow movements into pictures of crystalline grace. Performances of these works on modern pianos seem less emphatic and emotive, by contrast, but the rounder, fuller timbres of newer instruments convey equally valid sentiments of their own. For those interested in acquiring all of Mozart's duo piano works at a throw - seven sonatas, a Fugue, an Andante with variations, and a concerto - Rudolf Firkusny and Alan Weiss are sympathetic collaborators with a collection available at midprice (Vox Cum Laude, 3VCL 9010X, three disks). One caveat: smooth and perceptive as the playing is, the disk sound is rather boxy. A brighter recording and a more urbane conception of the Concerto for Two Pianos, K.365, is that of Christoph Eschenbach and Justus Frantz, with the former conducting the London Philharmonic (Angel DS 37903, digital). This is paired with an equally appealing rendition of Mozart's Concerto for Three Pianos, with Helmut Schmidt, the former West German Chancellor, on the relatively simple third piano part. Here we have a pairing of a worthy performance offered for the aid of a worthy cause: proceeds from the disk go to Amnesty International. The Mozart multiple piano concertos are youthful works, written to be performed by the composer and his sister, circumstances that also pertain to the first of Felix Mendelssohn's two double concertos. Composed when Mendelssohn was 15, and with the Mozart work clearly serving as a model, the piece is fresh, often showy, and somewhat naive, with many a Mozartian turn of phrase in the orchestral tuttis. Anthony and Joseph Paratore give the work a spirited, ingratiating reading, coupled with the more broad-boned and virtuosic set of variations on a Weber theme, for two pianos and orchestra, on which Mendelssohn and Ignaz Moscheles composed collaboratively a decade later (Schwann VMS 2088). Gabriel Faure's ''Dolly'' Suite is a charming salon piece that brings together movements of assorted characters, from the swaying, gentle Berceuse to the lilting Kitty Waltz and the vividly colored Le Pas Espagnole -actually more Parisian than Spanish in feeling. Magda Tagliaferro and Daniel Varsano are not the best matched of collaborators, the former being particularly gracious and the latter tending toward heavy-handedness (characteristics that particularly stand out in the solo Nocturnes that round out the disk); yet, Miss Tagliaferro's influence overrides, and the views they provide of Dolly and of the Ballade, Op.19, are sensitive ones, on balance (CBS IM 37246, digital). Sergei Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances, his final composition, is best known in its orchestral guise, but the composer fashioned an electrifying two-piano version that is certainly worth a hearing. Joshua Pierce and Dorothy Jonas cast the work in a sharp-edged but flattering light, and make an almost equally strong case for the composer's early ''Russian Rhapsody'' and Benjamin Britten's captivating but rarely heard Introduction and Rondo alla Burlesca (StoLat SZM 0123). Igor Stravinsky's music also reaps some dividends among recent releases. Ursula Oppens and Paul Jacobs take on two of Stravinsky's own four-hand piano transcriptions, ''Petroushka,'' the ballet score, and the Three Pieces for String Quartet (Nonesuch 79038, digital). Reductions of orchestral pieces are often disappointing, but this is a marvelous performance that offers an enlightening look at the score's textural riches, both by suggesting orchestral sonorities, and alternately, allowing the piano to speak on its own terms. A later Stravinsky work, the Concerto for Two Pianos, is an energetic work in the composer's New-Classic style that is given a strong performance by Klara Kormendi and Adam Fellegi (Hungaroton SLPX 12284). The other side of this disk is given over to a pair of intriguing contemporary Hungarian works - Szabolcs Esztenyi's Concertino for Two Pianos (1972-3), an insistent, pointillistic score with both minimalist and atonal leanings, performed by Miss Kormendi and the composer; and Laszlo Vidovsky's ''Double'' for Two Prepared Pianos (1968-73), a bizarre but often rather tactile and attractive work.

1048-> REAGAN, IN OREGON, FORECASTS POWERFUL ECONOMIC RECOVERY
President Reagan carried his message of America on the mend to the forested reaches of the badly depressed lumber industry today, predicting that the nation's economic recovery would be ''powerful and sustained.'' He told industry executives, ''the economy is revving up.'' It was the most optimistic terminology Mr. Reagan has used thus far in discussing the recovery. As he visited the plywood mill of the Weyerhaeuser Company, similar words of optimism were being broadcast on national radio in the President's recorded weekly speech. In it, he promised the nation that unemployment ''will be heading downward'' from the current 10.2 percent level. ''The other economic factors are too encouraging for it to hold out much longer,'' the President said. In the radio speech, he also said he would send Congress new proposals next week for dealing with long-term unemployment problems. These proposals include an option to turn unemployment benefits to tax credit vouchers as an inducement to businesses to hire the unemployed. The proposals would also increase job retraining grants to the states and would permit a 25 percent cut in the minimum age for summer jobs for the young unemployed. In his visit to the sawmill here, Mr. Reagan heard from lumber executives that the industry had been through ''devastating'' times but was showing signs of recovery. However, one executive cautioned that those signs ''must not be overstated.'' The President expressed sympathy that the executives were ''not out of the woods yet.'' He quickly amended this, considering the sylvan locale, and told the lumber executives, ''You're not back in the woods yet as far as you'd like to be.'' Local labor leaders were hardly as positive-sounding as the President in their description of the hard times here as a result of the slowdown in housing construction. On the motorcade route to the sawmill, groups of citizens held signs of complaint as well of welcome. Various picket signs proclaimed: ''Bread not bombs,'' ''Reagan not welcome in Oregon,'' ''Ax Gorsuch'' and ''Political Facade.'' The last was a reference to the local labor leaders' contention that the two-and-a-half hour Presidential visit was designed as a sham for the press. Mr. Reagan discussed the industry's troubles with four executives at a televised roundtable session led by Peter Murphy, a Eugene lumber executive who is Republican state committeeman for Oregon. The President emphasized recent readings that housing sales were up 10 percent and that housing construction starts were up 36 percent. The President, in discussing the nation's forest resources, made a smiling observation that there must be ''at least 240 million backpackers'' in the nation, considering the Government's wilderness preserves. More seriously, he later asserted, ''There is today in the United States as much forests as there were when Washington was at Valley Forge.'' In promising improvements for the lumber industry and the economy in general, Mr. Reagan vowed to maintain his efforts to fight inflation. He said interest rates had not fallen as far as he wished. ''They're still skeptical we might go back to the old ways,'' he said of the credit industry. ''I'd say, 'Over my dead body,' but there are too many people willing to take me up on that,'' he added with a smile. In his radio speech, the President estimated that half the unemployment rate was ''cyclical'' and resulted from the recession. He said he and Congress ''are working out our differences'' on the $4.9 billion jobs bill awaiting final approval in the Senate. ''The American economy is on the mend,'' the President said once again. ''And one of the reasons is that we've finally begun to correct some of the past errors of government that brought on inflation, high interest rates and recession.'' ---- Wilderness Stand Discussed KLAMATH FALLS, Ore., March 5 (AP) - The President said today that the private sector was not guilty of the ''rape of all the natural resources'' and that he opposed setting aside ''wholesale amounts'' of land as wilderness areas. Meeting with timber industry exectutives, Mr. Reagan was asked whether he would veto or sign a bill expanding wilderness acreage. He pointed out that about 80 million acres have been set aside. He said he could support some additions ''but not to go out in the wholesale amounts that they are talking about.'' ''Our private sector has not been guilty of rape of all the natural resources,'' he added. Congress has extended legal wilderness protection to about 80 million acres of pristine forest land, but most of it is in Alaska. About 25 million acres are in the lower 48 states, and wilderness advocates say that amounts to only a tiny fraction of the nation's land area.

1049-> AROUND THE WORLD; Iraq Says 9,800 Iranians Died in Failed Drive
Iraq said today that Iran's latest Persian Gulf war offensive had been turned back with more than 9,800 Iranians killed and no territory given up. The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an Iraqi major general at the front as saying the Iranians ''failed to seize even one inch of Iraqi land'' in the offensive, which began Sunday night. He said the Iranians had tried to thrust into Iraqi territory but that the tide had now turned in Iraq's favor. The Speaker of the Iran Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, called on Iraq and its supporters to accept Iran's demands for an end to the 31-month-old war. The Iranians reported that they captured new strategic heights north of the border town of Fakkeh today, overrunning Iraqi forward positions after destroying an infantry brigade and a tank battalion.

1050-> GOVERNOR WANTS TO STOP GIVING ALL ALASKANS YEARLY CHECKS FROM OIL FUND
With a new Governor in office and the world price of oil dropping, the days of carefree visits to the cash drawer may be drawing to a close for those in the Alaska state government. Gov. Bill Sheffield, a Democrat, wants to stop paying all Alaskans a share of interest earnings from the fund set up from oil royalty income seven years ago. Governor Sheffield said he thought that paying $1,000 to each Alaskan last year was a bad idea and that it contributed to a national view that Alaskans were rich. A view he and other officials termed a misconception. ''I campaigned against it,'' he said, referring to those months over the last two years when he left the hotel business to run for Governor. ''A cab driver in New York thought we were getting $10,000, not $1,000.'' Fund Set Up by Vote The oil income pool, called the Permanent Fund, was established by popular vote in 1976. A quarter of the state's oil royalty income must go into the fund. Jay Hammond, as Governor, fought hard for creating the fund and paying dividends from its earnings to Alaskans. If the dividend checks are sent again this year, they will be for about $300, Governor Sheffield said. But he wants to use the money instead for revenue sharing with local government, to reinvest in the Permanent Fund, to make payments to elderly people and to create an Alaska investment fund. He proposes that such an investment fund be set up to channel earnings out of the Permanent Fund to use in construction projects and to avoid distributing them to individual Alaskans. While legislators are noncommittal, a strong opposition to the proposal has emerged in letters to newspapers. Bill Detrick, of Ketchikan, said in one letter: ''Mr. Sheffield's demands at this time will inevitably result in the resurrection of the Alaska income tax. That is the next logical step and one no doubt already being considered by this administration. Watch out.'' Oil Revenues Falling Fast As the Legislature convened last month, members were confronted with the word that oil revenue was going to fall $1 billion below predictions. A rule of thumb used here is that a drop of $1 a barrel in oil prices costs the Alaska government $150 million a year. When the forecasts were made, Alaskan oil was selling at about $31.50, and it is now about $27.50 a barrel. A further drop of $2 or so is projected, based on the least desirable possibilities. Not that poverty has arrived here. Even under the influence of a constitutional amendment voted in November that limited spending, Governor Sheffield's budget for next year proposes spending just under $3 billion, or $7,000 per capita. California, by comparison, spends about $1,000 per capita. The Alaskan income tax ended when the oil money began to pour in. Sales taxes go to the local governments that levy them. Yet, Alaska officials are worried about their money. Although poor for the first 10 years of statehood, Alaska has thrived from the time oil was found at Prudhoe Bay in the Arctic in 1968. In 1959, the year of statehood, Alaska had $25.4 million to run its government, according to Robert Elliott, a research analyst in the State Deartment of Revenue. Ten years later collections had gone to $112 million. Most Income From Oil Mr. Elliott said that of the total $16.9 billion Alaska has collected for its own use since statehood, 80 percent has come from oil. The sources are royalties on state-owned land at Prudhoe Bay, severance taxes on removal of oil from the ground and business taxes on the oil companies. Alaska officials are ready to resist expected attacks by the Federal Government or others on the oil money. Alaska's United States Senators, Ted Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski, addressed joint sessions of the Legislature this month. Each warned of moves in Washington that might lead to repeal of the profits tax exemption that applies to Prudhoe Bay oil and of moves from states lacking natural resources to limit the ability of states with resource to impose taxes on minerals, petroleum and timber. Governor Sheffield, in answer to questions why Alaska should be exempted from taxes everyone else pays, said in an interview, ''We need the money to put the infrastructure into place. When we became a state we were broke and undernourished.'' In a recent interview in his office, he said: ''We've got a big country here and we've got to get into the minerals. We need to build bridges. We need cheaper power.'' Favors Building Dam He was asked what would happen if he proposed reviving the state income tax to finance construction of a mammoth hydroelectric dam on the Susitna River. He favors building the dam. ''The people would agree to it,'' he said of the income tax proposal for the project. When asked if planned such a proposal, he replied, ''No, not yet.'' Officials believe the state's reputation as a rich spendthrift may fuel action to take away some of the oil income. In his last year in office, Governor Hammond spent $2 million on a public relations campaign in other states to try to erase this image. Governor Sheffield said he would abandon this strategy, although he regarded the problem as a serious one. ''I really think we can improve the public perception of us by just sitting here minding the store and getting things in shape,'' he said.

1051-> NEW DATA EXPLAIN LAG IN PRODUCTIVITY
The Government today introduced a statistical series on productivity that shows that a drop in capital investment was not a major factor in the sharp decline in the growth rate of productivity in the 1970's. The series, called the multifactor productivity index, is an effort by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to present data that indicate the reasons underlying the trend in productivity. Today's announcement provided data covering 1948 to 1981. The series will be updated every September. Some economists welcomed the new series, which they said could help explain why productivity growth has slowed in the past decade or so. Rising productivity is one key way to achieve lower inflation because it means that more goods can be produced at the same cost, lessening pressure on prices. ''I view this as a first step toward an explanation for the reasons for changes in the output of the United States,'' said Edward Denison, a former Commerce Department official now studying productivity at the Brookings Institution here. This series, he added, ''indicates that changes in capital investment were one cause, but not the major cause, of the decline in productivity.'' Reagan's Tax Program Productivity growth has been a matter of major policy debate in recent years. The Reagan Administration pushed for significant tax cuts for business to stimulate capital investment, which they said was necessary to increase productivity. But the new productivity numbers provide additional support for those economists who have argued in the last several years that large increases in capital investment do not produce major productivity gains, and who have questioned the need for the large stimulus for capital investment that was a key part of President Reagan's tax package approved in 1981. According to the multifactor series, the drop in the growth rate of productivity after 1973 was mostly caused by a decline in the efficiency of both labor and of existing machinery and plants. The new data, however, still do not pinpoint the exact cause for the decline in productivity's growth rate. Among the explanations offered are the rise in energy prices in the 1970's and new government regulations. The new series supplements the old productivity data, which measured the output of all persons per hour but was not able to provide a breakdown of the factors. Efficiency Measured The new multifactor index, according to officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, measures the efficiency of labor, machinery and plants. When this measure is subtracted from the overall productivity measure, what is left is a measure of the impact of the new capital investment - new plants and machines - on productivity. Over all, the productivity averaged a growth rate of 3 percent a year from 1948 to 1973 and then fell to an average growth of eighttenths of 1 percent through 1981. According to the data released today, of the 3 percent average, two percentage points resulted from multifactor productivity and one percentage point from new capital improvements. Of the total 2.2 percentage point decline in overall productivity after 1973, 1.9 percentage points resulted from a decline in efficiency, while the drop in the rate of new capital investment for machines and plants accounted for only three-tenths of one percentage point. The impact of capital investment is shown more dramatically in the productivity figures for manufacturing. Overall productivity, which rose by an average of 2.9 percent a year until 1973, fell to an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent between 1973 and 1981. In this case, multifactor productivity dropped by 1.8 percentage points while the contribution of new capital in plant and equipment rose fourtenths of one percentage point.

1052-> GOVERNORS' GROUP CALLS ON REAGAN TO SLASH DEFICITS
Leaders of the National Governors Association called on the Federal Government today to reduce the growth of military spending, maintain the current level of social welfare spending and consider raising taxes to slash the Federal budget deficit over the next five years. It was their most comprehensive statement to date on Reagan Administration fiscal policies. The appeal to Congress and the Administration, approved by the governors' executive committee, represented their first formal statement on military spending as well as their most forceful warning about the Federal deficit, which most governors see as a threat to the health of state economies. The chairman of the association, Gov. Scott M. Matheson of Utah, a Democrat, and the vice chairman, Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois, a Republican, jointly sponsored a proposal calling on Congress and the White House to reduce the annual Federal deficit to $90 billion in the fiscal year 1988. Projections by the Congressional Budget Office show that under present law the deficit will reach a postwar high of $194 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and will rise to $267 billion in 1988. The governors said the Federal deficit, now estimated to be 6.1 percent of the gross national product, should be reduced to 2 percent of that index, the combined market value of all goods and services, in 1988. Mr. Thompson said the governors' policy statement should not be construed as ''an attack on the President or his programs,'' but he noted that ''the Administration does not support it.'' The President's budget calls for more rapid growth in military spending and more cuts in the growth of social welfare spending than the governors wanted. Mr. Thompson said the gist of the governors' message to Washington was, ''Put our fiscal house in order, or you're going to kill us all.'' ''It's a mark of the desperation of our position that we are willing to settle for a $90 billion deficit in 1988 when everybody had been hoping for a balanced budget,'' Governor Thompson said. Gov. Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania, a Republican, said he felt uneasy about the policy statement because it was too specific about national military and revenue requirements for the Federal Government. He said he did not understand how the governors, ''without a Defense Department of our own,'' could know whether a particular level of military spending was adequate to protect national security. But many governors clearly wanted their association to play a larger role in the national budget debate than it had before. Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, a Republican, said, ''We may not be experts on the Federal budget, but we ought to be experts on the implications of the Federal budget in the 50 states.'' The governors' association has prided itself on being a nonpartisan organization. But as the governors gathered here at the Hyatt Regency Hotel for their winter meeting, there seemed to be a sharper edge to their comments about the Reagan Administration, reflecting in part the Democrats' increased majority. Thirty-four of the 50 Governors are now Democrats. Before the November elections, 27 Governors were Democrats. The governors' budget resolution was drafted with the help of Raymond C. Scheppach, the new executive director of the association. He had been deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office, and his selection by the governors shows their increasing concern about Federal spending and tax policy. Governors' Recommendations In their statement, the governors warned that large deficits, which would force the Government to compete with other borrowers for available capital in the credit markets, could choke off the incipient economic recovery by driving interest rates back up to extremely high levels. To reduce the deficit, they made these recommendations: - The real value of military appropriations, excluding inflation, should be allowed to grow no more than 4 percent to 6 percent from 1984 to 1985, and it should grow an average of only 3 to 5 percent a year from 1984 through 1988. The first Congressional budget resolution for the current fiscal year assumes real growth of approximately 9.5 percent in the next two years, and that is slightly below President Reagan's request. - The governors said ''revenues may have to be increased'' to hold the Federal deficit to $90 billion in 1988. However, they did not recommend any specific type of tax increase. Repealing the third year of the tax cut enacted at President Reagan's request would save $30 billion in the fiscal year 1984, according to the Congressional Budget Office. - Congress should approve the proposals made by the bipartisan National Commission on Social Security Reform. These proposals, including a delay in cost-of-living adjustments and a tax on a portion of Social Security benefits for higher-income individuals, would reduce spending for the main Social Security program in 1988 by $24 billion, from the anticipated level of $211 billion, the governors said. - Congress should make only marginal reductions in such benefit programs as welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and guaranteed student loans. The governors recommended reductions of only $2 billion in these programs, expected to cost a total of $127 billion in 1988. - Spending for ''nondefense, discretionary spending'' programs, such as Federal aid to state and local governments, should increase at only three-fourths of the inflation rate. - Congress should restrict the growth of benefit programs in which there is no test of financial need. Such programs include Medicare, Social Security and disability insurance. The governors urged Congress to cut $15 billion to $18 billion from such programs, which would otherwise cost $173 billion in 1988.

1053-> THE NATION; Defense Budget: The Uncuttables
As it did last year, the Defense Department told Congress last week that any cuts in its budget request would mean the elimination of badly needed weapons. And as they did last year, key legislators vowed to trim the request. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger was greeted with skepticism on all sides when he told the House Budget Committee that a 1984 spending authorization of $274.1 billion - 10 percent higher, after a 4 percent inflation allowance, than last year - was the minimum necessary to preserve security. Representative James R. Jones, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the panel, rebuked Mr. Weinberger for saying that Administration critics were undermining the country's defenses. Mr. Jones said he wanted to hold the increase to 5 percent, after inflation, for a saving of $8 billion. Most committee members seemed inclined to go along. Mr. Jones also asked Mr. Weinberger to suggest items on the Pentagon's shopping list the country could do without. When the Defense Secretary declined, Mr. Jones made an end run to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking their thoughts on a list of proposed cuts in President Reagan's five-year, $1.6 trillion defense plan. Mr. Reagan, meanwhile, was revamping some current arms spending projections. He said he would cancel about two-thirds of the planned production of cruise missiles - cutting in half the value of the Boeing Company's $8.7 billion contract -and open the bidding for an advanced version of the weapon incorporating ''stealth'' technology for avoiding radar detection. The new missile was said to be necessary because of unexpectedly rapid advances in the Soviet Union's ability to detect and destroy the low-flying cruise missile. But Congress has the authority to overrule the decision, and a move to do so was launched by legislators from Washington, where Boeing has its headquarters.

1054-> OUSTER ARBITRARY, MOSCOW COMPLAINS
The Soviet Union said today that the expulsion of 47 officials from France had been ''absolutely arbitrary'' and the stated reason ''obviously fabricated.'' An article distributed by Tass, the Government's press agency, said: ''A few days ago the French authorities ordered a number of employees of the embassy and other Soviet missions in France to leave the country without any grounds, under obviously fabricated pretexts that are totally at odds with reality. ''Representations made to the French side at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. and through the Soviet Embassy in Paris have stated a most resolute protest over this absolutely arbitrary action. It was stressed that responsibility for its consequences to Soviet-French relations rests entirely with those who had planned and carried it out.'' The expulsions were the talk of the diplomatic community here, and speculation focused on how the Russians would respond. Diplomats found that the Tass response reflected both Soviet anger and indecision over what to do. Cooling of Relations Although Soviet-French relations cooled after the election of Francois Mitterrand to the presidency, the Russians have retained a special attitude toward France among Western governments for a number of reasons. These include the fact that France does not participate in the military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that four Communists serve in Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist-led Government and, more generally, that France has often remained independent of the United States, as in the case of support for the new natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe. A sign of a changed Soviet attitude appeared on Tuesday, when Tass criticized French nuclear weapon tests in the South Pacific. In contrast to criticism of the American and British military, the French have rarely come under attack in the Soviet press. One problem is that the French presence in Moscow is only a fraction of the Soviet presence in France. Diplomats said that the omission by Tass of the number of diplomats expelled from Paris and of the fact that they had been accused of espionage left the Russians the option of retaliating by asking fewer French diplomats to leave without accusing them of being spies.

1055-> AROUND THE WORLD; Peru Says Its Forces Killed 69 Rebels in 6 Days
Soldiers and policemen killed 69 insurgents in a six-day period, the military command said, in an offensive launched after the massacre by leftist guerrillas of Peruvian peasants in a remote Andean village. The Government operation began a day after the Easter Sunday slaying of 67 peasants in the town of Lucanamarca, according to a spokesman for command headquarters in Ayacucho, 350 miles southeast of Lima. The Government attributed the Easter killings to the leftist Shining Path movement. A communique issued late Wednesday by the military command said troops and special antiterrorist policemen and paramilitary civil guard units also seized arms, ammunition, dynamite and propaganda in the operation.

1056-> VOLUNTARY BUSING PLAN BEING STUDIED
Renee Gregory sits in the front row at Kirkwood High School, eager for the education she hopes will give her a chance to become a physician. She is among 930 black students from St. Louis, where mandatory busing was ordered in 1980, who travel each day to predominantly white suburban schools under voluntary metropolitan desegregation. On Monday, Federal District Judge William Hungate will consider the success of the voluntary plan, which is now followed by 15 St. Louis County school districts, and determine whether to order the county's other eight districts to participate. The hearing could take as long as two weeks. The Justice Department, which once argued for increased busing, refused last month to take a position. 'It's Like a Dream' Renee lives with her parents and younger sister in an apartment just a few blocks from a public high school. She thought she could get a better education outside the city, and transferred to Kirkwood. ''It's like a dream to me,'' said Renee, a vivacious 17-year-old high school junior. ''Kirkwood is a good school. All the teachers out there are like moms and dads to me. They're so concerned. We even invited one of my teachers over for Thanksgiving dinner - and she actually came.'' Renee's decision means an hour's cab ride each day at state expense. Meanwhile, 345 white suburban students go into the city each day to attend 19 specialized magnet schools offering academically advanced programs or specialization in such fields as art and communication. In both cases, students may transfer if they wish. Cost State $1.7 Million The program cost about $1.7 million last year, or about $3,650 per student, all of it state money. Another 7,175 students are bused to different city schools under a mandatory Federal court desegregation order. Nearly 80 percent of the city's 59,000 students are black, but blacks make up only 37 percent of the combined city-county student population. The city's desegregation case goes back to 1972, when Minnie Liddell, who had children in the schools, filed a lawsuit against the St. Louis Board of Education and the state contending that city schools remained segregated. In March 1980 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed with her and ordered Federal District Judge James Meredith to oversee desegregation of public schools in St. Louis. Busing began without incident in the city that fall, but Judge Meredith refused to extend the order to the suburbs. Sees Lack of Concern ''There's a lot of deep feeling in the county, but they weren't concerned about what happened in the city,'' Judge Meredith said recently. ''But if we'd starting moving these city kids into the county, you would have had a first-class mess on your hands.'' Referring to suburban districts, he said, ''I dismissed them as parties because I knew we had all the problems we needed without the county.'' After Judge Meredith gave up the case, citing his health as the reason, Judge Hungate ordered suburban districts to begin preparing for mandatory metropolitan desegregation. But he also proposed an alternative: that the city swap students with suburban districts voluntarily to bring the black student population in the suburbs to 15 to 25 percent. Four suburban districts agreed initially. Now more than half the districts in St. Louis County are taking part. ''That's the only way the voluntary basis would work,'' Judge Meredith said. ''I'm sure the suburban districts have come into the program because they didn't want to be subjected to a harsher, mandatory program.'' Seen Harming City Schools Critics say the program represents a brain drain from city schools. ''Some black parents complain that the cream of the crop is going out to the suburbs and there is no challenge in our schools,'' said Anthony Sestrick, an attorney for white parents in the case. ''And the kids coming in from the county are going to magnet schools, so the quality of city schools is actually deteriorating.'' ''I worried about getting the cream of the crop from the city, but we haven't done that,'' said Franklin McCallie, principal of Kirkwood, where 19 percent of the 1,400 students are black. Kirkwood has accepted 45 students from the city. ''We've gotten some very, very fine kids, but not all,'' Mr. McCallie said. ''What we are taking is kids who have a strong desire to get a fine education, which has spilled over into a lot of support for the program and for our school.''

1057-> THE NATION IN SUMMARY; A Long String Is Attached To Jobs Bill
By week's end, only William O'Connell, president of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, seemed to be maintaining his cool about the rider holding up Senate passage of a recession-relief jobs bill. President Reagan, sounding as ''deeply disturbed'' as he said he was, broke with practice to promise a veto if repeal of last year's tax-withholding provision on bank interest and dividends stayed attached. Robert Dole followed bitter denunciation on the Senate floor with hearings on increasing the low taxes banks now pay (''There is no direct relationship between this and the avalanche of mail'' produced by the banks' repeal drive, ''but it might have expedited'' the hearing, the Senate Finance Committee chairman said). ''The President's statement,'' Mr. O'Connell said, ''is unfortunate. A majority of both houses wants repeal.'' Unless Senate leaders prove remarkable armtwisters over the weekend, Mr. O'Connell may prove right. The claim of Robert W. Kasten Jr., the freshman Republican from Wisconson who is pushing repeal, that he has the votes, was not disputed by chiefs of either party. Both want the rider removed, partly to avoid a veto, partly because of their concern that approval would make them appear to have yielded to bankers' pressure and partly because repeal is estimated to cost $4 billion a year. The Internal Revenue Service says that $20 billion a year in investment income goes unreported; banks complain of the costs of withholding. The hope in the Senate is that an undisputed section of the jobs bill, providing $5 billion in Federal loans that almost 30 states need by middweek Wednesday to keep on paying unemployment benefits, will bring its own pressure. The House passed a similar jobs measure two weeks ago (the House would provide nearly $5 billion for temporary jobs and humanitarian aid, the Senate, a little less than $4 billion), and a separate vote on the withholding repeal would be required. It is expected to carry.

1058-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; SPICE ISLAND STRAINS
This brilliantly green island republic of 100,000 people in the south Caribbean is worrying its neighbors and provoking harsh frowns from the mighty U.S. It is another example of the dilemma of social reform and American foreign policy. Four years ago, a small leftist group led by Maurice Bishop overthrew the corrupt, bullying regime of Eric Gairy who had dominated Grenada for 28 years, running down its meager economy based on tourism and export of nutmeg and other spices. Mr. Bishop launched an impressive public program. On the face of it, it is perplexing that Mr. Bishop won't hold elections because compared with the past he has achieved a good deal. Deputy Premier Bernard Coard, a hulking, bearded man of sharp intelligence answers this question with an impatient, chiding question of his own: ''Do you equate elections with democracy?'' On Grenada's record, he has a point. Mr. Gairy, supported by his ''Mongoose gang'' of thugs, did run what people here call ''rum and corned beef elections,'' rigged rituals that had nothing to do with free expression of public will. But that doesn't explain why better elections can't be held, why there are still about 90 political prisoners held without charge or trial in the brilliantly lit prison above the picture-postcard capital, why the attempt to start an independent paper was suppressed and its editor jailed. It is for these reasons, the U.S. State Department says, that Washington refuses to exchange ambassadors with Grenada, excludes it from President Reagan's Caribbean Basin initiative and is trying to cut it out of U.S. aid programs. That is just as unconvincing as the Bishop government's excuses. If human rights and democratic process were really the test, why is the U.S. getting so chummy with, say, Guatemala - where a military regime murders people by the thousands? Obviously, there's a different reason. Grenada has aligned itself with Cuba, which gave military aid and is building a huge new international airport. On the site, posters in Spanish show Fidel Castro with the slogan ''In Grenada, your example guides us.'' Grenada votes routinely with the East in international organizations, whatever the issue - from Afghanistan to the Falklands. Official rhetoric has been stridently anti-American. Political education manuals use the language of textbook Marxism, although public slogans are mild compared with other revolutionary regimes. Typical example: ''Build the revolution. Grow more food.'' Mr. Coard says Grenada seriously wants better relations with the U.S., but on its own terms. If national policies were the test, he snaps, ''I'd have my own shopping list for the U.S., on things like racism, women's rights, housing, medical service. But we are not so arrogant.'' Washington seems to think it can turn the regime away from the East by ostracizing it. No doubt that is nonsense. Neither, though, is there much to support the conventional argument that U.S. disapproval is responsible for driving Grenada into Soviet arms. But the policy is, said a conservative businessman, giving more credibility to the leftist argument that the U.S. won't accept social progress and that Grenada has to look elsewhere for desperately needed aid. ''It shows the U.S. as immature,'' he said. ''You ought to be able to overlook the heady rhetoric of young leaders on a tiny, poor island. Everyday life is normal and reasonable here.'' But he demanded anonymity. No so Alister Hughes, a fiercely independent-minded journalist who supported Mr. Bishop at first out of revulsion for Mr. Gairy. He is now the Government's most outspoken critic, much harrassed. Still, he says, ''Bishop is well-intentioned but the price - the prisoners and suppression of press freedom - is too high.'' There is a surprising gap between the hard-left talk and pro-Cuban international stance of the leaders and the moderate, mixed-economy, reformist program it is running. My impression is that they are convinced Marxists, though they don't use the term, but they are shrewd enough to know Grenadians don't want a Communist-style regime. Mr. Coard says he has ''no model'' but only seeks what best suits Grenada. He doesn't seem to realize how hard it is to invent a new kind of happy Socialism. Many have tried without success, and the Cuban connection holds a risk of being drawn irreversibly under Eastern dominion. A subtle and sound U.S. policy would try to prevent such polarization and the stark choice between being pro-American or pro-Soviet. Even if Washington doesn't trust Mr. Bishop and Mr. Coard, it should show more confidence in Grenadians' aspirations and more tolerance while the youthful leaders learn to be practical. America's stern, cold shoulder is moving nothing, increasing regional tension and strengthening those who say anti-Americanism is the only hope for progress.

1059-> Evolution Of a Team
''IT'S as quiet as a cemetery here,'' said Walt Frazier. This was more than a month ago, and the former Knick star sat in Madison Square Garden watching his former team, then in last place in the Atlantic Division, clank through another dank and deadly effort. ''This,'' said a Knick official, who had asked that his name not be used, ''is the pits.'' The ghosts of the exciting Knick teams seemed to flutter around the championship flags of 1970 and 1973 that hung from the rafters. One might have imagined a wind whistling through the empty seats and upper reaches of the vast arena. Crowds of 4,000 and 5,000 were showing up where once capacity crowds of nearly 20,000 emoted with such intensity that, as Frazier once said when coming back to the bench after a terrific Knick spurt, ''you listen to that standing ovation and it just makes you jingle inside.'' The Knicks now seemed not only lifeless, but hopeless. Suddenly, they began to win. On Saturday night they returned to the Garden from a road trip and beat Chicago, 94-79. It was the Knicks' 14th victory in 17 games. The Knicks pushed their record to 28 victories, 29 losses, and if the playoffs were to start today instead of at the end of March, they'd be the fifth of six teams in the Eastern Conference to qualify. The joint wasn't necessarily jumping on Saturday night, but it certainly was stirring. The crowd of 9,076 was definitely pregnant with possibility. The Garden cognoscenti - and there are many in the throng - can spot a good pick as quickly as they can a good pickpocket. What they saw on Saturday night were more hands and arms than had been visible on the court in some time. ''If you're not going to keep your hands up on defense,'' said Hubie Brown, the Knick coach, chastising his pigeon-toed veteran guard, Paul Westphal, ''then there's no reason for you to be out there.'' And the coach, who prepares for games with the detail of a paleontologist, scouts the rivals carefully and knows their plays, diligently explains it all to his players - and expects them to see the plays unravelling as he does. ''C'mon,'' he shouts to one of his players on the court near him, ''you knew your guy was going baseline - that's like our No. 5 play!'' On offense, the Knicks are nor longer shooting the first chance they get their hands on the ball. But they're still less than perfect. ''You don't have to take a shot like that facing the basket,'' shouts Brown at Bill Cartwright, the 7-foot-1-inch center with a mustache and goatee in the shape of a long O. But later, there comes a play that pleases Brown, and he claps. Cartwright gets the ball in the pivot, passes out to Westphal in the corner at the baseline. Westphal looks, then passes back to Cartwright. Cartwright passes back to Westphal. Westphal returns the ball. Almost like the old game of keep the hat away. But Cartwright bangs toward the basket and hits a short hook. ''That's patience,'' Brown would say after the game. ''Earlier in the season Bill would have put the ball on the floor immediately and been tied up. Or Westphal would have shot because he would have been so surprised to get a pass he figured he'd better make the most of it.'' It is obvious that the team is becoming more comfortable with itself. Only two of the 11 players Saturday night were with the Knicks for all of last season - Cartwright and Marvin Webster. Sly Williams was out for some of the year with a variety of problems and Westphal joined them for only the last 18 games. The coach is also in his first year. ''I didn't inherit a team,'' he said, ''I inherited a group of people meeting for the first time.'' At first many bridled at the acidic language Brown uses. ''But after awhile,'' said Westphal, ''you realize that that's him and you don't take it personally.'' Brown maintains a tighter control of his team than most coaches. He calls most of the plays on offense. And he has a particularly shrill voice, so there can be no mixup on the calls. But for all his planning, for all his firmness, it took an accident - perhaps two - to get the Knicks going. In mid-January, both Bernard King, the high-scoring forward, and Ed Sherod, the rookie point guard, were injured. This opened up the chance for Cartwright and Truck Robinson, the forward, to become more than just spectators on offense. Each responded with a series of 20-point games, and Cartwright has averaged 19.6 points in the last 17 games. And Westphal, a 10-year league veteran, became the point guard, or floor leader. He was not as tight as Sherod, a rookie who seemed hesitant to make a risky pass into the pivot for fear of Hubie's net plucking him off the court. The Knicks launched the winning streak. When King and Sherod returned, the team continued to win. King, always a team player, has fit snugly back in. Dave DeBusschere, a forward on the Knick championship teams, and now the director of the Knick basketball operations, stands in a runway on floor level, white-haired at age 42, in tan corduroy jacket and canvas shoes, arms crossed. ''They're quicker and they're more confident,'' he observed after the game. He mentioned the recent acquisition of Rory Sparrow, a swift guard, as being a big help. ''There's no substitute for quickness.'' He added, ''They're learning how to win, and no longer just trying to hang on. But, hey, we've still got a long way to go.'' Hubie Brown was equally sanguine. When it was mentioned that only one of the 14 teams the Knicks beat in their streak had better than a .500 record, he said without hesitation, ''You're on the right track.'' The next two games the Knicks play are against Philadelphia and Boston at home, tomorrow and Saturday. Is that a test? ''We're coming together,'' said Brown, ''but you can't expect a miracle in one year. The 76ers and the Celtics are tremendously talented and have playoff experience. Hey, the Lakers are 0 and 4 against those two teams.'' ''Reality,'' said Brown, ''is reality.''

1061-> THE SNOWBOUND SAGA OF BUS NO. 66
When John Patti wheeled his blue and gold bus out of the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 6:30 Friday night, his schedule called for him to travel the 15 miles to Montclair in 30 minutes. It took seven and a half hours. Mr. Patti's 51 passengers, most of them seasoned commuters, knew it was trouble from the start. The snow was coming down fast, and it took the bus an hour to get through the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan. Thus began the journey of DeCamp Bus Lines' No. 66 bus as it fought its way across the Meadowlands of New Jersey through the worst snowstorm in years. It was an odyssey repeated by thousands of suburbanites Friday night as they struggled by bus and automobile to reach their homes. Many more were stranded in the city when officials stopped letting vehicles through the tunnel. The crawl west toward Route 3 was slow, yet promising. But by the time the bus had reached Secaucus, not far east of Giants Stadium, the traffic had congealed into a jell of stalled trucks, buses and cars. 'Does This Happen Often?' DeCamp 66 got there at about 8:30 - two hours out of the terminal - and sat immobile for nearly four hours as the windows frosted up, the bright reading lights burned, the windshield wipers slapped and the warming heat floated through the bus. ''Does this happen often?'' asked Bridgit, a young woman visiting from Sweden. ''I hope not,'' replied her seatmate drily. Mild irritation gave way to apprehension. How was the gasoline supply, Richard Bonsal asked John Patti. The driver was reassuring; there was a two-day supply. Some passengers said they thought they would need it. But the apprehension then melted into resignation and, finally, some sense of adventure. A few passengers tried to doze, others read. Several felt confined and ventured out into the snow. Foraging for food began, and tales of outside excitement returned to the bus. It was suburban pioneering. Peanuts and Wild Waitresses Some passengers found food at Paul's Diner, 100 yards down Route 3. They came back with provisions -potato chips, pretzels and peanuts - and exotic tales of two harried waitresses who were so exhausted they were about to crack skulls. Still others went in search of a toilet and found success. ''The facilities are primitive,'' reported Chandler Grannis as he shook the snow from his coat. ''If William Faulkner had lived here, he'd have written about it.'' And others walked to a nearby Shell gas station, where attendants were busily hauling cans of fuel to stranded automobiles, to make phone calls home and observe their woes on the station's television set. A dozen people stood in line at the telephone, patient except for one man in a sheepskin coat who shouted over the line to his wife: ''Am I driving? No, three camels brought me here!'' Outside the frosty bus, the ghostly shapes of stalled trucks, buses and abandoned cars loomed ominously in the swirling snow. And rumors came back with the foraging passengers. Cheers and Applause ''A truck has jackknifed up ahead.'' ''The bridge is closed, we'll never get through.'' ''The television says tunnel-bound traffic will be moving by midnight but we won't move till 6 A.M.'' ''Please pass the potato chips.'' At midnight, some shouted: ''There goes a car!'' Cheers rang out. Five minutes later John Patti, with chains on the wheels, moved the bus ahead two feet. Applause. At 12:15 A.M. a young woman in a purple coat bounded onto the bus, after walking a half-mile from another DeCamp bus up ahead that she said was running out of gas. Five minutes later, a stalled car having been pushed out of the way, DeCamp 66 struggled free and began to rumble, ever so slowly, westward toward home. More cheers. Those few miles were negotiated in 90 minutes, with an occasional stop to allow passengers to push a stalled car out of the way. But spirits by then were rising, and the first passenger to debark was cheered home. A nostalgic camaraderie already was developing on what by now was known as the ''6:30-66.'' ''We should have a reunion,'' said a man in a cap. ''A summer reunion,'' a woman replied.

1062-> Soviet Aide Dismissed For Gross Corruption
The Soviet leadership has dismissed the Deputy Minister of Light Engineering for gross corruption and incompetence, the Communist Party daily Pravda said today. A scathing satirical article in Pravda depicted the Deputy Minister, Anatoly M. Yershov, as a ''waster'' who abused his position to build himself a country house out of state resources and who received lavish gifts from subordinates at state expense. For his 50th birthday, Pravda reported, Mr. Yershov was given a vase worth $400 by the Uzbekistan textile producing industry. As proof of the former official's conceit, Pravda said the vase was engraved with his own face.

1063-> COMIC BOOK AGAINST DRUGS
''Skree! Blam! Foom!'' The White House presents a special issue of ''The New Teen Titans,'' a comic book about superheroes who vanquish drug abuse. The comic book, produced by DC Comics of New York and underwritten by the Keebler Company, was unveiled today as a new tool to help prevent drug use among fourth graders. In a cover letter, Nancy Reagan tells the youngsters: ''Don't let anyone tell you that you can't be a hero. Declare that you will stay drug-free. And you'll be a hero - to your mother and father, family and friends, but most of all, to yourself.'' The comic book tells of the exploits of ''The New Teen Titans.'' Though the Titans, seven teen-agers who fight evil across the universe, never tell youngsters that drugs are bad, most eventually see the light for themselves. The comic book is being distributed by the Education Department to one million fourth graders in 35,000 schools.

1064-> RATINGS RACE WON BY CBS
Bolstered by the continued popularity of such weekly series as ''60 Minutes'' and ''Dallas,'' CBS has won the prime-time network ratings race for the 1982-83 television season that ended last Sunday. CBS achieved its victory despite record-breaking audiences for two miniseries, ''The Winds of War'' and ''The Thorn Birds'' on ABC. For the season, which began in September, CBS had an 18.2 rating, a half point more than ABC, which had a 17.7, and well ahead of NBC, which had a 15.1. The rating represents the percentage of all the homes with television sets that are tuned to a given program. Each rating point represents 833,000 homes and is worth about $50 million in annual advertising revenues. Last year the results were CBS, 19 rating; ABC, 18.1, and NBC the same 15.1. CBS has been first in the prime-time ratings for the last four years. This season, it had the four highest rated series: ''60 Minutes,'' ''Dallas,'' ''M*A*S*H,'' and ''Magnum, P.I.'' The farewell episode of ''M*A*S*H'' on Feb. 28 ranked as the most popular single program in television history. CBS's other shows in the 10 for the season were ''Simon and Simon,'' ranked seventh, and ''Falcon Crest,'' ranked eighth. ABC and NBC Rankings ABC had three shows in the top 10: ''Dynasty,'' which ranked fifth, ''Three's Company,'' sixth, and ''The Love Boat,'' ninth. NBC had only one, ''The A Team,'' ranked 10th - the only new show of the season to rise that high in the ratings. Indeed, out of 31 new programs introduced in the fall and at midseason in January and February, only three rank in the top 20 shows. In addition to ''The A Team,'' they are ''Newhart'' and ''Gloria.'' An analysis prepared by CBS, however, shows a continuation of the decline in the three-network share of the prime-time audience that began eight years ago. Last season, the three networks had 83 per cent of the audience, and this season that share dropped to 81 per cent. But, because of an increase in the number of television sets in use, CBS says that the over-all audience for the three networks stayed steady.

1065-> EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCHES TO MARK EASTER IN OLD RITES
Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter this Sunday in rites recalling not only the spiritual power of Jesus' Resurrection, but also their churches' cherished role as guardians of the doctrine of an undivided Christendom. Archbishop Iakavos of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America will light the paschal candle at the altar of Holy Trinity Cathedral at 319 East 74th Street at midnight tomorrow while thousands of worshipers wait in the darkened church to proclaim, ''Christos aneste!'' (Christ is risen.) In similar rites, Orthodox churches around the world mark the Easter festival this weekend. The celebration this year is five weeks after the Easter of Western Christians because the Orthodox calendar is based on a fourth-century decision stipulating that the festival must be on the Sunday following the vernal equinox, but always be after the Jewish Passover. Scattered throughout the world, and in the minority in most countries, the 200 million Eastern Orthodox Christians hold firmly to the classic theology drawn from the decisions of the ecumenical councils held in the first eight centuries of Christian history. Gains Made in Last 20 Years Though they once kept to themselves in ethnic ghettos, Orthodox churches in the last two decades have had some success in bringing their theology into the councils of world Christendom. They are prominent members of the World Council of Churches, a largely Protestant body, and have established cordial relations with the Roman Catholic Church. Each has its own patriarch and organization. ''But we are one church, in communion with each other sacramentally,'' said the Rev. Thomas Hopko, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America who teaches at St. Vladimir's Seminary in Tuckahoe, N.Y. For many Orthodox, the symbol of their unity is the liturgy and the honor many of them give to the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul as ''first among equals'' in the Orthodox hierarchy. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, with about 1.9 million members, is the largest of a number of Orthodox denominations in the United States, which are generally grouped according to national backgrounds -Syrians, Russians, Bulgarians, Serbians, Romanians, Albanians and Ukrainians. Rites of Early Christians Though it has not regained the temporal power of its early centuries, Eastern Orthodoxy holds that the theology of the early Christian era should be elevated today. During Holy Week and Easter Services, the Orthodox churches exhibit what Father Hopko says is their greatest treasure, the Divine Liturgies. These rites are replete with symbolism, incense, ornately vested clergy and solemn chant. The Orthodox Church in America has about one million members today and, along with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, includes about three-quarters of the Orthodox believers in North America. The Antiochan Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, a denomination connected to the Patriarch of Damascus, is also active in ecumenical affairs in the United States. It has 152,000 members in 120 parishes. Among the smaller Orthodox churches in the United States is the Russian Orthodox Church in the U.S.A., Patriarchal Parishes, whose headquarters is St. Nicholas Cathedral at 15 East 97th Street in Manhattan. The patriarchal parishes are still technically under the religious jurisdiction of Patriach Pimen of Moscow. A few blocks away, at 75 East 93d Street, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia will celebrate Easter on Sunday. This group, with perhaps 50,000 members in the United States, rejects the authority of the Patriarch of Moscow.

1066-> AROUND THE WORLD; Greece Assails a Threat For New State in Cyprus
Greece expressed concern today to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council over a threat by the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, to create an independent state in northern Cyprus, Government officials said. The message was delivered to the Ambassadors of Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union and China after they had been summoned to the Foreign Ministry here. Officials said the threat was seen as a reaction to the General Assemply resolution last week, which called for the withdrawal of occupation troops from Cyprus.

1073-> BROTHER INDUSTRIES' NEW LOOK
Brother Industries, Japan's leading producer of sewing machines and typewriters, is entering the office automation field, not so much by choice but by necessity. The company is being driven by stagnation in its traditional sewing machine business and the drastic changes that microelectronics technology has brought to the typewriter market. ''We are being forced into office automation,'' said Katsuji Kawashima, the 64-year-old president of Brother. Its principal entries in the field are electronic typewriters and computer printers. To increase recognition of its brand name and typewriters in the United States, the company has begun a $25.5 million advertising campaign. The American electronic typewriter market is now dominated by I.B.M. Sales Up Sharply Last year Brother's sales of electronic typwriters - distinguished from electric models by their printed circuit boards, crowded with semiconductor chips, underneath the keys -jumped more than fivefold, to the equivalent of $43 million. Revenues from computer printers more than doubled in 1982, to $51 million. To be sure, the big gains are bloated by the fact that these are comparatively new products for Brother. Still, the Nikko Research Center forecasts that the company's sales of computer printers and electronic typewriters will register average annual increases of 44 percent and 32 percent, respectively, from 1982 through 1986. In the typewriter business, the company is aiming at the office market in the United States of three million units a year. This market has long been dominated by the Selectric models of the International Business Machines Corporation. In fact, I.B.M. holds about 70 percent of the office typewriter market worldwide. Yet with the advent of electronic typewriters, I.B.M.'s control of this market has been challenged not only by established typewriter makers such as Olivetti, SCM and Brother, but also by companies like Xerox, Canon and Ricoh. ''With the new technology, the market has opened up,'' said Yoshihiro Yasui, senior managing director at Brother. ''So we think there is a great opportunity for us.'' The office typewriter, some analysts say, is moving into a realm of competition that in other industries has favored Japanese companies -low-cost mass production of a microelectronics-based item. 'A Japanese Game' ''The typewriter is becoming a Japanese game,'' said Kenichi Ohmae, managing director of Mckinsey & Company in Tokyo, ''and Brother seems to be the leader.'' Brother's earnings last year, aided by growth in the office automation lines, rose 50 percent, to $27.7 million, on a 7 percent rise in sales, to $592 million. Because nearly half of its business comes from export sales, the company was also buoyed by a weak yen, which makes its products less costly in foreign markets. For the current fiscal year, which ends in November, Brother's profit growth is expected to slow considerably, largely because of an expected strengthening of the yen. Analysts' estimates of this year's earnings increase range from less than 5 percent to more than 15 percent. Most analysts agree that once the anticipated currency adjustment is absorbed, Brother should register yearly gains of at least 10 to 15 percent through the mid-1980's. Office Opened on Coast Preparing for stepped-up activity in the United States, Brother in March opened a sales office and distribution center outside Los Angeles. Brother is no stranger to the American market. About 40 percent of its export sales, mostly portable typewriters and sewing machines, are already made in the United States. The company is the secondlargest purveyor of typewriters for use outside the office in the United States, after SCM. Most analysts say that Brother should do well in the office typewriter market, which it entered in 1980, but they question how long the market will remain strong. 'Good Bridge Product' The electronic typewriter is a ''good bridge product'' whose life span will probably be five years or so, until technological and manufacturing improvements drive the price of word processors down to replace typewriters, according to Darrel E. Whitten, an analyst for Bache Halsey Stuart Shields in Tokyo. Similarly, while Brother is now well positioned in the computerprinter business, the market is becoming increasingly crowded and subject to sudden shifts with rapid changes in technology.

1074-> United Brands Sets Sizable Write-Off
The United Brands Company said yesterday that it would take a $100 million charge against fiscal third-quarter earnings from the restructuring of its United Fruit Company division. United Fruit is the world's largest importer of bananas, which are sold under the Chiquita label. The company, based in New York, said it was restructuring to ''better match the company's supplies with demand for its product in selected markets.'' The United Fruit unit will scale back banana production in certain locations, reduce long-term contractual commitments to purchase bananas and realign transportation and distribution accordingly, the company said. The Value Line Investment survey notes that United Fruit has been hit hard by the weakness in banana prices brought on by oversupplies. The survey says, ''Cutting back on its own distribution eventually will help restore prices, but withdrawing from contracts with growers could prove costly.'' Because of the special restructuring charge, United Brands said it expected to report a substantial loss for the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 1983. It will announce final results for the period at the end of June. United Brands reported sales of $812.5 million in the fiscal second quarter, down 17.5 percent from $985.2 million a year earlier. Its stock closed at 12 7/8 yesterday, down 5/8, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company also said the restructuring would prevent declaration of the regular quarterly dividends normally payable on June 1 and June 30 for three issues of preference and preferred stock.

1076-> SCOUTING; Man at Work
Marvelous Marvin Hagler usually ''goes to prison'' (what he calls his training camp at the tip of Cape Cod) five or six weeks before a fight. But he left yesterday to prepare there for his middleweight title defense against Wilford Scypion, which takes place in three and one-half weeks. While Hagler may hardly need to work up a sweat to defeat Scypion May 13 in Providence, R.I., it is not in the champion's character to take an opponent lightly. ''Don't worry about it,'' said Goody Petronelli, Hagler's trainer, from his home in Brockton, Mass. ''Marvin is already in great shape. He's been working out for a month now in my gym here, and frankly I get more out of him here than at Provincetown. It was his decision to stay at home in Brockton.'' One interested observer, Jimmy Jacobs, believed it did not matter how seriously Hagler trained. Jacobs, who manages Wilfred Benitez, a probable future Hagler opponent, will not even bother to attend the Scypion fight. ''I've seen fights like this before,'' he said. ''I've seen Muhammad Ali fight Alfredo Evangelista and I've seen Ali fight Jean-Pierre Coopman. You can't criticize the ethics of the match. Scypion is a legitimate contender who has earned a title shot. But he is a legitimate contender with absolutely no chance of winning. Hagler is that much better.''

1082-> BULGARIAN SEIZED IN NEW YORK AND CHARGED AS SPY
A man described by Federal officials as a Bulgarian intelligence agent was arrested on an espionage charge last night as he left a restaurant in Manhattan. He was said to have been carrying highly classified nuclear secrets received from an American who was cooperating with the authorities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said the suspect, Penyu B. Kostadinov, 41 years old, an assistant counselor for the Bulgarian Commercial Office at 121 East 62d Street, was taken into custody at 7:15 P.M. as he left the Gulf & Western Building on Columbus Circle. Mr. Kostadinov, who lives at 315 East 86th Street and has worked in New York as a Bulgarian trade representative since 1979, was said to have obtained the secret documents from the American at a dinner meeting at the Top of the Park, a restaurant atop the tower on the southwest corner of Central Park. The agents who seized Mr. Kostadinov as he emerged from the building also recovered the classified documents, the F.B.I. said. The authorities declined to identify the American, other than to say he was a graduate student working in private industry. They said the suspect had established a close relationship with him over the last year and was apparently unaware that he had been working with the F.B.I. throughout that period. Both men have been under surveillance for months, the authorities said. The meeting to exchange the nuclear secrets, however, was arranged only a few days ago, an official said. In a statement issued only an hour after the arrest, William H. Webster, the Director of the F.B.I., said ''highly classified United States Government nuclear material'' had been seized in Mr. Kostadinov's possession. The F.B.I. Director's statement gave no details about the classified documents, saying only that they related to nuclear energy. Federal agents in New York and Washington declined to discuss the nature of the secrets or the role played by the American, who was said to have got in touch with the authorities a year ago when he was first approached by the Bulgarian. Documents Were 'Screened' Joseph Valiquette, an F.B.I. spokesman, said the documents had been ''screened by appropriate Government officials'' before they were turned over to the Bulgarian. The screening of the materials was apparently done to prevent a serious breach of security in case the arrest went awry, and to prevent the disclosure of critical information in court when the case against Mr. Kostadinov is prosecuted. The suspect, who lives here with his Bulgarian wife and two sons, has been working as one of several assistant commercial counselors for the Bulgarian trade office in New York, the F.B.I. said. Last night, United Press International quoted another assistant commercial counselor at the office, Batcho Genov, as saying he had ''no idea'' about Mr. Kostadinov's purported role as an undercover agent. Promotion of Trade Mr. Kostadinov's official duties were said to involve the promotion of trade and arrangements for the placement of Bulgarian exchange scientists and researchers in assignments with universities and other institutions in the United States. But Federal officials said his job as a trade official was only a cover. They said Mr. Kostadinov was actually an agent of the Durzhavna Sigurnost, or D.S., the Bulgarian state security service, which collects foreign intelligence data. ''He's a full-fledged intelligence officer,'' Mr. Valiquette said. He added that the suspect's rank in the Bulgarian intelligence apparatus was believed to be high. Officials said the D.S. is the Bulgarian equivalent of the Soviet K.G.B. and is overseen by Moscow's intelligence apparatus. Last spring, when the United States expelled three Soviet officials for what it described as espionage, Mr. Webster, the F.B.I. Director, charged that one of every three Soviet and Eastern bloc diplomats in the United States was a spy. No Diplomatic Immunity According to the F.B.I., Mr. Kostadinov, as a trade official, does not possess diplomatic immunity. Instead, officials said, he has had what is known as functional immunity, which protects him in this country from prosecution for actions taken in his official capacity as a trade representative. But such immunity does not protect him from criminal charges, the F.B.I. said. Mr. Kostadinov was accordingly charged under the Federal Criminal Code with espionage, which is punishable upon conviction by life imprisonment. The suspect was held overnight at the Federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, pending arraignment today in Federal Court in Manhattan.

1085-> VISIT TO A VASSAR MANSION
Fifteen Hudson Valley designers have transformed a 20-room Tudor- style mansion into a showplace that will be open to the public for inspection starting tomorrow in Poughkeepsie. The mansion, built in 1929, stands in a 27-acre garden that was designed by Andrew Jackson Downing, America's first landscape architect, in 1850 for Matthew Vassar, the brewer who contributed the money to found the college bearing his name in Poughkeepsie. Although the garden, called Springside, is a national historic landmark, it is now overgrown and weedy. But the sponsors of the design show, which runs through Oct. 16, have cut paths through the brambles so that visitors can see some of Downing's original ovals and plantings. Downing, who lived in Newburgh, just across the Hudson River, laid out the roads, paths, gates, cottages and other features of what Matthew Vassar hoped would become a rural cemetery for Poughkeepsie. But another site was chosen for the cemetery, and Vassar decided to use the property as a summer home, about a mile from his residence in another part of Poughkeepsie. Death in Hudson Accident When Downing's design was completed, he left Poughkeepsie for Washington, where he and his young associate Calvert Vaux were commissioned to work on designs for the landscaping of the Capitol, the White House and the Smithsonian Institution. Downing died in a steamship accident on the Hudson in 1852. In 1950, the garden was determined to be the last remaining Downing landscape, and in 1969 it became a national landmark for its ''exceptional significance in the nation's history.'' The house and garden are owned by Robert S. Ackerman, a real-estate developer in Poughkeepsie, who plans to move in after the show is over. For the show, the 15 designers have decorated rooms in styles ranging from provincial to Victorian. Tours, which are being run as a benefit for the Hudson Valley Philharmonic Orchestra, will be given Thursdays and Fridays from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., and Mondays and Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tickets are $6; $5 a person for groups with reservations, which are required, made by calling (914) 454-1222, and $4 for students and the elderly. The best way there is by the Taconic State Parkway north to Route 55, turning west on Route 55 into Poughkeepsie and then left on Academy Street, to the house, which is at 171 Academy Street.

1087-> CUOMO ORDERS AIDS STEEL MAD IN U.S.
Governor Cuomo issued an executive order yesterday designed to make all state agencies buy American-made steel for construction projects. The Governor, whose order sets a cost standard for steel, said he was complying with a ''Buy American'' measure passed by the State Legislature earlier this year. He acted shortly after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rebuffed his attempt to impose a more flexible cost standard than the one it adopted yesterday for the purchase of American steel for transit projects. Mr. Cuomo denounced the authority as a ''fiefdom'' and reiterated his call for its abolition. At an early morning meeting, the 14-member M.T.A. board adopted a standard for the use of American steel that was far more stringent than that sought originally by Mr. Cuomo. Board members said later that their standard would be less harmful to subway, bus and commuter fares than the Governor's proposal. ''When in doubt,'' said Richard Ravitch, the chairman of the agency, ''the fiduciary responsibility falls to the farepayer. Therefore I don't think the expenditure of additional money, though valuable in the sense that it created jobs, takes precedence over the obligation to the farepayer.'' Under Mr. Cuomo's pressure, though, the board reversed a decision it had made earlier this summer and voted to use domestic steel for repairing the Throgs Neck Bridge. The cost standard called for in Mr. Cuomo's executive order is identical to that used by the Federal Government for its construction projects. That standard requires state agencies to purchase American-made steel if its cost is no more than 6 percent greater than that of foreign steel. State Comptroller Edward V. Regan immediately questioned the Governor's move. He warned that the cost of construction projects throughout the state would rise and that fewer highways and bridges could be repaired with the proceeds from a $1.25 billion bond issue to be presented to the voters in November. Elizabeth B. Weiss, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said it was impossible to ascertain how many tons of steel the state used annually in construction projects or how much steel would be used as a result of the bond issue. Each year, the M.T.A. signs $200 million in contracts that use steel and steel parts. The state produces about 1.9 percent of the steel made in the United States. Angered by the M.T.A. board's decision in July to allow the Karl Koch Erecting Corporation to use Korean steel to rehabilitate the Throgs Neck Bridge, Governor Cuomo called on the M.T.A. at that time to change the contract and use American steel. Mr. Ravitch resisted, contending that it would cost the agency an additional $3.7 million. Mr. Cuomo then stepped up his criticism on the agency for its decision and demanded further that it set a standard for the use of American steel, arguing that jobs would be created and that the country's steel industry was in jeopardy. Under the standard first proposed by the Governor's office, the M.T.A. would have been required to reject foreign steel in favor of American even if the cost of the project increased by up to 25 percent. But Mr. Ravitch said the cost of the Governor's proposal would be too onerous for subway, bus and commuter railroad riders. Construction Workers Picket Then yesterday, with 200 ironworkers in hard hats picketing outside the M.T.A.'s Madison Avenue headquarters, the board gathered to vote on Mr. Cuomo's demands. The board first voted eight to six to accede to Mr. Cuomo, reverse the July decision and order that the steel used in the $32.9 million reconstruction of the Throgs Neck Bridge be purchased domestically. A report by the M.T.A. staff estimated the additional cost of the steel at $2.74 million, lower than its $3.7 million original estimate. The Governor's office estimated that the board's reversal would create 175 new jobs and provide work to two steel fabricating plants in the state. Moments later, the board voted by 13 to 1 to require the M.T.A. to purchase domestic steel if its cost did not exceed that of foreign steel by more than 6 percent. Four hours later, Mr. Cuomo announced that he would apply the same standard approved by the M.T.A. to all state agencies. Michael J. Del Giudice, the Governor's secretary, said the lower standard voted by the M.T.A., though far less than what Mr. Cuomo had sought, was acceptable because the board had voted to use domestic steel for the Throgs Neck project. While indicating that he was displeased with the Throgs Neck vote, Mr. Ravitch said the board had acted properly in adopting a very narrow overall standard. 'The Critical Issue' ''With respect to Throgs Neck, there is a premium being paid to give New York jobs,'' said Mr. Ravitch. ''The critical issue is the adoption of the 6 percent standard. ''To apply a higher standard than 6 percent would not only result in a greater expenditure of money and therefore in a reduction in the improvements that could be made in the transit system, but it would also probably result in discouraging some people from bidding and domestic manufacturers would increase their prices to meet that gap created by the standard.'' ''This is a regressive way of paying for it,'' continued Mr. Ravitch. ''Only the farepayers are paying for it. If a premium ought to be paid for jobs in the State of New York, that premium ought to be paid by all the taxpayers of the state.'' Cuomo Denounces Suggestion Governor Cuomo lashed out at that suggestion. ''I disagree utterly with their policy,'' said Mr. Cuomo. ''They regard the M.T.A. as a fiefdom which is separate and apart from the good of the rest of the state. If that were true, then the M.T.A. should not be getting money from the rest of the state, nor should they be sharing in the bond issue, nor should it be getting money from Washington.'' ''The fact that is uses its status as an authority to make itself inconsistently parochial for the purpose of giving but not parochial for the purpose of getting, that's one main reason I have argued repeatedly you should get rid of the M.T.A.,'' Mr. Cuomo said.

1089-> TV FILM HELPS REUNITE FAMILIES
A 3-year-old boy has been reunited with his mother after an 11- month separation, bringing to at least two the number of missing children returning home because of a television movie about child abduction this week. Phyllis Clark and her son, Justin, returned home today, a day after their reunion in Georgia, where the authorities had found the missing boy with his father. ''I left at 9:30 yesterday morning and I just got home this morning,'' she said today. ''We drove straight down there and picked up Justin and drove straight back. No stops for anything to eat because we were afraid it just wasn't true.'' Father Picked Him Up Justin was last seen at his home in Bardstown, Ky., on Nov. 11, 1982, when his father, Owen Douglas Clark, picked him up for a court-authorized visit, arranged under a custody ruling in a then- pending divorce case. It was not until Monday night, after the broadcast of the NBC television movie ''Adam,'' that there was a clue to their whereabouts. Justin's photo was one of those of 55 missing children shown after the movie about Adam Walsh, who was abducted and slain two years ago. The first missing child found in connection with the broadcast was Lynn Stockie, 15, who was abducted two years ago. Lynn saw her own photograph in an article in TV Guide about the movie. She called her grandparents, who called Child Find Inc., a nationwide organization. By Tuesday afternoon she was in the grandparents' Arkansas home. Boy Traced by Phone Tips In the Clark case, Rose Spalding of the Nelson County Circuit Clerk's office in Kentucky said she received a call Tuesday from an employee of the Missing Children's Help Center in Tampa, Fla. A woman wanted to know if there were any warrants out against Owen Douglas Clark, Rose Spalding said. The telephone caller said a person in Georgia had called her and said she had recognized the boy and had seen him in Georgia. The authorities traced the report to Cleveland, Ga., where they found Mr. Clark and his son. Mr. Clark was arrested on a Kentucky warrant charging him with custodial interference, a misdemeanor, according to Shallen McCoy, the Nelson County Attorney. Mrs. Clark's attorney said his client was granted permanent custody of her son in May 1983. In New Paltz, N.Y., Child Find has taken approximately 3,000 phone calls since the movie ended at 11 P.M. Monday, an agency spokesman, Alice Burn, said Wednesday. Adam Walsh, 6, disappeared on July 27, 1981, from a store in Hollywood, Fla. His severed head was found two weeks later, but the rest of his body was never found. Boy's Body Found in Closet BOSTON, Oct. 13 (AP) - A 5-year-old boy who disappeared while playing near his house two days ago was found dead today in the closet of a nearby home. The police said a 14-year-old boy was charged in the killing. The body of Francis Claudio Jr. was found after the police received an anonymous telephone call telling them where to look, the authorities said. The suspect, who was not identified because of his age, was charged with being ''a delinquent child,

1090-> CONSUMER PRICES UP BY 0.4%
Despite sharp increases for automobiles and gasoline, consumer prices rose only four-tenths of 1 percent in August, the Government reported today. Food prices rose for the first time since May although only slightly, beginning to reflect the effects of the summer drought. Last month's rise in the Consumer Price Index, reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, puts the rate so far this year at 3.4 percent, and for the last 12 months at only 2.9 percent. ''Inflation remains under control,'' Larry Speakes, Presidential spokesman, said. The August increase follows an equal rise in July, suggesting that the economy's spreading recovery is putting some pressure on prices and pushing the inflation rate toward the 5 to 6 percent level that many economists are predicting for 1984. ''It's not alarming,'' Albert T. Sommers, an economist at the Conference Board, said of the report. ''It's not going to get alarming. But it's going to go up.'' ''I understand a few people are saying inflation's going to come back with virulence,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''But I don't see that. I think we'll see 5 percent or less than that.'' On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that a broader measure of inflation, based on consumer prices and other prices, was running at a 3.2 percent rate in the July-September quarter, essentially unchanged from a 3.3 percent rate in the spring. The figure is derived from the department's projections for growth of the overall economy and thus leaves open the question of whether inflation is accelerating. The one surprise in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report today was a full percentage point increase in the broad category of transportation costs. Prices of new cars, seasonally adjusted, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, prices of used cars jumped 1.8 percent and gasoline prices rose 1.1 percent. Financing Costs Cited The bureau said each of the increases appeared to reflect aberrational behavior that it did not expect to persist. John F. Early, head of the Consumer Price Index office at the bureau, attributed much of the rise in new car prices to consumer financing costs, noting that the automobile companies and dealers had ended the discounts they had been offering during much of the year to stimulate sales. The big jump in used-car prices, Mr. Early said, appeared to result not only from higher financing costs but also from renewed demand for the big, inefficient fuel-burners that Detroit has largely abandoned. The gasoline price increases, said Patrick C. Jackman of the bureau, were ''hard to fathom.'' But part of the explanation lies in the seasonal adjustment. At the pump, prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in August, he said, but they usually decline then, and since they did not, the bureau's adjustment formulas produced a sizable increase. The performance of food prices last month was too erratic to signal much of a trend. Over all, they increased two-tenths of 1 percent. Fresh vegetable prices soared, jumping 5.8 percent. Prices of poultry rose to a point that now puts them above the levels of a year ago, while beef and pork prices fell and thus remain well below last year's prices. Averaged out, the cost of eating at home remained unchanged from July, while eating out cost six-tenths of 1 percent more than in July. Higher Meat Prices Expected ''It takes a while for the effects of the drought to work through to the retail level,'' said James R. Solloway, economist and commodities expert at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. ''We should see it in a few months,'' in higher meat prices, he said. During 1984, Mr. Solloway predicted, food prices will rise 7 percent after climbing only 2 to 3 percent during the last two years.'' The drought, Mr. Early said, caused beef and pork prices to fall because farmers slaughtered their livestock rather than pay feed prices that had been forced up by drought-induced shortages. Shortages of beef and pork will eventually follow, however, he said. In other major consumer-spending categories, housing costs rose two- tenths of 1 percent; medical care five-tenths of 1 percent, and entertainment three-tenths of 1 percent. Apparel, led by a 1.4 percent rise in shoe prices, increased four-tenths of 1 percent. Energy prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent. The Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, or the CPI-U, as the principal guage of inflation is known, stood at 300.3 in August, which means that it now costs three times as much to buy a typical assortment of consumer goods as it did in the year on which the index is based, 1967. Unrounded, its increase in the index for August was 0.004352193. Another gauge, the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or the CPI-W, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in August, to 299.5.

Only half of Ireland's electorate voted today on an amendment enshrining an abortion ban in the Irish Constitution. Opposition leaders reported widespread voting irregularities. Abortion, along with divorce and birth control devices, already is illegal in Ireland, where 94 percent of the population is Roman Catholic. But anti- abortionists want to write an abortion ban into the Constitution to prevent future challenges by liberals or the European Court of Justice. The issue split the country as seldom before. Yet the turnout in the referendum was low, with only an estimated 50 percent of the 2.4 million eligible voters casting ballots. Vote counting begins Thursday.

1094-> Real Estate; Two L.I.
WOODBURY, L.I. THE similarities between the Woodbury Common shopping center in this northern Long Island community and the Southgate Shopping Center in Massapequa Park, 10 miles to the south on the Atlantic Ocean, are apparent at first glance. Both are of intermediate size, both are distinguished by clock towers of 58 and 38 feet and both have a Tudor-style architecture that brings to mind a European village square. Not surprisingly, both were developed and are owned by the same firm, Kabro Associates of Massapequa Park. Kabro is the corporate name of the Melvin Kaplan family. Mr. Kaplan; his brother, Lawrence; his two sons, Neal and Lee, and his nephew, Steven, are the owners. However, the the backgrounds of the two shopping centers could not be more different. The Kaplans built Woodbury Common, encompassing 17 shops on a 1.7-acre site at the juncture of Woodbury Road and the Jericho Turnpike, in 1974. Its success led them in 1980 to buy an adjacent five-and-ahalf-acre tract and expand the complex to its present 37 stores. By contrast, their success at Southgate, a complex they purchased in 1978 as a joint venture with the Roosevelt Savings Bank, was achieved by shrinking what had been a 30-acre shopping center to 10 acres. But the Kaplans' development of both indicates that in this era of huge regional shopping malls, there is a place for the intermediate shopping center that appeals to a particular market. Rents at Woodbury Common range from $20 to $22 a square foot; those at Southgate are $12 to $14 a square foot. Mr. Kaplan characterized Woodbury Common and Southgate as ''boutique'' shopping centers. That is, they make no attempt to compete with the giant shopping malls in the number and volume of goods or in drawing shoppers from a vast area. Instead, they aim for those shoppers, primarily from the immediate area, who are looking for particular items and are attracted by a more relaxed, quieter shopping ambiance. ''We don't have, nor do we want, national tenants,'' Mr. Kaplan, a 30-year-old lawyer, said. ''We want to be different from the malls by offering more specialized services, uniformly better-quality items, and more sensitive marketing and display.'' Thus, among the stores at the 56,000-square-foot Woodbury Common, are 12 women's clothing or shoe stores, two men's stores, a store offering educational toys for children, a gourmet grocery, five restaurants, four gift and jewelry stores, and a stained-glass workshop. There are also a pharmacy, dry cleaner, hair salon and travel agency. ''The tenant mix is very important,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''We went to great lengths to get stores that complemented each other. That way the stores aren't directly competing against each other.'' The Southgate center, at 101 Grand Avenue in Massapequa Park, differs in that there are fewer stores (19) on a bigger plot of land. The complex, in which the Kabro offices are situated, also has a major anchor, a Foodtown supermarket. But Mr. Kaplan said the principle at both centers was the same: tailoring the shopping center to the needs of the immediate area. At Southgate, that took some foresight, for, as the Bar Harbor shopping center, it had enjoyed great success when it opened in the 1950's. But the 300,000-square-foot complex was overtaken by the development of the giant regional malls. By the mid-1970's, it ''was a virtual ghost town,'' Mr. Kaplan said. The Kaplans literally rebuilt it, scaling the shopping center back to 100,000 square feet on 10 acres - and building 182 residential condominiums on a part of the site set apart by a fence and thick decorative shrubbery.

1096-> CARLTON ATTAINS 300TH VICTORY
Steve Carlton tonight became the 16th pitcher in baseball history to win 300 games when he pitched the Philadelphia Phillies to a 6-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and ran their winning streak to eight games. The 38-year-old left-hander worked eight innings, allowed seven hits, struck out 12 batters and won his 15th game of the season, his 19th in the major leagues. He thereby joined a tight circle of pitchers who had won at least 300 times, starting with Cy Young at the turn of the century and extending to Early Wynn 20 years ago and Gaylord Perry in 1982. The Phillies made life easy for Carlton with a 17-hit offense against three pitchers, starting with Joaquin Andujar. At the end of the evening, with eight games left in the race in the National League's East, they led the Pittsburgh Pirates by three and the Montreal Expos by five. They also eliminated the Cardinals, who won the World Series last year. But the champagne in the Phillies' clubhouse tonight was poured for Carlton. Next Goal Is 400 He already has won the Cy Young Award four times as the best pitcher in the league. He already ranks as the No. 1 strikeout pitcher, with a total of 3,702. He has a record of 300 victories and 199 losses, with no intention of stopping there. ''He thinks he can win 400,'' said Bill Giles, the president of the Phillies. ''Winning 300 is just a statistical symbol of his place in baseball history,'' said Paul Owens, the manager of the Phillies. ''He'll go down as one of the great pitchers in history.'' ''At his age, he's still a power pitcher, and that's amazing,'' said Whitey Herzog, manager of the Cardinals. ''He's an automatic Hall of Famer. He's the world's strikeout leader. He's never had a sore arm. He's an artist. The same guys who have been swinging at that low slider for 15 years are still swinging at it.'' Maintains His Silence Carlton took a brief curtain call on the field after the game. Otherwise, he maintained his four-year-old policy of not answering baseball questions. The Phillies even kept their locker room closed for 25 minutes so that they could congratulate their star in private. But Carlton spoke eloquently with his powerful performance on a chilly evening in Busch Stadium before 27,266 fans. He also won another measure of satisfaction from the team that traded him in 1972 when he was holding out for $60,000. By beating the Cardinals last Sunday and again tonight, he now has taken them 37 times with only 12 defeats. He even knocked in the first run of the game in the second inning, which opened with a double by Gary Matthews. Two outs later, Ivan DeJesus outran an infield single and Carlton singled to right field for a 1-0 lead. In the third, the Phillies made it 2-0 on singles by Len Matuszek, Joe Lefebvre and Greg Gross. By then, they had seven hits off Andujar, who was well along toward his 16th loss. Homer Ends Shutout Chance But in the fourth inning, Carlton lost the chance for the 56th shutout of his career. George Hendrick led with a single and David Green whacked the 1-and-0 pitch high off the balcony in left field for a tie. After that, the Cardinals got no more runs off the 6-foot-6-inch left-hander. In the fifth inning, they quickly lost their tie, their pitcher and their manager. Mike Schmidt and Lefebvre started it with singles with one down. Then they pulled a double steal. Then Matthews singled to left field for a 3-2 lead, and Herzog hurried to the mound to consult his agitated pitcher. As Herzog left the field, he got into a brief argument with the home plate umpire, Jim Quick, who promptly ejected him from the game. After all that, Andujar walked Gross, and then Bo Diaz lined a two- run single to center for a 5-2 lead. Finally, Andujar was led away by Hub Kittle, the Cardinals' pitching coach.

1098-> THE CITY; 43 Are Treated In Brooklyn Fires
Forty-three firefighters and members of a civilian fire patrol were treated for exposure to potentially hazardous fumes in two unrelated Brooklyn blazes, but tests found the fumes were not toxic, authorities said yesterday. The first blaze occurred at about 8:15 P.M. Wednesday at a warehouse in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Thirty-eight firefighters and members of the civilian patrol were treated for exposure, said John Mullligan, an assistant fire commissioner. None required hospitalization. The fumes, at first believed to be from magnesium, were identified as from calcium carbonide, used in welding. The second fire occurred an hour later, when a transformer explosion blew off a manhole cover outside the former Cumberland Hospital, on Auburn Place in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. Mr. Mulligan said officials had initially feared that the transformer contained polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's. Five firefighters were treated for burns and possible exposure to PCB's and released. No PCB's were found.

1099-> BankAmerica's South Dakota Filing
The BankAmerica Corporation said today that it had filed an application to open a state-chartered bank in South Dakota. Industry analysts said that, because of a new South Dakota law, the step would put BankAmerica in a position to sell insurance if existing Federal regulatory barriers are overcome. A hearing in South Dakota has been set for Sept. 26. ''The regulations governing insurance issuers in South Dakota are among the incentives for our taking this action,'' said Bob Fienberg, vice president for corporate public relations at BankAmerica in San Francisco. ''But insurance is only one of the possibilities we're looking at.'' BankAmerica, the nation's second- largest bank holding company after Citicorp, with $121 billion in assets at the end of June, follows Citicorp, the Security Pacific National Bank and the First Interstate Bancorp in filing its applications to acquire or open a bank in South Dakota. As large financial institutions, such as Merrill Lynch Inc., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company, have extended into the financial marketplace with brokerage, insurance, mortgage and credit services, many large banks have attempted to fight the stiff laws that restrict their operations outside of banking. Earlier this year, South Dakota passed a law that would allow state-chartered banks to sell insurance in any state after acquiring the necessary licenses. ''Insurance is a natural financial service for banks to offer,'' said George Salem, senior banking analyst with A. G. Becker Paribas Inc., in New York. But last spring, Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, indicated his opposition to the application by Citicorp to buy the American State Bank, in Rapid City, S.D. In a letter to Senator James Abdnor, Republican of South Dakota, he warned that South Dakota's liberal banking laws were undermining national financial policy. The Federal Reserve Board has not ruled on the Citicorp bid.

1100-> AROUND THE NATION; Survey Stakes Burned To Protest Navy Project
Protestors said Tuesday that they had torn up and burned hundreds of surveyors' stakes along a 20-mile route in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where the Navy plans to build a submarine communications system. About 30 protestors from Wisconsin and Michigan participated in ''raiding parties'' in the last three weeks, said Tom Hastings, a spokesman for Citizens Against Trident-ELF. ELF is the acronym for the extremely-low-frequency communications system. The protesters object to the building of the 56-mile-long Michigan antenna because it is scheduled to become part of a communications system that can send messages to submerged Trident submarines carrying nuclear missiles. A spokesman for Gilbert-Commonwealth Inc., the Jackson, Mich., company conducting a preliminary survey of the area, said that some markers had been removed but that the vandalism would not halt the project.

1101-> TEXT OF CONGRESS'S RESOLUTION ON KOREAN JET
Following is the text of Congress's joint resolution on the Soviet Union's downing of the South Korean airliner. The House approved the resolution today by a vote of 416 to 0, and the Senate was expected to vote on it Thursday. WHEREAS the United States joins with the world community in expressing its outrage over the actions of the Soviet Government on Aug. 31, 1983, which caused the destruction of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 with the loss of 269 innocent lives; WHEREAS on Aug. 31, 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 inadvertently entered Soviet airspace; WHEREAS Soviet authorities tracked Korean Air Lines Flight 007 for more than two hours but did not adhere to all the internationally recognized procedures necessary to warn the aircraft that it was off course and to protect its passengers; WHEREAS a Soviet Air Force fighter fired air-to-air missiles at Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and destroyed the unarmed, clearly marked civilian airliner with 269 innocent men, women and children from 14 nations aboard, including 61 of our fellow citizens; WHEREAS among the victims was a distinguished Member of Congress, the Honorable Larry P. McDonald; WHEREAS the highest levels of the Soviet Government have lied in an attempt to justify this unconscionable act and have continued to deny access to the area where the airplane went down; WHEREAS the Soviet Government has publicly proclaimed its intention to repeat its murderous act if another airliner wanders inadvertently into Soviet airspace; and WHEREAS this cold-blooded barbarous attack on a commercial airliner straying off course is one of the most infamous and reprehensible acts in history: Now, therefore, be it RESOLVED by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the United States hereby 1. Condemns the Soviet crime of destroying Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and murdering the 269 innocent people onboard; 2. Calls for a full and frank explanation from the Soviet Union for this brutal massacre; 3. Extends its deepest sympathies to the families who lost loved ones and supports their rights to obtain reparations from the Soviet Union; 4. Calls on the Soviet Union to assist international efforts to recover the remains of the victims; 5. Calls for an international investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization into this heinous incident; 6. Declares its intention to work with the international community in demanding that the Soviet Union modify its air defense procedures and practices to assure the safe passage of commercial airliners; 7. Finds that this tragic incident, and the Soviet Government's refusal to acknowledge responsibility for its wanton conduct, will make it more difficult for the United States and other nations to accept the Soviet Union as a responsible member of the international community; and 8. Urges our allies and other nations to cooperate with the United States in continuing to demand that the Soviet Government unequivocally apologize for its actions, fully compensate the families of the innocent victims and agree to abide by internationally recognized and established procedures which are purposefully designed to prevent the occurrence of such tragedies.

1102-> THE PRIDE OF PEOPLE'S POLAND: ITS PRINCELY STEEDS
In People's Poland, Arabian horses are still aristocrats. Once the pride of Poland's plethora of princes, counts, dukes and myriad lesser nobility, the Arabian bloodlines are now the basis for one of the few successful socialist enterprises in the bleak economy. Early each fall the handsome - and very expensive - steeds are on display at the annual show and auction of the state stud farm here, before an appreciative audience of horse lovers and buyers, most of them American. ''This is the best place in the world to buy Arabian horses,'' said Mike Nichols, the director, who raises horses in Connecticut and California and is an honored regular at the show here. ''Except for your farm, of course,'' suggested Leonard T. Keggs, an Ohio breeder, who bought a 4-year-old stallion for $609,000, the highest bid at this year's auction. The Importance of Tradition ''Poles are great riders,'' Mr. Nichols continued. ''What's important in breeding is continuity and tradition.'' Indeed, the Arabian horses, tracing their roots back to the 16th century, are a reflection of one of Poland's most treasured romantic traditions, that of the mounted warriors who swept back and forth across the land. At the beginning of World War II, the Polish Army consisted largely of cavalry, the brave uhlans, who charged Nazi tanks with an unfortunate lack of effect. Like the national symbol, the Polish eagle, which is always portrayed wearing a royal crown, except, of course, when it is displayed by the Communist Government, the horses represent a stubborn survival of remnants of the old ways. Nowhere else, for example, is the courtly tradition of kissing a woman's hand so universally and enthusiastically practiced. Shoes are in desperately short supply here, but private craftsmen still custom-make elegant high leather riding boots. All of the Polish Arabians, the oldest bloodline in Europe, are said to spring from the three studs owned by great families: Slawuta of Prince Sanguszko, Bialocerkiew of Count Branicki and Jarczowce of Count Dzieduszycki. The Radziwill family had enormous stables and the Duke of Zaslawski counted 408 pure Arabian horses among his possessions. Chaos Was the Norm In truth, the Polish aristocracy was a singular historical development; its antics between the 16th century and the end of the 18th century earned the sobriquet ''The Republic of Anarchy.'' Virtually everyone with a few acres and a sword counted himself a noblemen. Of course, some, the great families, were more noble than the others. The King was elected, and the liberum veto, under which any single delegate to the parliament could block all action by objecting, was insisted upon. Chaos became the political norm. Even Poland's most famous King, John III, who stopped the advance of the Ottoman Empire by defeating the Turks at the siege of Vienna, could not control his fractious subjects, and by the time he died, overweight and morose, the country was disintegrating. In the captured tent of the Grand Vizier outside Vienna's walls, he had reflected, as aides tried unsucesfully to grab a parrot the Turk had left behind in his hasty retreat, on the conduct of the German reinforcements sent to help him. ''They listened to me as our soldiers never do,'' the King wrote somewhat plaintively to his wife. Farms Still Need Horses Most polish horses, unlike those here, are sturdy peasants. More than any other country in Europe, Poland is still heavily dependent on horses for farming. Much of the land is held in long, narrow strips by peasant farmers, and it is worked in the old way, by hand and by horse. On a drive of more than three hours through the countryside as the harvest was beginning last June, there was not a single tractor in use; every field was being worked by men, women, children - and horses. ''I'm an old farm boy, and I'm really surprised at what I've seen,'' said an American buyer at the show. ''Driving up here, it was the way farming was done 50 years ago. No, 70 years ago.'' Throughout rural Poland, which is to say most of the country, horses pulling barge-shaped carts are still a primary means of transport. In the mountains of the Podhale in the south, they haul timber, on the flat plains near the Baltic in the north, beets, and in between everything from coal to families on their way to church. The main road between Warsaw and Cracow, the rough equivalent of the highway from New York to Washington, is richly marked with evidence of this form of transport. Signs Are in English All of the signs at the show were in English, and so was most of the conversation. A row of flags honored the nationalities of the buyers present, and the Stars and Stripes flew next to the Polish flag, for the American contingent of more than 50, Polish officials said, was the largest group here. There was a also a Russian flag; this village is only about six miles from the Soviet border. At the auction, some of the horses would bring $60,000 to $70,000, others hundreds of thousands. In the past, a few great horses - like Bandos and El Paso - have brought in the neighborhood of a million dollars. This is a particularly nice neighborhood for a country desperately short of foreign exchange. There were about 500 pure Arab mares for breeding in Poland at the beginning of the century, but by 1946 the succession of wars had brought the number to 52. Even those, the official history of the stud farm darkly hints, nearly became victims of Stalinism. ''In the postwar history of our breeding, there were also difficult periods,'' the history recalls. ''There was a time when the Arab stud was severely restricted and the plans to liquidate Arab breed horses were very close, as it had been recognized that this horse does not represent a significant utilitarian value. Fortunately, this did not come to pass. '' To the strains of the theme from 'High Noon'' and ''Ghost Riders in the Sky'' over the loudspeaker, Mr. Nichols, whose deadpan routines with Elaine May used to crack up young sophisticates, solemnly helped to judge the mares. He made notes on a pad as the descendants of horses that Polish noblemen in their fur hats and armor traveled to Aleppo and Damascus to buy from the Bedouins from across the sands, were put through their paces by the proud workers of the state stud farm. ''Arabians haven't had any decent horses for years,'' growled one of the American buyers. ''All gone. Just Cadillacs.''

1103-> THE REGION; Suspect Charged As Fake Doctor
A Long Island man who assisted in 70 operations at a Fort Dix Army hospital and reportedly anesthetized a patient who was left severely brain damaged was indicted today on charges he falsely said he was a licensed doctor. The man - Abraham V. K. Asante, 45 years old, of Roosevelt, who is free on $7,500 bail - was charged with two counts of making false statements to the Army on his application for employment as an anesthesiologist, two counts of illegally distributing narcotics and one count of aggravated assault. Mr. Asante had stated in his application that he had been licensed to practice medicine in Indiana and Connecticut, but he is not licensed in any state in the country, according to United States Attorney W. Hunt Dumont. Mr. Asante, a native of Ghana who became an American citizen in 1976, faces 50 years in prison and $160,000 in fines if convicted, Mr. Dumont said. He said Mr. Asante would be notified of his arraignment date.

1106-> GIANTS REPLACE BRUNNER WITH RUTLEDGE AS STARTER
The Giants, reeling from a 2-5 record, announced today that Jeff Rutledge would replace Scott Brunner as the starting quarterback. Rutledge will play Monday night against the Cardinals in St. Louis, and he said that Coach Bill Parcells had told him not to worry about being taken out of the game. This is the fifth National Football League season for Rutledge, who played at the University of Alabama from 1975 through 1978. He has started only once - in 1979 as a rookie for the Los Angeles Rams against the Chicago Bears. When Phil Simms suffered torn knee ligaments in the final 1982 preseason game and was lost for the season, the Giants obtained Rutledge from the Rams for a fourth-round draft choice. Brunner replaced Simms as the starter and Rutledge became the No. 1 backup. Though Rutledge has been here almost a season and a half, he has never played for the Giants in a regular-season game. Brunner played every offensive play in the strike- shortened 1982 season, and this season Brunner had been the quarterback except for relief stints by Simms against the Dallas Cowboys on Sept. 18 and Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 9. Simms was doing well against the Eagles until he suffered a compound dislocated fracture of the right thumb on his passing hand. He was believed to be lost for the season. However, his hand is out of the cast ahead of schedule, and there is a small chance he will return late in the season. Brunner has been plagued by 11 interceptions and 7 fumbles. In addition, the Giants have had difficulty scoring when they get close to the goal line. Parcells said he decided Wednesday night to make the change. ''I think it's time we tried different combinations,'' said Parcells. ''I'm not trying to make anyone the scapegoat. The quarterback has no control over tipped balls or getting hit while he throws. I also think there's been a great deal of pressure on Scott, basically from the media. I think a little relief from that could be good.'' The Giants call the area inside the opponents' 20-yard line the red zone. Ron Erhardt, the offensive coordinator, said a team should score every time it reached there, and he said 60 percent of those scores should be touchdowns. In the Giants' 25 penetrations of the red zone this season, they have scored only 19 times - 8 touchdowns and 11 field goals. They failed to score four times when Brunner fumbled away the ball, once when Rob Carpenter fumbled and once when Butch Woolfolk was assessed two 15-yard personal-foul penalties on the same play. When Parcells told Rutledge this morning that he would start, Rutledge said he was surprised. ''It's an opportunity for me,'' said Rutledge. ''It's something I've wanted for a long time. I know it's not a good time for Scott. I feel sorry for him. I don't think Scott played that bad. I said before that I don't think quarterbacking has been our problem. It's been very frustrating not playing, so this is exciting and somewhat nerve-racking.'' The normally effervescent Brunner seemed deflated. He talked quietly, as he did after Simms replaced him in the third quarter against the Eagles. ''Obviously, I'm not happy,'' said Brunner. ''But there's nothing I can do about it. Obviously, our main problem is the quarterback position.'' If Brunner were the coach, would he have made a change? ''I'm not the coach,'' he said. Rutledge, like Brunner and Simms, is 26 years old. He is more mobile than Brunner and better suited to rollout passing. Hector May Play Sunday HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Oct. 20 - The Jets' running game got a lift today when the condition of Johnny Hector, the all-purpose runner, was upgraded from questionable to probable for the game Sunday against Atlanta. Hector has missed the last two games with a knee injury.

1109-> REBELS DEMAND P.L.O. END COMPROMISE AND CORRUPTION
Col. Saed Musa, the leader of the rebellion against Yasir Arafat, said today that his men would not give up their revolt until Mr. Arafat agreed to root out corruption in the Palestine Liberation Organization, reject all compromise peace plans and consent to share power with the dissident officers. Colonel Musa, a 56-year-old onetime Jordanian Army officer who before his revolt was deputy chief of the P.L.O. Military Operations Room, met with a few reporters in a two-story house in Hammara, a village in the center of his tiny rebel domain along the Syrian border in the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley. The dissident Palestinian officer, who goes by the code name Abu Musa, made his points in Arabic articulately and with the confidence of a man who appeared comfortable in his role as a rebel leader. It was clear as Colonel Musa and the officers around him discussed the reasons for their insurrection that they had in effect mounted a ''coup d'etat'' against Mr. Arafat except that there was no state apparatus for them to seize. Instead, they have taken over a cluster of villages and P.L.O. positions in the last area in the Middle East where the Palestinian guerrillas can operate with a small measure of autonomy. Rebel Reports on Attack Dressed in new-looking green army fatigues, Colonel Musa said his men had to launch their latest attack early Tuesday on members of Al Fatah still loyal to Mr. Arafat because ''they were trying to cut our supply routes'' along the main highway from Damascus through the Syrian border post at Masnaa into the Bekaa. The colonel said 5 of his men were wounded in what he called this counterattack against Arafat loyalists, while 2 of Mr. Arafat's men were killed and 7 were wounded. After the battle, 25 Arafat men defected to the rebel ranks, he said, adding a comment about his sorrow for the loss of life in the clash. He denied, as Damascus did today, that Syrian tanks helped his men, but the small number of casualties in the fighting and the ease with which the rebels overran the pro-Arafat positions seemed to suggest that they had support from some of the hundreds of Syrian troops all around Colonel Musa's headquarters in Hammara. In addition, from all appearances, the rebels do not number more tha a few hundred men. Pro-Arafat officers near Shtaura said the Syrians were not allowing them to receive arms supplies from Damascus but were letting food and other things through. The Rebels' Conditions Asked what would persuade him to give up his rebellion, Colonel Musa listed four conditions. First, he said, Mr. Arafat would have to call a full congress of Al Fatah, the largest of the eight groups in the P.L.O. Mr. Arafat is both head of Al Fatah, which he founded, and chairman of the P.L.O. Colonel Musa and his rebels are also longstanding members of Al Fatah. ''Arafat should summon a general congress of Fatah,'' the dissident colonel said. ''We do not believe in armed confrontation. We believe in democratic dialogue. We do not insist on a change in leadership, but there must be a halt to the deviation from the path of revolution. This is an internal problem. Matters will not be solved by Arafat going to King Fahd or Ceausescu or others.'' Until Mr. Arafat agrees to call such a conference, the rebel commander said, his men will stay where they are but will fight only in self-defense. If a full congress is convened, Colonel Musa said, the rebels will insist on three basic changes. First, he said, is a clear rejection by Mr. Arafat and Al Fatah of President Reagan's Middle East peace plan, the Arab League peace plan adopted at Fez, Morocco, and all suggestions of confederation between Jordan and any proposed Palestinian state. Mr. Arafat has always tried not to limit the P.L.O.'s choices on these peace proposals. Charge of High Living In addition, Colonel Musa said, some Palestinian leaders have exploited the struggle for their own purposes, using the movement's money to buy expensive cars or villas, and these people must be purged. ''A revolution is made by the poor and common man, not by millionaires,'' he said. Colonel Musa began his revolt against Mr. Arafat on May 15, shortly after the P.L.O. chairman appointed two people with reputations for high living as commanders of the P.L.O. units in Lebanon. Finally, the colonel said, the rebels want an end to the ''singular'' rule of Mr. Arafat and a return to ''collective leadership.'' The rebels want an emergency committee to be formed to run Al Fatah for now, and they want 50 percent of the seats. Mr. Arafat, who spent the day traveling around the Bekaa, has gone a long way toward meeting many of the rebels' demands. Before Tuesday's attack, Mr. Arafat was in Damascus heading a meeting of Al Fatah's ruling revolutionary council. A statement issued after the meeting said the council had decided to establish a special court to examine charges of corruption and dereliction of duty during the Israeli invasion. The council also declared that the Fez peace plan, which Mr. Arafat had previously supported in full, should be bypassed ''in favor of a military option.'' Ahmed Abdel Rahman, Mr. Arafat's spokesman in Tripoli, north of Beirut, told reporters that the demand for collective leadership was rejected by Mr. Arafat. A Limit on Rebel Control Mr. Abdel Rahman conceded that roughly half of Al Fatah's men were now out of ''logistical contact'' with their main command centers. This does not mean they have all gone over to the rebels, but it does give an indication of how effective the dissident officers have been in disrupting Mr. Arafat's ranks and the flow of supplies and information to his men. A tour of the border area today found Colonel Musa and his small band of followers well entrenched in Hammara, Mejdel Anjar and Bar Elias, all small villages near Masnaa. They patrolled these areas with small trucks mounted with heavy machine guns and clearly had all the radio communications equipment necessary to stay in contact with one another. However, one of Colonel Musa's aides said they had not been allowed by the Syrians to put up any checkpoints on the main highway from Masnaa to Shtaura, most of which they captured Tuesday. That road remains in the overall control of Syrian troops, but Arafat loyalists retain their positions near Shtaura unhampered by the Syrians. The Arafat men appeared to be extremely edgy as they kept their eyes turned not south, where the Israelis are, but east, where Colonel Musa and his rebels are entrenched.

1110-> Bridge: The Complexities of Bidding Have Increased in 20 Years
The language of bidding has been enlarged considerably in the past two decades. In the old days there were many bids that did not and could not have a natural meaning and were therefore never made. Today serious players think up specialized meanings. A good example is a double of one no-trump by a player who has passed originally. The normal penalty meaning is ruled out, so many tournament players use this action to show length in the major suits. An example occurred on the diagramed deal, which helped Greg Woods and John Rengstorff of New York to win the men's pair title at a recent regional in Providence, R.I. News Is Not Good Woods doubled to show the major suits, giving his partner unwelcome news. He might well have passed the double for penalties, but he tried two clubs. Since South had already promised the majors he could suggest another possibility by bidding two diamonds, and that became the final contract. West's spade lead was allowed to win, and he shifted to a heart. East took the ace and shifted back to spades. South won with the ace and led his singleton club. West put up the ace and exited with a heart to the dummy's king. Two club winners were cashed, and a trump was led to queen. West took his ace and led his spade winner, leaving this position when dummy ruffed: NORTH S - H - D K 6 C 10 8 WEST S - H J D J 8 2 C - EAST S 2 H 4 D 9 C 2 SOUTH S J H Q D 10 7 C - South needed three more tricks, and at first sight he seems due to make just two. But when he led the club ten and ruffed with his trump seven the defense was helpless. West overruffed with the eight, and did the best he could by leading his heart. When Woods won with the queen and led the diamond ten, he had brought off a rare event: a trump pin at the 12th trick. It did not matter whether or not West covered with the jack.

1111-> WASHINGTON; REAGAN'S BAD LUCK
Sometimes Presidents, like all the rest of us, run into streaks of bad luck, and this clearly is one of those times for President Reagan. Just when he thought he could have a golfing holiday with Secretary of State Shultz in Georgia - a silly idea, since golf is not a holiday but an agony - he was startled in the night by the disaster of the Marines in Beirut. While the White House press spokesman was trying to suppress the President's score on the links, some poor soul crashed the gate at the golf course in the hope of telling Mr. Reagan his troubles. By Sunday the President was back in the Oval Office, not only dealing with the tragedy in Beirut but planning an invasion of the island of Grenada in the Caribbean. This is not a weekend the President is likely to forget. It may even be a weekend he is likely to remember when he thinks about running for another four years. ''I have to say,'' he told reporters when he came back, ''that I don't know of anything that is worse than the job I have, and having to make the calls I have to make'' to the families of the victims in Beirut. Then, on the same weekend, with hundreds of thousands of people in Britain and West Germany protesting against his emplacement of more nuclear weapons in Europe, he had to decide what to do about the crisis in Grenada. And he did decide, as in Lebanon, to send in the Marines. It was a hard call. He was treaty- bound by the United Nations Charter not to do so. Article II of the Rio Treaty, signed by the United States, stated that ''all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations.'' President Reagan checked with the British, who used to govern Grenada and still have a Governor General there. Prime Minister Thatcher advised against an American invasion of that island, but the President ordered the invasion anyway in the belief that American lives were at stake there, though there was little evidence that this was true. It's easy to say that legally the President was wrong, but probably unfair to say he wasn't right under the circumstances. Unfortunately, this is not a world of law. The President was condemned for not anticipating and protecting the Marines in Lebanon. He would have been condemned all the more if he had not acted to protect the lives of the Americans in Grenada, even if in that chaotic situation he was told by whatever fragile authorities existed there that there was no real danger. President Reagan has more than enough trouble these days without hitting him in the press when he is down. He has a crisis on his hands in Lebanon. His Navy is strolling around the Caribbean and in the Pacific, off the shores of Nicaragua, without much effect on the civil war there that he clearly doesn't understand. He could not possibly bear another defeat in Grenada, though most Americans don't know where it is and couldn't care less. He had to act quickly and get out, which is precisely what he intends to do. Consider the opposite: Suppose, after the disaster and humiliation in Beirut, the President had allowed a Communist coup in Grenada to succeed. Even if the Americans there were not in danger, he would have been mocked around the world, viciously in Moscow, and also in the Western Hemisphere for not defending vital U.S. interests. It's not easy to defend Mr. Reagan's conduct or misconduct of foreign affairs, but in this particular occasion he had a problem, and to be fair, it's hard to say he didn't make the right move - or to fault Mr. Shultz, who went to great lengths to explain in a trembling voice why he thought the invasion of Grenada was necessary. The Secretary of State is an honest and decent man. He didn't pretend that the invasion was an easy or even a legal exercise. He appeared before the reporters and gave a chronological account of the Grenada problem, answered their questions and defended his skipper. He only argued that under the circumstances the invasion was necessary, and promised that the U.S. troops would be withdrawn within a few days. Probably this won't satisfy Congress, or the press, or the allies. But you have to make allowance for the element of accident, like the bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut, or the sudden crisis in Grenada. How do you handle such things? The men of politics who come forward to decide are obviously in trouble. The President doesn't have the vaguest idea about how to get out of the mess in Lebanon, or out of his $200 billion deficit this year at home, and neither do the Democrats who are giving him a hard time both at home and abroad. But for the moment a little time and understanding and sympathy is needed on both sides.

1112-> AROUND THE WORLD; Ulster Terrorist Attacks Kill 3 and Wound 49
Terrorist violence killed three policemen and wounded 35 other officers and 14 civilians in a period of less than 24 hours ending early today, the police reported. The two Irish Republican Army bombings and a shooting were believed to be linked to the scheduled Monday meeting in London between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Ireland. A press officer at the Belfast police headquarters said one of the officers was shot early this morning northwest of Belfast, and died later in a hospital. On Friday an I.R.A. bomb demolished a Belfast college lecture hall, killing two police officers and wounding 33 others, and a car bomb exploded outside a pub in Strabane, County Tyrone, injuring two off-duty police officers and 14 customers.

1113-> IN THE NATION; TALE OF TWO TREATIES
When W. Averell Harriman arrived in Moscow in the summer of 1963, a reporter asked how long it would take the American envoy and his team to negotiate a ban on nuclear tests in the atmosphere. Thinking fast, Mr. Harriman decided to send a signal to the Kremlin. ''About two weeks,'' he said, ''if Premier Khrushchev wants a treaty as badly as President Kennedy does.'' Just 13 days later, Mr. Harriman recalled to an audience gathered this week to honor him and the 20th anniversary of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the work of the Soviet-American negotiators was done. That was possible, he said, only because both sides wanted a treaty. And he added that his only regret, two decades after that first arms control success, was that ''we didn't go after'' a comprehensive treaty that would have banned nuclear tests underground as well as in the atmosphere, the oceans and space. Had such a treaty been concluded then, Mr. Harriman observed, many nuclear weapons systems that now threaten the world never could have come into existence. Jerome Wiesner, who was President Kennedy's science adviser, also suggested that the moment might have been lost in 1963. Speaking earlier at the dinner sponsored by the Arms Control Association, he said Mr. Kennedy had been greatly encouraged by a tour of Western states 20 years ago this autumn, during which crowds had roared approval of the Limited Test Ban Treaty. Dr. Wiesner said Mr. Kennedy told him that if he'd realized how much public support there was for the treaty he might have been more willing to insist on a comprehensive test ban. The issue arose again during the Carter Administration when the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union virtually completed a Comprehensive Test Ban treaty (C.T.B.) in which, for the first time, Moscow agreed to on-site inspections as part of the necessary verification procedures. Paul Warnke, then the U.S. negotiator, told the audience that he now wondered whether the higher priority should have been given to the C.T.B. rather than to SALT II - which ultimately was not ratified. Dr. Wiesner and Mr. Warnke agreed that in the Kennedy Administration, as later under President Carter, opposition within the U.S. Government - in the Pentagon, in Congress, at the national nuclear laboratories - as well as in the ''military- industrial complex'' and the press had been a bigger obstacle than the Soviet Union to agreement on a comprehensive test ban. We don't have such a treaty, Mr. Warnke said, ''because we don't want it.'' Instead, internal pressures to continue testing - for new nuclear weapons systems and to improve old ones - have been too strong. Another former Carter Administration official suggested in a private conversation that, owing to internal U.S. Government opposition to a comprehensive treaty, the better course might have been to concentrate on a treaty banning all tests but those of relatively low yield. That way, he said, Moscow at least might have been ''locked in'' to the concessions - such as on-site inspections - it had been willing to make in the C.T.B. negotations. McGeorge Bundy, President Kennedy's national security adviser, recalled for the dinner audience the sequence of events leading to the 1963 Test Ban Treaty. In late 1961, the Russians conducted a series of atmospheric tests, breaking a moratorium that had been observed by both sides. The U.S. responded with a test series of its own; and in the summer of 1962, Moscow embarked on still another round of testing. But this time, Mr. Bundy said, President Kennedy took the initiative to break the cycle, deciding in effect: '' 'O.K. You have two series and I have one. And it doesn't matter.' '' Ultimately, in his American University speech of 1963, he pledged again that the U.S. would not test in the atmosphere if no one else did. Three weeks later Mr. Khrushchev replied favorably, Mr. Bundy recalled, and Mr. Harriman was sent to Moscow. The resulting treaty, Mr. Bundy said, ''was the most constructive event I was ever associated with.'' But he warned that it would be harder now to achieve a a comprehensive treaty, because ironically the public's fear of nuclear fallout from atmospheric tests - ''the most compelling single force'' behind the 1963 treaty - had been eliminated by that treaty. Moreover, Mr. Bundy pointed out, the ''range of armaments'' on both sides is far more complex now. For these reasons, and because of continuing opposition within the U.S. Government itself, Mr. Bundy said, a comprehensive test ban treaty or any other major arms control agreement could not be had without ''the authority of the President's voice'' forcefully taking the lead in seeking it. As for Mr. Harriman, he saw a clear lesson in the experience of 1963 and of a Soviet-American treaty successfully observed for 20 years. ''There's no reason,'' he said, ''to be afraid to make agreements to limit arms.''

1114-> PERSONAL HEALTH
RACHELLE KESS was 21 years old when she first noticed that her eyelids looked droopy. Then she began experiencing periods of extreme weakness, when doors were too heavy to open, stairs too difficult to climb, food too hard to chew. Between times, she felt absolutely fine, full of her usual energy and able to pursue the normal life of a bright, beautiful, ambitious young woman. The good times convinced her that nothing was seriously wrong, until she suffered the ultimate assault -breathlessness that progressed to respiratory failure, weakness that became paralysis. Without modern life-support techniques, Miss Kess would have died for lack of oxygen. Miss Kess then learned that she had myasthenia gravis, a mysterious neuromuscular disease in which nerve messages to muscle cells are interrupted by an attack by the immune system on the body's own tissues. The symptoms typically wax and wane, and with treatment they sometimes disappear indefinitely. Thus far, Miss Kess has not been so lucky. For her, as for most myasthenia patients, it remains a chronic, incurable, unpredictable disease. Still, in some ways Miss Kess is fortunate. Had she acquired the disease several decades ago, it might have claimed her life. Today, the vast majority of patients survive and live mostly normal lives with time out for occasional flare-ups. In the last two decades, long-term death rates have been reduced by two-thirds, and twice as many patients now improve after the first one to three years. No one knows how many people have myasthenia gravis. Estimates range from one in 100,000 to one in 10,000 Americans, many of them women in their 20's and 30's. But it can strike as young as age 2 and as late as age 80. Past 50, men are more likely to develop this disease, whose best-known victim was Aristotle Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate. Milder cases than Miss Kess's may escape diagnosis for years. The results of muscular weakness may be mistaken for laziness or alcohol abuse. The symptoms often inhibit achievement in school and at work. The hallmark of myasthenia gravis is weakness and rapid fatigue of the muscles, especially the voluntary muscles of the eyelid and other parts of the face, the neck and the throat. In some patients, arms and legs are the prime targets. The weakness usually results in such classic symptoms of the disease as drooping eyelids, difficulty in swallowing and breathing, double vision, loss of facial expression, slurred speech and an inability to perform simple muscular tasks. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from patient to patient and from time to time. As in Miss Kess's case, occasionally a ''myasthenic crisis'' may occur, characterized by respiratory failure and total paralysis. According to a report in Hospital Practice magazine by Dr. Robert P. Lisak of the University of Pennsylvania, symptoms may be aggravated by a mundane infectious illness, fever, certain antibiotics, quinine (including tonic) and the local anesthetics procaine and lidocaine. People with myasthenia gravis also are more likely than others to develop thyroid abnormalities, rheumatoid arthritis, adult-onset diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a connective-tissue disease. All of these, like myasthenia gravis, are regarded as autoimmune disorders. The latest evidence indicates that the muscular weakness in myasthenia gravis is a consequence of an autoimmune attack on the cell receptors for a nerve-transmitting chemical called acetylcholine. Antibodies to acetylcholine receptors can be found in the blood serum of 90 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis. With the receptors blocked by antibodies, nerve messages cannot get through. But while researchers have begun to decipher the immunological mechanisms behind the disease, no one yet knows what triggers them or how to turn them off for good. Still, many approaches to treatment have been developed that can greatly improve the lives of most patients and sometimes keep the disease at bay indefinitely. Although the disease cannot be cured, it can be controlled. As with symptoms, responses to treatment vary widely from patient to patient. And even in the same patient, the response to a given treatment may vary from time to time. Thus, therapy often involves a fair amount of trial and error, usually starting with the least hazardous treatments and always tailoring them to the severity of the patient's disease. The least drastic are drugs that block the destruction of acetylcholine, such as Prostigmin, Mestinon and Mytelase. For those who do not respond fully to such drugs, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs may be added. About 10 percent of patients have tumors of the thymus gland, an organ in the upper chest that is intimately involved in immunological responses. Many patients aged 20 to 50 improve greatly after surgery to remove the thymus, even if it has no tumors. After thymectomy, many can function with few or no drugs, and in some the disease seems to go into permanent remission. Considerable attention has been paid to the recent experimental use of plasmapheresis, a way of cleansing the blood of the destructive antibodies. Dr. Lisak says it is most useful for patients in myasthenic crisis, but is too costly and somewhat risky for routine use. And although it does remove the damaging antibodies, it does nothing to stop their future production. Although it is one of the rarer autoimmune diseases, myasthenia gravis may give medical researchers the clues they need to crack the puzzle of the more common ones. As Dr. Lisak put it: ''We know precisely what is causing the trouble: an antibody to a specific molecule of known structure. This knowledge does not tell us the source of the antibodies, but it should help us find out.'' The way Miss Kess has dealt with her illness is instructive to all patients with chronic or recurring maladies. Her initial reaction was not unusual among people who discover they have an incurable disease. At first she raged against her disease, seeking to defy its limitations, wearing herself to a frazzle with frantic activity when she was strong, denying herself entry into the world of the disabled and dependent. But this fierce denial only aggravated her symptoms and led to nightmarish emergencies in which, unable to breathe, move or talk but fully alert mentally, she was suddenly at the mercy of machinery and often equally mechanical medical personnel. Initially she toyed with the idea of suicide, but soon decided to rise to the challenge of her illness. This sparked a determined search for medical care that treated her as a person as well as a disease, a crucial aspect of all medical care that is especially important when the illness is chronic. It also convinced her that she had to conserve her energy and focus on activities that were most significant to her. Miss Kess, who was trained as a nurse, is now back nursing part time, as well as writing freelance and serving as vice president and education consultant for the New York chapter of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation. ''Three years of illness has made me keenly aware of the importance of living each day to its fullest,'' she said. ''It forced me to sift out the trivial from the important, showed me the importance of assuming an active role in sickness and in health, helped me discover small joys and trustworthy, caring people.''

1115-> AROUND THE WORLD; Iran Says 11 Died In Iraqi Missile Strikes
Iraqi missiles bombarded the Iranian city of Andimishk today, killing 11 people, wounding 87 and damaging hundreds of homes and shops, the Iranian press agency said. Iraqi Government newspapers had called for the strike to avenge the third Iranian offensive in the last 17 days, in the northern part of the war's battlefront. The state-run Teheran radio said that the offensive continued today in Andimishk, 50 miles east of the border, with heavy fighting, and that more than 4,000 Iraqi troops had been killed or wounded in the latest drive. BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 5 (Reuters) - Iraq's elite presidential guard has gone to the northern front to help repel Iran's latest offensive, the Baghdad radio said today. The presidential guard, which is composed of commandos trained in guerrilla warfare, is responsible for internal security and guarding President Saddam Hussein.

1122-> TEACHER, NOT POLICEMAN
To the Editor: I disagree with Saul Downes's letter of Sept. 19 in which he regards the principal of Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J., a failure: ''I think the principal and the other adulators have lost sight of what the mission is, and that is to teach all the public school students, not just a majority of them.'' Not to expel or separate undisciplined high school students is to risk not teaching the majority at all, or at least at an inferior level. It cannot be better to allow the disruptive student to stay and impair instruction. Time lost by all students waiting for ''the problems'' to work themselves out is hard to regain and a teacher turned policeman can no longer be an effective instructor.

1124-> VENICE SHOW DEPICTS ANCIENT CHINA
VENICEMore than 700 years ago, Marco Polo, a youth journeying with his father and uncle, who were Venetian merchants, arrived in China. The special relationship that was opened then between Emperor Kublai Khan and the republic on the Adriatic remained personal, according to historians, and bore no special fruit over the centuries. Now, however, when Venice has long lost its influence and power and the Mongol empire and its successors have yielded to a people's republic, Marco Polo's role in bridging the gulf between East and West has received recognition in the form of an extraordinary exhibition of Chinese art and archeology sponsored by the Peking and Rome Governments. The exhibition is being mounted by the City of Venice in the Doge's Palace, in itself a place that draws travelers from all over the world. The central theme of the exhibition is to show through archeology and art the gradual development of the Chinese civilization and state, from the neolithic period to the Han Dynasty, said Prof. Gian Carlo Calza of Venice University, a specialist in Asian art and a member of the group of eight scholars that organized the exhibition. The oldest objects on display date to the Peiligang Culture of the seventh to the sixth millenium before the current era; the most recent are products of the western Han Dynasty, which reigned from 206 B.C. until A.D. 24. A Young Science Paradoxically, in view of the antiquity of all of the exhibits, scholars of Sinology nonetheless view it as shedding new light on their subject. ''Although Chinese civilization is very old, the history of its origins is still new,'' said Prof. K. C. Chang, chairman of the anthropology department at Harvard and chairman of the scientific committee of the exposition. ''Archeology in China is a young science,'' added Prof. Mario S. Abattini, another Venice University Sinologist. He said that archeology has been consistently and scientifically carried out in China only since the creation of the People's Republic and that the aim of the exposition was to provide as complete as possible a survey of the results of those efforts. Professor Calza said that the exhibition would have been much bigger if the Chinese Government had provided more of the items that were on the ''shopping list'' that the scholars, led by Professor Chang, had submitted to Peking. ''The bargaining was pretty stiff, but they yielded much under heavy fire,'' Professor Calza said. The ''bargaining'' concerned not only the objects to be exhibited, but also the financial terms of the show. Peking received $150,000 and 11 percent of the proceeds from the catalogue and will get half of the admission fees after 500,000 visitors. Since the show opened last June, 4.3 million Venetians and tourists have seen it. The exhibition closes at the end of the year. Mixed With Italian Treasures About 80 percent of the stoneware, ceramics, bronzes and jades on display had never before left China, and they all lend emphasis on the origins of Chinese civilization. As a result, visiting scholars say the organizers are justified in asserting that the show is ''the most comprehensive archeological display on ancient China ever seen in the Western world.'' Equally exceptional - and to the unspecialized eyes of most visitors far more noticeable - is the extraordinary setting of the Doge's Palace and the great works of art that hang, or are painted, on the walls of the grand, vaulted and wainscoated halls in which the Chinese treasures are displayed. Seeing Giovanni Bellini's ''Lamentation of Christ,'' for example, flanked by a group of protoporcelains from between the 11th and 8th centuries B.C. on one side and a bronze vessel in the shape of a duck from the same period on the other side is a striking experience. Professor Chang, interviewed by telephone in Boston, said there was probably a special advantage in the setting. ''I think the Chinese curators were so impressed by the place they probably chose works that could stand up to it,'' he said. ''The show includes many more and better things than have been shown in the West before.'' Politics Not a Factor He said that with its central theme of tracing the development of Chinese civilization and the extraordinary richness of its contents, the exposition went beyond a comparable show that toured the West in 1974-75. While the earlier exhibition had the clearly political purpose of showing to the outside world that even during the Cultural Revolution archeological digs had continued, the Venice show has no apparent political purpose other than to improve China's relations with a Western country with which it enjoys normal ties. Professor Chang said that among the most noteworthy exhibits were the jade funerary shroud of Prince Liu Sheng, dating to the Han Dynasty and unearthed in 1968; the Zhong Shan bronzes of the period between 475 and 221 B.C., and an array of neolithic pottery, which he said had never been shown in such variety. The extraordinary appeal of the exhibition was evidenced on a recent weekend when members of a large tourist group from Taiwan, risking difficulties with their Government, which punishes any contacts between its citizens and China, trooped excitedly to the show.

1125-> CONCERT: BRAHMS BY PERLMAN AND ASHKENAZY
WHEN Vladimir Ashkenazy and Itzhak Perlman joined forces to play the complete Brahms Violin Sonatas in Carnegie Hall on Sunday night, it was a slightly idiosyncratic composer that emerged. This Brahms was a gentlemanly fellow of no rash inclinations; he only occasionally had anything to say with much urgency. For the most part he was sweet and pleasant company. He was neither overly impassioned nor rudely cold, neither imposing himself on a listener nor pushing anyone away. And, of course, he was immaculately dressed, with tasteful appointments and nary a crease in his clothes to disturb his appearance. Mr. Perlman's violin parts were models of gracious ease, and Mr. Ashkenazy's piano parts were so humble as to be self-effacing. The first and second sonatas were genteel, their rocking rhythms and polished phrasing following the instructions of the score: dolce, molto moderato, amabile, tranquillo, grazioso. And in the third sonata the players raised their voices for the first time, as if the composer were emerging out of a cocoon to show his more excitable nature. This version of Brahms did, of course, have its virtues. But one could have asked for much more - for a sense, even at the composer's most tranquil moments, of his urgency and focus, or for a sign that beneath that slightly melancholic amiability were hints of morbidity and nostalgia. The gentleman that appeared was not a profound musician, simply a very well-mannered one.

1126-> GROWING DEBATE OVER CABLE
With nearly 40 percent of the nation's homes wired for cable television, lawmakers in Washington are trying to come up with a policy that will affect how much the estimated 31 million households will have to pay for the service and, ultimately, what they will see. At the heart of the matter is a dispute over the very nature of cable. In the view of many municipal governments and consumer advocate groups, cable, because of its logistics and economics, is a monopoly, and should be regulated like telephone companies or other utilities. According to the cable industry, however, it faces competition from a wealth of other entertainment and information sources, including video cassettes, satellite-to-home broadcasting and other products of the new technology. Thus, operators argue, they should be given more autonomy. 'Key Issue in Debate' ''The contention that cable is not a monopoly at all is the key issue in the deregulation debate,'' said James Love of the Center for Study of Responsive Law, a consumer group. Currently, most cable companies are regulated by the municipalities in which they operate, and must appeal to local councils for rate increases and other adjustments in their original franchise agreement. The operators must also apply to the municipality for renewal of their franchises. If the industry has its way, that situation will change. The House is currently studying a bill that would reduce the municipalities' authority over rates and renewals in return for requiring cable operators to provide greater access to independent programming. A similar bill was passed recently by the Senate. Control Over Programming Some of the largest companies in the cable business are operators - owners of the cable systems - as well as programmers. The prime example is Time Inc., which owns both American Television and Communications, the nation's second-largest cable operator after Tele-Communications Inc., and Home Box Office, the largest pay service, with 12 million subscribers, as well as Cinemax, the third-ranked pay service. As another example, Warner Amex Cable Communications, the fifth-largest cable operator, also owns Nickelodeon, MTV and - with Viacom, the 11th-largest cable operator - Showtime and The Movie Channel. Even when operators do not directly own programming, they choose the services for which they will provide channels - and hence an opportunity to be seen - and those to which they will deny access. Concentration of Ownership This so-called gatekeeper function has become magnified as the cable industry becomes concentrated among a handful of cable operators. According to Paul Kagan Associates, a leading cable analyst, the 10 largest cable operators already account for half of all cable subscribers, and will own 70 percent within a decade. The gatekeeper's role will become still more critical, say consumer advocates, city officials and others, as cable moves into new services. Eventually, they say, operators will determine not only the movies, sports and news that consumers will be offered, but also such non-entertainment services as banking and security systems. Nicholas Johnson, a member of the Federal Communications Commission from 1966 to 1973 and a proponent of regulation, draws an analogy between cable and telephone service. ''The telephone company never said, 'If we gave you a phone, what sort of things would you be talking about?' '' he said. In contrast, he said, cable operators do make judgments about what they will carry. Charges of Blocked Access Already, some independently owned programming services contend that they have been denied access by self-interested operators. ''There's a lot of blocking going on,'' said Paul Klein, president of the Playboy Channel. Mr. Klein said that a number of systems, including Time's American Television, have refused to carry his service because they do not want competition for the R-rated movies they already carry. The cable operators deny the charge, asserting that they have rejected the Playboy Channel because it would offend the communities they serve or because they personally find it objectionable. While Playboy has not gone to court in the matter, a similar allegation was made in a lawsuit brought last year by Ted Turner, the entrepreneur who established the Cable News Network, the first 24-hour all-news channel. Mr. Turner sued Group W because, he argued, it was refusing to carry CNN in favor of its own Satellite News Channel. The lawsuit was settled last month when CNN acquired Satellite News, however. Cable operators deny that they are discriminating against rival services. Rather, they say, they fill their channels with services that will attract and maintain subscribers and provide a proper return on their substantial investment. 'People Haven't Wanted to Pay' That view is supported by William Johnson, assistant chief of the F.C.C.'s mass media bureau. ''If it started to turn out that the cable companies carried only their own product, it would be a concern,'' Mr. Johnson conceded. But, he said, an F.C.C. investigation of Mr. Turner's contention failed to turn up a pattern of discrimination. ''If services haven't survived,'' he added, ''it's because people haven't wanted to pay for them.'' In fact, said Robert Rosencrans, president of United Artists Cablesystems, a large cable operator, the present range of programming ''has only been accomplished in an environment where financial interests were served by diverse programming.'' If the two businesses were separated, he added, ''we'd have no cable system today.'' In the present regulatory climate in Washington, no one is seeking to break up the cable combinations. But some lawmakers are still concerned that too much power may be concentrated with the cable operators. Wirth's Leased-Access Bill Accordingly, a bill proposed by Representative Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, would require some operators to lease channels to programming services that could not otherwise get access. The provision would open a limited number of channels to services that had been excluded: in return, cable companies would be granted more control over rates and franchise renewals. For many on both sides of the debate, leased access would be an acceptable compromise. But the degree of access that would ultimately be provided is disputed. The Wirth bill would require leasing only by systems operating at least 36 channels - a criterion that would exempt more than half of all systems in operation today. Furthermore, opponents note, the bill stipulates that leased access ''will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development of the cable system.'' In effect, consumer advocates and municipalities contend, that provision would leave the operator completely in control. ''The cable operator could cut sweetheart deals with friends, or keep off politically controversial programming,'' said Sue Miller Buske, executive director of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers. ''That means the cable operator can censor, and I have a big problem with that.'' The industry counters that it must have a way to avoid programs that are ''poorly produced or salacious,'' Mr. Rosencrans said. ''We ought to be able to protect our investment.'' Not even its proponents argue that leased access would yield a bonanza of cultural and educational programming. Instead, they suspect, the likeliest result would be an outpouring of entertainment catering to the lowest common denominator. ''Violence, car chases - that's what the networks have given us, and I suspect that's what leased access would give us,'' said Mr. Johnson, who nonetheless favors the bill. Whether operators will be compelled to lease access to programmers, and how much access, remains to be determined by Congress. But in the long run, suggests Charles Dolan, the head of Cablevision, technology will make the debate obsolete. Operators are adding more channels to the dial, he noted, and thus reducing the pressure for access. Some Cablevision systems have between 80 and 110 channels. ''In a way, it's becoming like the telephone,'' he said. ''Nobody has a monopoly on the circuits.''

1127-> O'ROURKE SEEKING TO REMAIN WESTCHESTER'S CHIEF
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke traveled throughout Westchester County today formally announcing what had been apparent for some time - that he would seek election to the $81,500 post this fall. Mr. O'Rourke, a 49-year-old Yonkers Republican, was designated by the Republican-controlled County Legislature last December to replace Alfred B. DelBello, a Democrat, after Mr. DelBello became Lieutenant Governor. The election this fall is for the unexpired two years of Mr. DelBello's four-year term. Standing on the steps of the County Office Building here, the first of five such campaign stops, Mr. O'Rourke spoke to about 150 supporters of his experience from serving four terms as a Yonkers Councilman and five terms in the County Legislature, where he also served as chairman. He pledged to ''hold the line on taxes.'' He also promised to maintain the county's park lands, a subject that has become a political issue, and to increase the fight against crime. He said he would build a strong program of county aid to local police departments and create a missing children's unit in the County Police Department. Reid Is His Opponent His Democratic opponent in November will be former Representative Ogden R. Reid, a 57-year-old Purchase resident who served for five terms in the House of Representatives as a Republican and for one, after switching parties, as a Democrat, before running for governor in 1974. He has been out of public office since 1976, when he resigned as the state's Environmental Commissioner. Mr. O'Rourke spoke of Mr. Reid as representing a ''failed ultraliberalism'' and challenged him to engage in a series of debates and to agree ''to limit campaign spending to an acceptable level,'' such as the $300,000 that Mr. DelBello spent in his last County Executive campaign. Mr. Reid said in response that he was hardly an ''ultraliberal'' in Congress, and that ''while government must always show fiscal responsibility, it must never forget the needs of people.'' He agreed to a series of debates ''when the issues are focused.'' As for campaign spending limits, Mr. Reid said he ''faced two realities.'' One, he said, was ''the value of the incumbency, which I would put at $250,000 to $500,000.'' The other was the ''likely role that Lew Lehrman,'' the defeated Republican candidate for Governor, ''will play in O'Rourke's campaign.'' No Major Changes Proposed Mr. O'Rourke said he expected Mr. Lehrman ''to campaign with me, but at this point he has not donated anything.'' Mr. O'Rourke said before moving on to Yonkers, Peekskill, Mount Kisco and Port Chester, that he was ''not necessarily considering any major shifts in government for the next year, or thereafter.'' He spoke of a ''very competent staff'' in county government, ''many of whom are Democrats,'' and said he was was proud to have ''continued professionalism in government.'' Born in Plainfield, N.J., on Oct. 26, 1933, Mr. O'Rourke was a year old when his father died. He attended public and private schools, went to Fordham University on a scholarship and joined the Air Force in 1954. He stayed for eight years, receiving a law degree while studying at night. Becoming County Executive meant giving up a White Plains law practice. Candidate Finishing a Novel Tall and silver-haired, he offers an urbane appearance. As chairman of the County Legislature he enjoyed the banter of political debate and would punctuate the proceedings with sallies occasionally drawn from the classics. He is completing a novel based on a true incident, a 1975 insurrection aboard a Soviet destroyer. Public opinion polls by Roger Seasonwein Associates in New Rochelle have indicated that Mr. Reid, despite his years out of public office, has better name recognition than Mr. O'Rourke. Perhaps as a result, Mr. O'Rourke has been attending dinners, community events and other functions at a mid-campaign pace. He is relaxed but articulate at such functions, using a ready wit to turn aside questions he wants to avoid. Mr. Reid, an experienced campaigner, also is traveling the dinner circuit and has focused so far on offering his own positions while reproaching Mr. O'Rourke for his. Mr. Reid has sought to characterize Mr. O'Rourke as willing to sell park land, a charge based on the County Executive's recommendation that unused county land be leased, and proposed today that the county create a Labor Department to retrain and otherwise assist workers, especially those facing layoffs at plants in Westchester.

1128-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Signal Plans to Assume Wheelabrator Unit Debt
The Signal Companies announced yesterday that if had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to assume $84.5 million principal amount of debentures issued by its Wheelabrator-Frye Inc. subsidiary. Signal said the debt, in two issues, would be the last of its subsidiaries' publicly issued debt to be absorbed by the parent company. Following the announcement, Moody's Investors Service said it was raising Signal's senior debt rating to A1, from Baa3, and raising the ratings on the two Wheelabrator-Frye issues to A1, from A2. Signal said the debt assumption -$9.5 million principal amount of Wheelabrator's 5 7/8 percent debentures due in 1997 and $75 million principal amount of its 11 3/4 percent debentures due in 2005 - was part of the company's financial restructuring plan. Last month, the company issued shares of its common stock in exchange for $10 million of its UOP Inc. unit's 6 5/8 percent debentures, which Signal assumed in April. Moody's yesterday raised the rating on the UOP Inc. debt still outstanding to A1, from Baa2. Cheryl Patten, a spokesman for Signal, said most of the remaining debt to be assumed by the parent company had been issued by its subsidiaries in private placements and industrial revenue bonds, but that the total dollar amount of that debt was unavailable. Since January 1981, Signal has assumed $142.5 million of its subsidiaries' publicly issued debt, she said. Signal also announced that it would soon begin to renegotiate its major bank credit facilities, with all future borrowings to be the obliations of Signal, rather than its subsidiaries.

1129-> PRETORIA UPHOLDS RULING ON BLACKS
After several weeks of anxiety and indecision, the Government announced today that it would not seek legislation to overcome a ruling by South Africa's highest court that opens the possibility for black migrant workers to gain permanent rights as urban residents. Pieter G. Koornhof, the Minister for Cooperation and Development, whose department administers the intricate laws that regulate the lives of blacks, acknowledged in Cape Town that the possibility that migrant workers might gain residence rights had now been ''clearly established'' and that the Government was ''obviously bound'' by an Appeals Court ruling in the case of a migrant named Mehlolo Tom Rikhoto. But he said the Government would pass legislation before the allwhite Parliament adjourned at the end of the month to make the right of migrants to bring their wives and children to urban areas conditional on official certification that they had acquired adequate accommodation. It was necessary to insure ''at all costs,'' Mr. Koornhof stressed, ''that unrealistic expectations of instant accommodation in urban areas are not created in the minds of urban workers and their families who are affected by the judgment.'' Ideological Ramparts Breached While the real impact of the judgment remains to be seen, it does breach the ideological ramparts of the apartheid system by opening the possibility for black migrant workers to establish themselves permamently in urban areas. A 1968 administrative regulation sought to insure that this could never happen. The Rikhoto ruling applies only to migrant workers who can show they have worked continuously for one employer for 10 years or for 15 consecutive years for various employers. Even if the new permit system that Mr. Koornhof seems to have been suggesting to control the movement to the cities of their dependents is harshly administered, such workers will have significantly improved their status. Migrant workers are hired on annual contracts in the rural ''homelands'' where they live under a system that effectively denies them job mobility after they reach the cities. Urban residents can quit their jobs when they see a chance of getting a better one. Since major corporations have started to offer family housing to skilled black workers, some of the former migrants affected by the Rikhoto ruling may have a narrow opportunity to use their new status to acquire the right to live with their families. Mr. Koornhof's announcement was greeted with expressions of relief by those who had feared that the Government would bend to pressure from its own right-wing opponents and members of the governing National Party, especially in the western part of Cape Province, where blacks are still a minority, who wanted to rush through legislation to nullify the Appeals Court ruling. Ruling Hailed in U.S. There was pressure on the other side from diverse sources, including the State Department in Washington, which issued a statement hailing the Rikhoto ruling; the new black trade unions here, which threatened strikes, and corporate interests, which made their concerns heard through an organization they established to foster change called the Urban Foundation. ''It was a bloody battle,'' reported a well-placed source who said he had heard that Mr. Koornhof had threatened to resign on the issue. The Rikhoto ruling does not open up a new era so much as restore a situation that existed 15 years ago, before the apartheid bureaucracy introduced a technicality that made it impossible for migrants to gain residence rights. By requiring them to return annually to the homelands to get their contracts renewed, this regulation enabled white administrators to contend that their employment had not been continuous and therefore they could never qualify for urban rights. No one seems to know how many migrants will be immediately affected by the judgment striking down that regulation. Published estimates have ranged from 33,000 to 266,000. Prof. Charles Simkins of the University of Cape Town, an expert on black population shifts, estimates that the number of workers who will qualify annually for urban residence under the Rikhoto ruling will only be about 30,000. That may not be a large number for a sophisticated industrial economy but it has great significance in the nation's racial politics for those who assume that political rights will eventually have to be conceded to urban blacks. Of the more than 23 million blacks within South Africa's traditional borders, only about 25 percent are presently believed to have the status Mr. Rikhoto won. Helen Suzman, an opposition Member of Parliament who has battled against the laws restricting free black movement to the cities, said she was relieved that the Government did not intend to ''tamper'' with the court's ruling. But she said it would be necessary to watch closely to see how the ruling was now carried out. ''The important thing is to make sure the administrators do not obstruct it or make it very difficult by demanding one set of proofs after another,'' she said. Mr. Rikhoto, a factory worker in an industrial city called Germiston, was helped in his suit by the Legal Resources Center, South Africa's only public interest law firm, which receives much of its support from sources in the United States, including the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford Foundation.

1131-> GENEVA REPORTED PICKED FOR LEBANON UNITY TALKS
After almost a month of arguing over the site for talks, Lebanon's factions have now agreed to meet in Geneva next week, senior Lebanese Government sources said today. The sources said the accord was reached today by Rafik Hariri, a Saudi mediator, in contacts with the various factions and with representatives of Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Lebanese Government. It had been agreed earlier that Syria and Saudi Arabia would send observers to the meeting. In a statement outside the presidential palace in Baabda, Mr. Hariri said: ''After contacts with the parties concerned and with Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam, agreement has been reached on the venue of the national dialogue. We thank God for this result.'' A senior Lebanese Government official later said Geneva had been chosen. ''It is now only a matter of working out the formalities,'' he said. ''The meeting could take place in Geneva anytime between next Monday and Thursday, provided there are no last- minute and unexpected problems.'' The decision to hold a conference aimed at reconciling the warring Lebanese factions was part of the cease-fire accord reached Sept. 26. The Lebanese Ambassador to Switzerland, Johnny Abdo, who was here this week for consultations, was ordered back today to make arrangements, the sources said. Foreign Minister Elie Salem of Lebanon said in a statement read at the palace after Mr. Hariri's announcement: ''The meeting will be on the territory of a friendly state and this requires diplomatic and political contacts which I, as Foreign Minister, will be undertaking. As soon as they are completed, the venue and time of the dialogue will be announced.'' A plan by President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon to hold the talks today at Beirut airport had to be canceled in the face of opposition from Walid Jumblat, the Druse leader, and his allies, former Prime Minister Rashid Karami, former President Suleiman Franjieh and Foreign Minister Khaddam of Syria. They said they did not believe they would safe at the airport, which is under the control of the Lebanese Army and American marines. The security concerns were viewed by Western diplomats as a cover for political considerations. The Syrians and the opposition leaders wanted the meeting held in a place that would take President Gemayel far away from his office and bring him down to the level of just one more factional leader. The opposition leaders therefore rejected the presidential palace in Baabda and the nearby airport, and favored places like a Greek ship or Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon. Geneva was apparently chosen because it had no political connotations and all parties felt their safety could be assured there. Lebanese Government officials were not particularly happy with the choice, but felt that a concession was needed to demonstrate their good faith. The officials believe President Reagan's charges of Syrian obstructionism at a news conference on Wednesday may have been a factor in inducing the Syrians to agree. Meanwhile, the multinational peacekeeping force was again the target of attack, with a French paratrooper injured when a home-made bomb packed with nails and placed inside a tea kettle was tossed at his truck as it was crossing the Green Line, separating Christian East Beirut from the predominantly Moslem Western sector. Four American marines were wounded Wednesday when a car bomb was detonated as their supply convoy passed by. With the meeting of Lebanese factions no longer scheduled to be held at Beirut airport, most of the gunmen who had turned the area into a battleground appeared to have left the scene. The Beirut radio said there was light and intermittent fighting in the southern suburbs today between the Lebanese Army and Shiite militiamen.

1132-> OLIVETTI IS SAID TO OFFER 20% STAKE TO A.T.& T.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which is beginning to enter overseas markets, is being asked to purchase a 20 percent stake in Ing. C. Olivetti & Company, the big Italian office- equipment maker, European executives familiar with the negotiations said today. The purchase would be required of A.T.& T. as part of a joint venture agreement under which Olivetti would market A.T.& T. products in Europe, the sources said. According to these sources, A.T.& T. would acquire the Olivetti interest from the stake held by two recently nationalized French concerns, Compagnie de St.-Gobain-Pont- a-Mousson and CII- Honeywell Bull. Robert E. Allen, A.T.& T.'s executive vice president and chief financial officer, told a meeting of French bankers and analysts here today that ''talks with Olivetti have been taking place and are continuing, although I do not know how they will work out. Marketing Venture ''We are interested in buying markets,'' Mr. Allen said, adding that A.T.& T. plans ''aggressive marketing'' of telephone equipment and information systems outside the United States after it completes the court-ordered divestiture of its 22 local operating companies next January. Mr. Allen refused comment on the possibility that A.T.& T. might aquire an equity stake in Olivetti. But an A.T.& T. spokesman said in New York last month that the company ''has not bid for any Olivetti stock.'' It was not immediately clear what A.T.& T. would have to pay for 20 percent of Olivetti. The company is currently valued at some $800 million on the Milan Stock Exchange, indicating that a 20 percent interest would cost about $160 million. In 1980, St. Gobain paid about $200 million for 20 percent of Olivetti. A.T.& T., which virtually ignored the overseas market when it had the American monopoly on telephone service, has been seeking to expand overseas in recent years. The search has become more pressing because A.T.& T.'s manufacturing arm, Western Electric, is likely to lose some business when its main customers, the local operating companies, split from A.T.& T. on Jan. 1. Overseas Partners Sought A.T.& T. has been looking for overseas partners partly because it has only a small overseas marketing force and because many foreign telecommunications systems are state-owned and tend to favor domestic suppliers. It now has joint ventures with Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, and a South Korean company, and owns a majority of an Irish telecommunications company. Analysts say they regard Olivetti as a logical partner for A.T.& T., but stress that the key question in any joint-venture negotiations between the two companies is the 32 percent stake in the Italian company currently owned by St. Gobain and Bull. St. Gobain bought a 32 percent interest in Olivetti when it was considering a diversification into electronics. But after the French Government nationalized it last year, the company was forced to give a 24 percent stake in Olivetti to Bull. Carlo de Benedetti, Olivetti's chief executive officer and a major shareholder, asked the French Government recently to reduce its stake in Olivetti as part of a proposed collaboration agreement with Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, another newly nationalized French company. That agreement is being held up because Mr. de Benedetti wants St. Gobain and Bull to sell roughly two- thirds of their combined holding in Olivetti - or 20 percent - to private investors, with C.G.E. taking over the remaining stake. French officials say Mr. de Benedetti has made clear that he would like A.T.& T. to be the buyer of the 20 percent stake as part of any joint venture agreement with his company. St. Gobain executives say they are ready to sell their remaining Olivetti shares now that their company has withdrawn from the electronics field. And executives at Bull, which is deep in the red, also say they want to sell their stake to raise new capital.

1133-> CITY BALLET: 'JEWELS'
Thursday night in the New York State Theater, the New York City Ballet danced George Balanchine's ''Jewels'' for the first time since 1980. The revival restores an unusual work to the repertory, for ''Jewels'' is that rarity, a full-evening plotless ballet. Its three sections, evoking the luster of emeralds, rubies and diamonds, are set to music by three different composers and are not directly connected by any narrative device. Yet they complement one another beautifully when performed together. ''Jewels'' is shining in a new setting. At its premiere in 1967, it had decor by Peter Harvey that included strands of jewels hung against layers of net. These designs were considered undistinguished and many balletgoers hoped they might someday be replaced. Unfortunately, the new designs by Robin Wagner are also undistinguished. The entire ballet is now danced inside a false proscenium, as if in a jewelbox, and a jeweled construction is lowered against the backdrop for each act: a tiara for ''Emeralds,'' a brooch for ''Rubies'' and a parure for ''Diamonds.'' But these constructions not only look like Christmas tree ornaments from a dime store, they are also obtrusive, for they have a tendency to distract attention from the dancers. Mr. Wagner has taken an excessively literal approach to the ballet. Thus, whereas Mr. Balanchine shows us the mysterious radiance of jewels, Mr. Wagner simply displays some big rocks. ''Jewels'' may be hard to design, yet the performance demonstrated that it remains a remarkable choreographic achievement. With its unhurried flowing steps, ''Emeralds,'' to Faure, appeared to occur in some enchanted grotto, and the proper serenity was achieved by its leading couples - Kyra Nichols and Sean Lavery and Karin von Aroldingen and Joseph Duell - and by Elyse Borne, Melinda Roy and Kipling Houston, who made the pas de trois proceed as if it were a single unbroken phrase. In contrast, ''Rubies,'' to Stravinsky, galloped along, even though Patricia McBride and Ib Andersen had a tendency to smooth out some of the choreography's sharp edges. If a sense of tension is often not welcome in ballet, it is appropriate here, for it helps invest the steps with nervous energy. Wilhelmina Frankfurt possessed a lot of such energy, and the way she let her arms and legs jut out made her resemble a Cubist portrait in motion. After the excitement of ''Rubies,'' the pomp and pageantry of ''Diamonds,'' to Tchaikovsky, served both to calm the viewer and bring ''Jewels'' to a stately conclusion. Its choreographic realm was an absolute monarchy, over which Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins ruled with benign authority. The performance made one realize that the real treasures of ''Jewels'' are the New York City Ballet's dancers. Compared with them, even the rarest diamond can seem paste. Robert Irving conducted and Gordon Boelzner was the piano soloist in ''Rubies.''

1134-> ; 42D STREET TROLLEYS: LET'S DO IT-LET'S NOT
To the Editor: Mayor Koch and Deputy Mayor Wagner are correct to be cautious about the proposed trolley for 42d Street. Transit users along 42d move primarily between the Port Authority bus terminal and Grand Central Station, already connected by two subways. A third train - on the street no less - makes no sense. In fact, a case could be made to eliminate even buses from the zone between the two terminals, providing instead simpler, more attractive connections from the subways to buses at each terminal for journeys toward either the U.N. or the Hudson River. Nor will the trolley conveniently serve the Convention Center, as its advocates suggest. Most conventioneers will stay at hotels closer to 50th Street, which will be better served by taxis and buses provided during peak usage. As Midtown grows, transit emphasis must continue to be on subway improvement and exclusive bus lanes as required. A new surface train taking up two traffic lanes would interfere disproportionately with legitimate vehicular traffic. Trolley fans should take their trains to Second Avenue. KENNETH S. HALPERN New York, Nov. 18, 1983 The writer is former director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Planning and Development.

1137-> SEAVER AND TORREZ SWEEP CARDS
The Mets managed something of a baseball rarity last night in Shea Stadium: They became the first team in nearly three years to sweep a doubleheader from the St. Louis Cardinals. They did it, moreover, with their two senior pitchers in the lead roles. They won the first game, 6-4, behind the pitching of 38-yearold Tom Seaver, who did a bit of huffing and puffing along the way and nearly blew a six-run lead. Then they won the second game 2-1, with 36-year-old Mike Torrez outpitching Joaquin Andujar, the hero of last October's World Series. Winning doubleheaders is not a specialty of the Mets. Before sweeping one last month in Pittsburgh, they had gone three years without winning two games in one day. Losing doubleheaders also is not a specialty of the Cardinals. The last time they did it was on Sept. 6, 1980, against the Houston Astros. The Mets also brought their record to 10-10 since Frank Howard replaced George Bamberger as manager. But Howard, a 6-foot-8-inch man who speaks in epigrams, merely said: ''For us to win, we've got to be letter-perfect. We still have to tee it up and play those guys tomorrow. But, as they say, I've been rich and I've been poor, and rich is better.'' Whitey Herzog, the manager of the Cardinals, blamed his silent hitters for the double defeat, saying: ''Too many guys not hitting. Too many guys going 1 for 25. Our second baseman, third baseman and shortstop are 4 for 67 combined.'' The first game marked another milestone for Seaver in his 17th season in the big leagues: He became the seventh active pitcher to reach 4,000 innings of work. It also marked another infrequent occasion when the Mets supported him with some early runs. This time, they did it against a team that had beaten them 11 times in the last 12 games. They got three runs off Bob Forsch in the first inning, starting with a single by Keith Hernandez and a walk to George Foster. Then up came Darryl Strawberry, the rookie right fielder, who had been benched for five days to rest his .179 average. He sent the second pitch into the balcony in right field for his first home run in a month. ''I had too many things on my mind,'' Strawberry said. ''But, sitting on the bench for five games, I blocked everything out of my mind but baseball. And I came back more aggressive.'' Two innings later, Seaver got three more runs, starting with singles by Bob Bailor, Danny Heep and Foster. That ended the evening for Forsch, who was replaced by the left-handed Jim Kaat. But Strawberry, a 21-year-old rookie facing a 44-year-old veteran, promptly doubled down the right-field line for another run. Then, with two down, Brian Giles walked and Jose Oquendo lined a single to left field, making it 6-0. The Mets lost another run when Giles was thrown out at third base, and that run grew more important as the Cardinals grew more animated. With two down in the fourth, they loaded the bases with two down and got their first run when Willie McGee bounced a single over Seaver's leap. And, when David Green followed with a single, two more runs crossed and Seaver's lead had been cut in half. In the sixth, Andy Van Slyke brought them even closer when he hit a home run into the right-field bullpen. Now the Mets' lead was down to 6-4, but Seaver kept it there by retiring 11 of the next 14 batters. ''I struggled,'' Seaver conceded. ''But there is enough gas left in the tank. Not super-unleaded, just unleaded.'' In the second game, the Mets treated Torrez to two runs in the first inning against Andujar, who hadn't won in a month. They did it on singles by Mookie Wilson and Giles and a double by Hubie Brooks. After that, they got only one hit the rest of the game. Then in the second inning, the Cardinals loaded the bases with three singles with nobody out. It was the turning point of the game, but it turned against the Cardinals. Torrez struck out Jamie Quirk. Then Ozzie Smith tapped one back to the mound, where Torrez threw home for the forceout. But Junior Ortiz, the Mets' new catcher, fired the ball past third base trying for a double play, and one run scored. ''Junior should have stuck the ball in his pocket,'' Howard said later, ''and waited for the pitcher to come up.'' However, Torrez struck out Andujar, then pitched two-hit ball until the eighth inning, when Jesse Orosco relieved him and completed the memorable evening. Astros 4, Braves 3 HOUSTON (UPI) - Terry Puhl singled in the tying run and Phil Garner singled in the game-winner over a drawn-in outfield with the bases loaded in the ninth inning. Atlanta had rallied for a 3-2 lead on pinch-hitter Bob Watson's two-out, two-run single in the top of the inning.

1138-> NO-FAULT MALPRACTICE INSURANCE FAULTED
To the Editor: Mildred B. Shapiro's proposal (letter, Sept. 19) of a no-fault system to compensate for ''adverse medical outcomes'' is not a new idea. It has been studied repeatedly and has always been found to be an unfair, impractical and potentially costly approach. It is naive to assume that compensation for adverse medical outcome can be equitably provided on a no- fault basis, irrespective of professional negligence. Fundamentally, there are only two ways in which no-fault can operate: (1) to compensate virtually everyone who has an adverse medical outcome (in effect, everyone who dies or gets worse); or (2) to devise a list of common negative outcomes or ''compensable events'' for which a fixed payment would be made. Universal compensation would be prohibitively expensive. The alternative approach also fails: Proposed lists of compensable events are always limited to the most common situations in which malpractice is evident. In other words, the vast majority of malpractice cases are not easily categorized and cannot be foreseen. They are therefore absent from any such list and exempt from coverage. Under the no-fault approach, there would be no compensation whatsoever for the majority of medical cases where negligence and malpractice occur. Most victims of medical malpractice would have nowhere to turn for compensation. Unlike auto no-fault, medical no-fault is not a program for compensating every victim, but rather a prescription to provide immunity for doctors in all but the most flagrant instances of malpractice.

1139-> FOR BRITISH WOMEN, THE GAINS COME, BUT SLOWLY
Marching soldiers, enthusiastic models waving from colorful floats and bands belting out the show tune ''There's Nothing Like a Dame'' led a parade past half a million onlookers earlier this month. The occasion was London's official welcome for its first female Lord Mayor. Dame Dorothy Mary Donaldson's inauguration Nov. 12 ended more than eight centuries of male tenure in the largely ceremonial position, but the event received little attention in British newspapers. Living in a nation whose chief leadership figures are Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britons did not seem surprised that Lady Donaldson is now Lord Mayor. Indeed, many Britons these days appear to feel that there is little to be gained by focusing on the role of women in the nation's economic, social or political affairs. That view starts at the top. Mrs. Thatcher's Opinion ''Mrs. Thatcher thinks that it is more significant that she is Britain's first scientist Prime Minister than that she's the first woman,'' said Ian Kydd, a press spokesman for the Prime Minister, referring to her work as a research chemist from 1947 to 1951. Mrs. Thatcher, he added, is not available for interviews on ''women's issues.'' Attitudes like Mrs. Thatcher's, possibly in part a reflection of the long association here of feminism with leftist politics, have combined with Britain's economic decline to make life especially challenging for the increasing numbers of British women entering the work force. Britain did not pass legislation guaranteeing women equal pay for equal work until 1975, some 12 years after the United States, and it has never come close to putting national affirmative action rules into effect. Americans here say the result is an eye-opener. ''American women are 10 to 15 years ahead of British women,'' said Claire Coppola, an assistant vice president in Kidder Peabody's office in the City, London's financial district. ''By that I mean that the City looks the way I imagine Wall Street did that long ago in terms of the number of women around and their influence.'' 'Aren't Enough Women' Barbara Bondy, a financial analyst sent from New York to Dun & Bradstreet's British subsidiary, said: ''I really miss the feeling of a strong women's business community. There just aren't enough women here for that.'' The City is renowned as a male bastion, but it is not the only business setting where British and American experiences have diverged. The number of female engineering graduates in the United States jumped from less than one-half of 1 percent to almost 10 percent of the total in the 1970's, while the British equivalent went from about 1.5 percent to about 4 percent, where it has leveled off. Susan Bullivant, a lecturer at Loughborough University of Technology, spent 1981 on a study tour in the United States. She wrote in a recent report that she was overwhelmed at the range of materials and programs she found on her tour that were focused on getting women into engineering. Many British women say they share the American impression that the two countries are developing in the same direction but that Britain is trailing. 'Haven't Done as Well' ''There are now many more girls going into the lower level of business than there used to be, but we haven't done as well yet in getting women into the upper rungs,'' said Baroness Lockwood, who retired this year after serving as chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission since it was set up in 1975 to encourage enforcement of equal rights legislation. ''The process is going to be slower here.'' Nevertheless, several dozen women and men interviewed in recent months agreed that British women's prospects at the professional level had steadily improved in recent years, and many said they felt the change was accelerating. ''The momentum seems to be gathering,'' said Pat Pitassy, a marketing executive from Celanese's Fibers Division on loan to Imperial Chemical Industries. ''I expect to see women move more in the next 5 years here than they did in the last 10.'' Women and men express a wide range of views about the extent of discrimination that women face in the business world. Nicky Joyce, president of the British Association of Women Executives, said she had not run into any problems in the 30 years since she and June Hicks founded a company to organize and staff shows and promotional events. ''If a man sees that a woman is successful, he will back her all the way,'' she said. ''British men are very fair.'' The Power of Clubs Others, however, were adamant that British women were rarely promoted unless they proved themselves clearly superior to male competitors and that they were often hindered by being channeled into career paths in which there were fewer promotion opportunities. In addition, the network of acquaintances formed by British men in private secondary schools and in the universities is cited as a persistent problem for women in their 30's and 40's who are working toward senior management positions. Such relationships are often reinforced - and big business transacted - at clubs, some of which exclude women and most of which limit their access. ''Of the older, well-established clubs, you are talking about 90 percent exclusion of women,'' said Sarah Edwards, a stockbroker who is putting together a survey for the City Women's Network, a seven-year-old group almost evenly balanced between American and British members. By all accounts, Britain's economic woes in the last decade have been a major drag on the progress of women in the labor force. Department of Employment figures show that the percentage of women in general management fell to 7 percent last year from 9.7 percent in 1975. Research published by the Equal Opportunities Commission suggests the reason is that women are far more likely to be managers in small companies, the group most damaged by the recession that began in 1979. Male Unemployment Higher Nonskilled women and manual workers outside the service sector have also been especially hard hit, although male unemployment rates are still, at more than 15 percent, about 50 percent over those for women. From 1979 through 1981, employment in the engineering sector fell by 15 percent over all - 14 percent for men and 21 percent for women. An Equal Opportunities Commission report said, ''Women are concentrated in the occupational groups which have declined relatively more than all other occupations in engineering and for which the future in increasingly bleak.'' Such projections are disturbing in a nation where divorce rates are climbing, and it is increasingly recognized that employed women stand between hundreds of thousands of families and poverty. Almost 50 percent of British women have or are looking for employment. Affirmative Action Opposed The Government and most of the voters are ideologically opposed to affirmative action in their favor, but there is a rapidly expanding range of programs intended to break down the educational barriers that get women started on the wrong foot. ''American women are much more conscious of being a role model for girls,'' said Leah Hertz, a City University Business School lecturer who is working on a comparative study of American and British women who own and manage relatively large businesses. ''The English haven't heard of the word visibility.''

1140-> GREYHOUND DRIVER IS HURT IN ATTACK
Four unidentified men attacked a bus shortly after it left the Greyhound bus terminal in Philadelphia yesterday, smashing its windows with crowbars and slightly injuring the driver. A 53-year-old striking Greyhound bus driver, meanwhile, was charged in San Antonio in connection with an attack on a bus and its driver that left a bullet hole in the windshield. As the nationwide strike against the bus company continued, Leslie White, a spokesman for Greyhound, said ridership was averaging 28 passengers per 40-seat bus, as against 27 a bus a year ago. But the current ridership figures represent passengers on the current limited service, which represents about one-tenth of Greyhound's normal service, she said. William Egenlauf, a detective with the Philadelphia police, said the four vandals apparently followed the bus there, which Greyhound had leased from Easy Rider Lines, just after it left the Philadelphia terminal about 1 P.M. He said the vandals ''were in an auto and pulled up behind the bus, turned off the bus engine from the rear and then beat on the windows with crowbars.'' Security Guard Was in Bus The bus driver suffered minor facial cuts, the detective said. Six passengers and an unarmed security guard for Greyhound were on the bus at the time of the incident. No one was arrested. Striking Greyhound employees marching in front of the terminal denied that their union was responsible. The passengers were taken to the nearby Trailways terminal, where they were allowed to use their Greyhound tickets for the ride to New York. In the San Antonio incident, Edwin L. Bunte of La Vernia, Tex., was ordered held on $25,000 bond by Federal Magistrate Robert B. O'Connor. Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Bunte on Thursday under a Federal complaint accusing him of being involved in the destruction of an interstate motor vehicle, according to Bill Dalseg, a special agent in charge of the bureau's San Antonio office. Shots were fired at a Greyhound bus and its driver in San Antonio Wednesday evening, Mr. Dalseg said, but the driver was not injured. The driver told the police that two men in a car drove ahead of the bus when it left the downtown station on its way to a maintenance garage just after 6 P.M. About 12,700 Greyhound bus drivers and other workers who belong to the Amalgamated Transport Union have been on strike since Nov. 2 in a dispute over a proposed 9.5 percent cut in wages and benefits. Union officials are scheduled to announce Monday results of voting on a new offer, which reportedly contains a 7.8 percent wage cut.

A Federal appeals court has upheld a judge's order requiring the Social Security Administration to restore benefits to more than 6,000 mentally ill people in six states. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled Friday that Federal District Judge Earl Larson acted properly when he issued an injunction last December ordering the benefits restored. They average $289 a month. The supplemental disability benefits were cut off in 1981 in accord with new eligibility standards imposed by the Reagan Administration. They made it more difficult for the mentally ill to prove inability to work.

1145-> MAN IN THE NEWS; NEW SCHOOL BOARD CHIEF
James F. Regan said yesterday after he was named president of New York City's Board of Education that he had one problem: He did not want to leave his office for a larger one down the hall because ''I can see Staten Island from here.'' Mr. Regan is a resident of Staten Island and taught social studies at public high schools there for 17 years. ''I still have chalk under my fingernails,'' he said during an interview at board headquarters in Brooklyn, shortly after the seven-member board at its annual election named him to replace Joseph G. Barkan. ''Some people say that we should have a prestigious board, all bankers or something,'' he said. ''I think 17 years in the system is an attribute.'' But his years as a teacher did not have much to do with his being named president for a year's term, board members said. It was more a matter of some disaffection with Mr. Barkan, whose three and a half years as president were capped by the difficult selection of a new schools chancellor in April. On Board Since 1972 Mr. Barkan said yesterday that he could not put together the required four votes to remain as president. The board yesterday also elected board member Miguel O. Martinez of Brooklyn as its vice president. James Francis Regan was appointed to the board in 1972 and has been reappointed regularly ever since by the Borough President of Staten Island. Mr. Regan served as president of the board for one year, during the height of the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975 . This time, he said, he expects his task to be easier. ''I feel good about it, I just feel good about it,'' he said in his office at board headquarters at 110 Livingston Street - an electricblue room with drapes that have illustrations of sailboats and a door sign that reads ''Captain's Quarters.'' The 53-year-old Mr. Regan is a captain in the Naval Reserve. Mr. Regan will have to give up his office because with the title of president comes an extra assistant, an extra secretary and a larger office. Being president is basically a ceremonial job, however. It does not carry any more power or responsibility than the other six board members have, nor does the president earn more than the $115 a day paid to all board members. The job is considered full time. The board sets basic policy for the 32 school districts, which have local responsibility for kindergarten through the eighth grade. The Board of Education, however, runs the high schools. Power Shift Is Cited The board also approves contracts and fills many jobs in the school system, including that of schools chancellor. In recent years, some board members, particularly Mr. Barkan, have complained that the board has lost some power to the chancellor. Mr. Regan said he had no difficulties with that relationship. Schools Chancellor Anthony J. Alvarado has told confidantes that he gets along well with Mr. Regan. Since 1978 Mr. Regan has been chairman of the State Permanent Commission on Public Employee Pensions and Retirement Systems, for which he is paid $52,100 a year. The commission makes recommendations to the State Legislature on all issues affecting the pensions of the 2.3 million current and retired public employees in the city and state. That includes members of the city's teacher retirement system. Mr. Regan, who readily acknowledges that he is a supporter of the United Federation of Teachers, said he did not think his job with the commission represented a conflict of interest. Aides to Mayor Koch said that the Mayor believed there probably was not a conflict. The Board of Education is no longer directly involved in labor negotiations with the teachers' union. Mr. Regan said he was not concerned about the issue, and that is very much in character, his colleagues said. He has developed a reputation for being an amiable, good-humored man who frequently spices routine board meetings with jokes and speaks fondly of his Irish roots. Six weeks after he and his twin sister, Gertrude, were born on Jan. 4, 1930, their mother died. All five children were dispersed among close relatives, Mr. Regan going to his mother's sister on Staten Island. Mr. Regan grew up on Staten Island. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Fordham University in 1952 and a Master's Degree in personnel and guidance from Richmond College in 1971. He joined the Naval Reserve while he was still in high school and went on active duty after leaving Fordham. After his tour of duty, he got a teaching job at Curtis High School on Staten Island. There he met his future wife, the former Mary F. Schlusser. They have been married nearly 26 years and live with their two daughters, Claire, 25, and Cara, 20, in the Great Kills section. As board president, Mr. Regan said, he wants to develop closer relationships with the 32 community school districts, wants to become more involved with the high schools and wants to see more improvement in special education. He said he also wanted to see education become a national priority. ''We subsidize tobacco, we subsidize cotton and we shouldn't subsidize education?'' he said. ''I think it is a national disgrace that we haven't developed a true urban plan, and education is part of it.''

1147-> JERSEY NO-FAULT LAW'S PRIME BENEFICIARIES
To the Editor: As your June 4 editorial ''A Primary Interest in New Jersey'' indicates, New Jersey no-fault auto insurance reform is being blocked by a coterie of legislators who do not want to increase the state's current $200 threshold for suits for pain and suffering. The low threshold, the weakest in the nation, actually invites lawsuits even after all medical bills are paid. That is why lawyer/legislators oppose the reform. urrently, for example, New Jersey motorists sue for pain and suffering three times as often as motorists in neighboring Pennsylvania -and New Jersey insurance companies pay out twice as much for an average claim. One result, as your editorial notes, is that New Jersey motorists pay the highest insurance rates in the nation, and more and more are electing to risk driving with no insurance at all because they can't or won't pay the stiff premiums. The reform the lawyer/legislators are blocking is literally driving some New Jersey motorists to break the law - while all New Jersey drivers pay for the dubious privilege of providing substantial benefits to lawyers, who receive approximately one-third of the total dollar amount in claims awarded by the state. Reform is desperately needed, and the independent insurance agents of New Jersey have accordingly made it their number one priority. JEROME M. GREENBERG President, Independent Insurance Agents of New Jersey Highland Park, N.J., June 8, 1983

1148-> DISCOVER THE CULTURE THAT STIRS LATIN HEARTS
To the Editor: It was hardly surprising that the reference to the ''genius of Uruguay'' produced so little impression on the U.S. diplomats attending the 1967 Conference of American Presidents in Punta del Este that James W. Symington describes (Op-Ed Sept. 23). Like the work of so many of his fellow Latin American ''pensadores,'' Jose Enrique Rodo's ''Ariel'' is extremely difficult to come by in English translation in this country. The New York Public Library, for example, has no copy. Among a population well known for its linguistic insularity, this situation has played no small role in insuring that even well-educated North Americans have remained ignorant ''of the cultural lessons that stir (their) neighbors' hearts.'' The reasons for this ignorance, unfortunately, go beyond mere ''apathy'' or a North American preoccupation with ''substance'' and ''action.'' All too often, even among specialists in this country, there has been a thinly veiled feeling of cultural superiority which has made it difficult for them to take Latin Americans seriously. Instead, in seeking to explain the continent, they have preferred to pick and choose from among Latin Americans who support their own notions of Latin American reality. The lack of familiarity with Rodo's ''Ariel,'' which Symington describes, is one small example of this. Rodo's vision of Latin America's future and critical references to the U.S. have ensured that his work would stimulate little interest in this country. Given this history of disregard, it is difficult to be optimistic about the ability of the Kissinger panel to listen to those opinions that do not coincide with North American visions of what should prevail in Central America. ROGER GOCKING Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Sept. 26, 1983 The writer is professor of history and political science at Mercy College.

1149-> PASTRY CHEFS WHO BREACH A MALE BASTION
LORI LECKMAN remembers vividly the sights and scents in the Los Angeles bakery where she worked one summer vacation while in high school. ''I served customers up front and later helped out in the back,'' she recalls. ''But the chef never let me touch the ovens. He told me that women could never be bakers - too tough for them.'' Today, 29-year-old Miss Leckman, a small, vivacious woman with the biceps of a gymnast, begins her work day while the rest of New York sleeps. She is chief baker at Mangia, a year-and-a-half-old carryout shop on West 56th Street in Manhattan. Among her specialties are light and crusty buttermilk scones, grainy bran-honey-apple muffins, spicy ginger oatmeal cookies, moist and spongy lemon-Madeira cake, hazelnut praline cake and something called rock cake, which resembles a huge, rough-textured cookie that is bursting with butter, lemon, raisins, eggs, flour, nutmeg and sugar. Miss Leckman is one of a growing cadre of women in New York making reputations as professional bakers, a field that has traditionally been dominated by men - big, brawny men at that. The women include the wholesalers Judy Arbaugh and Joy Jackson, who turn out a flourless chocolate truffle cake that is so rich it should be subject to the windfall profits tax; the pastry chef Nancy Zinman, who specializes in cumulous French and Italian pastries; Helen Oless, the bread wizard of Bloomingdale's, and Kerrie Buitrago of Pierrot, who rolls some of the most buttery and flaky croissants in New York. Not only are they undaunted by the often grueling physical aspect of baking, they revel in it. ''It's great, I don't have to go to a gymnasium to stay in shape,'' said Miss Leckman, who arrives at the shop at 2:30 A.M. to start doughs for breads and pastries. Her chores can include lugging around 100-pound sacks of flour, grappling with heavy equipment and lifting mixing bowls ''that are so big I can sit inside them.'' These women also say they are attracted by the softer, esthetic side of their work, the unabashed showmanship that desserts allow. ''There are so many possibilities,'' Miss Leckman said. ''Once you get to know your ingredients well, you take it from there - it's like painting.'' Some of them note that their entry into professional baking is, in a sense, the completion of a sociological circle. In earlier generations, when women rarely worked outside the home, skill in the tricky field of baking was a means of distinguishing oneself. ''Then in the 60's we got away from all that,'' Miss Arbaugh said. ''It was considered demeaning. Now we are getting back into it because it is a respectable business.'' Miss Leckman is a painter by training, and it was the art world, not the culinary scene, that lured her to New York five years ago. At first she supported herself washing dishes in a SoHo restaurant, and she eventually began helping the cook bake bran muffins, blueberry muffins and scones for Sunday brunch. Over the next year she baked at several other restaurants and shops in town, all the while studying books on the subject. A year and a half ago she joined a group of young entrepreneurs who opened Mangia. She credits Patrick Markby, the British-born chef at the shop, for teaching her about authen-tic English scones, muffins and pound cakes. ''Our buttermilk scones are light and not sweet; Americans are used to heavy ones,'' Miss Leckman said. ''We also use a lot of lemon peel and raisins in baking, like the English.'' For Miss Arbaugh, 37, a former saleswoman for Working Woman magazine, professional baking is a return to an earlier flirtation with the business. In the late 1970's, when she lived in La Jolla, Calif., she earned extra money selling her homemade apricot log, carrot cake and deep dish apple pie to restaurants and shops in town. ''The way I was doing it, there wasn't enough money to make much of a living,'' she said, ''But it convinced me that there could be a real business in it someday.'' That day came two years ago, when she got together with a longtime friend, Joy Jackson, and founded Food of Our Own Design, a wholesale bakery and catering company. ''Foood,'' as they call it, still makes Miss Arbaugh's original California recipes as well as a no-nonsense ''chocolate-chocolate chip cake'' and a dense, chewy, chocolate and walnut brownie pie. Their New York clients include Balducci's, Fay & Allen's Food Halls, the Washington Market in TriBeCa, the Ambassador Grill on First Avenue, Scramble's Cafe in SoHo and six Bloomingdale's stores in the city and suburbs. The business, which began in their home kitchens (Miss Arbaugh's Manhattan apartment and Mrs. Jackson's in Maplewood, N.J.), has been working out of rented professional facilities in Bloomfield, N.J. Later the partners plan to open a retail-wholesale shop in nearby South Orange. When Nancy Zinman applied to Bennington College more than a decade ago, one of the questions on the application concerned what she wanted to do after college. ''Make pastry,'' she wrote. It has been a long road to a career as a professional pastry chef for Miss Zinman, including two and a half years of training in France and more than three years in New York looking for the right job. There is no question that she has made it, as evidenced by the plaudits she is receiving from customers at Castellano, a 10-monthold restaurant on West 55th Street specializing in northern Italian cuisine. After college Miss Zinman returned to her avocational interest in baking and enrolled in various cooking classes at the New York City Technical College in Brooklyn. While there she met Jean Drouant, the director of L'Ecole Hoteliere du Paris, who invited her to study at the school for a year. After finishing the program -she was one of two non-French students there - the next step was a school-sponsored apprenticeship at a restaurant. ''The professor in charge told me that I would never get a stage (apprenticeship) in a city restuarant; that was just for men,'' Miss Zinman recalled. ''He said I would have to look out in the suburbs or in the country.'' She found work in the kitchen of the Paris Hilton performing a variety of jobs, then later worked at several restaurants in Paris and its environs (including Le Camelia in Bougival outside Paris, where she worked under the chef, Jean Delaveyne, and the restaurant Chiberta in the city). ''Everywhere I worked there was an all-male brigade de cuisine, and everyone was wonderfully supportive and helpful to me,'' Miss Zinman said. Upon returning to New York she worked briefly at La Gauloise, then left for another position that never materialized. After a frustrating job search she took a job as a legal secretary for a year. ''I don't want to sound bitter and blame my own problems on discrimination,'' Miss Zinman explained. ''But the reality is that there still are real barriers to women in many restaurants.'' As pastry chef at Castellano Miss Zinman is garnering a reputation for her execution of a traditional northern Italian dessert called ''tira mi su,'' an exquisite combination of ladyfingers soaked in espresso coffee, mascarpone cheese, egg yolks, heavy cream, sugar and egg whites. She makes an exceptionally flaky and light mille-feuille, filled with a combination of pastry cream and whipped cream, as well as a delectable apple tart with a base of ladyfingers and pastry cream. Kerrie Buitrago, a former international investment banker with a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University and currently an information officer with the Common Market office in New York, says the best investment she ever made was a six-month apprenticeship at the renowned patisserie in Brussels called Wittamer in 1979 and 1980. Her serious interest in baking began a decade earlier when she was working in Paris. ''I went over to the Cordon Bleu one day to watch a demonstration,'' Mrs. Buitrago recalls. ''It was so wonderful that I quit my job the next day and enrolled for a yearlong course there.'' In 1979 she took a leave of absence from her job and returned again to Europe, this time with her husband, Oscar, to apprentice at Wittamer -Mr. Buitrago specialized in sorbets and she concentrated on pastries. After that they studied for several months at the Ecole Lenotre near Paris. Last June the Buitragos opened their own shop, called Pierrot, at 108 Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. They make all sorts of unstintingly rich tarts and cakes, baroque desserts in shapes of everything from the Brooklyn Bridge to Rolls-Royces, muffins, cookies and their exemplary croissants, both regular and with ham and cheese. Mr. Buitrago, a native Colombian and former photographer, specializes in sorbets in such flavors such as guanabana, mango, passion fruit, peach, cassis, bitter orange and apple. Mrs. Buitrago, who has been working for the Common Market office by day and at the shop at night and on weekends, will leave her office job later this month to join her husband full time. Like many other female bakers in New York, Helen Oless came to her profession from another field - in her case academia. Although she has a master's degree from New York University in American fiction and has worked as a paralegal, ''I just couldn't get baking out of my system,'' she said. As a baker at Bloomingdale's, Miss Oless is putting into practice years of experimentation with flours, yeasts and baking techniques to create delicious country-style brick-oven breads, the pride of the store's bakeshop. They include rye, whole wheat, white, currant-whole wheat, walnut-whole wheat as well as more exotic combinations such as an aromatic cheddar cheese-caraway and prosciutto-olive. She also makes the shop's popular miniature pizzas. ''I prefer baking to other kinds of cooking because it requires a great deal of technical skill,'' Miss Oless explained. ''In cooking you can make a mistake and sometimes cover it up; baking is not so forgiving.'' While she says the brick oven at the store is an advantage in making exceptional breads, the real secret is proper blending of grains and flours. ''I blend flours for most of my breads,'' she said. She explained that, for example, mixing whole-wheat flour with a little semolina yields a crunchier crust and a chewy interior. ''There are so many variables in bread making - the weather, temperature, the oven,'' Miss Oless said. ''But then there always is the wonderful experience of seeing it come out of the oven. You can't beat it.'' Nancy Zinman's Mille-Feuille Puff pastry (see recipe) 1/2 quart pastry cream (see recipe) 1 quart heavy cream, stiffly whipped Powdered sugar. 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1/3 of the puff pastry to measure approximately 12 inches by 18 inches. Gently lift the dough (it is easier if you drape it over a rolling pin when picking up) and lay it on a 12-by-18-inch baking sheet. Prick dough evenly with a fork. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until pastry is puffed and golden brown. Repeat procedure twice to make a total of three pastry sheets. 3. When all the pastry sheets are cool, trim the edges with a serrated knife to form three equal rectangles. Reserve trimmings. 4. Fold pastry cream with the whipped cream. Spread a thick layer over the bottom sheet. Place second pastry sheet over the cream mixture. Apply second layer of cream. 5. Cover with top sheet of pastry. Dust the top with sifted powdered sugar. You may caramelize the sugar by heating a hot metal object such as a potato masher and pressing it over the sugar. Brush sides of the mille-feuilles with crumbled trimmings from the puff pastry sheets. Puff Pastry 1 pound all-purpose flour (preferably Hecker's) 1 cup cold water, approximately 1 teaspoon salt 1 pound sweet butter, cold, cut in small pieces. 1. Put all but 1/3 cup flour on a work table and form into a ring. Place water and salt in the center. With the tips of your fingers, gradually incorporate the flour. Do not overwork. Form into a round - the dough should be smooth, moist and not overly sticky. Slash the top of the dough ball in a cross shape. Cover dough in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. 2. Mix remaining flour with butter. Work to smooth mass and form it into an eight-inch square, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 3. On a lightly floured working surface, roll out the dough to form a large clover shape. Place butter-flour mixture in the center of the dough. 4. Close flaps of dough and completely enclose the butter. Roll out the dough to a rectangular shape approximately 18 inches by 8 inches. The rectangle should be rolled out vertically away from you. Always roll from the center out, never backtracking with the rolling pin. Leave the edges a little thicker than the center to avoid breaking dough. After rolling, gently flatten the edges with the rolling pin. 5. Brush off excess flour and fold dough in thirds like a letter (top toward you, bottom over top) to complete first turn. Rotate the the dough clock-wise one quarter turn - at this point it should resemble a book with its binding on the left. 6. Gently roll it out again on a floured surface into an 18-by-8-inch rectangle as in step 4. Brush off excess flour and, once again, fold the dough in thirds as with a letter, top down and bottom up. This completes the second turn. Cover the dough and refrigerate for one hour. 7. Execute third and fourth turns exactly as was done with the first two. Refrigerate for another hour. Then make the 5th and 6th turns and refrigerate for another hour, or overnight. Yield: Enough puff pastry for one mille-feuille. Pastry Cream 1 quart whole milk 1 vanilla bean 10 egg yolks 1/2 pound granulated sugar 5 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour, sifted. 1. Rinse a deep pot with cold water (to prevent scorching), and pour in milk and vanilla and bring to a boil. 2. While milk is heating, whisk egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl until the combination is thick enough to form ribbons. Gradually mix in the flour. 3. Pour hot milk into the egg mixture very gradually - one ladle at a time - while whisking vigorously. Pour mixture back into the pot and cook over medium flame while whisking constantly until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Let it boil for 30 seconds, while whisking, to cook the flour. Transfer mixture to a stainless-steel bowl. Dot with butter to avoid formation of a crust. Yield: Approximately 1 1/4 quarts. NOTE: This is more than you need for the mille-feuille; excess can be saved and served with fresh fruit or in other desserts. Lori Leckman's Buttermilk Scones 1 pound all-purpose flour 5 teaspoons baking powder 2 ounces sugar 4 ounces sweet butter 3 whole eggs 5 ounces golden raisins 1/2 pint buttermilk (or enough to form a sticky but manageable dough). 1. Preheat oven to 420 degrees. 2. Mix flour with baking powder and sugar. Rub butter into the flour until it forms the texture of fine bread crumbs (this can be done in a food processor). 3. Beat eggs lightly. Place dry mixture in a mixing bowl and form a well in the center. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the eggs and 1/4 pint of buttermilk into the well. Add the raisins and mix thoroughly, adding more buttermilk if needed to form a sticky but homogenous dough that can be kneaded lightly on a floured board. 4. Knead dough lightly on a floured board, and roll out into a rectangular shape, approximately one-inch thick. Cut dough into roughly two-inch squares. Place squares on a well-greased baking sheet. Brush with remaining eggs and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until scones have puffed and are golden. Yield: 16 scones. Lori Leckman's Lemon-Madeira Cake 1 pound sweet butter at room temperature 1 pound sugar 1 pound all purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 8 eggs 6 ounces ground almonds 14 ounces diced candy lemon peel. The zest of three lemons. 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. 2. Line two loaf pans (approximately 10-inch-by-6-inch) with buttered baking parchment, and dust with flour. 3. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Combine flour and baking powder. 4. Beat the eggs. Add eggs gradually to the butter, beating well with a wooden spoon. If the mixture shows signs of curdling add a spoonful of flour. 5. Gradually mix in the almonds, lemon peel and lemon zests. The mixture may require a little milk to reach the ''dropping'' consistency: that is, thick enough to require a sharp tap to dislodge it from the spoon, but not light enough to pour. 6. Distribute batter evenly in the loaf pans - it should reach a little more than half way up the sides. Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees, then reduce oven to 300 and bake another hour. Test by inserting a warm knife in the center: if it comes out clean the cake is done. Let the cake cool in its tin. Yield: Two cakes approximately one pound each NOTE: The name Madeira is believed to come from the wine that traditionally accompanied this cake in Britain. There is no Madeira in the batter) Helen Oless's Cheddar Cheese Ring 1 package dry yeast 1 cup milk, heated 2 tablespoons butter, unsalted 3 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons sugar 4 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded (1 pound of cheddar cheese) 2 cups semolina flour 2 tablespoons caraway seeds, braised 2 teaspoons dry mustard 5 cups bread flour, (approximately) 2 cups warm water Cornmeal for baking sheets. 1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. 2. In a saucepan, heat milk, butter, salt and sugar to lukewarm. Add 4 cups of cheese gradually and stir until cheese and butter are melted. Pour into a large bowl and when lukewarm, add yeast mixture and 2 cups semolina flour. 3. Work the mixture with a wire whisk until smooth then add caraway seeds and dry mustard. Mix. Batter will begin to thicken and take on a grainy look. Add 1/2 cup of cheese. Mix. 4. Add 3 cups bread flour, gradually, stirring with a wooden spoon. Dough will be sticky. 5. Turn out on a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, gradually adding remaining 2 cups of flour. 6. If you want to make a braided loaf, shape the dough into 3 balls of equal size and roll out each ball into an 8-inch-by-12-inch rectangle with rolling pin. Starting two inches from the top, slice each rectangle into three equal-size strips. Loosely braid the strips on each rectangle. Pinch the braided ends and form a circle with each piece of dough by connecting it with the other end. This will yield three rings. (If you want a nonbraided ring, simply roll out the three equal-size dough balls into loaves in the shape of French bread, and make a ring.) Make slashes on top of the ring with a sharp knife. 7. Place dough rings on baking sheets dusted with cornmeal and let them rise until doubled. 8. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour, until a hollow sound is heard when the bottom is tapped. Yield: 3 large rings Optional: Egg wash (1 whole egg and 1 teaspoon milk) and grated cheddar cheese sprinkled on top of wash. Helen Oless's Proscuitto and Olive Braid 1 tablespoon cornmeal for baking sheet 6 ounces slab prosciutto, finely chopped (least salty variety) 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 garlic clove, mashed in salt 2 teaspoons fennel seed, bruised in mortar and pestle 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground 1 1/ 4 cups hot (about 110 degrees) tap water 1 tablespoon dry yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup vegetable shortening (at room temperature) 1 1/2 dozen Greek olives, chopped 3 cups bread flour (approximately). 1. Sprinkle baking sheet, approximately 9 1/2 by 11 inches, with cornmeal and set aside. 2. Saute prosciutto in 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in garlic, fennel seed and pepper. Pour contents into large mixing bowl. 3. Add hot water, yeast and sugar. 4. Stir in 1 cup all-purpose flour. Beat in 1/4 cup shortening. Add chopped olives. 5. Add 1 more cup of all-purpose flour. Dough will be sticky at this point. Scrape out onto work surface. 6. Gradually knead in 3 cups of bread flour until dough is smooth and elastic. 7. Cover with inverted bowl; rest for 10 minutes. 8. Roll dough into a 10-inch-by-15-inch rectangle. Cut three strips in rectangle, leaving about 1/2 inch at end uncut. Braid and pinch bottom end. 9. Place on prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm place until light and doubled in volume - about one hour. When doubled, bake in preheated 400-degree oven until hollow sound is heard when loaf is tapped on bottom. Yield: 1 large loaf. Kerrie Buitrago's Fruit Tart Pastry shell: 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 stick sweet butter 4 tablespoons sugar 1 egg. 1. Put all ingredients in a mixing bowl. Using your fingers, combine all ingredients and form into a ball. Do not overwork. Refrigerate one hour before using. 2. Line a 9-inch pastry shell with the dough. Place a layer of parchment paper over it and weight with dried beans, rice or lentils. 3. Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 400-degree oven or until crust is golden. Let cool. Pastry cream: 4 1/4 cups milk 1 1/4 cup sugar 10 egg yolks 1/2 cup cornstarch 1 vanilla bean, scraped 3 tablespoons Grand Marnier or Kirsch 1/3 cup heavy cream whipped Variety of fruits in season Apricot jam for glaze. 1. Bring milk to boil. 2. Beat egg yolks and sugar together in a separate bowl. Add cornstarch while whisking. Pour a ladle of warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, return to heat and add vanilla. Whisk until just thick. Cool. 3. Mix pastry cream with Grand Marnier or Kirsch to taste and lighten with a small amount of whipped cream. 4. Fill prebaked tart shell with pastry cream. 5. Arrange a variety of fresh fruits on top, such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, bananas, cantaloupe, black and green grapes, kiwi slices. Fill in with mandarin oranges and lichee nuts for color contrast 6. Glaze with hot apricot jam. Mix 1/4 cup of jam with two tablespoons of water to thin out if necessary, so that the coating is very light and not coagulated. Brush on apricot coating with a pastry brush. Yield: Enough for two 9-inch tarts. Judy Arbaugh's and Joy Jackson's Brownie Pie 2 cups chocolate chips 3 tablespoons sweet butter 3 eggs 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon instant coffee 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 pound walnut pieces. 1.

1151-> DANCE: MOLISSA FENLEY IN BROOKLYN
Molissa Fenley and Dancers, along with Anthony Davis's music ensemble, Episteme, blew into town Thursday night with a potent, exciting new entry in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's ''Next Wave'' series. For the first time, the true sense of experiment in this experimental series made itself felt with an awesome strangeness. Even the ''decor'' was different, consisting of packets of small prints by the Italian painter Francesco Clemente and given to each member of the public to examine at will. More to the point, ''Hemispheres,'' this world premiere choreographed by Miss Fenley with a commissioned turbulent score by Mr. Davis, does not look, or rather, feel, like anything else on the dance scene. It rushes in headlong, blasts forth with Miss Fenley's brand of high- speed cannonball dancing, yet its dynamics of the future are permeated with a disturbingly effective primal resonance. Miss Fenley and her dancers, Silvia Martins and Scottie Mirviss, are very visibly high-tech barefoot performers. How astonishing then that the sensation of the instant is of a tribal explosion, of ritual release, with each woman recalling the sacrificial virgin of another staged pagan rite, Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' ''Hemispheres'' is tough, cerebral in its formal patterns and yet emotional. A program note in a souvenir book indicates that Miss Fenley called her piece ''Hemispheres'' because her governing concept involved the intuitive and the analytical areas of the brain - perhaps as a metaphor for the dominant aspects of her work in general. In addition, her familiarity with Africa, where her father was in government service, and her declared interest in third-world dance traditions, suggested another meaning to ''Hemispheres.'' In Mr. Davis, an avant-garde composer whose interest in African and Asian musical traditions is combined with classical training and experiments with ''new jazz,'' Miss Fenley has met her perfect collaborator. For this listener, this first encounter with Mr. Davis's music was a revelation, its range of insistent drive and tender lushness also largely responsible for the success of the evening. If one wondered how the intuitive and the analytical would come through onstage, one realized suddenly that it did - that the dichotomy sensed between the ritual release and the structural precision of the choreography was exactly what one felt throughout the hourlong piece. Let it be said that Mr. Clemente plays no part in this. His participation, on the conceptual level, is not a joke. The ''visual element'' in this production (collaboration with composers and painters is the theme of the ''Next Wave'' series) consists of four different sets of prints. The dominant imagery is of dismembered parts of the body and garotted or bound figures. All well and good. Mr. Clemente's springboard is said to have been a remark about dancers by the French writer Ferdinand Celine - accused of Fascism for his World War II activities. The point is that Mr. Clemente (who lives in Rome, New York and Madras) is not an American, and his fearful dark world has no point in common with the brave new world in this very American piece by an American choreographer and American composer. Even their Africanisms and Bali-isms are pure American avant-garde. ''Hemispheres'' has three parts, typical Fenley in its concerto structure, with a quiet movement at the center. Mr. Davis, at the piano, and his ensemble conducted by Dwight Andrews, offers an overture, ''Esu at the Crossroads,'' stormy in its pianism and then calm. The three dancers, clad in tuniclike sashed dresses by the fashion designer Rei Kawabuo, from his ''Comme Les Gar,cons'' line, begin ''Before Borders'' to a musical section called ''Little Richard's New Wave.'' No, begin is not the word. When Miss Fenley shoots across the academy's Lepercq Space, arms frenetically vibrating and bent, followed by the two other dancers, each on her own trajectory, the impact is a shock. The pace continues, headlong flings into movement, occasional coming together in unison. Each section has a movement theme. ''Telepathy,'' set to ''Esu, the Trickster,'' is the second part of the first section. The three dancers intersect, add kicks and turns to their leaps and hops, almost submerged by the sound until everything suddenly winds down. ''Eidetic Body,'' to ''A Walk Through the Shadow,'' starts in silence. The dancers, now in tights, focus on a distortion of the head-down Cave Turn from Martha Graham's idiom. It is all intense, meshing with the extraordinary dreamlike texture of the music. Miss Fenley, frankly, is less of an adagio than an allegro choregrapher. ''Projection,'' to ''Clonetics,'' brings her back home. The insistent repetitive drive of the music here follows the amazing dancers, whipping around like crazy.

1154-> FIRST ATLANTA TO BUY STAKE IN SOUTHEAST
The Southeast Banking Corporation of Miami said today that the First Atlanta Corporation would invest $40 million in Southeast. Officials said the move could foreshadow a merger of the two banks. Under terms of the accord, First Atlanta, the second-largest bank in Georgia, with assets of $5.1 billion, will purchase 740,471 shares of Southeast common stock for $27 a share. The stock closed today at $23.375, unchanged, on the Big Board. In addition, Southeast, the second- largest bank group in Florida, with assets of $8.3 billion, will sell First Atlanta $10 million in newly issued nonvoting adjustable-rate preferred stock with an initial dividend of 10.5 percent, and $10 million of nonvoting convertible preferred stock with a 10 percent dividend rate. Altogether, the deal would give First Atlanta a 4.8 percent interest in Southeast. That stake could be expanded once interstate bank ownership is authorized. Currently Federal law prohibits such mergers, except in states with laws authorizing ownership of banks in specific other states. Charles Zwick, Southeast's chairman and chief executive, did not rule out the possibility of a merger between the two banks. ''There is no commitment,'' he said today. ''On the other hand, we're interested in having an investor who is compatible and could be part of a larger system.'' Florida's Governor, Robert Graham, is advocating a bill for the 1984 legislative session that would allow mergers among banks in 10 southeastern states. Bankers in Georgia have expressed support for the plan. As part of today's agreement, Southeast will buy up to $20 million of First Atlanta's common stock during a two-year period beginning next October. First Atlanta will sell the shares at market price or 110 percent of book value, whichever is greater.

1155-> HOUSES OF WORSHIP TAKE LANDMARK FIGHT TO ALBANY
Religious groups and preservationists, who have clashed for years over giving landmark status to houses of worship in Manhattan, have taken their battle to Albany for the first time. At issue is a proposal by the city's religious establishment to exempt houses of worship across the state from local preservation laws. The measure was introduced in the Senate and Assembly two weeks ago. Mayor Koch, the Municipal Arts Society and the New York Conservancy oppose the measure, and prominent preservationists, including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, have written and telephoned legislators to denounce it as a threat to the city's architectural treasures. It is defended by the New York Board of Rabbis, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the Council of Churches. They say landmark laws infringe on religious freedom and have been used unfairly against houses of worship. The proposal would have its major impact in Manhattan. St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church is planning a 59-story office complex over a church building on Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, and other congregations have sought to demolish houses of worship and use the valuable land to put up apartment buildings. The Landmarks Preservation Commission contends that the law has been applied fairly in the city and that there are adequate procedures to relieve houses of worship of hardships caused by landmark designation. ''If this were proposed in Paris, Rome, London or Dublin, places with significant church architecture, the general population would be outraged,'' said Kent L. Barwick, chairman of the commission. ''It would be laughed out of town.'' In her letter to legislators, Mrs. Onassis, a member of the Municipal Art Society, said that it was ''hard to accept'' that society ''should at this moment consciously decide to destroy the heritage that our parents and grandparents have passed to us.'' ''Churches are probably the greatest preservationists of any institution in the world,'' said the Rev. N.J. L'Heureux Jr., who proposed the changes on behalf of the Committee of Religious Leaders, a group representing major faiths in New York City. ''Congregations are the best ones to decide the future of their property.'' The measure would exempt houses of worship, and religiously owned property from the jurisdiction of about 100 separate local landmark procedures across the state, unless the religious organizations voluntarily elected to be covered. They could withdraw their participation at any time. A proposed amendment would limit the exemption to noncommercial properties. The sponsors of the measure, Senator John E. Flynn, Republican of Yonkers, and Assembly majority leader Daniel B. Walsh, Democrat of Franklinville, both called for public hearings before the measure was put to a vote. THey said they doubted the measure would be taken up during the current legislative session. ''It's a red-hot issue,'' Senator Flynn said. ''I am getting a ton of mail from both sides. I am still weighing the pros and cons.'' Assemblyman Walsh said that he believed the houses of worship had a ''legitimate purpose,'' but that they had to convince his colleagues that they were not trying ''to circumvent preservation law'' for ''secular purposes.'' Governor Cuomo, asked about the measure at a news conference today, said he had not yet seen the bill. Religious groups cite a series of cases in which they say the Landmarks Preservation Commission blocked or threatened to block the demolition of deteriorated church buildings. Church Challenging Designation The St. Paul and St. Andrew United Methodist Church at 86th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan, for example, is in court challenging a landmark designation they say blocked the demolition of a building of ''questionable archtectural value.'' As a result, Mr. L'Heureux said, the congregation must now spend half its budget on building maintenance and heating. The congregation had planned to replace the church with a 12-story apartment building containing a new church, he said. In a statement of purpose, the proposed legislation declares that ''the preservation of the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion without governmental interference is a value of greater importance than the otherwise laudable goal of preservation of objects and buildings of 'special character.' '' Courts Have Upheld Status On the other side, preservationists say that the Court of Appeals has upheld the right of the commission to designate houses of worship as landmarks, and that the United States Supreme Court has upheld preservation regulations as a valid form of regulation. Laurie Beckelman, executive director of the New York Conservancy, said houses of worship have a right to ask for a hardship exemptions. She noted that a developer who purchased the Mount Neboh Synagogue on West 79th Street recently won such a hardship exemption. The demolition of the synagoguge has been stopped, as the developer, Alexander Edelman, negotiates over a possible sale of the air rights over the structure. ''We feel that the law is basically effective,'' she said. The main issue in the bill, she said, was valuable real estate below 96th Street in Manhattan. ''It is a big real estate bill,'' she said.

1157-> BUSINESS UPDATE; SMOKING WITHOUT THE LABEL
In a year marked by sharp price increases, fierce marketing and sagging sales, the tobacco industry has, perhaps unwillingly, made one thing clear: Consumers are more than happy to pay less for cigarettes. Liggett & Myers's generic cigarettes, priced up to 20 cents below Marlboro, Camel and other top brands, nearly tripled their 1 percent market share in the three months after the Government doubled its Federal excise tax last Jan. 1 to 16 cents a pack. Liggett estimates that sales of no-name smokes will bring in $325 million in their fourth year on the market, up from $140 million in 1982. The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has seen similar success with Century, a lower-priced entry introduced last July that has snatched an average share of 0.85 percent in the markets where it is sold. ''It has significantly outperformed expectations,'' said James W. Johnston, executive vice president. Such growth, however, will add little life to the stagnant tobbaco business: Analysts expect industrywide sales to decline by as much as 4 percent this year. Rather, analysts say, Century and the generics have caused only a shift of buyer preferences. Reynolds's gain with Century was largely offset when smokers of Winston, another Reynolds brand, moved to generic brands, said Diana Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''The price sensitivity among consumers is focused among the older, middle-aged person - who is a Winston smoker,'' she said. Experts also wonder whether the off-price boom has peaked. James P. Dowd, Liggett's director of marketing for generic labels, said, ''We don't see any signs of it slackening off.'' But analysts say they believe that sales of the plain cigarettes have flattened at about 2.5 percent of the total market since the first quarter. ''When you come out of a recession, people tend to go back to brand names,'' said John Maxwell Jr., an analyst with Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb Inc.

1159-> PHILIP GLASS'S 'PHOTOGRAPHER'
-heralded Next Wave Festival formally opened last night with a new version of a mixed-media piece called ''The Photographer: Far from the Truth.'' This 80-minute play-concert- dance amalgam, which will run at the Academy through next weekend, is a complex, fascinating, striking collaboration. And even if it finally falls short of complete success, its earnest intentions and sometimes dazzling realization make it worth both seeing and admiring. The piece was conceived by Rob Malasch of the Netherlands in collaboration with the American composer Philip Glass and first presented in Amsterdam last year. A mixed- media musing on the life and work of the pioneering 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge, it consists of a play with incidental music, a piece of abstract music with visual accompaniment and, finally, a dance with music. Mr. Glass was not happy with the Dutch realization, however, and decided to create an almost entirely new piece, retaining only his music and Mr. Malasch's basic scenario. To that end, he and the Brooklyn Academy enlisted Robert Coe to write a new book, David Gordon to choreograph, Santo Loquasto to design and JoAnne Akalaitis, who was once married to Mr. Glass and who is known for her acting and directing with the vanguard theater troupe Mabou Mines, to direct. What is being offered now - as seen at the second preview performance on Wednesday - is a 45-minute play that concentrates on the great melodramatic incident in Muybridge's life: his murder of his wife's lover (who is also the father of a child Muybridge had raised as his own). Then follows a 15-minute piece of music by Mr. Glass played by his ensemble in the pit accompanied by a slide show of Muybridge's photography. Finally, there is a 20-minute dance focused on a woman (Valda Setterfield) who enacts movements captured by Muybridge's figure studies while surrounded by a swirling mass of characters from the drama. To judge from the activities on stage and from the suspiciously copious accompanying documentation - suspicious because one worries about any piece that requires so much explanation - Miss Akalaitis, Mr. Coe and Mr. Glass (and Mr. Malasch, brooding over this production from afar) had several complementary intentions. The ''far from the truth'' subtitle calls into question the seeming verisimilitude of photography, indicating how personal and cultural prejudice can twist the apparently innocent replication of reality. Muybridge's Victorian imagery and sequential motion studies are shown as exhibiting a shadowy area among Victorian kitsch, cliche, dawning modernity and present-day ''process art'' - this last made overt in the striking slide show of Part 2 in which Muybridge's running, leaping figures are set against Mr. Glass's modular, repetitive music. Throughout all three parts, ''The Photographer'' plays with tensions between overstuffed Victorian imagery and attitudes on the one hand, and the ''objective'' implications of photography on the other. These tensions are explored on every level the creators can conceive: riddles repeated over and over as the audience take their seats; shifting combinations of art forms, and constant disruptions of conventional narrative logic by characters who suddenly turn and address the audience directly or who cite tangentially relevant quotations from noted 19th-century authors. The results are constantly interesting on an intellectual level, and sumptuously attractive visually. Mr. Loquasto's sets and costumes - based on the artist Max Ernst's own reinterpretation of the Victorian era - are beautiful, and so is Jennifer Tipton's lighting. The casting is strong, the dancing attractive, the tableaux vivid, and Mr. Glass's fluent score, while one of his lesser efforts, does fit comfortably into this broader mixed- media context. Sometimes, all these elements come together powerfully: The wife's suddenly dispassionate description of Muybridge overcome with extreme emotion when he is acquitted at his murder trial is accompanied by consoling music and huge photographs projected on a scrim of a man's despairing face. Ultimately, however, there seems less here than assaults the ears and eyes. Mr. Glass's simple, mystically compelling music may function better with images that speak mysteriously on their own, free from the excessive intrusion of words and ideas. Robert Wilson, who worked with Mr.Glass in ''Einstein on the Beach,'' can create such mute, compelling illusions. There is no similarly evocative sensibility in this version of ''The Photographer.''

1160-> Marietta to Buy Stock Allied Holds
The Martin Marietta Corporation said it would pay about $280 million for the remaining 20 percent of its stock held by the Allied Corporation, the peacemaker in Marietta's merger battle last year with the Bendix Corporation. The action would return Martin Marietta to the independence it enjoyed before Aug. 25, when Bendix made a surprise offer for the Bethesda-based aerospace conglomerate's stock. Bendix was gobbled up by Allied in the agreement that ended the fight in late September. Martin Marietta said it had filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue 4.65 million shares of stock, and would use the proceeds to buy a like number of its shares from Allied. The action, combined with a previously announced plan to buy back 1.8 million shares from Allied, ''will eliminate Allied's holding in Martin Marietta outstanding shares,'' the company said.

1161-> BUSINESS UPDATE; SHERRY LANSING'S NEW ROLE IN MOVIES
Sherry Lansing caused quite a commotion in Hollywood last December when she abruptly announced plans to quit her $300,000-a-year job as president of 20th Century-Fox Productions. After three years at the helm as the first woman president of a movie studio, she broke away, teamed up with Stanley Jaffe and formed a production group within the Paramount empire. Now, Jaffe-Lansing is putting the final touches on its first film, which it plans to distribute through Paramount by mid-March. ''Racing With the Moon'' stars Sean Penn and Elizabeth McGovern, and according to Miss Lansing it features ''people that you care about.'' Set in 1943, it is the story of two young men who go off to war. ''It takes place at a time when values were simpler,'' Miss Lansing said in a telephone interview from her Los Angeles office. ''It has a romantic element as well as a lot of humor.'' While high-tech chase scenes and adorable otherworldly creatures may be the tickets for success at the box office in recent years, the thinking at Jaffe-Lansing is that moviegoers want films that appeal to the human element, she said. Jaffe-Lansing hopes eventually to maintain a production schedule of five films a year, and romance, emotional conflict and struggles for power are the themes planned for its first releases. It was a power struggle of her own that led to Miss Lansing's departure from 20th Century-Fox, where she and Norman Levy, Fox's president of distribution, frequently disagreed about which films to back. The 39-year-old Miss Lansing said she also enjoys being free of administrative duties. ''I wanted to be more involved in the movie-making process, not an executive with the bureaucratic problems,'' she said. At Jaffee-Lansing, ''I don't have to worry about administrative details. It's a company whose sole purpose is to make movies.'' And so far, at least, Jaffe-Lansing has Paramount's support. ''We have great flexibility and autonomy,'' she said. She declined to comment on the financial backing Paramount is providing Jaffe- Lansing or what kind of success its first film will need at the box office, but added, laughing, ''I think we'll do far better than break even.''

1163-> Topics; Changes of Atmosphere; Senior Campers
Country air, that heady scent of flowers, grass and trees, is a commonplace to those who live in it - and a great treat to those who live with exhaust fumes. It is also a luxury well beyond the reach of many older New Yorkers. There is, however, a program called VASCA - Vacations and Senior Centers Associations - through which more than 9,000 older (55 to 90) adults can have two weeks in the country. VASCA has 17 affiliated camps in the tri-state area; activities range from swimming to crafts to overnight hikes. VASCA fees are low, and the organization adjusts them according to one's ability to pay. But some people can't afford to pay anything at all, which is why VASCA provides ''scholarships'' for those who need them. Donations for these scholarships are tax-deductible, and can be sent to VASCA, 225 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10003.

1164-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; A Rare Sound on the IRT
The midday service on the Lexington Avenue is sluggish. The young people congregating on the uptown platform at 77th Street and Lexington Avenue are noisy. On the downtown platform the other day, a tall, thin, blond man began playing the violin. Suddenly those on the uptown platform, including the normally raucous teens, fell silent. The young man played Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto and, as new passengers joined the waiting crowd, he interspersed little historical comments about the composer and the composition. When he finished, there was a round of applause. Then a downtown train howled in, and the violinist was lost to view.

1167-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; THE VICTORY LAPS OF JOHNNY BENCH
E ighteen years ago last month, Johnny Lee Bench gave the valedictory speech at his high school graduation in Binger, Okla., a town of 600. The speech was titled ''How the Youth of Today Will Be the Leaders of the Next Generation.'' It is just the kind of subject on which 17-year-old kids are expert. Bench, the Cincinnati Reds' veteran player, recalled the speech the other day with slightly arched eyebrows. ''I don't remember much about it,'' said Bench. ''Oh, there were some vague thoughts about making the world a better place to live. But I was a naive kid, and I only had thoughts of becoming a major league baseball player.'' He smiled. ''I decided very early to back out on the Presidency.'' Bench, as the sporting public knows, succeeded mightily in his ambition. He became one of the best catchers in the history of the game. The Reds are making their last swing of the season through the Eastern cities of the National League, and it is Johnny Bench's last swing as a player. Last night's game against the Mets was his last in New York. He has announced his retirement at the end of the season. And now, in the 16th and final season of his major league career, he is taking curtain calls, perhaps not with the frequency of Sarah Bernhardt's numerous farewell tours, but receiving, one might imagine, similar warmth and admiration. Before Wednesday night's game at Shea Stadium, a decorous ceremony was held at home plate, and Tom Seaver, a friend, a onetime teammate and a once and current opponent, presented him a ''token of appreciation'' from the Mets, a diamond-studded pendant in the shape of his uniform number, 5. The fans and the players on both teams stood and applauded generously. And Bench, at age 35, doffed his long-billed red cap and waved, revealing a still-young-looking face and, as he turned, a small bald patch on the back of his head. After another night in New York, the club would be on to Philadelphia, where some of Bench's teammates with the old Big Red Machine now play: Pete Rose, Tony Perez, Joe Morgan. ''I know the Phillies are planning a little something too,'' said Bench. Last week, he was honored along with Carl Yastrzemski, also retiring, at the All-Star Game in Chicago. Many of the old Hall-of-Famers were there, and at a luncheon they gave Bench a standing ovation. Bill Dickey, the former star catcher of the Yankees, came by and said to Bench, ''Joining the rest of us, huh?'' ''That,'' Bench recalled later, ''was a real thrill.'' On Sept. 17, the Reds are playing Houston at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, and it has been designated Johnny Bench night. Bench is scheduled to be behind the plate, for old times' sake. Two years ago, after 13 seasons as a catcher, he told the club that he could no longer play there. He would be available for third base and first base. Backstopping had taken a terrible toll on his body: His knees ached, his back ached, his shoulders and throwing elbow ached. ''I've been shot up with so many painkillers to stay in the lineup,'' he said, ''that if I were a race horse I'd be illegal.'' He had caught 100 games or more for 13 straight seasons, a major league record he shares with Dickey. For his last game as a catcher, he'll have to warm up his body and especially his arm for two weeks in advance, he said wryly. ''Nowadays,'' he added, thinking of trying to throw out stealers, ''all the base runners wear track shoes.'' And now his playing career is nearly ended, a career that was begun and nurtured in the tiny town of Binger. ''You start out not being able to go to the proms or buzzing around all day in a car, because you've got to be on the field, practicing, practicing,'' Bench recalled, ''and dreaming about becoming Mickey Mantle or Willie Mays.'' Indeed, he became a national sports figure, much as they had. But what about the valediction, about becoming a leader of the next generation? Did he think he had fulfilled some of that promise as a baseball player? ''When people heard I was retiring,'' said Bench, ''I got a lot of letters from kids and adults saying, 'Thanks.' They said I had helped them get over some humps, especially after I had had surgery for lung cancer in 1972. I was only 25 years old. And I came back to play regularly. I think that gave some people encouragement, seeing that if I didn't let something like that get me down - well, too down, because I was scared -then they wouldn't let whatever problems they were having keep them down, either. ''I'm glad I could help some people. I feel good about being in some way a part of their lives. ''Of course, I didn't make everyone happy - like some of the catchers in the Reds' minor league system.'' He also learned about the fickleness of the fans. He recalls a period in 1971 when he was being booed regularly by the hometown crowds. During one particular game, which his father was attending, Bench struck out twice and popped up in his first three times at bat. ''The boos for me were rocking the stadium,'' recalls Bench. ''My last time up, I got two strikes on me. Boo. Boo. Then I hit a home run to win the game. My dad jumped up and shouted, 'Boo now, you bums.' They didn't hear him. They were cheering.'' Bench laughed. ''But I have no complaints,'' he said. ''I've gotten all the recognition anyone could dream for, and I've got financial security and helped my parents and went around the world and met all kinds of people. I've even been invited to the White House. That was 1969, and I met Mr. Nixon.'' How had he felt about that? ''Great,'' Bench said. ''It was almost as good as meeting Willie Mays.''

1168-> ENVOYS PREDICT IRAQ WILL USE FRENCH JETS
Western and some third-world diplomats here predict that Iraq will eventually use its new French-built warplanes in the war against Iran, but will probably not use them against the huge Iranian oil terminal at Kharg Island. The Teheran Government has repeatedly said an attack on Kharg Island, in the Persian Gulf, would lead to an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-sixth of the West's oil supplies pass. Although military experts have expressed doubts about the feasibility of a blockade, the Iranian threat has caused concern in Washington, Europe and Japan. In a series of interviews this week, diplomats suggested that for the time being the Iraqis intended to use their five Super Etendard fighter-bombers, delivered early last month, as weapons of psychological warfare. The Super Etendards are equipped with radar- evading Exocet missiles like those used to devastating effect against British ships in the war in the Falkland Islands last year. 'One of Their Aims' A third-world envoy said, ''Already those planes have accomplished one of their aims by drawing attention back to the war, which the world tends to forget about, and to the Iraqi point of view.'' Several sources, including one Iraqi official, argued that the delivery of the Super Etendards had helped to create the climate that prompted the United Nations Security Council to debate and pass Resolution 540, calling for free passage in the Gulf and its adjacent waterways, including the Shatt al Arab, which links the Iraqi port of Basra to the Gulf. Iraq accepted the resolution, approved on Oct. 31, but Iran, which controls the Gulf, rejected it. Baghdad is trying to capitalize on the renewed attention focused on the war through a diplomatic offensive that included a four-week visit to the United States between mid-August and mid- September by Ismat Kittani, a former President of the United Nations General Assembly. Other Iraqi representatives are in the process of visiting Vienna, London, Bonn, Rome and other European capitals. Weapons of Persuasion Iraq is also believed to have used the warplanes as a lever in trying to persuade the country's two chief financial backers, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to increase their subsidies for the war effort. But the Super Etendards cannot be held in reserve permanently, in the view of diplomats and other analysts in Baghdad. The longer they are kept out of action, the argument runs, the less credible a threat they constitute, so most analysts expect them to be used toward the end of this year or in the first months of 1984. Military experts in Iraq and in Western Europe say they believe the Exocets are ill suited for an attack on the oil terminal because they are designed to skim the surface of the water, thus avoiding radar detection. It would be difficult to launch them in such a way that they would hit oil tanks surrounded by barbed wire and other, smaller structures. One attache said such a use would ''be a total waste, with only the slimmest chance of knocking the terminal out of action.'' Instead, it is theorized in Baghdad, the Iraqis will use the Exocets, when the time comes, either against Iranian warships or against tankers tied up at Kharg Island, or both. Iraqi Terminal Needs Repairs In the first case, the object would be to prevent the Iranian Navy from interfering with Iraqi efforts to repair and use their own main oil terminal, which lies at the head of the Gulf off Basra. That terminal was put out of action in the earliest days of the three-year-old war - the most serious loss suffered by the Iraqis since hostilities began. In the second case, the object would be to frighten foreign ship owners and their insurers away from Kharg Island, thus denying to the Iranians the sizable oil revenues that make it possible for them to continue the grinding struggle. But there are some analysts here who doubt the ability of Iraqi pilots to operate the complex weapons systems of the Super Etendards successfully. In the war to date, one foreign military officer said recently, the pilots have been ''generally unimpressive,'' tending among other things to release their bombs at much too high an altitude to achieve accuracy. President Saddam Hussein promised a group of French journalists on Oct. 13 that Iraq would make prudent use of its new weapons. He and his colleagues on the ruling Revolutionary Command Council can clearly not afford to lose two or three of their five planes; that would constitute a tremendous blow to troop and civilian morale.

1169-> FOOD NOTES
Sodium and Convenience People who eat mostly processed, convenience and fast foods are the ones most likely to consume too much salt, which has been linked to high blood pressure. These products usually contain more sodium than unprocessed equivalents, either as seasoning or in such additives as the preservatives sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or sodium sorbate. A handy reference to the amount of sodium in brand-name foods on supermarket shelves or in fast-food restaurants, where sodium content may not be labeled, has just been published. ''Salt: The Brand Name Guide to Sodium Content,'' by Dr. Michael Jacobson, Bonnie F. Liebman and Greg Moyer of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (Workman Publishing, $5.95), contains 160 pages of listings of foods, including fast foods, with the sodium content per serving. Scanning the listings leads to the conclusion that the more processing involved, the more sodium there will be. For example, Old Fashioned Quaker Oats is said to contain 1 milligram of sodium before cooking, while Instant Quaker Oatmeal is listed at 281 milligrams. Dorman's natural Swiss cheese has 111 milligrams of sodium in a 1.5-ounce serving, but the same company's pasteurized process Swiss has 582 milligrams of sodium. A Swanson frozen turkey dinner contains 1,200 milligrams of sodium, about the same as a McDonald's Quarter-Pounder with cheese. According to the book, the National Academy of Sciences considers 1,100 to 3,300 milligrams of sodium to be the ''reasonable'' daily intake for Americans, although other studies have shown that as little as 200 milligrams are sufficient. Most Americans consume 4,000 to 6,000 milligrams a day. The listings are useful for anyone trying to restrict sodium in the diet. Not only foods, but over-the-counter drugs, bottled waters and municipal water supplies were surveyed. Those concerned about sodium might not want to drink the water in Long Beach, Calif., or El Paso, Tex., where an eight-ounce glass contains close to 30 milligrams of sodium (the book lists 1.4 milligrams for New York City). The book also explains how reducing sugar can help cut down on salt in processed foods. In many instances heavily sweetened foods also require more salt to keep the flavor in balance. In describing a test conducted by the Gwaltney division of Smithfield Foods, a manufacturer of processed meats, the book says that when the sugar was reduced in one line of products ''the amount of salt needed to assure a pleasing taste fell markedly.'' There are guidelines for reducing salt, explanations of the importance of potassium in the diet and the role of exercise and a discussion of salt substitutes. However, the relevance of the small section of low-sodium recipes is questionable. People who regularly eat processed and fast foods might be more interested in how to make a quick low-sodium tomato sauce than the one in the book, which calls for 15 ingredients and requires an hour to prepare. They also might be less motivated to attempt the veal scaloppine made with white miso or tamari than one without these ingredients. A collection of easy low-salt recipes made with ingredients that are all readily available in supermarkets, not health-food stores, would have made more sense. Newman's Own Charities Paul Newman, who began selling a line of salad dressings and spaghetti sauces under the label Newman's Own about a year ago, is contributing the first year's entire profit, $500,000, to 17 charities across the country. The list is diverse, with most of the organizations selected by Mr. Newman. Actors Studio, WNET-TV (Channel 13), Yale University, the Lahey Clinic and the Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center are some of them. The New York Foundling Hospital just received a check for $100,000. The police department and library in Westport, Conn., where Mr. Newman lives and the food company is situated, also are beneficiaries. ''Sometimes other people suggest charities,'' said Ursula Hotchner, whose husband, the author A. E. Hotchner, founded the company with Mr. Newman and is its vice president. ''For example,'' she said, ''a photographer did a job for us without pay, so we gave money to one of his favorite charities.'' From the beginning, the plan was to disperse the profits this way, but no one connected with the company anticipated its success. The products are now being sold in Australia, New Zealand and England; Japan is next on the list. Charities in those countries will benefit from their sales of Newman's Own. A hamburger sauce is to go on the market soon. Next year Mr. Newman hopes to give away $1 million. Food for Scholarships This Sunday you may be able to pick up some caviar or foie gras, also to benefit a cause. Proceeds from the Holiday Food and Wine Bazaar being held from noon to 4 P.M. at Lavin's Restaurant, 23 West 39th Street, will go to the scholarship fund of Les Dames d'Escoffier, an organization of professional women in the food and wine field. The scholarship recipients are usually aspiring young chefs. For the sale, the tables at Lavin's will be stacked with homemade preserves, relishes, cakes, pies and breads. Cookware, cookbooks, gift baskets and specialty foods will also be sold. A celebrity auction will start at 3 P.M., with Jacques Pepin, Patricia McCann and Gael Greene as auctioneers. Elegant lunches, brunches and dinners, an opportunity to spend a day in the kitchen of the ''21'' Club, a tin of caviar, a whole Alaskan salmon, a fresh goose and a special-occasion dinner at Mr. Pepin's home in Connecticut are among the items up for bid. There will be a $3 general admission charge. Buffalo Sausage Last month, when six Napa Valley wine producers held a luncheon and reception at An American Place, Larry Forgione's new restaurant at 979 Lexington Avenue (70th Street), one of the hors d'oeuvres that had to be replenished constantly was the buffalo sausage. Slices dipped in crumbs and fried were irresistible. This sausage is available to home cooks by mail. It is made of buffalo meat and country bacon, seasoned with juniper berries and herbs and smoked. Eight large sausages, totaling two and three-quarters pounds, cost $16.50; there is a $4 handling charge in all states but Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin. Order from American Spoon Foods, 411 East Lake Street, Petoskey, Mich., 49770; telephone 616-347-9030. The sausages are shipped frozen; if they are thawed when received, they should be refrigerated and used within a week. Mr. Forgione removes the casing from the sausage and slices it. He dips the slices consecutively in flour, beaten egg diluted with a little water and a mixture of fine white bread crumbs and ground almonds. He deep-fries the coated slices until golden. Justin Rashid, who owns American Spoon Foods, said the sausages are quite lean, so they should be cooked quickly; overcooking will dry them out. FOODNOTES BOX - C4 BUYS OF THE WEEK POTATOES BANANAS

1170-> HOW TO SEE SOCIAL CUTS AS PENNY ANTE SAVING
One of our most enduring fables portrays the United States as throwing away untold billions of dollars each year on bloated and useless social programs. If we only trimmed the fat, so the notion goes, we could increase defense spending and maybe even balance the budget in the bargain. The Reagan Administration has eagerly promoted this updated version of the old ''guns or butter'' debate. The problem is, attacking social programs to make a dent in the deficit is like asking an unemployed auto worker to offset his lost income by canceling his magazine subscriptions. Last year, the nation's general tax revenues amounted to $365 billion. Of that, $215 billion was gobbled up by a swollen military budget. Only $67 billion was directed to social programs. In other words, defense expenditures soaked up 59 percent of the nation's general revenues, while social programs accounted for 18 percent - a better than 3 to 1 ratio. And this year the disparity will be even greater. Those who complain that America spends vast sums on social programs generally include Social Security spending in the figures. But Social Security is a special case. None of its expenditures - $212 billion last year - come from general tax revenues; none may be diverted to any use other than those for which the fund was created. The rest of our social programs - Food Stamps, Medicaid, education and the like - absorb a comparatively modest $67 billion in Federal tax dollars. These programs cost far less than many people imagine. For example, food stamps last year cost $11 billion; Aid to Families with Dependent Children (''welfare''), $7.7 billion; senior citizen centers, $250 million; nutrition services for the aging, $250 million; summer lunches for children, $99 million; supplemental food for women, infants and children, $1.16 billion. With a deficit running at $207 billion, it is simply impossible to cut these programs deeply enough to matter; even their total elimination would still leave America with a $140 billion deficit - four times what is was only four years ago. Yet the Administration continues to press for further cuts in these and similar programs - yielding trivial fiscal savings at enormous human cost. To illustrate how little such cutbacks yield, consider the budget in terms of a single dollar, rather than billions of dollars. Last year, then, the deficit was $207. Among its many cutbacks, the Administration dropped 200,000 mentally handicapped men and women from the Supplementary Security Income rolls and told them to go get jobs. That saved the nation 21 cents. The Administration ended summer lunches for half a million children, netting the Government 6 cents. Then it cut breakfasts, too, saving 12 more cents. When the Administration ended a little program that taught ghetto children about proper foods, diet and nutrition, it saved half a penny. And when it ended food stamps for more than a million families, that saved the nation all of $1.25. By contrast, waste and mismanagement in the defense budget went unchecked, eating up $36 of that $207 by the Administration's own admission. The General Accounting Office names an even higher figure - $50 or more. But even the lower of these sums could have funded Medicaid, food stamps, ''welfare'' and any half dozen smaller programs at far more generous levels than they now enjoy. Obviously, the Reagan Administration uses a double standard in these matters. Every instance of petty fraud uncovered in social programs inspires outraged cries for further cutbacks. Yet the Administration calmly tolerates gross abuses in military spending. Unquestionably, abuses have occurred in social programs, and we must do everything we can to safeguard against them. But the fact remains that many of these programs provide necessities like food and health care to people who can't afford them. Moreover, these programs should not be viewed as charity. Job training, medical care and the entire array of social programs vilified by the Administration are nothing less than investments in human capital. Their goal is the long-term creation of economic wealth by creating a healthy, alert and competent population. When social spending is cut, we all foot the bill. For example, by closing senior centers, the Administration saves a few hundred dollars per person. But the closings force many seniors into nursing homes prematurely - and this can cost Medicaid as much as $30,000 a year. Similarly, stinting on food for pregnant women yields short-term savings. But the result is sicklier babies and bigger hospital bills - and, in some cases, lifetimes of disability and dependence on the public dole. Portraying itself in January 1981 as a jealous guardian of the national purse-strings, the new Administration proclaimed its improbable vision of lower taxes, more defense spending and a balanced budget - to be achieved, largely, by cutting the ''frills'' in social spending. Three years later, we are saddled instead with a deficit so vast that it threatens to strangle America's long- awaited recovery. It is imperative that the nation address this crucial problem. But if we really intend to reduce the deficit, further cutbacks in social spending are not a serious option.

1174-> EUROPEAN CHIEFS ARE DEADLOCKED ON MARKET ISSUE
The summit meeting of European Economic Community leaders ended today in a deadlock over proposed cuts in farm spending and Britain's demand for a $1 billion budget refund. The breakdown leaves the 10-nation Common Market on the brink of bankruptcy and facing the most difficult political crisis of its 26-year history, according to officials here. The debate over farm spending is of crucial importance to American agricultural interests because the Common Market's farm policy encourages European farmers to produce more food than the community needs by guaranteeing them high prices and keeping out inexpensive imports. Persistent Trade Tensions With the help of big community-financed subsidies, these surpluses are then sold on the world market, where, successive American administrations have complained, they compete unfairly with American agricultural exports. This results in persistent trade tensions with the United States and threats of ''subsidy wars.'' The deadlock also apparently means that Spain and Portugal face a new delay in winning membership, since the community's leaders failed to set a firm date for the conclusion of entry negotiations. Spain and Portugal had the support of most Common Market members in seeking such a deadline. Announcing the deadlock, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece, who was the chairman of the meeting, termed the summit meeting a failure and said the heads of government could not agree on anything despite six months of preparatory work. The Common Market's members are Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg. ''We were not able to reach a unanimous position on a single issue,'' Mr. Papandreou said at a closing news conference. For the first time, the semiannual summit meeting ended without a statement about the E.E.C.'s future and without an agreed-on position on international political problems. ''Nothing was settled at this summit,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said. ''We are coming up to a crisis.'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany called the failure ''a bitter setback'' and said the community was now ''at a critical turning point.'' He said a special emergency summit meeting might be needed next year. The breakdown came after three days of intense talks in a windowless yellow stucco palace. This morning, Mrs. Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand of France, the principal antagonists, tried to find a compromise at a private breakfast meeting after it became clear that the leaders were unlikely to agree on the agricultural and financial reforms they promised at their last meeting. As a result of the deadlock, the Common Market is likely to run out of funds next year, forcing it to cut back spending on agriculture and other programs intended to promote European economic unification. Spending to Overtake Revenues The threat of bankruptcy now hangs over the Common Market because Britain, with varying degrees of support from West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, refuses to vote for extra funds unless all 10 members agree to cut subsidies to inefficient farmers and divide the budget more equitably. As a result, current spending programs are expected to soon overtake revenues. ''You have got to let the cash run out to make people understand the need for fundamental change,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, who was clearly in a combative mood. She added that ''I am not prepared to stagger on from compromise to compromise.'' She has had to contend with widespread British sentiment against the E.E.C. Even President Mitterrand, who has been a strong supporter of Europe's expensive agricultural policy in the past, said the community must ''get rid of waste'' and impose ''more discipline'' on farm spending. 900,000 Tons of Surplus Butter The Common Market nations currently spend about two-thirds of their annual $25 billion budget subsidizing farmers, and total agricultural spending has risen nearly 30 percent this year alone. As a result, the community holds 900,000 tons of surplus butter and more than a million tons of unwanted powdered milk, plus large surpluses of beef and wine. Britain and West Germany want to curb these surpluses, arguing that this would leave the Common Market with more money for technological research, aid to areas of high unemployment and other policies to end the industrial recession. Britain is also demanding a new system for dividing up the budget. Although one of the poorer of the 10 members, Britain now pays in $2 billion more a year than it gets back in subsidies for its farmers and in other community payments. British spokesmen repeatedly said Mrs. Thatcher and her allies considered their position impregnable because, unless they hand over additional tax receipts, community spending on existing programs will exceed income next year. But they prefer a settlement that would give the community more money to spend on policies they support.

1175-> MCGUIRE LEAVING POLICE POST DEC. 31
Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire, who said several weeks that he was planning to step down, announced yesterday that he would resign Dec. 31. Mr. McGuire, a 46-year-old lawyer, said at a noon news conference at City Hall that he would become chairman and chief executive officer of Pinkerton's Inc., the world's largest private security company with 29,000 uniformed employees. He has been Commissioner for six years, the longest term since Lewis J. Valentine held the post, from 1934 to 1945. The Commissioner said his decision had been prompted only by a desire to return to the private sector and to ease the pressures on his family. ''I love this job,'' Mr. McGuire said, ''butI have to get on with my life.'' Mr. McGuire, who will receive no pension credit in the $82,000-a-year post, had long told friends that he would leave the office to better provide for his wife, Joan, and two children, Brendan, 7, and Kristina, 4. Koch Calls Him the Best Mayor Koch accepted the resignation with ''great regret but also with understanding.'' As he had done before, he praised Mr. McGuire as the best Commissioner in the history of the department. ''He has given six years of sustained first-rate performance,'' Mr. Koch said. The Mayor said he would look for an individual of ''total professionalism'' and ''total integrity'' to replace Mr. McGuire. He emphasized that the choice would be his alone, that he would not set up a screening panel and that the selection would be made without regard for race, religion or any other special consideration. The advent of a new police commissioner traditionally brings about broad changes in the high command of the department, which now consists of 23,540 police personnel and nearly 8,000 civilian employees. All deputy commissioners and all police supervisors over the Civil Service rank of captain serve at the pleasure of the Commissioner. When Mr. McGuire took over in January 1978, he replaced all but one of the department's six highest-ranking chiefs. Asked to Stay Last Year The announcement of Mr. McGuire's resignation - made shortly after the Commissioner told his top deputies and commanders - ended speculation over when he would leave office. Mr. McGuire said several weeks ago that he intended to leave at the end of the year or next summer. Last year, when it appeared that Mayor Koch would be successful in his bid to be governor, Mr. McGuire had indicated privately he would resign at the end of 1982. But when Mr. Koch lost in the Democratic primary to Mario Cuomo, Mr. McGuire, at the Mayor's request, stayed on. Mr. McGuire said that the job at Pinkerton's, which was acquired last January by American Brands Inc., had not been solicited by him and that it was ''a substantial offer.'' Earlier, there had been speculation that Mr. McGuire would return to private law practice after his resignation. The Commissioner was accompanied at the news conference by his wife, his daughter, who tugged at his leg as he spoke, and his father, James, a retired deputy chief inspector. Two hours earlier, the department's top officials were assembled in a conference room at Police Headquarters. When Mr. McGuire announced he was leaving, one commander said later: ''There was stunned silence. We all knew he was going to leave sometime, maybe soon, but we didn't expect to hear it then.'' James B. Meehan, the transit police chief, who reports to the Police Commissioner, said that when the brief session ended, ''Everyone rose and applauded him.''

1176-> IT'S A BUSY TIME FOR DODY GOODMAN
Dody Goodman was wandering through Bloomingdale's the other day, sporting pink ruffles and her usual tousled mop of strawberry-blond ringlets, when she was recognized by several fans as Mary Hartman's mother, Martha Shumway. But when Miss Goodman paused to chat, her fans were stunned. ''They said, 'Oh my goodness, you really talk that way!' '' Miss Goodman reports. Indeed, the voice that has long been Miss Goodman's trademark - once described as sounding ''like a Tweetie Pie cartoon bird strangling on peanut butter'' - is her very own. She has a sweet face and a Kewpie-doll mouth, but her tongue seems to be made of rubber. All her life, Miss Goodman says, ''I just opened my mouth and people laughed.'' These days they are laughing at Miss Goodman as Essie Miller, the warm-hearted, blithely inconsistent mother in ''Ah, Wilderness!'' Eugene O'Neill's only major comedy, ''Ah, Wilderness!'' stars Philip Bosco as Essie's benevolent husband and Scott Burkholder as the son struggling with adolescent angst over the dual torments of love and the meaning of life. Drawing Warmest Response O'Neill himself viewed the son as the play's pivotal role, although that of the father is substantive enough to have attracted such stars as Lionel Barrymore, George M. Cohan and Will Rogers. But it is Miss Goodman who draws the evening's warmest response in the current production, which is presented by the Roundabout Theater Company at the Haft Theater, 227 West 27th Street (box office, 242-7800), where it will run through July 24. A veteran of stage and film as well as television, Miss Goodman can also be seen in the movie ''Max Dugan Returns,'' as the batty nextdoor neighbor who monitors the odd goings-on at Marsha Mason's house. Miss Goodman's next film will be a Disney production called ''Splash,'' in which she plays a secretary in a produce company owned by a man who falls in love with a mermaid. The role has the usual Goodman twist: the secretary is not quite herself, having recently been struck in the head by lightning. Miss Goodman won't tell how old she is - ''I'm afraid they'll put me out to pasture'' - but she first became a television favorite more than 25 years ago, when she began to appear on Jack Paar's ''Tonight'' show. ''I was the epitome of the dumb blonde,'' she recalls. Playing Mary's Mother Her next major television breakthrough did not come until 1976, when Miss Goodman was cast as the mother on ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.'' As Martha, she talked to plants, had an affair with a man who crashed through her kitchen roof from his hot-air balloon and adored her husband, George, until he underwent plastic surgery (he had fallen into a vat of Rustoleum) and came out looking like Tab Hunter, at which point Martha was so upset by his handsomeness that she began to flee his advances. Like many of her characters, whose lives are often governed by bizarre chance, Miss Goodman never intended to become a comedienne. She started as a dancer, and after graduating from high school in Columbus, Ohio, she headed for New York, where her first job was in the corps de ballet at the Radio City Music Hall. It was Imogene Coca, with whom Miss Goodman appeared in a Dallas production of ''Wonderful Town,'' who encouraged her to take up comedy, and soon Miss Goodman was doing sketches on the Martha Raye and Sid Caesar television shows. Many years later, Norman Lear - the co-producer, co-writer and director of the Martha Raye show - would remember Miss Goodman's work and cast her in ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.'' Acting Through Doing ''I took a few acting classes, but most of my acting has come about through doing,'' Miss Goodman says. She has also written a play, ''Mourning in a Funny Hat,'' about her mother's reaction to her father's death, which starred Shirley Booth in a touring-company production. Although she has worked steadily through the years, often in summer stock, Miss Goodman seems undismayed that her name has never become a household word. ''Everyone hopes for that big starring Broadway hit, that big movie or successful TV series,'' she acknowledges. ''I think I might have dwelt on that a little, but if it's not in the offing, you go back to work and do the things that are offered to you. The most important thing is to keep working. And when it comes down to the line, the other things have been satisfying, and you learned from them all, and the pressure hasn't been that great.'' She thinks about this a minute, and then brightens, looking as daftly optimistic as one of her characters. ''And as long as you're still alive,'' she adds cherrily, ''there's always the hope that something might come along.''

1178-> VILLANOVA DEFEATS IRISH, 61-55
Ed Pinckney scored 19 points, and John Pinone 16 tonight as Villanova rallied from an 8-point deficit in the second half to beat Notre Dame, 61-55. The Wildcats (8-2), winners of six straight games, took the lead for the first time on a dunk by Pinckney to make it 45-43 with 7:30 to play. The score was then tied four times, the last at 51-all. Pinckney hit two free throws with 2:31 to play to put Villanova ahead for good, 53-51. Notre Dame (6-5) led, 27-25, at halftime and took its early secondhalf lead on the shooting of John Paxson, who scored 8 of the team's first 14 points in the second half. Paxson finished with 18 points but committed two costly turnovers in the game's final 2:30. Penn 70, Yale 65 PHILADELPHIA (UPI) - Karl Racine sank two free throws with 18 seconds left to clinch the victory for Penn in an Ivy League opener. Racine, who scored 7 points, connected on a 60-foot jumper as the buzzer sounded to end the first half, cutting Yale's lead to 34-33. Penn then surged to a 53-45 lead, only to have Yale cut the lead to 66-65 when Butch Graves hit a short jumper with 25 seconds left. On the inbounds play, Graves, who had 20 points, committed his fifth personal foul, sending Racine to the line for the clinching foul shots. Princeton 75, Brown 63 PRINCETON, N.J. (UPI) - A senior forward, Gordon Enderle, scored a game-high 22 points to lead the Tigers to the Ivy League victory. Enderle hit two baskets as Princeton (7-5) ran off 11 straight points in a six-minute span of the second half after Brown (2-8) had closed to 1 point with 6:29 left. Florida Southern 70 Columbia 63 Special to the New York Times LAKELAND, Fla. - Travis Stanley made eight straight foul shots in the final two minutes tonight to lead the Moccasins into the final round of the Juice Bowl Tournament in George Jenkins Fieldhouse. They will meet Hofstra, an 82-67 winner over George Washington. Florida Southern, which finished second in the nation among Division II schools last season, led by 58-49 with 4:40 to play. Columbia scored 10 of the next 14 points to close to 62-59 with 1:56 left, but Stanley's foul shooting stopped the rally. Stanley led all scorers with 20 points. Moses Johnson had 17 for the Moccasins (9-5), while Richie Gordon and Eric Clarke had 13 apiece for the Lions (2-7).

1179-> TV: ETHNICITY CROPS UP IN TWO CRIME SHOWS
Prime time on NBC tonight is taken up largely by two ''pilots,'' which, in these cases, is a euphemism for two aborted series. At 9 P.M. on WNBC-Channel 4, it's ''O'Malley,'' starring Mickey Rooney as a comical private detective, Irish obviously. At 10 P.M., it's ''Inspector Perez,'' starring Jose Perez as a humorous New York City policeman, Puerto Rican obviously, on loan to San Francisco. Despite their differing heritage, these two characters bear a family relationship to the many other ethnic policemen who have proved popular on television; O'Malley and Perez were evidently conceived in response to the season's taste for ethnicity. ''O'Malley'' was not available for review, but I did screen ''Inspector Perez,'' and I am moved to say a few words over the departed. To borrow one of the show's running gags about the inspector, ''He don't look like no cop.'' No, Perez the actor is little and softlooking, with a thick mustache that doesn't interfere with his boyish grin. And Perez the inspector doesn't act much like a cop, at any rate not a made-for-television cop. He lives with his mother, who sends him off to work with hefty sandwiches and who writes him mysterious notes. His driving would be catastrophic in a car chase. Although he practices judo now and then, his strength as a policeman lies in a concern for others that he says he picked up along with much else in New York's Spanish Harlem and that translates into people trusting him. He is the sort of detective who pauses in the middle of an interrogation to inquire about a witness's pet dog. One thing he does have in common with some other television cops is an apartment that is clearly not affordable on a policeman's salary. Since Perez is honesty itself, I deduce that his mother has money in the bank. In sum, Perez the actor makes the inspector a likable little fellow in a low-key way, easy to be around. Despite the mod leather coat he dashes about in, he's thoroughly wholesome. One assumes that at some stage in the production of this show, NBC's market researchers discovered that a little Puerto Rican cop, no matter how likable, just wouldn't fly. Part of the problem may be the likability; the producers try to squeeze a bit too much sweetness out of their star, instead of trusting him to let it flow naturally. But neither the amiable presence of Jose Perez nor the teasing banter with his captain, energetically played by Dana Elcar, could have done much for his cause in the executive suite once this pilot was shown. The plot is an exercise in psychobabble about a young man who kills beautiful Chinese girls because a beautiful Chinese girl betrayed him in Vietnam. As the police psychiatrist observes sensibly, ''It's a little kinky, isn't it?'' So, here we have a central character who one might have lived comfortably with for a season or two, killed off before his primetime. He deserved better. Inspector Perez, it was good meeting you; rest in peace. As for you, Perez the actor, hope to see you around.

1180-> Spatial Relations
A new satellite-borne telescope recently fixed on the bright star Vega and made a startling discovery: The star is encircled by a cloud of matter that may be a solar system. That's a nudge toward supposing we may not be the universe's only focus of life. If life evolved once, here on Earth, presumably it can evolve elsewhere, given enough suitable niches such as water-laden planets. But no other solar systems can be seen by earthbound telescopes peering through the fog of the Earth's atmosphere. That the satellite-borne tele- scope should stumble on one just in checking its instruments is a rebuke to the skeptics. If Vega, one of the Sun's closest neighbors, has planets, probably so do many of the galaxy's hundred billion stars. At least some should be hospitable to the evolution of life. But Vega, say astronomers, is only one billion years old, a quarter of Earth's age and probably too young to have life-bearing planets. That telescope, with its infrared eye, should quit checking out the starlets of the firmament and look for older stars with longer tales to tell.

1181-> Your Money; A Tax Shelter For Employees
THE name may not have a comfortable or familiar ring, but 401(K) plans have become one of the most talked-about subjects in employeebenefit circles these days. As a result, these plans - a type of savings plan that allows workers to shelter income from taxes - have been adopted recently at many companies. The programs, often referred to as salary reduction plans, derive their name from Section 401(K) of the Internal Revenue Code, which became effective in 1978. But it was not until last year that they began to get widespread attention from the corporate community. This followed the issuance by the Internal Revenue Service of proposed regulations in November 1981, and an announcement in February 1982 that these early proposals could be used by companies considering setting up such a plan. In contrast to other popular retirement savings plans, the employee cannot set one up on his own: they are available to individuals only when their employer participates. If a 401(K) program is established, workers can defer part of their salary every year, up to a maximum of $30,000, and place it in a company profit-sharing or savings plan. The money they save is pretax, rather than after-tax, dollars. ''Retirement planning is a three-legged stool,'' said Joel Levy, a partner of Coopers & Lybrand, a certified public accounting firm. ''There is the company retirement program, Social Security and personal savings. The 401(K) plans were designed to encourage personal savings.'' The basic appeal of this kind of program, usually offered through payroll deduction, is that employees do not pay current income taxes or Social Security taxes on money paid into the plan. That is because the compensation - whether it is a bonus or regular salary - is deferred on a tax-sheltered basis so that it can accumulate until the employee leaves the company or retires. In a typical situation, a company might establish a program allowing employees to contribute up to 6 percent of their base pay. The advantage of saving with pretax dollars, as opposed to after-tax dollars in a standard thrift plan, is demonstrated in this example provided by Howard V. Sontag of Buck Consultants, a benefit consulting firm: A married New York State resident with four exemptions and an annual salary of $24,000, or $2,000 a month, has monthly withholding of $275 for Federal income tax, $105 for New York State tax and $134 for Social Security. If he or she contributes 6 percent of salary to a standard profit-sharing or retirement plan, the deduction would be $120. Net take-home pay, therefore, would amount to $1,366. Using a 401(K) plan, however, net take-home would be higher. The 6 percent contribution would reduce the employee's gross salary for tax purposes to $1,880. This lower base, in turn, would reduce the monthly deduction for Federal income tax to $245; the New York State tax to $93, and Social Security to $126. The result: take-home pay of $1,416, or $50 more each month than under the standard plan. In many of these plans, moreover, the employer will contribute 50 percent of an employee's contribution to a specified maximum. Thus the employee's account is augmented, while the employer gains by providing a high-visibility benefit at a relatively low cost. No employee can save more than $30,000 annually through such a program, however, nor can a corporation pay more than 15 percent of its overall payroll into a 401(K) plan. In addition, the plan must be offered to all employees and cannot discriminate in favor of higher-paid executives. What is more, a worker - if he can afford it -could open a 401(K) plan at work and a separate individual retirement account elsewhere. When an employee leaves a company, he can take his savings without penalty and, under certain conditions, can reduce the tax burden by using the 10-year income averaging method. In contrast, savings accumulated in an I.R.A. cannot be removed before age 59 1/2 without paying a 10 percent penalty and, once removed, are subject to ordinary income taxation. On the down side, participants who remain at their company cannot touch their savings without demonstrating financial hardship. Although this type of hardship has traditionally been defined as including emergency medical expenses, buying a primary residence and financing children's education, the guidelines are still fuzzy enough that many companies are reluctant to set up a plan until the I.R.S. issues final regulations. Such regulations are currently being processed. Still, more and more companies are climbing aboard the bandwagon, according to specialists in the field. And more and more employees - individually or through their unions - who see these plans as a good way to set aside pretax dollars are urging employers to do so.

1183-> NO EXCUSE FOR MISSING TARPAULIN
MIAMI TO their credit, the Jets did not use the absence of a tarpaulin as an alibi. The overnight rain had turned much of the Orange Bowl football field into a rice paddy and the rest into a skating rink. But after the Miami Dolphins qualified yesterday for Super Bowl XVII as the American Conference champion with a 14-0 victory, the Jets did not complain too loudly. ''The only thing I know is the rules,'' Coach Walt Michaels said. ''I can't understand it.'' The constitution of the National Football League requires each team to have a tarpaulin available to protect a field from rain or snow. Perhaps the Jets would have lost yesterday no matter what the condition of the field. As the Jet coaches and players kept saying dutifully, the field was the same for both teams. But that's not the issue. The issue is that the field was inexcusably bad for both teams. Through the years, the N.F.L. staff has prided itself on presenting the best possible field conditions for its postseason games. But the N.F.L. staff was negligent in allowing the Orange Bowl field to be exposed to the steady rain that had been forecast after Thursday's heavy rain. ''As a coach, I'd like ideal conditions,'' Walt Michaels said. ''However, the game of football wasn't made to be played in ideal conditions. It's played in all kinds of weather.'' The game of football, however, especially in the N.F.L., is supposed to be played under the best possible field conditions. And yesterday the best possible field conditions did not exist. If a tarpaulin had been on the field overnight before the rain stopped shortly before game time, then the field at least would have been in the best possible condition. Instead, the field was in the worst possible condition. The Dolphins should be fined by Commissioner Pete Rozelle now, but too late to assure a field in the best posible condition. But ever since the Dolphins began operations in 1966, they have not complied with that N.F.L. rule as if it never rained here. Another reason is that since 1976, the Orange Bowl field has been composed of what is known as Prescription Athletic Turf - six inches of natural grass over 12 inches of sand above two-inch plastic drainpipes over a plastic liner. Three other N.F.L. teams also play on similar fields - the Washington Redskins, San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos. But all four teams have been advised that this turf would be damaged by a tarpaulin. Because rain is supposed to drain quickly from such a surface, the Dolphins have never bothered to purchase a tarpaulin. The Dolphins' answer is that they're not responsible for the protection of the field, that the City of Miami operates the Orange Bowl. ''I'd prefer to play on a dry field,'' Don Shula, the Dolphins' coach said, ''but I don't own the Orange Bowl - ask them.'' That's a copout. The Jets don't own Shea Stadium, but they must supply a tarpaulin. ''After our tarpaulins got torn up from the snow before our last home game this season with Tampa Bay,'' said Tim Davey, director of facilities operations for the Jets, ''the league ordered us to get new tarpaulins in case we had a home game in the playoffs. We had to buy three tarps, each 90 feet by 170 feet, at $4,200 each.'' But somehow the Dolphins have never been required to purchase a tarp for the Orange Bowl. The irony of the tarpaulin controversy is that Al Ward, once the Jets' president and now assistant to the president of the American Conference, was in charge of the preparations for yesterday's game. After a heavy rain Thursday, the Miami weather bureau forecast a 70 percent chance of rain Saturday and a 30 percent chance yesterday. ''They could've trucked in a tarpaulin from somewhere nearby,'' Jim Kensil, the Jets' president, said before yesterday's game. ''We could've brought our own tarps down if we'd known.'' At halftime yesterday, the Hardee County High School band from Wauchula, Fla. was ordered not to march on the field by Don Weiss, the N.F.L.'s executive director. But by then it was as if the Jets' offense also had been ordered not to march on the field. Freeman McNeil couldn't cut, Richard Todd couldn't seem to plant himself before passing and Wesley Walker disappeared. The wide receiver had been the Jets' most effective weapon in their playoff victories in Los Angeles and Cincinnati and he had punctured the Dolphins' defense throughout his Jet career. ''The conditions didn't help,'' Wesley Walker said later, ''but the Dolphins were on the same field we were.'' In his previous 10 games against the Dolphins over five seasons, Wesley Walker had caught 42 passes for 785 yards and 9 touchdowns. In two games during the recent strike-shortened season, he had caught nine passes for 130 yards against the Dolphins; of the seven touchdown passes permitted by the Dolphins in their other 11 games, Wesley Walker had caught three. ''Good football teams with a good wide receiver like Wesley Walker stretch the field,'' Bill Arnsparger, who designs the Dolphin defenses, said last week. ''On defense you have to play the width of the field against everybody. But the good teams make you play the length of the field, too.'' But the mud shortened the length of the field for the Jets yesterday. As the Jets trudged into their locker room, their green jerseys and white pants were almost all smeared and smudged with mud. But not Wesley Walker's uniform. Except for a dirty smear across each knee, his uniform was spotless. He had caught only one pass, for no gain. And he didn't catch that pass until the Jets' next-to-last play late in the last quarter long after the Dolphins had canceled the Jets' trip to the Super Bowl. ''I had more double coverge than I've ever had, they were pressing me coming off the line and then the safety was doubling on me,'' Wesley Walker said later. ''I think I only had four passes thrown to me. One was intercepted, one I caught out of bounds, and two of 'em were thrown right into the defense.'' On a slippery field, a pass receiver is supposed to have the advantage over the defensive backs because he knows where he's going and the defensive backs don't. But it didn't work that way for Wesley Walker yesterday. ''We were trying to get the ball to Lam Jones because they were using single coverage on him,'' Joe Walton, the Jets' offensive coordinator, said later. ''But the Dolphins were doing a good job on him and on the tight end and on the backs. Where are you going to go?'' As it turned out, the Jets are going home now, wondering what might have been if there had been a tarp on the field overnight. Meanwhile, the Dolphins are going to Super Bowl XVII against the Washington Redskins on Sunday at Pasadena, Calif., in the Rose Bowl. Wonder if there's a tarpaulin there?

1184-> Topics; Opening Errors; Busy Schedules
The letter proffering a questionnaire or asking for a credit reference for an acquaintance begins, ''Dear Sir or Madam: I want to thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to ...'' A demeaning suggestion. The schedule runs the person, rather than the other way around. Should anyone with an opinion worth soliciting be accused of stealing time from a little black book? A more flattering opening might at least get the reader through the first paragraph: ''Dear Sir or Madam: I know how very busy you are, and so I'm especially grateful that you should take the time to ...'' Reminding people how very busy they are, however, may be more dangerous than, say, a knowing wink: ''Dear Sir or Madam: I am sure there are 10 or 15 things you'd rather do than fill out the enclosed questionnaire, which 4,000 other Americans have already answered ...'' But why answer questions on which thousands have already bared their souls? The cutest approach may be the convoluted compliment: ''Like you, some of the brightest people we wrote to last month thought they had many better things to do than finish reading this letter, but ...'' Too cute, by half. Let those who compose such letters take a moment from their busy schedules to notice that most people would prefer they get to the point.

1186-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
'Rabbit Town' Honors a Friend M urray Lehrer remembers pink or blue ribbons on lobby mailboxes in Stuyvesant Town. It was the post-World War II baby boom, when young couples flocked to the new 8,732-apartment complex in the former Gashouse District, just above 14th Street from First Avenue to the East River Drive. Mr. Lehrer is the last of its 13 original mail carriers. ''Rabbit Town, it was called,'' he said yesterday with a fond chuckle -as much for the memory of all those children as for the surprise party that 70 residents gave him Saturday at 270 First Avenue, one of the six buildings he served. He is retiring next Saturday after 39 years in postal service, 35 at Stuyvesant Town. From 5 to 10 percent of his original patrons are still on his route. Mr. Lehrer, who lives in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, rises at 4 A.M., walks 10 blocks and then takes two subways to the Stuyvesant postal station. He starts sorting mail at 6 A.M. and delivering at about 9, and is home soon after 3:30. ''He's one of those exemplary individuals,'' said Stephen Joseph, an organizer of the party. ''He's terrific at his job, loves the people, pays your postage due and never asks you for the money.'' Besides an inscribed brass ''Golden Envelope Award'' from his patrons, Mr. Lehrer got retirement letters from some former Stuyvesant Town children.

1187-> Powell Learning Some New Tricks; Ringo Helping Jet Tackle
After four straight seasons in the Pro Bowl, Marvin Powell, who is perhaps the finest offensive lineman in football, has met an equally impressive coach in Jim Ringo, a Hall of Famer. Now the pair is attempting to take Powell to what the player describes as ''a new plane.'' Powell said today that he is going to change the style that has brought him the greatest success of any lineman in the Jets' history. The right tackle, 6 foot 5 inches and 268 pounds, is a spectacular run blocker and a sturdy blocker on pass plays. But Powell said, ''It's coming to the point where defenses were geared to stop me. So it's very important I forget about my ego. In camp, going against Mark Gastineau, I'm going to get beat.'' Gastineau is the all-pro defensive left end. He and Powell confront each other in practice. Now, with Powell's new style, Gastineau knows that he may be off balance. 'A Certain Arrogance' Powell explained that with his old style, his stance telegraphed whether a play would be a pass or a run. If he leaned forward, he was going to explode out to block for a runner. If he was more erect, he was going to stand up and protect the passer. ''I went to Coach Ringo and asked him to reconstruct my pass-set,'' said Powell. ''I always telegraph what I'm going to do and that comes from a certain arrogance I learned at Southern Cal. We used to point to the holes and dare the defense to stop us.'' Ringo, who performed at center for 15 years, including 11 with the Green Bay Packers, talks to Powell about the philosophy of being an offensive lineman. He also offers much more down-to-earth advice, such as, ''If the defense is holding, then punch him, anything to get rid of him.'' But Ringo, in public, downplays the work he is doing with Powell. He admits that he is asking the offensive linemen to change their techniques somewhat, to use more upper-body and arm strength. And he concedes that he is working with Powell on not tipping off the defense. A New Contract With the new technique, Powell's stance looks virtually the same for both run and pass, but he puts his weight on the balls of his feet for the run, and on his heels for the pass. ''What I did in the pros no longer exists. I'm on a different plane now,'' said Powell. That also applies to his salary. It had bothered him so much that he left a recent minicamp until the club agreed to negotiate a new deal. Now, Powell revealed that after renegotiating the contract, he is on a level with the most highly paid offensive linemen in the game, at about $300,000 a year. ''Last year I was the ninth highest-paid Jet. My base salary was $115,000 a year,'' he said. ''I was sure that Klecko was going to sign for more than $350,000,'' Powell said, referring to the star defensive end Joe Klecko. ''But I had won more honors than any Jets lineman in history.'' Powell said his salary is not among the highest in pro football, but with bonus incentives, it could add ''many six figures'' to the deal. Powell credited the club's principal owner, Leon Hess, with helping to create the new deal. But Powell also said of the contract, ''In two years it will be obsolete.'' And then what? he was asked. ''You never know,'' Powell replied. ---- Crutchfield Injures Elbow Dwayne Crutchfield, who last year was twice on the verge of becoming the No.1 fullback until he was injured, suffered an elbow injury during a workout today. The club will not know the seriousness of the injury until X-rays are examined. ... Bruce Harper was cleared to report Wednesday after undergoing his annual cardiovascular examination, a procedure required because he contracted pneumonia several years ago.

1188-> PEKING SAYS IT DOESN'T COVET ANY TERRITORY HELD BY SOVIET
China said today that it had no territorial claims on the Soviet Union and accused the Soviet press of intentionally distorting its stand on their longstanding border dispute. A commentary in an official magazine rejected a Soviet charge that China was reviving old claims to Soviet territory and using the issue to block progress toward better relations. The commentary in World Affairs, quoted by the New China News Agency, said China's stand on the border issue had not changed. The commentary said Peking ''has solemnly declared on many occasions that China has no territorial claims whatsoever on the Soviet Union nor does it demand the return of its territories ceded to czarist Russia under a series of unequal treaties.'' World Affairs said China ''stands for an overall solution to the border issue through peaceful negotiations by taking into consideration the actual conditions and on the basis of the abovementioned treaties.'' Talks Opened Last Year Peking and Moscow opened talks last year on improving relations. The nations have been at odds since they split over ideology two decades ago. Further talks, at the deputy foreign minister level, are to be held in March. The Chinese commentary replied to an article in the Soviet review Novoye Vremya. The Soviet publication said China was stepping up circulation of articles and maps laying claim to disputed border territories and including hostile accusations that the Soviet Union had seized them. The Soviet article suggested Peking was trying to keep the border question alive should it decide to slow moves toward establishing better relations. The Chinese commentary said Novoye Vremya had deliberately linked Chinese historical accounts of the czarist seizure of Chinese land in the last century with current efforts to improve Chinese-Soviet ties ''by way of launching wanton slanderous attacks on China's principled stand on these matters.'' China maintains that 580,000 square miles of its territory are occupied by the Soviet Union under unequal treaties imposed on 19thcentury Manchu emperors.

1189-> THE REGION; High Dioxin Level At Ironbound Site
New tests in Newark, disclosed today, show hazardous levels of dioxin on the approaches to a plant that formerly made Agent Orange. Environmental Commissioner Robert E. Hughey said that samples ranging between 1 and 4 parts per billion of dioxin were found near the entrance to the former Diamond Alkali Company chemical plant in the Ironbound section of Newark. He said that cleaning would begin at the approaches to the Diamond Alkali site early next week. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency considers one part per billion hazardous to human health. Mr. Hughey also announced that about 400 of more than 750 random samples taken within a mile radius of the plant had shown safe levels of less than one part per billion of dioxin, a chemical byproduct in the manufacture of defoliants and bug killers, or no dioxin at all. Results have not been received on the other random samples.

1190-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Between Two Teams
Gary Anderson , who is under contract to two professional football teams, told a Federal court in Houston yesterday that he believed his former agent did not get him the best possible contract when he had him sign with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League early this year. Anderson, a running back, later signed with the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League and is trying to have the court void the contract arranged with Tampa Bay by the former agent, Jerry Argovitz . But the judge, Norman Black , refused to grant Anderson an injunction to void the Bandit contract. The judge said he was distressed that the Chargers were financing the legal battle, and he refused to accept arguments from Anderson's attorneys that Argovitz misrepresented the player. The former Univerity of Arkansas back, who was a first-round draft choice in both leagues, contended that the failure to allow him to play for San Diego would cause him irreparable harm. The judge's ruling was not clear as to whether he could play for the Chargers in an exhibition game tonight. . . . One college football coach, Tom Osborne of Nebraska, said he favors pay for his players, but not quite to the range Anderson has reached. Osborne's figure is $50 a month, as spending money. Players once got $15 a month for incidental spending, but that has since been banned.

1191-> POLICE FIGURES SHOW 37 ARRESTS IN CONCERT VIOLENCE; News Analysis
Preserving order is a police department's basic job. When order breaks down, as it did after last Friday's Diana Ross concert in Central Park, questions arise about what went wrong: Did the police perform as well as they could have? Is the city's Police Department being blamed for events that could not have been anticipated? Was such an event impossible to police? The questions are being asked by many of the police officers assigned to the concert and by many of the victims of an hour-and-ahalf rampage through midtown Manhattan that claimed scores of victims of robbery and assault. Top police officials have described their major problem at the concert as one of deployment -maneuvering their troops rapidly to problem areas outside the park. The reason for this, they say, is that they geared their concert strategy to potential problems within the park - such as the chain snatching and bottle throwing that marred Miss Ross's rain-shortened concert the evening before - not for a rampage through Manhattan's streets. 'Impossible to Anticipate' ''What we didn't anticipate is that a couple of hundred kids were going to leave the park - that had not been our expectation,'' Patrick J. Murphy, the chief of operations and the department's highest ranking uniformed officer, said yesterday. Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire said yesterday that ''it is impossible to anticipate in advance that hundreds of kids would start marauding around midtown.'' The Commissioner made the comment after the swearing in of 1,024 new police officers. Police officials offer two reasons for the failure to anticipate the problem. There had been no similar outpouring from the park in recent years, although, they concede, the police have dealt with problems on a smaller scale around Madison Square Garden after some events. And their network of community-relations and youth officers throughout the city had not come up with any information that disruptive youths had planned to descend on the concert. The police perceived that their great potential problem was the chance of a disturbance within a huge crowd that could include a substantial number of teen-agers who might be drinking alcoholic beverages, taking drugs or be intent on ripping off gold chains and pocketbooks and fading into the bustle of the crowd. Adding to the danger was the park itself, Chief Murphy said. ''It was dark; there were plenty of trees; it was a big expanse,'' he said. The force of 1,150 officers was deployed inside the park rather than on neighboring streets. More than 130 plainclothes anticrime and narcotics police officers were positioned thoughout the crowd and under trees to spot potential troublemakers and to break up quickly any incidents of bottle throwing or theft. When the concert ended with few incidents, the police identified their next key problem as the crowd's exit. About 200 officers were redeployed to nearby subway stations to help ease the crush just as what Chief Murphy estimated as 200 youths tore out of the park. In addition to the 1,150 officers, 250 other officers, including 15 mounted police officers, were called to the scene. The police command post was shifted to Times Square. Several city buses were commandeered by the police, who emptied them of passengers and raced down Broadway. But in the end, Assistant Chief Gerard J. Kerins, who headed the police operation, said the morning after, ''It was like being struck by lightning.'' While he said his force was never out of control, he described the situation as being like ''an infantry being overrun.'' Top police officials maintain that order was restored relatively quickly. ''The police acted professionally during and after the concert,'' Mayor Koch said at the swearing-in ceremony yesterday. ''I believe they should be complimented for containing a volatile situation from completely exploding.'' Attacked at Park Exit To Marvin Roslin, who owns a company that sells advertising for radio stations, this mayoral backing rings hollow. Mr. Roslin was attacked at the park's 69th Street exit and suffered a broken tooth, a blackened eye and bruises over his head and face. ''The clear point is that the response of the police, according to people such as the manager of the Tavern on the Green, was totally inadequate,'' he said. ''The manager said the press got to the tavern before the police did.'' ''For 45 minutes to an hour, it was just crazy,'' said Police Officer Anthony Palma of the 20th Precinct. As two other officers at the precinct station house on the West Side nodded agreement, another officer said, ''All we saw was neighborhood stabilization units, with six months of training.'' The units are made up largely of rookie police officers. ''We didn't see any riot control police,'' the officer said. ''I don't think this was an unpoliceable event,'' said Thomas Reppetto, president of a watchdog group called the Citizens Crime Commission and a former commander of detectives in Chicago. ''I suppose there is such a thing, but I don't think this was one. There probably was some kind of underestimation of what was going to happen because these concerts in Central Park have worked out so well. ''But I don't want to be a Monday morning quarterback. You can't operate on the assumption that something is always going to go wrong because then you have to beef up your strength and those guys have to be given overtime and somehow you come up short. You have to make an estimate of what you're going to need, and the best guide is past experience.'' Internal Investigations In past instances, outbreaks of mayhem have led to internal Police Department investigations and shake-ups, most strikingly after a rampage by teen-agers and an unruly rally by off-duty police officers at the Muhammad Ali-Ken Norton fight at Yankee Stadium in 1976. The incidents led to the retirement from the department of Assistant Chief Anthony V. Bouza, who was in charge of deployment. This time, the department believes an investigation is unnecessary, and many top officers said future events would receive greater protection against similar outbreaks. In the meantime, the post-mortem seems to have been delivered by Chief Murphy to a Florida couple who were attacked in the incidents Friday night. Apologizing to them, he said, ''This is something we had not foreseen.''

1194-> RELATIONSHIPS; EXPLOITERS: THEY TAKE, NEVER GIVE
AT the feast of life, there are always a few freeloaders. These are t he people with a talent for exploiting others, socially and e motionally. They have never been known to pick up a check or stand in a line or return a favor. They will borrow your car and return it with an empty tank. They will burden you with the details of their psychic ups and downs, but don't expect to tell them your troubles. Society has names for such people, and psychotherapists have theories about the roots of their narcissistic behavior. ''It's a paradox,'' said Howard Kogan, a director of the Training Institute for Mental Health Practitioners in Manhattan. ''On the one hand, some have been so indulged in childhood that they grow up with a special feeling of entitlement. On the other hand, some have been so neglected that they grow up angry and expecting restitution. Either way they become takers, never givers, in their lives and relationships.'' The problem seems to have surfaced in China on a grand scale. According to a recent news report, China's drive to hold down its population by limiting couples to one child is spawning a generation of spoiled brats. As a Chinese educator put it, ''Single children are the sun in a family, and parents and grandparents are planets orbiting the sun.'' Parents are said to lavish presents on these children. Clinics allow them to go to the front of the line. Teachers give them extra candy and less work. As a result, the children are growing up expecting special treatment and having problems adjusting in school. One thing that distinguishes people with feelings of entitlement from those who may be occasionally thoughtless or rude is their reaction to criticism. When confronted with their behavior, they usually express shock and indignation. People who have been exploited by them are often stunned by this, but professionals who treat such cases find it perfectly understandable. ''On an unconscious level,'' said Dr. Irving Handelsman, a psychoanalyst practicing in New York and Great Neck, L.I., ''they always feel entitled, either because they were the exceptional child or the deprived child. So they never feel guilty for what they are doing. They are totally insensitive to what others are feeling. They have a certain lack of social intelligence and no sense of give and take in relationships.'' What they often have is a kind of ''psychic radar'' for detecting others with a need to give, Dr. Handelsman said. ''I've seen many marriages based on this,'' he said. ''The taker continues to take until the giver is no longer willing to give or until, through therapy or some insight, there is a change in the person's sense of self and role in life.'' It is rare that such people seek help when they are young. More often than not, those who do enter psychotherapy do so in middle age. This is a time when they may begin to experience a sense of joylessness and inner emptiness, and sometimes a fear of losing a special attribute, such as good looks or talent. ''Many are living out their lives on a low level because they can't stand competition,'' Dr. Handelsman said. ''They'll take jobs that require less of them as long as they can feel superior.'' On the other hand, according the Dr. Manny Rich, associate director of the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Manhattan, there are those with successful careers and a wide circle of friends. ''They're sharp,'' he said. ''I'm convinced this is an intuitive sense. They won't approach anybody if they think they're going to get turned down.'' Instead, Dr. Rich continued, they lead a kind of double life, taking from some, giving to others. ''You see this a lot in professional circles,'' he said, ''where a doctor, say, will take whatever he can from other doctors in the group. Meanwhile, there is another group of doctors he wants to belong to, and he wouldn't dare ask for a thing because he knows he can't get away with it. He'll give as much as he can to be part of this group.'' It is difficult, but not necessarily impossible, to deal with such people on the job. ''You have to remember that they never really grew up and that they are still expecting to be taken care of,'' Dr. Rich said. He cited the case of a colleague who constantly borrowed books from his library and never returned them. One day he noticed that his bookshelves looked empty. ''It finally dawned on me,'' he recalled. ''So I said, 'Hey, do you know you've got half my books?' And being a true analyst, he replied, 'You're too sensitive.' I said, 'Don't tell me about me sensitivity, give me back my books.' '' ''He was telling me I have something wrong with me,'' Dr. Rich said. ''Well, I do. What's wrong with me is I lent him my books.'' Georgia Dullea

1195-> SUBSTANCE RELEASES HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE
Scientists for the first time have reported successful use of a synthetic substance to set in motion the natural production of growth hormone in humans. The research workers predict that the artificial substance, called GRF for growth hormone releasing factor, will prove useful in treating serious human growth disorders, including some cases of childhood dwarfism. The accomplishment, reported Thursday, might also be an important step toward applications to agriculture in regulating the size and growth of domestic animals. In its applications, the releasing factor could be an alternative to the use of natural growth hormone harvested from human pituitary glands or produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Use of the human hormone, derived from human pituitary glands, is currently standard treatment for pituitary dwarfism in humans, but the supply is extremely limited. Tests with human growth hormone produced through gene splicing are now under way in human patients. Six Adult Volunteers The first use of the artificially produced releasing factor in humans was a test in six normal adult volunteers demonstrating that it did stimulate their pituitary glands to produce human growth hormone, which was detected in their bloodstreams. The report of this successful test followed by only a few months reports of the discovery and identification of the long-sought natural releasing growth factor and its successful fabrication. The natural substance was found in tissues from a patient at University of Virginia Medical Center, Charlottesville, who had a tumor of the pancreas and a serious overproduction of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. A substance produced by the tumor triggered the release of the growth hormone and proved to be either the long-sought natural growth hormone releasing factor of the brain or something very closely similar to it. The natural releasing factor is produced by the hypothalamus, a deep-seated part of the brain that exercises many control functions over the pituitary gland. The new test showed that the substance had no effects on any other known body hormone and no toxic effects. Plans for Future Testing Next, the scientific team plans to test it in adults who failed to grow normally because of a lack of natural growth hormone production. In adults, the growth hormone is not expected to produce further growth. But if growth hormone is produced in these adults, as is expected, the releasing factor will soon be tried as a treatment for children who are in danger of severely retarded growth because their pituitary glands are failing to produce and release growth hormone. In the recent tests, each person was given a single injection of a small amount of the material. Release of growth hormone into the bloodstream was detectable in five minutes and continued to increase to a peak production between 30 minutes and an hour later, according to Dr. Michael O. Thorner, professor of medicine at University of Virginia. He was first author of the report published Thursday in The Lancet, a medical journal published in London. The research was a collaboration between his group and medical scientists at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London and at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, Calif. The other authors were Jean Rivier, Joachim Spies and Wylie Vale of the Salk Institute; Stephen Bloom and Joan D. Webster Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London; Mary Lee Vance, Alan D. Rogol, Michael J. Cronin, Donald L. Kaiser, William S. Evans and Robert M. MacLeod, of University of Virginia. Dr. Thorner emphasized that the test in humans was approved in advance by the Food and Drug Administration as well as human research committees at University of Virginia. The identification of the substance and its artificial fabrication were done last year at the Salk Institute under the direction of Dr. Vale. What is believed to be the same substance was also found independently by another group at Salk led by Dr. Roger Guillemin.

1196-> Poles to Permit Showing Of 'Danton,' Wajda Film
''Danton,'' the new film about the French Revolution by the Polish film director Andrzej Wajda, will have its premiere in Warsaw on Jan. 31, the state television said tonight. Although the film is set in the late 18th century, in some quarters it has been viewed as a symbol of Poland's current crisis, and its main characters, Danton and Robespierre, have been likened to the labor leader Lech Walesa and the Communist Party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. Polish sources have dismissed such speculation, and the decision to screen ''Danton'' appears to be an attempt to dispel the rumors. Mr. Wajda, who was closely associated with the outlawed Solidarity labor union movement, was forced to step down as head of the Polish film-makers' association. But unlike some other cultural figures, he was not interned, or otherwise harassed under martial law.

1197-> SOLARZ WANTS SALVADOR'S ARMS AID TIED TO TALKS
A visiting United States Congressman has proposed tying future American military aid to El Salvador to the Government's willingness to open unconditional talks with the leftist guerrillas. ''The only way to bring the war to an end is through negotiations,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ''For us to continue to support a Government that is likely to end up losing unless we send in the Marines is an unproductive strategy.'' Mr. Solarz said Saturday night that such talks could be opened directly with the Government or with a proposed peace commission, which the Government has been promising to form since August. Last October, the Government here responded coolly to a proposal by the leftist opposition for unconditional negotiations. The provisional President, Alvaro Magana, rejected negotiations until the guerrillas lay down their arms. Roberto d'Aubuisson, the president of the Constituent Assembly and the leader of the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance, called the possibility of negotiations ''absurd.'' Certification Required At present, the Reagan Administration must certify to Congress every six months that the Salvadoran Government is making progress in human rights and economic and political improvements. The next certification, which is necessary for continued military aid to El Salvador, is due next week. Mr. Solarz said the certification legislation should be rewritten to halt military aid unless the Government puts an end to the murder of civilians by death squads. Under the current law, the Administration must certify only that the Government is ''achieving substantial control'' over the armed forces. The Congressman also said the legislation should provide the possibility of a Congressional veto, which is lacking in the current law. The present certification law expires next October. The Congressman said the whole question of continued military aid would be taken up in March by the Foreign Relations Committee. 'Time to Internationalize' ''I find it difficult on moral or political grounds that we should give aid to a country that is killing its citizens,'' he said in reference to reports by human rights groups that the number of civilian deaths in the three-year-old civil war has climbed to more than 38,000. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who was also in San Salvador, said he believed that there had been too much emphasis on an American solution to the problems of El Salvador. He said it was ''time to internationalize'' the mediation process and seek the help of other Central American countries and Mexico. ''It might be the right time to bring others into the process,'' he said. ''I believe that Secretary of State George P. Shultz would like to try some new avenues that we were not able to try in the past.'' Both Congressmen said Government and military leaders here had told them that the certification process had been helpful in restraining the violence against civilians and encouraging progress in land redistribution. Status Quo 'Unacceptable' ''The biggest single thing I learned here is that the Salvadoran Government believes that certification has been helpful, and they clearly want to maintain conditions and in some instances want to strengthen it,'' Mr. Solarz said. He said that the status quo was ''unacceptable'' and that the United States could embolden the more moderate elements in the Government by making the conditions for military aid stronger. ''There are forces here that would like to eliminate the death squads and negotiate with the left, but at the current time they do not have the political strength,'' Mr. Solarz said. ''The theory behind strenthening certification would be to strengthen their hand.''

1198-> Nancy Schaffir Is Wed To Anatole Gershman
Nancy Schaffir, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Schaffir of New York, was married yesterday to Anatole Gershman, son of Mr. and Mrs. Vitaly Gershman, also of New York, formerly of Moscow. Rabbi Abe Weissman performed the ceremony at the home of a friend of the couple in Manhattan. The bride, who will retain her name, is assistant producer at Dragon Communications, maker of medical films for the pharmaceutical industry. She graduated from Hampshire College. Her father is president of Growth Dynamics Inc., management consultant in New York. Mr. Gershman, who is vice president of technology with Cognitive Systems in New Haven, attended schools in Moscow, studied at the University of California at Los Angeles and received his master's degree and doctorate in computer sciences from Yale University. His previous marriage ended in divorce. His father, now retired, taught physics in Moscow schools. His mother is a retired pediatrician.

1199-> SISTERS OF 'SKIRMISHES' WORK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP
SUZANNE BERTISH and Fran Brill, who have won critical praise as the warring sisters in ''Skirmishes'' - Catherine Hayes's darkly comic slice of life at the Manhattan Theater Club - improvised an argument recently in a restaurant. ''My children are young; they would have nightmares if I brought them here,'' Miss Brill declared at one point between bites of steamed vegetables. ''You're selfish,'' Miss Bertish rejoined over spinach salad, as patrons in earshot glanced over uneasily. The exchange helped Miss Brill feel less defensive as the character Rita on stage when she tells her sister, Jean, why she hasn't returned home earlier to help care for their dying mother. ''Skirmishes'' takes place entirely in the mother's bedroom, where the sisters berate each other, reveal some of the pain of their lives and argue anew, first one and then the other engaging the audience's sympathy. On stage, they seem very much to be sisters, however at odds; they even look alike, audience members tell them, although the actresses themselves don't think so. But they have not consciously worked at developing a sibling relationship, except that Miss Brill copies a smirk of Miss Bertish's as though it were a family trait. Time to Become Acquainted The actresses have not gotten to know each other well in the four weeks since ''Skirmishes'' began its run. ''I've asked her over for dinner, but there hasn't been time,'' Miss Brill reported regretfully the other day as Miss Bertish nodded in agreement. Both are playing roles radically different from recent ones they've played - and the new parts have encroached on their lives. Miss Bertish, the British actress who was the uncouth Fanny Squeers and two other characters in the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Nicholas Nickleby,'' seen on television last week, plays the bitter and unkempt Jean in ''Skirmishes.'' Jean, wearing an overlarge cardigan, has spent much of her life caring for her ailing and now incontinent mother - a task the character describes to her visiting sister in sardonic detail. Off stage, the actress has been going around in sneakers and no makeup, ''looking like a slob'' she said. ''I've started biting the skin around my nails,'' Miss Bertish confided, ''and it looks quite disgusting.'' Miss Brill - who played Stella recently in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' at the Hartman Theater in Stamford - portays Rita, who has left home long ago, and who returns for a brief and overdue visit. Between performances in ''Skirmishes,'' Miss Brill has been dressing neatly enough, reflecting her own as well as her character's predilection. But she has been acting with uncharacteristic snippiness. Rita's incursion on Miss Brill's life is partly intentional. ''Rita has less control over her emotions than I do, and I've been parodying her, allowing myself to be nasty,'' Traits of Nervousness She finds herself thinking, ''How would Rita react to this man in the store who won't give me change for the bus?'' Or, ''Does she rub her nose a lot, smooth worry lines out of her forehead or fuss with her hair?'' Probably, Miss Brill concluded. ''Rita is a very nervous character, preoccupied with how she should behave. She has put together a life with her husband and children, but it has holes in it. She tries to be calm, to smile, to be above the tension. And I must say, that conflict is a wonderful thing to play as an actress.'' It is also something with which Miss Brill can empathize. ''People always say, 'Gee, Fran, you're so together,' '' she added. ''Yet I know the demons I carry in my psyche.'' She even dreams about the play. ''I go through certain passages and wake up in the night,'' she continued, ''and think, 'Oh, that's the way to do it.' '' She thinks Miss Bertish's character, Jean, is the stronger of the two, but her co-star is not so sure. ''Jean has endured a lot,'' Miss Bertish mused. ''She hasn't put her mother in a home or turned her back on her. One obvious strength is her use of the English language; she can obliterate Rita with words. But she really needs here sister there. They have different strengths.'' Audiences Can Tell To play almost any part, Miss Bertish said, ''At some point in the rehearsal, you've got to find the real thing inside yourself and drag it out of you; find either how you would feel in the situation or how the character would feel. You can fake it, and some actors do - I mean good actors.'' Perhaps 10 percent of sophisticated audiences can tell the difference, she added. Miss Bertish identifies to some degree with Jean but not with her brand of wit. ''I can be funny, but I'm not acerbic.'' That aspect of Jean, though, is satisfying to play. ''You fly with it a bit,'' she said. ''You can hit bull's-eyes.'' Miss Brill, an American, can sound British in ''Skirmishes'' because she has a good ear for accents - a talent tha is quite apart from acting skill, both actresses said. ''Olivier can. Gielgud can't and says so,'' said Miss Bertish, imitating Gielgud saying so. Miss Brill's English accent is ''brilliant,'' according to Miss Bertish, and the American actress has, in fact, frequently been cast as an Englishwoman - in such plays as ''Look Back in Anger,'' ''School for Scandal,'' ''Arms and the Man,'' ''Otherwise Engaged'' and ''Knuckle.'' Rapidly Gained Accents Miss Bertish, whose mother is American, also has a good ear and recently played an American lab assistant in the film ''The Hunger.'' ''When I was a kid,'' she recalled, ''I would come here on holiday, and then go back with an American accent,'' an affectation little appreciated by her schoolmates. ''Skirmishes,'' which has been extended to Feb. 20, is virtually a two-character play; the dying mother (Hope Cameron) has few lines. And both actresses must be on stage almost nonstop, with hardly any props to help them. Compounding those difficulties is the small size of the theater, in which they can hear programs dropped and even whispers. ''The other night,'' Miss Bertish recalled, ''Rita had asked me what I would like my relationship with my husband to be, and I replied 'Deeper,' and I heard someone in the audience say 'What?' and someone else answered, 'Deeper!' I felt like repeating it for him.'' Occasionally one or the other actress may drop a line or say the wrong one, for much of the dialogue reworks arguments between the sisters. When that happens, ''it's almost fun,'' because of the challenge, Miss Brill said. ''You think, 'Am I really listening?' ''

1201-> THE REGION; Fingerprints Plan For Pupils in Jersey
Nearly 44,000 elementary school students in Union County are to be fingerprinted during the next year to help locate them should they ever disappear. ''We see a lot of teletypes on missing children and kids who are found dead with no form of identification,'' said John Troiano, a county undersheriff who helped develop the program. Starting Jan. 25, students in grades kindergarten through eighth in each of the county's 21 municipalities will be fingerprinted, but only with parental permission. So far, 92 percent of the parents have approved, Mr. Troiano said. The fingerprints are then given to the family. No record of the prints is retained by officials, Mr. Troiano said. ''We told parents the best thing to do is put them with your insurance policies and forget you have them,'' Mr. Troiano said. ''Hopefully, you won't ever have to use them.''

1203-> OPEC'S MINISTERS AGREE TO REDUCE PROJECTED OUTPUT
OPEC oil ministers agreed today to reduce the total projected amount of oil that the group's 13 members would produce this year. One minister said that Saudi Arabia would bear the brunt of the reduction. But a serious dispute remained over how to adjust oil prices to reflect differences in quality. The ministers emerged this evening from a closed four-hour meeting with widely varying assessments of the progress made toward bridging deep differences within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries about how to avert a price war. There was a consensus among those ministers who spoke to reporters that there had been an accord on a total ceiling for OPEC production through 1983 - 17.5 million barrels a day rather than 18.5 million. However, the ministers said, they had not yet reached agreement on a price structure. Recession Has Cut Demand Some OPEC countries, which have seen their revenues slide because the worldwide recession has cut demand for oil, have threatened to undercut OPEC's $34 benchmark price for a barrel of Saudi Light crude in order to expand sales and recover lost revenue. Mohammad Gharazi, Iran's oil minister, told reporters after the meeting, ''All members agreed on three things: a total ceiling, maintenance of the benchmark price and also the quotas.'' The last was a reference to how much each nation would produce under the OPEC ceiling. Mr. Gharazi called the agreement a ''victory for OPEC.'' The meeting here has not yet been declared an official ''extraordinary conference'' of OPEC, and thus whatever decisions are made would not be binding on the members. But if this ''consultative'' meeting is made official, as has happened in the past, the group would announce specific agreements. According to several ministers and delegation members, a deep dispute remained between the Persian Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, and major African producers such as Nigeria, Algeria and Libya, over how to revive a system of price adjustments called differentials. Those adjustments essentially make Persian Gulf oil more competitive with the high-grade light oils produced by the African nations. Algerian sources said that Saudi Arabia wanted its heavy oil priced with a discount of $3.70 a barrel in order to improve its competitiveness, while the African nations wanted to keep the discount at $2. Humberto Calderon Berti, Venezuela's Minister of Energy and Mines, said after the meeting that broad agreement had been reached to reduce OPEC's maximum production ceiling to about 17.5 million barrels of oil a day, from the planned 18.5 million. OPEC members are currently producing about 17.5 million barrels of oil daily. Quota System Disregarded Last March, OPEC agreed for the first time in its 22 years to an overall production ceiling - 17.5 million barrels a day - to support falling oil prices. But the system of country quotas worked out in March was disregarded by several members. At a meeting in Vienna in December, the divided group, seeking again to stabilize prices, decided to increase the quota to 18.5 million barrels a day, but failed to agree on individual alottments. The two nations at the center of December's dispute were Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iranian officials argued then that the needs of their larger population gave them priority in world markets. But Saudi Arabia, which has been supporting Iraq in its war with Iran, did not want Iran to bolster its resources for that war with extra oil revenues. Mr. Calderon said that Saudi Arabia had agreed to reduce its quota to between 4.5 million and 5 million barrels a day, from the March quota of 7.5 million. Iran, he said, was granted a production increase to 2.5 million, from a March quota of 1.2 million. Other major shifts from the March quota system included Iraq, whose quota was increased to 1.25 million barrels a day, from one million, and Venezuela, which received an increase to at least 1.7 million, from 1.5 million, Mr. Calderon said. Oil industry analysts have estimated Iran's current production at about 2.7 million barrels a day, while Saudi Arabia reported last week that its production was down to 4.2 million. Iraq's production has been limited by wartime conditions to about 700,000 barrels a day, while Venezuela said it was producing about 2.1 million barrels. Mr. Calderon said that the Persian Gulf nations had called for an increase in the system of differentials to make their crude oil more competitive. The group around Saudi Arabia, which includes Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, was said by sources here to have threatened to undercut OPEC's benchmark price, perhaps by about $2 a barrel, if the African nations failed to agree to higher differentials. A barrel contains 42 gallons. Less Costly to Refine The African countries' light crude oil costs less to refine, so a discount is necessary to make the Saudi group's heavier oil competitive. Officials from major oil-producing companies who have come to Geneva to try to talk to delegates said the question of differentials could pose a major obstacle to agreement. ''If the Saudis are to accept a deep cut in their quota,'' one official said, ''they will want steps taken to assure that they can sell what they produce.'' The ministers are expected to continue their talks Monday morning.

1204-> Peru's Debt Is Rescheduled
Western governments to which Peru owes money agreed today to allow a delay in repayment of about $1 billion in medium-term and long-term debt due between May 1983 and February 1985. The accord was reached at a meeting of the Club of Paris, an informal group of representatives of Western creditor governments. They agreed to allow Peru to extend its debt repayments for eight and a half years with a four-year grace period, the French Economics Ministry said. Peru's total official debt outstanding stands at about $7 billion, while the country's commercial debt amounts to $4.5 billion.

1206-> PERSONAL HEALTH
RESEARCHERS are discovering surprising effects of eating starchy foods such as pasta or kidney beans now that these complex carbohydrates are gaining credibility as nutritious foods that can be the basis of meals rather than side dishes. The findings are of interest to diabetics, athletes and anyone else who may be concerned about fluctuations in blood sugar. It has long been assumed that simple sugars produced a corresponding immediate rise in blood-sugar levels but that starches such as the complex carbohydrates did not. Research now shows, however, that not all starches - or all sugars - are alike in their effects on blood sugar and that the differences could have important implications for health and behavior. When the level of blood sugar rises, a hormone, insulin, is released to bring the level back to normal. For the diabetic, whose output or usage of insulin is abnormal, this sugar-induced demand for insulin means trouble. Even for the ordinary healthy person it can have unwanted side effects. Among them, insulin can raise blood levels of fatty substances called triglycerides, which are implicated in heart disease; it also encourages the storage of calories as fat, and it can change circulating levels of amino acids that in turn change brain chemicals that affect behavior. Thus, an outpouring of insulin may increase serotonin levels in the brain, a condition that induces sleepiness. Furthermore, the less dramatic the effect a food has on blood sugar, the longer the diner is likely to feel satisfied. Eating something that raises blood sugar and insulin may lead to a quick return of hunger pangs and to problems with weight control. Until recently nutrition scientists and diabetes specialists believed that all carbohydrates behaved in predictable ways: Simple sugars, which are readily digested and absorbed, were thought to produce dramatic rises in blood sugar, which in turn would require an outpouring of insulin to be processed. The starches, which take longer to digest and absorb, were considered to have a relatively minor effect on blood sugar. Furthermore, it was assumed that eating plant foods whole, with their natural fiber intact, would blunt any effect the food might have on blood sugar. In the so-called exchange lists of foods from which many diabetics and weight-reduction clients are told to select their daily menus, half a cup of orange juice (the juice of one orange) is considered equal to one small orange or two tablespoons of raisins. In the list of starchy foods, one small white potato could be exchanged for a third of a cup of corn kernels, two-thirds of a cup of @parsnips or half a cup of cooked dried beans or peas, or a slice of bread, or half a cup of pasta or rice. In the vegetables list, half a cup of carrots is ranked with half a cup of beets or bean sprouts. In the exchange list of dairy products, ice cream - with all its sugar - is not even an option. Nor do candy, pastry or potato chips appear on the lists. While the foods on the lists might contain approximately the same amount of carbohydrates and calories, it turns out that they may not have the same effect on blood sugar. According to recent findings by Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, now of the University of Toronto, and his co-workers at Oxford University and Central Middlesex Hospital in London, carrots and parsnips can produce a higher blood-sugar level than a Mars Bar or even honey. Honey, in turn, had a much greater effect on blood sugar than ordinary white table sugar (sucrose). Beets had somewhat less effect than other root vegetables but more than pastry and almost double that of ice cream. Shredded wheat had more effect than raisins, and white potatoes more than sweet potatoes and about the same as a Mars Bar. Moreover, the Jenkins studies found, the fiber in grain foods, at least, made little if any difference. No significant variation in blood-sugar response was found after eating white spaghetti and whole-wheat spaghetti, white rice and brown rice, or white bread and whole-wheat bread. From the perspective of raising blood sugar, peanuts, cooked dried beans and peas - for example, soybeans, lentils, kidney beans and chickpeas - oatmeal and pasta had the least effect of the carbohydrate foods. When combinations were tested -for example, bread and cottage cheese, or bread and beans - unexpected and unpredictable effects on blood sugar resulted. The bread-cheese combination led to a rapid increase in blood sugar that would be characteristic of the bread, whereas the bread-beans combination resulted in a much slower rise, more like that induced by beans alone. The effect of various foods on blood sugar seems to be directly related to how fast they are digested and absorbed, and the form of the food -say, wheat as pasta rather than as bread - may be more important than the actual substance, Dr. Jenkins maintains. Instant mashed potatoes had a greater effect on blood sugar than natural potatoes and an apple has a lesser effect than apple puree, which, in turn, had less effect than apple juice, researchers at the University of Bristol found. Dr. Jenkins's findings have been supported by research in the United States as well as elsewhere in Europe and in Australia. Phyllis Crapo, nutrition researcher at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, for one, says her studies of potatoes, bread, rice, corn and ice cream produced results very similar to those of Dr. Jenkins. ''We fed our volunteers huge bowls of ice cream and saw no signficant increase in blood glucose,'' she related. She reported that cake produced a greater effect than ice cream, but the substitution of fructose (fruit sugar) for sucrose (table sugar) in preparing the cake reduced its effect. In July researchers at the Universities of Minnesota and Colorado published a study indicating that modest amounts of refined white table sugar - traditionally forbidden to diabetics - did not lead to high blood-sugar levels when eaten as part of a meal. The researchers suggested that the prohibition might be modified, with occasional substitutions of modest amounts of sugar for other carbohydrates such as potatoes. Do these findings mean that, diabetic or not, we can feel free to skip our baked potato at dinner and eat chocolate candy for dessert instead? Or that we can forget about coarse whole-grain bread and go back to the pasty white varieties most of us were reared on? Or that we can eat all the ice cream we want without feeling guilty (less guilty, indeed, than if we had eaten shredded wheat)? Certainly not, the researchers say. ''Blood sugar is only one factor to consider,'' Dr. Jenkins emphasized. For diabetics it is certainly an important factor, but hardly the only one essential to their health and nutritional wellbeing. ''The findings don't mean you should eat a candy bar in place of potatoes,'' Dr. Jenkins said in an interview. ''The calories count too, and you would feel satisfied on a lot fewer calories of potatoes than of candy.'' Nutrients must also be considered. Far more of the potato's calories come from nutrients that are good for the body than would be found in the candy bar. Just because no difference was detected in blood-sugar effects ''doesn't mean you should eat white rice and white bread,'' Dr. Jenkins insisted, adding that other nutrients and other virtues were associated with eating fiber, particularly its beneficial effects on bowel function, blood cholesterol and weight control. ''Just because a food causes a large increase in blood glucose does not make it necessarily evil,'' he noted. He said that a lowcholesterol, high-starch diet with plenty of fiber and properly balanced protein was the goal of most experts who are eager to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and other diet-related chronic ailments. HEALTH CHART - C6 Blood Sugar Index of Foods Food that contains carbohydrates can change the level of blood sugar. The following index compares the way various foods raise blood sugar with the effect on blood sugar produced by straight glucose. That is the form sugar takes in the blood and it is here assigned an index number of 100 for the purposes of the compari-son. All the foods were fed to healthy people in amounts that matched the carbohydrate content of the glucose used in the test. The index was prepared by Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, now of the University of Toronto, and his coworkers at Oxford University and Central Middlesex Hospital in London.

1208-> MUSIC: LES BROWN AND BAND COME EAST FOR TORME SERIES
SINCE Les Brown settled in California 35 years ago, his Band of Reknown has rarely ventured farther east than Las Vegas. Its appearance last weekend for three nights with Mel Torme at the Orrie de Nooyer Auditorium in Hackensack was an unusual opportunity for Easterners to hear one of the few surviving Swing Era bands that has retained the style and sound of the period and yet has a freshness that makes it seem quite up to date. This to a great extent is because Mr. Brown's association with Bob Hope for three decades has allowed him to keep the band together with only occasional changes in personnel. The band has roots, and its old arrangements, such as ''Bizet Has His Day'' and ''I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,'' still swing with a flowing ease, driven by a rhythm section anchored by Jack Sperling on drums and with saxaphone and brass ensembles that have a luster that studio band re-creations cannot achieve. Unlike the band led by another survivor of the Swing Era, Harry James, which is primarily a setting for Mr. James's trumpet, Mr. Brown's band is an ensemble with no star but with a variety of good instrumental soloists. Like the old big-band sidemen, Matt Uttel, a warm-voiced altosaxophonist, Bud Madison, a crackling jazz trumpeter and flugelhornist, and Lou Ciotti, who plays tenor saxophone with a big-toned authority, can make an impression within the limitations of half a chorus. The longevity of the band is emphasized by the presence of Butch Stone, the baritone saxophonist and singer, who joined Mr. Brown in 1941 and now, his hair turned snowy white, is still singing ''A Good Man Is Hard to Find.'' Stumpy Brown, Les Brown's younger brother, has been playing bass trombone and singing rhythym songs since 1943, and Jo Anne Greer, who has been with Mr. Brown since the 1950's, retains the band singer's ability to make the most of a single chorus on ''Sentimental Journey.'' Helen Forrest, who shared the bill with Mr. Torme and Mr. Brown, used to be a band singer herself with Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and Harry James, but in her latter-day career as a solo performer she has broadened her style and, backed by Mr. Brown's band, she tended to give her songs an exaggerated projection that lost the fine points that once marked her singing.

1209-> PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MATTERS; OPENING STATEMENT
I have an opening statement here. A while back I got a letter from a 13-year-old and I apologize for not having answered her as yet. She wrote, ''Don't you wish sometimes you could just stamp your feet and shout at the press or Senators to be quiet, sit down and listen to what you're saying?'' Well, yes, Gretchen, I sometimes do feel that way, and particularly over the past week. On April 27 I went to Capitol Hill, addressed a joint session of the Congress on a subject of vital importance to all Americans - I talked about our goals in Central America and I asked for Congressional understanding and support. In Central America as elsewhere we support democracy, reform, and human freedom; we support economic development; we support dialogue and negotiations among and within the countries of the region, and yes, we support a security shield for the region's threatened nations in order to protect these other goals. In my view, there's been entirely too much attention to the efforts that we're making to provide that security shield, and not nearly enough to the other elements of our policy. Yet in each of the four elements of the policy we find that they reinforce each other, and they're being pursued simultaneously in a carefully balanced manner. I dispatched Ambassador Dick Stone to the region to facilitate the process of dialogue and negotiations. He's there now with a personal message from me to leaders of the countries in the region, the text of which I'm making public tonight. I am heartened by the efforts of the Contadora countries, led by Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, to reach a peaceful regional solution. I'm encouraged by some recent statements from Nicaragua and Cuba that seem to indicate that they, too, now recognize the merit to regional negotiations. I trust their words will be followed by positive actions to ease tension and stop the fighting in the region. Here at home I've appointed a bipartisan commission to make recommendations on the long-term measures, including economic assistance, that we should undertake to help these struggling nations. And I hope soon to be signing the legislation on the Caribbean Basin initiative passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both Houses. The program will bolster the economic independence of the region. We continue to promote elections as the best way to guarantee peace, human freedom and responsive government. Greatest Part of Aid The greatest portion of our aid goes toward humanitarian and economic assistance. For every one dollar we provide for security assistance to that region we provide three dollars for economic and human development. But we recognize that democracy and development can hardly flourish when threatened by violence. Dialogue and negotiations can best succeed when the parties are convinced that their goals cannot be achieved through the barrel of the gun. It's especially important in our own hemisphere that the United States continue to be the foremost protector of peace. As part of this mission, as a way to provide a shield for democracy and development, we together with our friends are now planning joint training exercises in the Caribbean and Central America. And let me set the record straight on what these exercises are and what they are not. Essentially there will be two sets of practice training in coming months: One, a series of ground exercises in Honduras with the combined forces of Honduras and the United States; second, a series of ocean exercises with our own fleet. We have conducted joint exercises with Latin American countries on a regular basis since 1965. The latest exercises with Honduras took place earlier this year. Much larger scale exercises have taken place in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Moreover, these training exercises are limited in purpose. Yes, we want to underscore, once and for all, that the United States, along with our friends, seriously opposes the use of force by one neighbor against another in Central America. But we are not seeking a larger presence in that region, and U.S. forces have not been requested. The United States stands firmly on the side of peace. As a nation we've remained steadfast in policy and purpose. We want to see an end to violence and bloodshed, to the export of revolution. We want to help our neighbors lift themselves up to prosperity. We want to usher in a new era of peace and social justice. Now these are great goals worthy of a great and generous people, and we shall continue to keep faith with ourselves in the days ahead. Now, Ellen? QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS U.S. Military Plans Q. Mr. President, you complain of too much tension. How can the people ignore two battleship groups, thousands of combat troops going to Honduras, you defend the covert funding of 10,000 rebels - Nicaraguan rebels. My question, and all these things have happened since April 27, the question, sir, is in seeking solutions, how far will you go militarily? And I'd like to follow up. A. Well I have told you. We have no military plans for intervention of that kind. We have 55 mainly noncommissioned officers helping to train the Salvadoran Army. We know that Cuba has somewhere in the neighborhood, has thousands of military personnel in Nicaragua. It does seem a little overbalanced with regard to the attention that is being paid to 55 as against attention that's being paid to the thousands. The - I suppose what my question is, Helen, back - answer to the question is - why are maneuvers that we have performed before and regularly suddenly treated with such suspicion when only - well within this year, last spring we had military maneuvers in Honduras. And last year we had naval maneuvers in the Caribbean, and no one seemed to be excited about them at all. So, it's just that there's no confidence in the fact that when I say these are maneuvers of the kind we've been holding regularly and for years. Q. But they're unprecedented to last six month. The polls show of the American people are not for them and they fear it may lead to war and my question is remembering the lessons of Vietnam, does this bother you and do they have any say? A. First of all there is no comparison with Vietnam and there's not going to be anything of that kind in this, and maybe the people are disturbed because of the confused pattern that's been presented to them and the constant drumbeat with regard to the fact of suspicion that somehow there is an ulterior purpose in this. It hardly seems to me that those ships are going there - and I don't know that they're going to be there six months. I don't know what the length of time for the training is. I don't know the number of ships involved. But I didn't know the number that were involved in the Caribbean exercises. But if they were there for some kind of a hostile purpose - we happen to know that right now a Soviet freighter, the Ulianov, is approaching the port of Corinto in the vicity of Nicaragua. That port is in Nicaragua. And it is carrying a load of military equipment - helicopters, transport helicopters for military purposes and so forth, and no one shot at them. Number of U.S. Soldiers Q. Mr. President, you've mentioned your interest in easing the tensions and you've said that you hope the Nicaraguan proposals will have that effect. Now, your spokesmen have said that the 4,000 troops that you're planning to send down there will --A. Between three and four. Q. Between 3,000 and 4,000 troops that you're planning to send down there will have standing orders to defend themselves if they're fired upon. How does that help to ease tensions? A. Well, wait a minute. That is something that has been true for a long time, as far as I'm concerned, with our troops and our forces anywhere they may be. We went through a period some years ago when American forces were pretty much fair game. Look back at some of our aircraft that were shot down on the charge that they had ventured over international water or out of international waters into the air space of a Communist-bloc country and shot down and we protested diplomatically. It seems to me that young men and women who are going to defend this country of ours and who join the military, should know that they have the right to defend themselves if we have placed them in a position where they could come under fire. And this is just a standard order. We don't want war, but I don't think that you prevent war by letting your personnel out there become the victims. Q. But doesn't this simply increase the chances of war? A. No, I don't think so. All of the ships that are down in that area and that are going there are outside the 12-mile limit. They're out in international waters, where they have a right to be. Now, wait a minute. Before all of your hands go up here, you change personnel every once in a while and new people come into the White House press corps and it's only been recently that an effort has been made that I have an opportunity to meet them and get acquainted. And so recently I met five newcomers to the press corps but only three of them are here tonight. And when I met them I told them that in this, the first press conference that if I knew they were here I was going to call on them if they had a question and Candy, do you have a question? Heightening of Tensions Q. How can I turn that down? A little earlier you said yes that the military exercises, that you did want to underscore that the U.S. is opposed to the use of force in the region. Is sending down our military might to the region a way to show that we oppose force? Isn't there some sort of contradiction there? Wouldn't it be better to say, if we do these things regularly, isn't this the time now, not to do it, not to heighten the tensions and to say, we oppose the use of force? How can you oppose it by sending down all these ships and men? A. Since the trouble that is going on down there comes from outside the area is revolution exported from the Soviet Union and from Cuba and from others of their allies, then wouldn't there perhaps be a risk if we changed our pattern and withdrew. Wouldn't we be sending some kind of a signal that might be the wrong kind of signal to send if we want peace in that area? The simple truth is, no one asked for American forces to come to their aid. In fact, they've gone quite the contrary and said the reverse, that they don't. And yet, they do acknowledge that they need the material assistance that we're giving them, both economic and to provide a shield or help them provide their own shield against the attacks that are preventing them from making the economic progress that they want to make now that they have installed a democratic type of government there. But, as I say, we've done this regularly. I don't that it's destabilizing, nor should it be. Q. I understand that you said in your letter to the four Contadora nations that you want to take this out of the realm of an East-West confrontation, but doesn't somebody have to begin to take it out of that realm and couldn't the U.S. be the leader in that way, and not make it that kind of an atmosphere of complication? A. We think we are. We have tried to make contact with the guerrillas in El Salvador to see if they would not meet with the peace commission that was created by the El Salvadoran Government to discuss participating in the democratic process in the elections that are coming up before the year is out. In the entire area I have just sent letters which have been made public now, but letters to the Contadora Four of our approval of what they're doing and our recognition of what they are and that we stand ready to support them in what they're trying to accomplish. We want a political and peaceful solution. Now wait a minute, there are two more here, Bob Raleigh? Support for a War Q. Mr. President, military leaders in the Pentagon have stated recently that they never want to be involved in another war without the support of the American people. Do you have any sense or feeling now for whether the American people are ready to support a war to defend our interests in Central America? A. Well, in the first place, I don't think the American people have ever wanted a war. I think we're probably the most peace-loving people in the world. And maybe this has been part of what has lured us into wars in the past, because we haven't been ready for them. But, no, I don't think the American people, and I don't think that they - frankly I don't think they're as aware as perhaps they should be - we've tried to make them aware - that this does constitute something of a threat in this hemisphere to peace in the entire hemisphere, if those who are exporting the revolution here are successful. But no, we're not planning a war, and we don't think that that's going to happen at all. I've seen four wars in my lifetime. I have sons and I have a grandson. And I agree with General Eisenhower, that war is man's greatest stupidity. And I don't want to see such a thing. We want peace. But we also must recognize that you've got to do more than just want peace. You have got to prevent what is happening down there to people who want peace also, but are not allowed to have it because of outside forces that are seizing upon their situation and hoping to further their own ideological aims. Q. Sir, do you feel that people support your policies in Central America? A. Those that have been informed and understand it do. I just met with some today who made it evident that they did. Now if we all get together and explain what's happening down there, perhaps that'll resolve the situation in that regard. Now, Ben Taylor? Possible Hostile Incident Q. Mr. President, if there is an incident where the American forces down there that are engaging in the military exercises are fired upon and they are forced to fire back, do you see any contingency where such an incident might lead to deeper American involvement in Central America? A. No, I don't, really, because I don't foresee - first of all those maneuvers that are going to be held in Honduras are not going to put Americans in any reasonable proximity to the border. It would have to be something in the nature of a terrorist attack, something of that kind. And I think that any of us - that could happen in a base here in America. And again I believe that those people who have taken it upon themselves to be our defenders and protectors have a right to defend and protect their own lives. Q. To follow up, sir, if Nicaragua attacks Honduras, would the United States assist Honduras militarily under the terms of the Rio Mutual Defense Pact Treaty? A. Well, we haven't considered that but a great many people should know that since 1947 - and so obviously our Administration didn't have anything to do with it - there is a pact, the Rio Pact, that says that any attack, or an attack on any American state shall be considered as an attack on all American states. Now that would require, of course, actual outside visible attack on a state, and I suppose by a country flying under its own flag instead of under surrogate troops. So we would have to deal with that problem when it arose and deal with it with all of our neighbors and friends in the Organization of American States. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to give you a chance to silence this drumbeat of confusion that you were talking about. Why not say categorically that Central America will not be another Vietnam, that under no circumstances will you impose U.S. troops in a combat situation in Central America? A. Well, I said the last time we gathered that there is something - I can make every assurance in the world that we have no such plans, we have no desire, nor do the countries down there want us involved in that way. But I used an expression that has been used by Presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and others, and that is that a President should never say ''never.'' Because that's a hypothetical question that then asks you to try to predict what could possibly take place in the future, and I just don't believe you can answer a hypothetical question. Q. Can I follow up? What about increasing the number of U.S. advisers in El Salvador - are you planning to at all? A. No one has presented a proposal to me about increasing the number. There's no question that 55 of them -if there was an increase - probably we could train the Salvadoran Army and its new recruits that are coming in actually requiring basic training a little faster than we're doing it. But there's been no proposal for such an increase. Aid to Latin America Q. Mr. President, since you yourself have identified massive social problems as one of the root causes of the troubles in Central America, are you prepared to make a commitment to substantial U.S. aid on the order of the Marshall Plan if the hostilities down there can be calmed? A. Well, what we've appointed a commission for - the Kissingerchaired commission - is for the purpose of coming up and recommending a long-range plan that would particularly deal with the things that you mention. There's no question that our neighbors to the south have for too many years suffered revolutions in which one set of rulers simply were exchanged for another set of rulers. And there's no question but their economic and social policies have left much to be desired as far as the opportunity for the great mass of their people. And what we want is a long-range policy - and this is what I discussed when I visited there and in South America, and discussed with them how we can have the kind of development that will make these countries economically self-sufficient, that will give them a standard of living in which there isn't the fertile soil that is presently there for subversion, for people offering promises of pie in the sky and then arouse them to revolution. And to, in other words, have a program that makes all of the nations here in the Americas equal partners in the development of this Western Hemisphere; and what a great power for good that we could be if we were so organized. And we want - this is my dream and it's what I hope that the commission will come back with. Q. Sir, is the United States prepared to make the kind of massive dollar commitment that that would undoubtedly entail? A. It does not follow that it has to undoubtedly entail that. For example, many of those countries are considered too high a risk for private investment. If, together, we could agree upon guarantees that investment would not be confiscated, taken over by governments and in changes of government and so forth, there is far more in the private investment pool, far more for there than any government could possibly do. And, it is to find out what is practical and what can be done. And we're not completely alone in this, because our allies, the other industrial nations in the world, have made it plain to us, and again at Williamsburg, that not only here in our Hemisphere, but in their own, we want to come up and find ways that can help the developing part of the world, and help them to faster development and a better way of life. Sam? Withdrawal in Lebanon Q. Sir, the Lebanese President said this past week that the Israeli partial withdrawal in Lebanon amounted to de facto partition of that country. Do you agree? A. No, I am very hopeful that if this partial withdrawal takes place that it will be recognized and admitted to be by the Israelis as one phase of their agreement to withdraw. If they withdraw in a phased withdrawal it certainly will give us a better case for breaking the roadblock that has been established by Syria and pursuading them to keep their original promise that when others withdrew, they would withdraw. I can't answer as to whether that is the way that this is going to perceived, or whether the Israelis will admit to it or not, but I will be talking in a couple of days with the two ministers who are here from Israel and about this very thing. But if this is a phased withdrawal, I think there is fear if there's simply a withdrawal to another line and then a digging-in and fortifying along that line, that this would be what it looks like Syria is doing, and that is simply trying to partition Lebanon, reduce Lebanon and grab off some territory for themselves. But with the agreement that's been signed between Lebanon and Israel, I don't think Israel has that in mind. Q. Sir, what would happen if Lebanon is partitioned? Would it be that awful? A. I just believe that the people of a country have a right to determine their own destiny, choose their own government and, if it was petitioned, it would be occupation by other countries, and yes, I think that is awful. We set out to help Lebanon after all these years of strife, regain sovereignty of its own land, protection of its own borders, and we're helping in every way we can to bring that about. I have to turn in some other direction here. Chris? Kissinger Role on Panel Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the chairman of your new commission on Central America, Dr. Henry Kissinger. There have been, as you know, a number of charges over the years that Mr. Kissinger, during the Nixon years, tried to destabilize the duly elected Government of Chile, and that he also once told a Chilean official that whatever happens in the south is of no importance. Did you check into Mr. Kissinger's record on Latin America before you appointed him? A. I know what his position was prior to my taking over this office and how seriously he considered the problems that are going on. Remember, Salvador didn't start with us - it was already in turmoil before we got here. And I know how he feels about that and I know also that there is no hard and fast - well, let me put it this way - I think there are some stereotypes about Mr. Kissinger that a little actual reading and rereading of the history would indicate that those stereotypes are not necessarily valid. No Women on Commission Q. Let me follow up with another question about the commission. You talk a lot here, and your aides do, about the ''gender gap,'' and yet that commission was appointed 12 men, no women. Doesn't that add to the perception that you're insensitive to women? A. It might add to the perception and that's all it is, is a perception, because if anyone really wants to dig into the facts, I will match our record against any other Administration that has ever been here with regard to what we have accomplished for women in the field of economics, our tax policies that reduced and hopefully will in the near future eliminate the marriage penalty tax, the measures that we passed on the I.R.A.'s that not only working women, but housewives, can have these tax-free savings accounts. We have almost doubled the tax credit for child care. But in addition to that, I noticed the other night that someone on the air was comparing our record to that of the previous Administration, and we came out a little behind with regard to the appointment of women to positions in Government, except that it turned out that without their acknowledging it, they were comparing the four-year record of the previous Administration with our first two years, and when you compare our first two years with their first two years, well, we're quite a ways out ahead. Q. Why are there no women on this commission? A. On this particular commission, maybe it's because that we're doing so much and appointing so many that we're no longer seeking a token or something. It just came out that these were the 12 we selected. We wanted six opponents and we wanted six on our side. But we've appointed over a thousand women in executive positions here in Government - three members of the Cabinet - never before in history - and one member of the Supreme Court. So I think our record - it's just a case of our record isn't known. Jerry? Source of Salvador Arms Q. Mr. President, since Cuba has repeatedly been labeled as the fountainhead of most of the violence in Central America, why has your Administration elected to go to the recipients of the arms and the equipment that comes in instead of going to the source? A. Well, we have interdicted some of the supplies that are going from Nicaragua over to El Salvador. If you go to the source, I think you're talking about the Soviet Union. They know, and we have communicated to them, how we feel about this, and we have also to our friends in Cuba and told them how we feel about it. We are trying to bring about the very thing that all of you seem to think we're shying away from, and that is not broadening a war but trying to limit it and trying to bring about a peaceful and political settlement in Central America. Confusion About Aims Q. Mr. President, in reply to Helen's question, you spoke of confusion, but isn't this Administration to blame for much of that confusion. Some of our own ambassadors in Central America were taken by surprise by the maneuvers. Some of the friendly governments, especially in the Contadora group were puzzled by your latest actions. My question is, why was there not more prior consultation, and what can you do now to reassure any of those friendly governments that we're not today closer to war down there than we were last week? A. Well, as I told you, I've sent letters to all four leaders of the Contadora countries. And I don't think that there is that much disturbance among our friends and allies about this. Sometimes there's a slip-up and an ambassador doesn't find out something they should find out soon enough in advance. As a matter of fact I received a cable from one about that. My most recent appointee is to the Ambassador of Austria and Helene let me know that something had taken place and she hadn't been told about it in advance, and when Helene speaks, I listen. Q. Who do you think it is to blame Q. Who do you think it is to blame for this confusion you spoke of now? A. I don't think there is as much confusion as they're trying to point out about this. The training feature with Honduras - this has been well advertised and known for a long, long time, that is going to take place. And as I say we regularly conduct joint maneuvers with, very often not only on land, but with the navies of our friends and allies in Central and South America. And so I just don't think that there's great confusion about this. Expansion of Covert Aid Q. Mr. President, is it true that you're planning a vast expansion of covert aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua? And what would Congressional action to cut off such aid mean to your efforts in Central America? A. Well I think it would be a very, very grave mistake if the Legislature interfered with what we're trying to do and we're trying to keep them aprised of our actions. I can't answer your question about covert aid. I think this is like discussing intelligence matters. If you discuss covert aid, it's no longer covert. So I can only tell you that we're continuing on a policy that we believe is aimed at, first of all, bringing about peace in El Salvador, hopefully through negotiations with those who are presently radicals and fighting as guerrillas. And in Nicaragua, hoping that we can persuade the Nicaraguan, the Sandinista Government, to return to the principles of the revolution and which they in writing guaranteed to the Organization of American States, what's going to be the policy of their government. Q. About the covert aid, Mr. President, given the fact that these covert operations are not so covert anymore, haven't we reached a point where it really might make more sense to do things on an overt basis and, in other words, hasn't the thing really become counterproductive? A. No. No, I don't think so. And I think what we're doing is well within the limits of common sense and those who are attempting to make it impossible for us to bring aid down in that area, I think are the ones who are building up, if they have their way, to a giant headache down the road aways. And we're trying to prevent such a headache from coming about. Carter Briefing Book Issue Q. Could you tell us what possible crime could be involved in the Carter briefing book caper to justify calling out the F.B.I.? A. There you go again. I just couldn't help that. I thought we were going to set a record, and I was going to go upstairs and be able to say how about that, not a single question on it. I can't think of - this is why when this charge was made - allegation was made - this is why I said there's only one answer to this. Certainly the best investigative force in the United States is the Federal Bureau of Investigation and I have told them to go completely to the bottom of this to see if there was any wrongdoing, to see if there was anything unethical in what had taken place and I have told all of our people to make themselves available - anyone who knows anything about this, and that includes me, and I didn't know anything about it until I read it in the paper - that to get to the bottom of this so that everyone in this country can be reassured that we know the truth. Q. Yes sir, but my question was what crime, or would you deny the possibility that all of this is little more than Washington Post, National Inquirer-style summer theater. A. Oh, you're tempting me. We'll find out when the investigation is completed. There are any number of things contained in the allegations and the wild flurry that immediately followed this. There could have been a break-in. Q. In the White House? A. That's what was alleged. That was what some of them said that this they suspected. I would have to tell you after having lived here for awhile that I don't think it's possible either. But also there could be the element of were these things actually stolen by someone in the White House? Was there involvement of White House staff in campaign activities who were supposed to be performing other government positions? There are any number of things that should be looked at.

1211-> SOUTH AFRICA SAYS IT KILLED 96 NAMIBIA REBELS
West Africa, Feb. 19 (AP) - South African military authorities said tonight that their troops had killed 96 black nationalist guerrillas in the last few days in South-West Africa. They said the rebels had sought to begin a new offensive in the territory. The South-West Africa Territory Force said the guerrillas had infiltrated a wide area across the north of the territory, which is also known as Namibia, from bases in southern Angola. The report came a week before new talks are to take place between South Africa and Angola in attempts to arrange a formal cease-fire on the Namibian-Angolan border. There have been reports recently that a de facto cease-fire has gone into effect. The chief targets of the guerrilla drive ''appear to be traditional leaders'' in Ovambo and Kavango Provinces, ''local farmers and farmhouses,'' the statement said. ''Follow-up operations are in progress and the security forces are following all tracks.'' South African Mandate Revoked Guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization led by Sam Nujoma have waged a 17-year bush war to end the rule of the white-minority South African Government over Namibia. The United Nations has revoked South Africa's 1919 League of Nations mandate to govern the former German colony. Five Western nations, including the United States, are trying to negotiate a peace agreement and independence plan for the territory. The United States has joined South Africa in insisting that Cuba remove approximately 30,000 of its soldiers from Angola, which is ruled by a Marxist regime, if South Africa withdraws from Namibia. The South African forces said 17 guerrillas were killed last Tuesday in Western Ovamboland and 34 more were slain in a second round of fighting in the same area. ''The rest were shot dead by security forces in the east of the operational area,'' the statement said. Snipers' Rifles Reported Some guerrillas ''were carrying Dragonov sniper's rifles for the assassination of leaders,'' according to the statement. It said others wore civilian clothes and carried South African currency in their backpacks. In recent years the nationalist guerrillas have infiltrated white farming areas in northern Namibia at the end of the rainy season, usually in March and April, when the bush provides better cover. The statement said the most recent drive had begun earlier than usual. The Angolans confirmed for the first time today that a new round of talks with their South African enemy would take place. The official Angolan press agency, Angop, said in a dispatch from Luanda, the Angolan capital, that the Government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had agreed to the talks. The dispatch, received in Lisbon, Portugal, did not elaborate on a time or place for the meetings. The South African Foreign Ministry said Friday that the talks would be held in the Cape Verde Islands off the West African coast sometime this week. The first meeting took place Dec. 7 in the Cape Verde Islands, and reports of an imminent cease-fire in Namibia followed. But South African officials say the chances of such an agreement are doubtful.

1212-> POP: MORGANA KING, SINGER, AT TUESDAY'S
Morgana King's mannered pop singing, with its stealthy phrasing, foggy timbre and other-worldly high notes, isn't a style suited to the broadest spectrum of pop music. But given well chosen ballads and sensitive instrumental support, Miss King can weave an intoxicating spell. And at Fat Tuesday's, where she is backed by an excellent trio, all the right ingredients worked together harmoniously for her. The special aura that Miss King conveys is an intense, remembered sensuality. And at Thursday's second show, the singer turned ''Out of Nowhere,'' ''Through the Eyes of Love'' and a medley of ''When I Fall in Love'' and ''Teach Me Tonight'' into dreamily romantic tone poems. Miss King invariably followed the beat, occasionally ornamenting her material with languid scat phrasing and then slipping into an ethereal upper register that extended to a D above high C. Such was her intensity that even the soupy pop-soul ballad ''With You I'm Born Again'' radiated with conviction. Her engagement ends tonight. Stephen Holden

1213-> POSTINGS; WALL ST. RESTORATION
The 1918 neo-Georgian building at 30 Wall Street has been the headquarters of the Seamen's Bank for Savings since 1954. But with the bank vacating more than three of its 12 floors for another location and the building sold to investors, the old Federal Office of the Assay - once the place to go to make deposits of gold in forms as varied as eyeglasses or teeth -is in for a facelift. David W. Levinson, senior vice president of Williams Real Estate, which is supervising the renovation, said the improvements would restore some of the building's historic flavor and make the main entrance more imposing. Space will rent for about $35 a foot. Despite its sale of the structure, Seamen's will maintain a branch and executive offices in the building.

1215-> STAGE VIEW; A PLAY THAT FALLS VICTIM TO ITS AUTHOR'S ATTENTIONS
In a way, Arthur Miller seems as obsessed with his play ''A View From the Bridge'' as the play's longshoreman hero, Eddie Carbone, is obsessed with desire for the niece he has taken into his home and reared. One feels that ever since ''A View From the Bridge'' was first seen here in 1955, Mr. Miller has stared at it, brooded over it, prodded it and manipulated it and stretched it every which way, unable to put it down until he'd made it grow up. And we know there have been times in the past when this sort of self-critical reworking produced admirable results for one or another playwright. There are also times when it produces a kind of dramatic forgetfulness: the author has tampered with the text so often that he's quite forgotten what's in it and what's not, whereupon he winds up doing some scenes three or four times over and some scenes not at all. In which case the play isn't really rewritten, it's just overwritten. I'm afraid that ''A View From the Bridge'' now belongs to this latter group, victim of the very propinquity that proved so troublesome to Eddie Carbone. The overwriting is utterly fatal to generous Eddie. It is clear from the outset that Mr. Miller means us to see the Italianate Eddie from Brooklyn - volatile, expansive, proud - as an at least quasitragic figure. We are introduced right off to a neighborhood lawyer who serves as a one-man Chorus, free to edge in from the wings and plant himself in a spotlight so that he can confide in us the dire things to come. Speaking in phrases that are somewhat on the pompous side, he tells us that poor Eddie ''never expected to have a Destiny,'' though plainly a Destiny lies in wait for him. ''Now,'' he adds, ''as the months passed, there was A Trouble that would not go away.'' As you can see, his conversation tends to sound clotted with Capital Letters, though actor Robert Prosky does his level and often effective best to make his prophetic utterances sound like casual street speech. In any event, we have been alerted. We know what to look for. Unfortunately, as we look for it, following Eddie into his Red Hook living room beneath the frayed fringe of a bell-shaped lamp, we don't find it. Eddie doesn't seem tragic. He seems either retarded or very hard of hearing. Not during the first few minutes, perhaps. Home after a day's work on the docks to greet his wife (Rose Gregorio) matter-of-factly, and his niece (Saundra Santiago) a great deal more warmly, he momentarily keeps his unconscious longings for the girl genuinely unconscious. If he caresses her shoulders briefly, the caress is offhand, paternal. If he backs away a few feet to admire her the more (''You are the Madonna type''), his interest might be called esthetic. Even as he resists the notion of her leaving business school and taking a job in a not especially safe section of the borough, he seems earnestly concerned for her welfare rather than unduly alarmed over her slipping from his grasp. Eddie, in the person of actor Tony LoBianco, is plainly overprotective but not necessarily a bundle of secret lusts. Good enough. What is not good enough - what is on occasion unintentionally funny - is the terrible obtuseness that follows. In scene after scene Eddie is given the message - urgently, loudly, desperately in some cases - that his interest in the 18-year-old is dangerously excessive. Eddie hears what is being said to him, even argues with it, hands trembling the while. Yet, as dramatist Miller has diagrammed the action of his play, no matter what is said to his hero and no matter what his hero says in return, Eddie Carbone's physical desire for his niece is apparently supposed to remain unconscious from 8 o'clock right down to a climactic knife-fight that comes along about 10:20. It is a staggering ambiguity - why not say impossibility? - to conjure with. His wife has spelled out the truth for him. Quietly but straightforwardly she has begun by asking a question: ''When am I gonna be a wife again, Eddie?'' Though Eddie has threshed about the room evasively without being able to form an adequate answer, she has zeroed in on the girl and the circumscribed life he's carved out for her. Only an extraordinarily dense person (a person not dramatically interesting) would fail to make the connection. When Eddie does so fail, his wife encourages the girl herself, who has fallen in love with a young illegal immigrant, to take steps to free herself. The girl, loyal to the Eddie who has always been kind to her, supposes that he simply doesn't ''like'' her boyfriend. ''Was there ever any fella he liked for you?'' the wife asks, pressing the girl to face facts. The lawyer has spelled it out for Eddie, plainer than plain. He begins with a relatively cautious ''Sometimes there's too much, Eddie, too much love for a daughter, too much love for a niece,'' then rises to a passionate crescendo. ''You can't marry her, can you?'' he roars at the bullheaded uncle, without budging him or awakening him to his own feelings. Even Eddie himself has seemed half-aware of his actual feelings now and again. Conscious of the girl's maturing sexuality, he dislikes her walking ''wavy.'' If he laughs off her protests (her reiterated ''I'm not a baby!''), he remains sternly overprotective - and knows that his concern is a bit much. ''I guess I'd never figured on one thing,'' he confesses to her fairly early in the saga. What hadn't he figured on? ''That you'd ever grow up,'' he admits. He sometimes seems to understand just enough about himself to have saved everybody else an awful lot of trouble. But no, he doesn't understand. We come to 10:20 and that knifefight that will leave Eddie dead on the street. We have by now played every key confrontation (Eddie-wife, Eddie-lawyer, Eddie-girl, Eddie-girl's lover) some two or three times, we've rehashed every available argument until we can recite its contours with director Arvin Brown's company. Just before Eddie goes into battle with a man he's betrayed to the immigration authorities (in an indirect effort to nail the young lover), Eddie's wife shakes her head ruefully and remarks that it's all come about because of something he wants and can't have. Suddenly he is stunned, aghast, shocked within an inch of his highly moral life. ''Is that what you think of me?,'' he roars in mighty injury, ''That I would have such a thought?'' If we had ever been able to believe in Eddie's ignorance of his own motives, this outburst would now constitute a fine irony. But we haven't believed, literally haven't been allowed to believe. Eddie's motives have been so stressed and overstressed, so explained and analyzed, so subjected to chalk-talk illustration that we are weary with the very thought of them - they were, after all, simple and obvious to begin with. (Eddie's kissing the girl's lover in an effort to prove him homosexual is blurred in the staging here, so thrown away that it makes no point at all.) In the end we are astonished, all right, but only at Eddie's astonishment. Even as the play has been groaning under the weight of repetition, it has skimped here and there on vital matters. We aren't present, for instance, for the moment in which the immigrant boy (James Hayden) and the girl first confess their love for each other. Not that we are in sore need of love scenes as such. And there is a followup romantic interlude in which, before taking themselves to the nearest bed, they make back-reference to the fact that they have already planned to get married. But what happened to that nervous, courageous encounter in which they dared make the choice? Given the impact that their decision will have upon Eddie, and given their full awareness of what that impact is likely to be, such a scene might very well have interested us. But it is quite difficult to keep our interest alive in any of the stubborn, headlong yet essentially ineffectual things the figureheads of this play keep doing. Mr. LoBianco's Eddie is certainly energetic; and in the few instances in which he is allowed to evoke an atmosphere beyond the confines of the living room - the heady aroma, say, of a coffee ship pulling into port - he makes the image vivid. But the energy he keeps pumping up is indiscriminately applied, spattering everyone within reach like grease from an overheated frying pan. No matter how extensive his fidgets, there is really no dimension to the role apart from his faintly symbolic function as Householder Infatuated with Niece. We don't honestly know anything about him in any of his other possible contexts. As for the attractive Miss Santiago, she is simply Niece, and as I watched her cradle the dying Eddie in her arms (Madonna style), I half expected her to sing the aria she was so patently poised for. Miss Gregorio, Wife, is condemned by Mr. Brown's constricted stage direction to sit limply by while her world comes apart (was the staging this constricted when it was first arranged last season at New Haven's Long Wharf?), and Mr. Hayden is reasonably appealing as the Available Young Lover (though we never really discover why Eddie's bowling friends find him so funny). Alan Feinstein, as yet another smuggled-in kinsman, is quite good. We know from past pleasures that author Miller can draw people (no capital letters). Here he has provided all the tumultuous gestures of a play without giving its participants genuine identities. It seems odd that he should have devoted himself so extensively to so arbitrary a task.

1217-> FINANCE BOND NEWS; Long Island Utility Sells 12 5/8% Bonds
The Long Island Lighting Company sold $75 million of 12 5/8 percent bonds due in 1992, offered through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation at a price of 99.82 to yield 12.85 percent to maturity. The yield for the bonds was less than that proposed by two other groups of underwriters who also bid for the issue. One group proposed 13 percent bonds that would have been publicly offered at par to yield 13 percent, while another proposed 13 1/4 percent bonds, also with a public offering price of par. Earlier this month, both major rating agencies downgraded the utility's bonds, citing the delay in opening the Shoreham nuclear plant. Moody's rated the new bonds Baa-3, its lowest investment grade, while Standard & Poor's rated the bonds BB+, its highest quality rating in the speculative category. In a separate financing, the Long Island utility sold 2.5 million shares of $25 preferred stock. Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company offered the stock at $27.50 a share with an annual dividend of $3.52 a share to yield 12.8 percent.

1218-> STORM BURIES SCHEDULE
The near-blizzard that stormed into the Northeast sector of the country on Friday continued yesterday to force postponements and cancellations of athletic events, including the Vitalis/ U.S. Olympic Invitational track-and-field meet at Byrne Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. The snow also forced the indefinite postponement of a National Hockey League game between Toronto and the Bruins in Boston, closed most of the thoroughbred and harness racing tracks in the affected area and forced officials to put off dozens of college basketball games, including Connecticut at St. John's. The track-and-field meet was rescheduled for Sunday, Feb. 27, after meet officials decided to bow to local transportation problems and the inability of many athletes get to the arena. The official said they hope to hold the competition in the afternoon, rather than at night, as is customary, although they are not certain the arena will be ready after a Saturday night basketball game. The new date will be two days after the USA/Mobil national championships at Madison Square Garden, which means that most of the important athletes will be in the metropolitan area that weekend. Yesterday morning, when the major local airports were closed, many of the track-and-field stars had not arrived, including several who had competed on Friday night in San Francisco. No officials could remember when another major indoor meet had been postponed by bad weather. Aqueduct race track in Ozone Park, Queens, not only canceled yesterday's card which was to have featured the $50,000 Whirlaway Stakes, but track officials also decided to keep the Big A dark today as well. Friday's card had been limited to four races before the heavy snow made further racing impossible. The Whirlaway Stakes will be run tomorrow if the track is able to operate. The Meadowlands and Roosevelt Raceway, harness racing tracks, put off their cards yesterday and hope to reopen tomorrow. Both are normally closed on Sunday. Other major Eastern race tracks that canceled their programs yesterday included Keystone and Liberty Bell in Pennsylvania, Bowie in Maryland and Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts. Keystone hopes to resume racing on Tuesday, and Liberty Bell and Suffolk Downs do not plan to open again until Wednesday. Among the many major college basketball games that were postponed was a Big East matchup between Connecticut and St. John's in Jamaica, Queens. The visitors left Storrs, Conn., on Friday afternoon, but were forced by the snow to stop in Stamford, Conn., where they spent the night in a motel and then headed back home yesterday. The game has tentatively been rescheduled for Thursday night at St. John's Alumni Hall. Another Big East postponement was in Landover, Md., where Georgetown and Syracuse had been scheduled to play at the Capital Centre. A meeting between Fordham and Manhattan on the Jaspers' home court was rescheduled for Feb. 24. Army and Iona were originally postponed in New Rochelle on Friday night, but yesterday afternoon's rescheduleding was also put off until tomorrow night. Other Eastern games postponed were Drexel Tech at Hofstra (to be played tomorrow night), C.W. Post at Pratt, St. Bonaventure at George Washington, St. Francis (Pa.) at Loyola (Md.), Frostburg State at Salisbury State, Brooklyn College and Navy, Fairfield at St. Peter's and Maryland at Duke. Two exhibition games featuring the Harlem Globetrotters at the Spectrum in Philadelphia were canceled when the teams found it impossible to arrive.

1219-> ROCK: POLICE PERFORM FOR 70,000 AT SHEA STADIUM
''We'd like to thank the Beatles for lending us their stadium,'' said Sting, the bassist and singer of the Police, near the end of the trio's concert at Shea Stadium. The group topped the Shea Stadium attendance figures for the Beatles and everyone else on Thursday night because a way was found to pack in 70,000 people for a sold-out performance. That meant shoulder-to-shoulder standing room on the field and completely full bleachers, and a bit of rain for those who arrived on time, but the mood of the crowd was pure exhilaration. It is a good sign that the Police can draw so many people and satisfy them, because the band's music works radical changes on what rock- arena audiences came to expect in the 1970's. The band's songs are light, not ponderous; introspective rather than aggressive; syncopated, not stomping, and more clever than simple-minded. Sting's lyrics even drop names like Nabokov and Scylla and Charybdis. Just about every Police song has a fleet, irresistible groove that might hint at reggae, African pop, funk, classical minimalism or rock. No single instrument sticks out; Sting's bass lines mesh with Stewart Copeland's articulate drumming, while the guitarist Andy Summers plays cross-rhythmic chords or floating washes of sound. Above and around the beat, Sting sings in a high tenor about mystical notions like Jung's ''Synchronicity'' (the title of the band's current album) or about loneliness laced with paranoia, as in Police hits like ''Every Breath You Take'' or ''Message in a Bottle.'' What makes the Police stand out among performing bands is that it never bothers to imitate its records. The trio couldn't if it tried, since band members overdub extra instruments in the recording studio. So it goes to the other extreme, revamping every song in a gleeful whirl of improvisation. The Police is one of the few rock bands - along with the Rolling Stones, the Talking Heads and the Grateful Dead - that is willing to shake up its arrangements nightly. That takes concentration, and the band's fingers were so busy that the players had no time for typical arena theatrics. Sting would occasionally cue the audience to sing along, and sometimes Mr. Summers would do jumping jacks on the beat. But the three video screens above and flanking the stage at Shea Stadium usually presented a much more visually active show, with rhythmic cross-cutting from player to player, than was actually occurring onstage. Yet the audience responded, not to showboating, but to intricate music- making. Although the Police added two female backup singers on one song and a bassist on another, along with an occasional repeating lick from a synthesizer, the bulk of the set thrived on the players' spontaneous three-way interplay. The band members took out their virtuosity on rhythm and texture rather than on individual display. Mr. Copeland ranged over a standard drum kit laced with all sorts of exotic percussion to find the right click or bonk for each off beat, while Mr. Summers and Sting chased each other through some songs in such close pursuit that they seemed to switch rhythm parts. Instead of stretching songs with long solos, the Police would slow down the groove for echoed, dub-style interludes for full trio. The concert was full of the kind of jubilant, daredevil group playing that is rarely heard on rock stages anywhere - much less at Shea Stadium. The Police's set seemed all the more innovative since it followed Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, which is the same old arena rock with a gender change. The group, minus video blowups, stomped out its own hard- rock songs and cover versions of 1960's hits while Miss Jett - who was virtually microscopic from the bleachers - hopped up and down and waved her arms. The music crunched and thudded in appropriate places, but it came across as an old routine.

1220-> CASHING IN ON COOKIE CRAZE
With a favorite recipe, an image of home-baked goodness and help from her husband - a professional financial adviser - a 26-year-old woman has built a $30 million cookie chain on the West Coast that is now heading East. Six years ago Debra Fields decided to offer her popular nut-filled chocolate chip cookies commercially. With $50,000 from her husband, Randall, 35, she opened a small store near the Stanford University campus here; today, the business has grown into a 63-store chain. East Coast Next Target Mrs. Fields Cookies Inc. - now a subsidiary of Mr. Fields's private financial services company headquartered in Park City, Utah - extends across five Western states, Illinois and Wisconsin. And Mrs. Fields hopes by spring to have stores in Boston, Miami and New York. ''We expect to open 20 stores in the New York metropolitan area alone,'' she says. In the West, the red and white Mrs. Fields stores - staffed by women in long, colorful skirts and ruffled blouses - are popular attractions in malls and urban centers. On a recent rainy night, the store along San Francisco's Pier 39 had a line of customers extending out the door. Mrs. Fields is by no means the only one in the gourmet cookie business. The ''industry'' dates from the early 1970's and includes such established players as Famous Amos Inc., David's Cookies, the Original Cookie Company and the Great American Chocolate Chip Cookie. All are privately held except the last, which is a unit of the Cole National Corporation of Cleveland. Additionally, food industry analysts say there are hundreds of small, one- and two-shop concerns around the United States that do nothing but sell cookies. David Liederman, chairman and founder of the 71-store David's Cookies chain, estimates that the gourmet stores take in $80 million a year. Part of the reason for their popularity could be the growing interest in healthful eating. ''When you buy a cookie baked on the premises with only natural ingredients, you feel like you're doing something good for yourself,'' says David Weinstein, a professor of marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ''It's a very different business from buying a packaged cookie.'' Started With Street Sales But Mrs. Fields says that in 1977, when her first store opened, Palo Alto residents, at least, were unaccustomed to buying fresh cookies. In response, Mrs. Fields took to the streets here with cookie sheet in hand to give out samples. ''It was the only way I could get people in the store,'' Mrs. Fields recalls. ''My feeling was that if you gave away cookies that were hot, chewy and delicious, people would come back for more and more.'' Indeed, what makes the cookies special, the company says, is that it prepares all its products on location. What is more, the company says it refuses to package its cookies for department-store sales and has spurned repeated requests to sell franchises. Mrs. Fields's employees - 600 of them in all - mix eggs, flour, butter, milk and a heavy lacing of chocolate chips and nuts in 40-pound batches that they hand-shape into oversized disks. The company says that customers always get fresh hot cookies; it gives to charity any more than two hours old. Mrs. Fields's dedication to quality, coupled with her husband's expertise, seem to have paid off. Sales have risen from $200,000 in 1977 to more than $30 million in the current fiscal year. Projections are for more than $60 million next year. As part of a private company, Mrs. Fields Cookies does not release earnings. But Mrs. Fields says the chain is ''very profitable.'' As evidence, she cites her $50,000 corporate contribution to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation last year, the largest it received. Professional Financial Help Mrs. Fields is chairman and chief executive of her company, but as she says, ''My heart is still in the kitchen.'' While she makes the decisions on products and new stores, the financial side of the business is handled by her husband, in his role as chairman of the Fields Financial Corporation, a financial services company founded in 1981. Fields Financial manages $60 million in assets for a number of major corporate clients, according to the company. Mrs. Fields Cookies plans to open its Miami and New York stores April 1, then follow with Boston outlets. The average cost of opening a store is $150,000, Mrs. Fields estimates. The East Coast already has its share of cookie outlets, however, with Famous Amos and David's Cookies, among the more successful. Mr. Liederman of David's Cookies believes the business is already saturated and says ''the shakeout has begun.'' But he expects he and Mrs. Fields will have no trouble surviving. In fact, he predicts that in the next two to three years the two chains ''will be going headto-head for the prime locations around the country.''

1221-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Former Avis President Chosen Boscom Chief
When Norton Simon Inc.'s troubled Avis division announced the sudden resignation last month of Howard C. Miller Jr., its president and chief operating officer, it said he planned to pursue ''personal business interests.'' An announcement yesterday by the FMR Corporation made clear that Mr. Miller's new business will be far different from renting cars. FMR, a Boston financial services and real estate company, said it had named Mr. Miller as chief executive officer of Boscom, an electronics trade center it plans to build on Commonwealth Pier in Boston Harbor. The development, scheduled for completion in mid-1984, will house showrooms and display areas for manufacturers of computers, telecommunications equipment and other products. Mr. Miller, 56, was not available for comment yesterday, but an FMR spokesman said he would be responsible for leasing space in the center and managing all its other operations. FMR said it had received advance commitments from more than 100 companies to lease permanent showrooms in the Boscom complex. Mr. Miller became president and chief operating officer of Avis, the nation's second-largest car rental company after the Hertz Corporation, in April 1982. He had also been in charge of the Avis from 1968 to 1972 as a group vice president of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, which then owned the car renter. From 1972 to 1981, he was president of the Canteen Corporation, a major industrial catering company.

1222-> Core of Soviet Satellite May Crash This Week
The Soviet Union told the United Nations Friday that the nuclear fuel core of its Cosmos 1402 satellite would enter the earth's atmosphere sometime between Thursday and Feb. 8 and burn up completely. Soviet officials officially notified Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations that the main part of the satellite entered the atmosphere over the central area of the Indian Ocean last Monday and ''ended its existence.'' ''The satellite's other fragment - the core of the energy unit reactor - will, according to projections, enter the dense layers of the atmosphere between 3 and 8 February 1983 and will burn up completely,'' the Soviet note said. The four-ton Cosmos 1402, used to track shipping, was launched last Aug. 30 and began to drop out of orbit earlier this month. The Soviet Union gave the United Nations details about the spacecraft under the terms of an international convention on the registration of objects launched into outer space.

1223-> AROUND THE NATION; Chavez Joins Marchers In Boycott of Campbell
Cesar Chavez, the leader of the United Farm Workers, today joined about 100 migrant farm workers who are on the last segment of a monthlong walk through Ohio and Pennsylvania symbolizing their demands for better pay and working conditions from the Campbell Soup Company. Mr. Chavez, who joined the marchers in the northwestern Philadelphia suburbs, said he planned to remain with them through Sunday, when they expect to reach the Campbell headquarters in Camden, N.J. He said the group's small size would not make a difference ''because what we're dealing with is a moral question, and you don't need a big crowd to affect people regarding moral issues.''

1224-> A GUIDE TO RENTAL VACATION PROPERTIES AVAILABLE IN EUROPE
IRELAND The Irish Tourist Board publishes a detailed 152-page book, ''Discover Ireland, Self-Catering,'' available free from their offices in New York (590 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036), Chicago and San Francisco. It gives information on 1,000 premises - thatched cottages, modernized farmhouses, Georgian houses, country homes - and is divided into eight regional sections. All the housing meets minimum standards laid down by the Tourist Board. Reservations can be made directly with the owners of the cottages or through regional tourist organizations (which charge a booking fee of $6). Among the most impressive new developments are the 11 Rent-an- Irish-Cottage village centers (six in County Clare, three in County Limerick and two in County Tipperary), which are built in traditional style with thatched roofs and open fires. Prices vary, but in the summer season range from about $220 for a two- bedroom cottage to $240 for three bedrooms. The cottages are equipped with all-electric kitchens. Babysitting, cleaning and other services can be arranged. Details, including prices, can be obtained from: Travel Division, Shannon Free Airport Office, Ireland House, 590 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036 (212-581-0480). Other properties can be had at lower prices; rates go down in the fall and winter. Among travel organizations specializing in self-catering vacations in Ireland are Lismore Travel , 106 East 31st Street, New York, N.Y. 10016 (212-685-0100) and Lynott Tours , 117 East 36th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016 (212-685-6630), which both represent the Rent-an-Irish Cottage plan; and O'Shea Tours , 195 South Broadway, Hicksville, N.Y. 11801 (516-681-2223), which handles other vacation properties in Ireland. FRANCE The gites, represented by the organization called Gites Ruraux de France , are holiday homes found throughout rural France that have been established with the financial support of the French Government, primarily, though not exclusively, for the enjoyment of the French and to promote tourism in out-of-the-way areas. The weekly rental for one of these houses, all of which are privately owned and usually accommodate four to six people, is generally less than $150 a week. Unfortunately, unlike Britain and Holland, the United States does not have a special allocation of g^ites bookable through a domestic agency. Americans must therefore first select the area where they would like to stay, then write to the individual department (region), the address of which is obtainable from the French Government Tourist Office (610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020) and in Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Or you can write to the Federation Nationale des G^ites Ruraux de France, 35 Rue Godot-de- Mauroy, 75009, Paris. It is always advisable to write in French and well in advance (by October of the previous year if you want a week in the peak holiday months). Linen rentals can be arranged. Vacation homes can also be rented through Vacances en Campagne , an English company that is represented in this country by DePetris and Stewart, 500 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036 (212-840-1520). The company's home address is Box Cottage, Sutton, Pulborough, Sussex RH20 1PS, England (tel: 07987-366). Villas International , 214 East 38th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016 (212-685- 4340), offers, in conjunction with Air France, a choice of 2,000 villas, apartments, cottages and chateaus throughout France (especially in Brittany and Provence.). Two agencies specializing in renting apartments in Paris are: Flatotel International , 43 Rue St. Charles, 75015 Paris (1-5775404). Studios (two people) to five-room duplex apartments. Price per day, for the studios, with a minimum of seven days, is around $27; duplex apartments, $120. Residences Charles Gullin , 10 Place Charles Gullin, 75018 Paris (1- 2571455). Studio apartments about $300 a week; three-room apartments, sleeping five, $540 a week. The best guide to holiday properties in France is Henderson McCartney's ''French Farm and Village Holiday Guide.'' It contains a section explaining how to make reservations directly with the owner (those who speak English are indicated; otherwise there's a translation of a standard letter of reservation). The book is distributed by Bradt Enterprises, 95 Harvey Street, Cambridge, Mass. 02140 (617- 492-8776) for $12.95, including postage. DENMARK The summer-house concept is a Scandinavian specialty, and it is these privately owned retreats that make up the majority of rentable accommodations. All are set in rural or coastal situations, and there's a high ratio of log cabins with open-plan living areas. In Denmark most visitors book through one of the main central booking agencies (most of the employees speak English). Two of the major agencies are: Dantourist , Hulgade 21, DK 5700, Svedbirg (phone 09--210741). Dansk Centralkontor for Summerhus-Udlejning A/S , Falkonercentret, Falkoner Alle 7, DK 2000, Copenhagen F. (01-190900). Prices range from $100 to $150 for a simple bungalow with two bedrooms to around $300 for a modern bungalow on a beach for six, fitted with such amenities as a dishwasher and sauna. The most popular areas for vacation homes are: North Jutland. A heavily wooded area renowned for its miles of deserted sandy beaches. North West Zeeland. Most of the houses lie within an hour's drive of Copenhagen, but there's plenty of countryside and several castles. Fyn. The island has long attracted Danish artists to its villages and small harbors. Bornholm. A quiet little island 105 miles from Copenhagen. (Access by direct flight from Copenhagen in 30 minutes. The off-peak round-trip fare is $50. There is also a seven-hour overnight ferry from Copenhagen that costs $11 one way.) SWEDEN In addition to privately owned summer houses, the central agencies' brochures list several ''chalet villages,'' groups of custom-built homes with a community center that invariably include a small restaurant, general store, laundromat and sauna, and sports facilities such as pony trekking or windsurfing. The most popular areas for summer houses, and the main agencies serving them (all with illustrated catalogues in English) are: The West Coast (fishing villages and Goteborg). The West Coast Tourist Board , Kungsportsplatsen 2, 41110 Gothenborg (031-115608). The Lake District, including the fjord-like lakes in the province of Dalsland.

SPAIN The Casas de Labranza (farmhouses) are similar to the French g^ites. More than 8,000 houses have been turned into vacation homes, with financial assistance from the Spanish Government. Most offer basic accommodations (many don't have electricity or hot water). They can only be booked by writing, in Spanish, directly to the owner. A book giving the address, type of accommodations and prices (as low as $25 a week) is available, for consultation only, at the Spanish National Tourist Office, 665 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022. While the book is not available for distribution, the office will mail out copies of individual pages, provided the inquirer specifies the province in which he or she wishes to rent. The most popular casas are found in the mountain regions near large cities, such as Barcelona, Valencia, Castellon, Seville, Huelva, Avila and Malaga. ITALY Brief information on renting vacation homes is included in a free booklet, ''General Information for Travelers in Italy,'' available from the Italian Government Travel Office, 630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10111, The office also has (but does not distribute) an annual guide listing 1,800 farms and other rural properties with a description (in Italian) of the facilities, position, prices, owner's name and address, and information on nearby archeological and historical sites. Prices start at less than $50 a week and go up to $600 for country mansions. The guide may be consulted at the travel office. Among agencies that list vacation properties in Italy are: At Home Abroad , 405 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y. 10022 (212-421-9165); and RAVE (Rent a Vacation Everywhere) , 500 Triangle Building, Rochester, N.Y. 14604 (716-454-6440). Cuendet, a Swiss agency, lists more than 1,000 properties in Tuscany, from the simple to the deluxe farmhouse. Prices range from $150 to $2,000. These properties can be rented through Cuendet's British agent, Chapter Travel, 102 St. John's Wood Terrace, London NW8 (01-722-0722).

1225-> Parcells Deliberates on Roster;
Decisions, decisions, decisions. With only two weeks remaining before the regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Rams, Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants has still not decided on such matters as his starting quarterback, place-kicker, tight end and right defensive end. Then there is the matter of reducing his roster from the current 70 to the final 49 players. Today, on the eve of an exhibition game against the Baltimore Colts at Giants Stadium, Parcells said he was not finding this all that easy. ''I spend three hours a day staring at that personnel board in my office,'' he said. ''It's like a trance.'' Brunner to Face Colts While Scott Brunner, who will start against the Colts, and Phil Simms compete for the No. 1 quarterback job, Parcells can afford to wait until next week before making his final decision. It is the same with his choice of Ali Haji-Sheikh, the rookie, or Joe Danelo, the incumbent, for kicking. Tom Mullady, last season's leading receiver for the Giants, will start Saturday night at tight end, but Parcells is waiting to see how his three rookies - Zeke Mowatt, Jamie Williams and Malcolm Scott - do in competition with Mullady and the other veteran, Gary Shirk. The coach said that it was ''possible'' he would start the season with three rookie tight ends but that ''I don't think that's desirable.'' Parcells is also hoping that Leonard Marshall, the slimmed second- round draft choice, can come on in the final two exhibitions to win the job at defensive right end from Dee Hardison. The next cutdown date is Tuesday, by which Parcells must reduce the roster by 10 players to reach an interim limit of 60. ''I don't want to waive any player I think has value in the league until I absolutely have to,'' he said, ''and I don't think I'll have to do that until the final cut.'' Taylor to See Some Action A week after ending his holdout, the all-pro linebacker Lawrence Taylor will get some playing time against Baltimore, but, Parcells said, will not start. . . . The Giants and the Colts each have 2-0 exhibition records, but Baltimore has not won a regular-season game since Dec. 20, 1981. . . . The Colts, who have been playing to win in the exhibition games, also have a quarterback battle, between Mike Pagel, last season's rookie starter, and Mark Herrmann, who was obtained in the John Elway trade with Denver. . . . Temperatures are expected to be in the 90's Saturday, and Parcells said that ''I hope it's 110'' for the 8 P.M. kickoff. He pointed out that the first three regular-season games, at home against the Rams and then at Atlanta and Dallas, could well be played in hot weather. Parcells worked his players hard this week and said they were a bit tired. . . . Definitely out of the game because of injuries are Floyd Eddings, Leon Bright, Karl Nelson and Billy Matthews. And Bill Neill, the starting nose guard, is also expected be out.

1226-> AN ITALIAN CONCERN CHARTS UNKNOWN OPERATIC TERRITORY
To the typical music history student of 25 years ago, Romantic Italian opera meant a brief discussion of Giuseppe Verdi with a nod in the direction of three predecessors and a sole heir. Nowadays, thanks to the bel canto revival and to musicology's stately forward march through the centuries, we are on much more familiar terms with Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti - but for most operagoers, large stretches of Italian history remain terra incognita. Who preceded the predecessors? Did Verdi have any competition in midcentury? What became of the inheritance when the heir, Giacomo Puccini, died in 1924? Charting unknown operatic territory is the prime mission of Edizioni Bongiovanni, a tiny Bolognese concern heretofore best known in recording circles for a series of fascinating vocal reissues. More recently there have been live recitals by the likes of Mirella Freni and Marilyn Horne, and now the company has embarked on what used to be pirate waters, issuing complete operas taped in performance. The releases thus far available include works of Ottorino Respighi, Errico Petrella and Tommaso Traetta, alongside unknown Donizetti and Rossini, with Alfredo Catalani to follow. None of these records features Maria Callas; indeed very few of the singers' names are familiar in the least. Clearly this is not mass-market strategy, but a dedicated effort to fill the historical gaps. The performances, too, are dedicated, and sometimes also satisfying. Studio remakes of these scores are unlikely (all the more so in the industry's current slump); the series will be invaluable to any collector or library interested in comprehensive documentation of musical theater in the Land of Song. The most interesting scores here are those of Respighi, whose star is now behind a cloud. Even his lavish orchestral pictorialization of Rome's fountains, flora and festivities have begun to slip from their stronghold in the symphonic repertory, and although ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' is not quite as condescending to him as the previous one was to Rachmaninoff, phrases like ''twittering trills'' and ''tinselly diatonic dissonances'' are prominent - among the praise. The situation was different in 1932 when, as one of the world's most feted composers, he came to preside over the world premiere of ''Maria Egiziaca'' as part of a four-day Respighi festival with the New York Philharmonic. But Grove's faint praise fades altogether before the blast of Lawrence Gilman in the Herald Tribune then: ''This is music so dull, so trite, so vapid, that one can only turn from it in deep, incredulous dismay.'' Credulity has perhaps been stretched, and the threshold of dismay raised, by the music of intervening years. At any rate, this ''concert triptych'' on the life of Mary of Egypt, who sins, is redeemed and seeks hermitage, impresses now as an attractive vehicle for a soprano of some vocal and emotional power. The singing on the Bongiovanni set (GB 2008/9), taped at a 1980 festival performance in Assisi, is competent in the main. Not competent in the title role is Javora Stoilova, a Bulgarian soprano who on this evidence owes herself a period of rest and renewed study. But Carlo Desideri (in the part sung at the Carnegie premiere by a little-known but promising baritone named Nelson Eddy) sings with vibrant, ringing tone, and Nazzareno Antinori as the sailor makes the authentic Italian tenor noise; if he can make it in more demanding roles as well he may help a bit to preserve this endangered species. Respighi's midcareer discovery of chant and archaic music figures prominently in the compositional processes of ''Maria,'' as it also does for ''Lucrezia'' (GB 2013/4), which was left unfinished at the composer's death in 1936. His wife and pupil, Elsa, completed the orchestration and saw the work launched with moderate success at La Scala. The recording only suggests what ''Lucrezia'' might sound like in a fully professional revival. Respighi's orchestration is at its richest (nothing twittering or tinselly here), and there is dramatic power: In the rape scene, especially, he catches an ugly, fevered momentum. But the student orchestra is badly out of its depth (''Maria'' has a different, better one), and the singing is good only in patches. Elizabeth Byrne in the title role displays a lovely and secure instrument; doubtless she will grow in imagination and personal projection. The baritone Daniel Washington sings Tarquinius beautifully, as long as the line does not lie too high for him. Giuseppe Morino, with a light voice that nevertheless recalls Franco Corelli in its timbre, quick vibrato, and individuality of utterance, is another young tenor to watch. A point about these operas that sticks in the mind as one proceeds to the earlier works in Bongiovanni's catalogue imported here by International Book and Record Distributors is Respighi's continuing faith in an Italian heritage of genuinely vocal writing. It is not just that the parts are grateful for a cantabile -based style of singing and lie comfortably for the normal voice ranges. More importantly, Respighi is often willing to confide the crux of his musical argument not to a milestone in the harmonic plan, nor to thematic reference or development, but to such an essentially vocal effect as a high note, a messa di voce, or an unaccompanied line of recitative. The operas need beautiful vocal sound and creative, resourceful singing because these, even though the composer can't make them happen, are a part of the composition itself in a way that they are not even with so songful a composer as Schubert. A corollary to this is that one cannot really speak of an Italian opera's worthiness for revival in the abstract. ''Maria Egiziaca'' may have merited revival 10 or 20 years ago for, say, Victoria de los Angeles or Magda Olivero, but - not the same opera without them - may not be worth reviving now. So also with ''Jone,'' an opera based on Bulwer-Lytton's novel ''Last Days of Pompeii,'' by Errico Petrella, one of several relatively successful toilers in Verdi's shadow. The score dates from 1858, and is a neat, routine compendium of the conventions the more famous composer was transforming or abandoning. There are large-scale duet confrontations on the ''Nabucco''/ ''Ernani'' model, telling little scene-preludes that recall Donizetti, some attractive andante arias, and quite a few rousing cabalettas (a form in which Petrella placed great faith). Donizetti himself is said to have hailed Petrella's melodic gift, and at times it is impressive; but his chief weakness (aside from conventionality) seems to have been the knack of turning out here and there an awkward, three- legged kind of tune that doesn't seem to cadence in the right place. Still, who knows what impression it might make with a Callas as Jone? The recorded performance (Caracas, 1981; GB 2020/12) is a hearty run- through by seasoned pros. Nothing tentative or student-like here, and the set is certainly worth hearing, but in reality this kind of singing is the opposite of what a Romantic revival needs: loud at the expense of beauty, agility, suppleness of line and variety of dynamic. (The soprano Adelaide Negri, who makes a better impression here than she did substituting for Renata Scotto in ''Norma'' recently, is a partial exception.) More likable as performances, though less valuable as documents, are Rossini's ''Demetrio e Polibio'' (GB 2002/2), his very first opera, and Donizetti's ''Olivo e Pasquale'' (GB 2005/7) - no, it isn't a sequel featuring the well-loved Don). Revivals of lesser-known bel canto operas are rather drastically subject to the law of diminishing returns. The occasional jot they add to our understanding of the composers is hardly enough to sustain interest over a full-length score in the absence of really striking individual portrayals or consistent command of period style. (Contrary to popular belief, a general revival of Donizettian and Rossinian singing has not yet taken place). Still, both these sets offer spirited music, most of it creditably and some of it bouyantly sung, and the playing of still another student orchestra (Opera Barga) under Bruno Rigacci is spry and trim. Tomasso Traetta was one of Rossini's more important precursors. His music is worth knowing about; on that count, the Bongiovanni release of ''The Rival Servants'' (GB 2003/4) should be discreetly ignored. The style is pure Italian Provincial, vintage circa 1950; the score is cut, rearranged and edited in a way that protects us from encountering the aspects of the piece or period that differ most from later, more familiar Italian comedies. All the Bongiovanni operas come with librettos, notes, and translations. The latter are quaint, sometimes obscure and often hilarious (one mezzo is commended to us as having ''a shrill voice with a wide range''). The sound, as usual with loud tapes, varies. The Respighi operas are short and come with bonuses: on ''Maria,'' some songs nicely done by Desideri; on ''Lucrezia,'' a Marcello cantata, heavily and charmlessly orchestrated by Respighi and sung the same way by Patricia Schraden.

1228-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Busy Night of Boxing
There will be 78 scheduled rounds of boxing, featuring world contenders from South America, on the undercard March 18 when Michael Spinks and Dwight Braxton fight for the unified light-heavyweight championship, it was announced yesterday by Butch Lewis, the promoter. The best of the undercard fighters may be Jose Flores, a high-ranking light-heavyweight from Uruguay, who will meet Dave Wigfall, a journeyman from Brockton, Mass., in one of the seven scheduled 10-rounders at Atlantic City's Convention Hall. Among the others featured are Ubaldo Sacco of Argentina, the South American junior welterweight champion, will face Willie Rodriguez, the former United States Boxing Association titleholder, and Elio Diaz of Venezuela, a ranking welterweight, will meet the former North American Boxing Federation champion, Bruce Finch. And for good measure, there will be a couple of four-rounders. ... Donnie Long of Akron, Ohio, who had been scheduled to fight John Tate, a former W.B.A. heavyweight champion on April 14, will not be able to keep that appointment. Long, 25, was convicted of murder in 1976 and then granted his freedom in 1981 on grounds that his trial was unconstitutional. But he has been ordered back to jail within 10 days by Ann Aldrich, the United States District Court judge who had overturned his conviction three years ago. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals reversed her decision last year.

1229-> SOUND; 78 RPM DISKS REGAIN ALLURE
The nearest thing to incunabula in the record business are those old 78-rpm disks traditionally stashed away in dusty attics. I never came across reference to undusty attics, but in any case, those 78 rpm disks were the standard of phonography for half a century, from about 1900 to 1950, when they were displaced by long-playing records. A generation of listeners has since grown up without ever hearing any of those quaint, antediluvian platters that spun fast enough to make you dizzy. Yet it was on this crude and brittle recording medium that great musicians left imperishable traces of their art. One merely has to recall the names of conductors like Nikisch, Weingartner, Mengelberg and Koussevitsky, pianists like Schnabel, Hess and Cortot, of fiddlers like Kreisler and Busch to hint at the musical wealth encapsuled in the shellac of these old records. Silently, like Sleeping Beauty, they await their awakening through intrepid collectors. Just such an awakening seems to be getting under way, and 78-hunting is on the verge of becoming a minor fad among phonophiles with a historical bent. Jazz collectors kicked off the trend with their incessant search for uncracked copies of Bix Beiderbecke or Kid Ory. Such ''finds'' (along with reissues on LP) form the basis for the jazz history programs now enjoying popularity on Public Radio and many college stations. The classical contingent wasn't far behind, and within the last year or so a lively collector's market has been pushing prices into a steep climb. Rare vocals, in particular, command premiums. For example, an ardent coterie fancies the singing tradition fostered at the Imperial Opera in St. Petersburg and they've been bidding up records made in czarist times by the Russian Gramophone & Typewriter Company. Single disks have fetched as much as $2,500 to $3,000. Orchestral and instrumental recordings are far more affordable, and even a rare version of a symphony or concerto can usually be had for around $50 from dealers specializing in antique sound, such as Lawrence Holdridge, 54 East Lake Drive, Amityville, N.Y., or ''Nipper''(a store named for Victor's musical fox terrier) in Woodstock, N.Y. Considering the rasping surfaces and dim sound of these ancient disks, one wonders what makes them so attractive to collectors. Surprisingly, the market for such records is by no means confined to oldsters who might have heard the artists long ago and attach to recordings of that period the sentimental regard many people feel for their own youth. To the contrary, a large proportion of 78-rpm afficionados include young professional musicians and other young listeners with an informed interest in changing styles of musical interpretation. What fascinates them is that the music-making captured on those early disks represents esthetic viewpoints quite different from those of the present. There is something beguiling in the rhapsodic freedom artists permitted themselves in matters of tempo and phrasing - an emotionally charged and deeply subjective approach that might nowadays be considered self-indulgent. And yet, what comes across from these old records is often a mesmeric fervor and inner conviction typically lacking in today's prevalent mode of coolly proficient music-making. Beyond the purely historical shift in performance style, one senses yet another, even more personal element affecting the music. The artists on these disks were the very first to have their sound perpetuated by a machine -the first to realize that their music would not vanish. Bruno Walter spoke of recording as ''the only form of immortality attainable by a performing musician.'' Others felt likewise. They did not yet reckon with the commercial pressures that nowadays make recordings go out of print as quickly as books, obscuring distinctions of merit and making ephemeral even that which deserves to endure. To those older artists, the billowing horns and dangling microphones of their day were indeed the Ears of Time -the magic passage to Forever. A little of that feeling settled in the grooves, and here and there one still senses a whiff of transcendence. Owners of such treasures usually play them but once: for transfer to cassette. This forestalls added wear of the original on repeated hearing and insures against total loss if the record breaks. So far, most listeners have transferred the sound from the old record ''as is'' with all its wheezing flaws. But recently, a specialist in sound restoration from historic sources, Barton Wimble, has devised a special adapter for home use - cryptically called the OWL - to enhance the sound quality of old 78-rpm recordings. Having determined that most of the surface noise on old records lies in the narrow frequency band between 8,000 and 10,000 Hz, Mr. Wimble equipped the OWL with several so-called notch-filters that tune out these specific noise segments while leaving the musical content of the adjacent frequency spectrum intact. There is also a control to beef up the feeble bass of early disks at specific points of the frequency scale while a low-frequency cut-off removes the residue of rumble left by yesteryear's wobbly recording apparatus. Though these functions could be approximated by the equalizers widely sold as audio acessories, the adjustment of such an equalizer requires skill, experience, and an analytic ear. By contrast, the OWL has its filters preset to the need of 78-rpm disks, giving even the novice a change to achieve professional results with ease. A bypass switch on the front panel takes the OWL out of action and thus permits instant comparison of its corrective effect with the raw original and left this listener surprised at the sonorities that could be coaxed from some musical relics. Available for $300 from Conductart, P.O. 616, Ansonia Station, New York, N.Y. 10023, the OWL may prove a fine traveling aid for journeys into the musical past. The company also provides styli suitable for playing 78-rpm records, as do such standard cartridge makers as Shure, Stanton, and Bang & Olufsen. Modern turntables with 78-rpm playback in addition to current standard speeds include the Dual CS 608 and the Thorens TD-115-3 Mk II. Such equipment forms the basic outfit for phono-historians who may discover, along with W.H. Auden, that ''for many of us, some of our most important 'new' experiences are discoveries about the hitherto unknown past.''

1230-> Celtics End Streak By Lakers, 110-95
Larry Bird scored 15 of his 21 points in the third quarter as the Celtics broke a seven-game winning streak by Los Angeles with a 110-95 victory today over the Lakers. Boston, winning for the 13th time in its last 15 games, led by 76-64 when it began a 15-3 run that carried the Celtics to a 91-67 lead with 1 minute 40 seconds left in the third quarter. Robert Parish, who led Boston with 24 points, started the burst with a tip-in, and Bird followed with two jumpers, making the score 82-64. The Lakers cut the gap to 82-67, but the Celtics scored 9 straight points, the last 5 by Bird, on a 3-point play off his steal and two free throws. Los Angeles scored the last 8 points of the third quarter and the first 2 of the fourth, making the score 92-79. But the closest they could come after that was 102-90 with 4:01 remaining. Los Angeles had tied the score for the 12th and final time on two free throws by Kurt Rambis with 4:21 left in the second quarter. The free throws made the score 46-46. Boston then outscored the Lakers by 14-4 for a 60-50 halftime lead. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led the Lakers with 27 points, and Jamaal Wilkes scored 20. Kevin McHale and Cedric Maxwell scored 16 each for the Celtics, who got 15 assists from Nate Archibald.

1231-> ON A WORLDWIDE ALERT FOR PROBLEMS ON RISE
Lester R. Brown, the 49-year-old president of Worldwatch Institute, is not by nature a pessimist. But he has taken a kind of grim satisfaction from some of the newspaper headlines that have resulted from his work, including these: ''Fertile Land Areas Found Dwindling,'' ''300 Million Couples Lack Birth Control.'' ''Study Cites Peril in World Agricultural Decline.'' ''Land Reform Efforts Said to Falter.'' Worldwatch is an organization devoted to the notion that the world is inescapably interdependent. In its eight-year existence it has published 64 books and papers on such global issues as malnutrition, world population trends, refugees, renewable energy, space, pollution, nuclear power and reforestation. Recently it received grants to begin work on an annual global ''report card,'' scheduled for publication in early 1984 by W. W. Norton & Company, that will grade governments on their progress in achieving a sustainable society. ''There's a certain amount of confusion about how things are going in the world,'' said Mr. Brown in a recent interview. ''We'll attempt to measure progress in a range of areas. We hope to identify the new problems and new dimensions of the old problems.'' Mr. Brown, the author of 10 books, has been in the business of sounding the world alert for some time. He is credited with anticipating the 1965 crop failure in India early enough to open a food rescue effort. He first became involved in agriculture as a 14-year-old farm boy in New Jersey, starting a commercial tomato business with his younger brother. Tomatoes helped pay for his degrees in agriculture, economics and public administration from Rutgers, the University of Maryland and Harvard. But it was the experience of living for six months in villages in India on a National 4-H Club Foundation fellowship, he said, that opened to him the wider world and the cause of international agriculture. Joining the Department of Agriculture in 1959 as an agricultural analyst, Mr. Brown served as Secretary Orville Freeman's adviser on foreign agricultural policy and later as administrator of the department's International Development Service. In 1969 he became a senior fellow at the Overseas Development Council and six years later with the help of a start-up grant of $500,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, he and two others from the council left to form the Worldwatch Institute. ''The initial idea was that the world was moving into a period of very rapid economic and technological change,'' said Mr. Brown, ''and there was a need for a group to look at the big picture, the global trends. The name Worldwatch seemed a bit presumptuous but it seemed as good as anything else we could think of at the time.'' All Worldwatch books are published commercially, and Worldwatch papers, reprinted throughout the world, total 1,6l6,000 copies in print. They had 74 publishing contracts for their first six books representing 24 different languages. The first printing of the Soviet edition of the book, ''The Picture of Health,'' was larger than in the United States, at 25,000 copies. ''You find the kind of dedication on the Worldwatch staff that you used to find in the civil rights movement,'' said William Dietel of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. ''It is an institute that has flowered.'' ''From the point of view of the foundations,'' he added, ''we are immensely pleased that Worldwatch is an example of what we have been preaching to the not-for-profit sector. You can't make it alone on philanthropy. You have to be more enterprising about finding ways of selling your product.'' But how does one interest people in issues that are apt to make some eyes glaze over, Mr. Brown was asked. ''The key is making it relate to people in ways they will understand,'' he replied. ''To most Americans, tropical deforestation is so far away it could be happening on the moon, but when tropical deforestation is related to the price of lumber and the cost of housing, then it requires meaning. Or take crop failure in the Soviet Union. It would appear to be their problem, not ours. But once the decision was made in Moscow in 1972 to offset that shortfall, not by belt tightening, but by importing, then it had an impact on Americans. And like it or not, we were sharing the food scarcity with the Soviet Union.'' ''To cite a very current issue,'' he added. ''We read about the debt in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Poland - debts they may or may not be able to pay off. Most of that money is borrowed from American banks. If those countries cannot pay off their debts in a systematic way, it is going to have a dramatic effect on interest rates here - the linkage is as direct as that.''

1232-> SCHOOL AID BATTLE HEATS UP IN ALBANY
ALBANY BARELY was the ink dry on Governor Cuomo's education aid proposal when a barrage of fierce but polite criticism descended on him from legislators who vowed to oppose it. Mr. Cuomo's budget called for only an $82 million increase in the $4.6 billion in education aid provided this year. But he coupled this with new formulas that would cut aid from relatively wealthy school districts -many on Long Island - and transfer it to relatively poor districts. Legislators - who spoke circumspectly about proposals to raise $900 million in new and speeded-up taxes and 8,400 layoffs - made it clear that the education proposal would have to be modified. The Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, deferred judgment on all other aspects of Mr. Cuomo's budget, but did not hesitate to argue that the Governor's education proposal treated some districts ''as more equal than others.'' Even the Assembly Speaker, Stanley Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat and an advocate of education aid reform, was extremely skeptical about the prospects. ''I don't know if it can be done,'' he said. ''I agree with the notion that if it can be done this is the year to do it.'' Under the Governor's proposal, 26 districts in Suffolk County would gain and 39 districts would lose, but the county would gain $5.7 million in aid over all, up 1 percent from last year's $522.5 million in aid. In Nassau 17 districts would gain and 39 would lose. The county would lose $22.4 million over all, a drop of 8 percent from last year's total of $271.8 million. The final form of the education aid package will not be developed until after laborious negotiations between Governor Cuomo and the legislative leaders and may not be known until the April 1 deadline for approval of the budget. In the meantime, many legislators and their fiscal experts here are saying that the outcome could depend on whether additional money can be found for education aid - in the midst of the state's worst fiscal crisis in years. And if money can't be found, the outcome will depend on how much can be cut back from relatively poor districts to assure that the relatively wealthy ones do not lose out. Already some legislators are talking privately about trying to reduce the $100 million in new aid that New York City would receive under Mr. Cuomo's formula so that it can be shifted to other areas. They argue that the additional aid for New York City will not go to education anyway. It traditionally has been applied to the city's general budget and to help close the city's deficit. The legislators say that under the budget New York City will gain far more than it expected so should have little reason to complain. Many legislators expected to be forced by the courts to address the issue of rich and poor districts, because of a case brought by Levittown and 26 other school districts and cities across the state. But last year the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled that there was no constitutional mandate to address the issue. In past years, the conflict over education aid followed a game plan that was repeated every winter. Former Governor Hugh L. Carey would propose a formula that would drastically shift education aid from districts relatively wealthy in property taxes to those with little tax base. The Legislature would then add additional money to the budget for education for the wealthier districts. In this way, legislators said, they would ''level up'' education aid. This year the game is being played by new rules. Mr. Cuomo argues that there is not enough money available for leveling up - and legislators will have to raise taxes if they want to do it. Asked what he would tell a group of school superintendents from Greak Neck and other well-off school districts, Governor Cuomo said: ''I know nobody wants to give up anything, I understand that, but let's bite the bullet. Let's try doing it right, let's sneak up on it a bit.'' ''We can give more money to education,'' he continued. ''Lord knows I want to, but it means a tax increase or money from somewhere.'' This did not win much support from Long Island legislators. Senator Norman J. Levy, Republican of Merick, called it an ''instant replay of Hugh Carey's proposals.'' He said that it would hurt many of Nassau County's relatively poor, high-tax low-wealth districts. ''The Cuomo proposal,'' he said, ''will be met with the strongest opposition from myself, and, I'm sure, Long Island's other legislators, local school boards, P.T.A.'s and taxpayers. Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, Democrat of Long Beach and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said there may be less room for change that some legislators think, because of the state's financial problem. ''Changes will be made in the school aid formula, but it won't be scrapped,'' he said. ''Two or three years ago we would have had room to scrap it.'' Some legislators wonder aloud how strongly Governor Cuomo will defend his plan, now that he had made his point. They say that there is so much opposition in the suburbs - where Mr. Cuomo won fewer votes than he had expected - that he may not even want it to succeed. ''I think he would die if his education formula went through,'' said one legislative fiscal aide. ''He needs strength in the suburbs.'' Others say that despite the hardship in Mr. Cuomo's proposed budget at least some additional money might be found. They say that budget officials might have set aside additional revenues that could suddenly appear in the midst of negotiations. Budget officials say there is no money available. ''At first glance there isn't any money available,'' said Assemblyman Kemp Hannon, Republican of Garden City. ''But the last eight years has shown that there was a way even when the Governor has not shown the legislature an open road. It is our duty to find an open road.'' In his proposed budget, the Governor outlined a number of measures that would shift state aid from relatively wealthy to poor districts. Mr. Cuomo wants to eliminate a provision in the current law guaranteeing school districts at least as much aid as they received the previous year. This provision, known as ''save-harmless,'' last year accounted for 2 percent, or $4.35 million, of the total state aid to public elementary and secondary schools. The provision has been criticized as wasteful because schools continue to receive such aid despite drops in enrollment. The ''save harmless'' provision thus did not take into account a school district's current need for aid, but its need in the past. Mr. Cuomo's proposal would substitute for this provision a guarantee for each school district at least $250 in state aid per pupil - a cut from this year's minimum of $360. This new provision alone would cost Nassau County $26.5 million in aid, with allotments under the ''save harmless'' provision dropping from $53.7 million to $37.2 million. The provision would help Suffolk County, which would gain $11.4 million in ''save harmless'' aid, its share rising from last year's $12.5 million to an anticipated $23.9 million. In Nassau, school enrollments have dropped 35 percent from 1971 to 1981, while Suffolk County schools have fallen 14.2 percent. Despite Suffolk County's enrollment drop, it still receives increased aid under this provision because it contains many school districts that are poorer than the state average. Much of the shift of money from wealthy to poor districts would come from changes in the way the state determines how much aid each district needs. Now, most state aid is allocated according to the district's property values, with a separate formula considering the taxpayer's income. Mr. Cuomo wants to combine the two measures into one formula, considering both the income level of a school district's taxpayers and its property tax base in determining school aid. Districts must raise additional school money through local property taxes. Because wealthier districts have higher property values, they have to increase taxes less than poorer districts to raise the money. Among those districts slated to lose money unde the proposal are Syosset, where aid would drop 47 percent, a cut of $2.68 million, and East Williston, where aid would drop 44 percent, a cut of $553,785. Cuts in opeating aid, which is general aid given to schools and not tied to any specific programs, would drop even more sharply. In Syosset, such aid would drop 60 percent, a drop of $2.3 million, and in East Williston, aid would drop 53 percent, a drop of $407,134. Suffolk County would gain aid over all, although 39 districts would lose money and only 26 would gain aid. The largest gainers in Suffolk County would be the South Manor district in Manorville, with aid increases planned at 14.7 percent, up $238,076, and Middle Island, where aid would increase 14 percent, up $2.2 million. The computer printouts detailing each district's aid loss or gain show some anomalies, however. The district with the largest percentage aid loss in the state is Fishers Island in Suffolk. Amagansett, Sag Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, and Eastport would also lose substantial portions of state aid. Some Nassau school districts would gain aid, among them, Long Beach, which is represented by Assemblyman Kremer. The Long Beach school district would get an aid increase of 10.8 percent, up $646,641. Despite the difficulties, some change may be possible. Last week, James Ruhl, an assistant program secretary for Senate Republicans, reiterated their opposition to changing the formula used to set education aid to make it ''wealth-equalizing.'' He said the current formula was fair. But he said that Senator Anderson would be receptive to some changes including modifying the provision that guarantees districts no cuts in aid no matter how much their enrollment has declined. Governor Cuomo seemed to have his own doubts when he answered questions from legislators on his budget. He was asked by Assemblyman I. William Bianchi Jr., Democrat of East Patchogue, whether change was not possible. ''I am not prepared to say it's not going to happen,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Who knows what will happen this year? It has never happened be-fore.''

1233-> Q&A; Permission to Sublet
Question: I own a cooperative apartment in Manhattan. I expect to be transferred, possibly out of the country, in the near future. Since I hope to return to New York some day, I would like to rent my apartment for however long I may be gone. My co-op board will not approve long-term rental arrangements, although a few one-year rentals have been approved. Can I challenge the policy of my co-op board in court? ... D.A., Manhattan. Answer: Most boards will allow a tenant-shareholder who is reassigned for a definite period of time - a year or two, possibly three - to sublet the apartment when it is clear the owner expects to return. The board's authority is spelled out in the corporation's bylaws and proprietary lease. Marc Luxemburg, a lawyer and chairman of the executive committee of the Council of New York Cooperatives, notes that most leases state that there is no limitation on a board's authority to refuse a sublet. In his opinion, it is unlikely that you would succeed in court. Access for Painting Question: My rent-controlled tenant refuses to allow me to paint her apartment or make necessary repairs unless she is present. What are my rights? ... J.T.H., Brooklyn Answer: Section D26-10.07 of the New York City Administrative Code says a tenant may not refuse entry to the owner or his employee to make repairs or improvements required by the maintenance code or other law. Section D26-12.01 of the city's Maintenance Code says painting is required every three years, although with the tenant's permission, you may delay painting an additional two years. Frank A. Dell'aira, assistant commissioner for code enforcement, says that under city regulations enacted to augment the code, you must ask for access in a reasonable manner. You must give notice in writing a week in advance, and 24 hours' written notice for an inspection. You are entitled to access from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday through Friday. Harry Michelson, general counsel to the Rent Control Division, says that if your tenant were found to have violated the code by refusing access, you would have grounds for eviction. Right to Information Question: Our cooperative was converted under a noneviction plan and only about a fourth of the apartments were sold to tenants in residence. The president of the corporation, a resident shareowner, asked the sponsor for rent figures for the unsold apartments so he could determine the impact of a maintenance increase, but was told that the rent rolls were ''confidential.'' Are the officers of a corporation entitled to full financial information about the corporation's capital assets? ... G.T.T., Manhattan Answer: Gloria Josephson, a lawyer who represents both sponsors and tenants, said she knew of no cases involving this issue. In her opinion, the rent is not part of the corporation's assets, but the maintenance is. When title to the building passed to the corporation, the sponsor ''bought'' the balance of the unsold shares. They belong to the sponsor and are not assets of the apartment corporation, which owns only the building. The sponsor must pay the maintenance and the increases, whether the maintenance is higher or lower than the rent he receives. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Readers are invited to send questions to Real Estate Q & A, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

1234-> MOSCOW ISSUES PROTEST OVER TEEN-AGER
Andrei V. Berezhkov, the 16-year-old son of a Soviet diplomat who touched off a dispute over whether or not he wanted to leave the United States, returned here today. Barely an hour later, the Soviet Government issued a formal protest describing the Reagan Administration's actions in a weeklong tug-of-war over the youth as ''disgraceful and inhuman'' and a breach of an international diplomatic conventions. The protest said the United States had ''grossly violated'' the Vienna convention governing diplomatic immunity by barring the youth from leaving the United States for six days. In a possible allusion to United States diplomats in the Soviet Union, it added that ''those who resort to violations of international commitments as regards others should not think that other standards will be applied to them.'' The protest broke an official silence that had been maintained in Moscow since the youth briefly disappeared from his suburban Washington home eight days ago. The teen-ager and his parents boarded a flight for home Thursday after State Department officials accepted his statements that he did not wish to remain. After arriving here on a Soviet airliner that brought the family from Paris, the youth was smiling as he left the customs hall at Sheremetyevo Airport and told Western reporters he was glad to be home. He appeared composed and even to be enjoying the attention. ''I'm not afraid to come back,'' he said, speaking in English. Within earshot of four or five men in suits who appeared to form an official welcoming party, the youth described the affair as ''all a big misunderstanding'' and volunteered his thanks to the State Department for making it possible for him to leave. ''I would just like to thank the State Department who have been very helpful in the past few days,'' he said. With United States television crews filming him as he reached the sidewalk outside the terminal, the youth, dressed in a T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, was asked why he had ended an exchange with reporters at Dulles International Airport in Washington on Thursday by saying, ''Say hi to Mick Jagger.'' ''Because I love him,'' he replied. The youth's remarks seemed to discomfit his father, Valentin M. Berezhkov, who approached the television crews and told them that they ought to have ''better things'' to do with their time and their film. Destination Not Disclosed The teen-ager and his mother, Valeriya, entered a green Volga sedan and drove off, with Mr. Berezhkov following in another car with the baggage. Their destination was not disclosed. The car that carried Andrei and his mother from the airport bore plates of the kind that are normally assigned to privately owned vehicles. But the fact that the family was met by a group of men who appeared to be officials, one of them carrying flowers for Mrs. Berezhkov, suggested that Soviet inquiries into the affair may not be over. Official interest in the affair was also reflected by the presence inside the airport of half a dozen policemen, who ordered the television crews out of the terminal when they tried to film the Berezhkovs emerging from customs. A middle-aged Soviet office worker who has followed the affair through foreign news reports in recent days, when asked what he thought it meant for Andrei's future, said: ''No future, he's finished. The father, too.'' The Soviet protest was delivered to United States Embassy officials at the Foreign Ministry earlier in the day, but was not published by the official press agency Tass until 7:45 P.M., after the Berezhkovs had left the airport. The protest made no mention of Andrei's action in leaving his Washington home in his father's car or the police search that followed. It also did not mention the letters to President Reagan and The New York Times that appealed for help in remaining in the United States and were signed ''Andy Berzhkov.'' Andrei Berezhkov has denied having written the letters. The protest said only that the Reagan Administration had issued ''an unprecedented order'' in forbidding Andrei from leaving the country ''under the pretext that the American authorities had to make sure whether he wanted to stay forever in the United States.'' U.S. Contingency Plans WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 - At least some State Department officials dealing with the case expected Andrei V. Berezhkov to refuse to go back to the Soviet Union and had prepared contingency plans for American security officers at Dulles Airport to protect him if he asked for asylum Thursday night, officials said today. But the officials said that once the 16-year-old son of a Soviet diplomat began talking to reporters and two senior State Department officials at the airport, the officials decided he was just a teen-ager who had got into a ''mess,'' one official said. ''I had assumed until then, on the basis of his letters to the President and to The Times, that he was a serious young man who had analyzed events and knew what he was doing in saying he wanted to stay here,'' an official said. 'A Very Good Chance' A State Department official said, ''When we heard that the Russians at first did not want to produce the kid at the compound, I felt there was a very good chance he would switch his story and ask to stay when he saw all the American officials at the airport.'' The official said that when Richard Burt, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, and Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, both met the youth at the airport, they became convinced, from his nonchalant answers to questions and his overall demeanor, that he was not a serious candidate for political asylum. Besides observing the youth while he answered reporters' questions, Mr. Burt also spent about 45 minutes with the family in informal discussion before the takeoff of the Trans World Airlines plane for Paris, according to Alan D. Romberg, a department spokesman. That discussion, Mr. Romberg said, only fortified the impression that there was no reason not to allow him to leave with his parents. The chief White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said the Administration was satisfied that the Soviet youth left voluntarily. Soviet authorities as well as the Berezhkovs have denied that Andrei wrote the letters seeking asylum here. But Mr. Speakes, in Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is on vacation, said, ''We have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the letters.'' (The Associated Press reported that a senior Administration official said the White House knew the letter was authentic because of a handwriting analysis by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.) Mr. Speakes, when asked how the White House knew the letters were authentic, said only, ''We have our way.'' He refused to elaborate.

1236-> SUNDAY OBSERVER; OPERATING IN SPACE
The high point of all submarine movies for me was always the appendectomy. Everybody knows the scene. The submarine, silent on the sea bottom, is under heavy depth-charge attack with lights flickering on and off, and water leaking through the seams, and the whole crew staring at the sonar phones with the sound of enemy destroyers coming nearer and nearer, and a case of acute appendicitis in the enlisted men's mess. The skipper saying: ''I'm going to have to operate, son, and I might as well be honest with you. I've never done an appendectomy before.'' The otherwise splendid German film ''Das Boot,'' about wartime life on a Nazi U-boat, omitted the appendectomy, thereby narrowly missing its chance to be pronounced the greatest submarine movie ever made. It occurred to me afterward that the producers left it out because the appendectomy is now the most unglamorous of all operations and they thought it might lower the tone of the movie if they included it. Nowadays the skipper would probably have to perform open-heart surgery to keep the audience biting its fingernails. These reflections occurred to me upon reading recently that there is now talk of putting a journalist in space. I imagine NASA will do that before long, and once it puts a journalist in space, of course, it will have to put a lawyer in space. It has already put a doctor in space. Lawyers cannot let themselves be excluded from weightlessness once journalists and doctors stake claims to the territory. Do you see what I am getting at? If not, here is a clue: Is there anything more like a submarine than a space capsule? Everyone inescapably sealed in. Claustrophobia. The constant danger of bursting seams. There would be a skipper on board, of course. I think he would be Frank Borman. Although Frank Borman has left the space program to run Eastern Airlines and star in its commercials, I think, with journalism, medicine and the law claiming a place in space, business would also insist on having a businessman in space, and Frank Borman would be the inevitable choice. With a businessman on board, there would also have to be a secretary in space. And once the businessman was permitted to take a secretary, the lawyer would have to have a clerk; the doctor, a receptionist; the journalist, a copyboy. In short, plenty of people available for dramatic surgery when the space capsule is well out on its trip to Neptune, or wherever. The problem arises when the druggist - I can't imagine a journalist on board without a druggist to dispense aspirin - comes to Frank Borman. ''I'm going to give it to you straight, Frank.'' ''Yes?'' ''My soda jerk has bad heart flutters.'' (With a secretary for the businessman, a clerk for the lawyer, a receptionist for the doctor and a copyboy for the journalist, the pharmacists' lobby would surely insist on a soda jerk for the druggist.) Borman: ''Captain to doctor. Examine the soda jerk right away, will you, Doc?'' A few moments later, the doctor: ''Captain, I'm afraid this lad needs open-heart surgery, and it can't wait until we reach Neptune.'' You will say, ''So the doctor does a little open-heart surgery. Where's the suspense?'' But does the doctor do open-heart surgery? He would love to, because doctors are humane, but open-heart surgery requires a highly trained medical team. It is not like taking out an appendix on the bottom of the Pacific. All the doctor has on board is a receptionist and all she can do is ask people to wait another hour because the doctor is busy. Nor is the doctor encouraged by the sight of the journalist setting up his TV camera in the soda jerk's mess to bring Earth live pictures of the first open-heart surgery performed in space. I can't blame him. If I were a doctor in a space capsule, I wouldn't fancy performing before an audience that would surely include such open-heart surgical masters as Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley. I would be even less enthusiastic if I saw the lawyer giving his card to the soda jerk while dilating upon the incredible wealth to be gained from malpractice suits. Not that I think the lawyer would do this, of course. All I'm saying is that when you're a doctor and you have a reporter and a lawyer looking over your shoulder, you might easily be tempted to listen a second time to a fluttering heart, wish you had gone to the golf course instead of Neptune and state that the situation is beyond your competence. This would leave matters up to the skipper, of course, because - well, the skipper is the skipper, and a skipper's got to do what a skipper's got to do. I see him giving orders. ''Smash that TV camera, throw the reporter in the brig, and put that lawyer under heavy anesthetic. And you, Doc, I want you to show me where things are located.'' I don't know about you, but I'm on the edge of my seat when he smiles at the stricken lad and says, ''I'm going to be honest with you, son.'' Of course it would be even better if there were depth charges outside.

1237-> OVER 20 YEARS, THE MOOD HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY
In terms of numbers, the turnout at today's march for jobs, peace and freedom may have approached the one it was meant to commemorate, but the tone, the moods and the passions of today's marchers were markedly different from those of the men and women who marched the same route 20 years ago with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The echoes of that earlier march were invoked throughout the day, and pictures of the assassinated black leader were everywhere: on placards, posters and baseball caps hawked by souvenir vendors. Above the stands for the speakers and the singers, a banner proclaimed, ''The Dream Lives On,'' a reference to the ''I have a dream'' refrain with which Dr. King punctuated his vision of a racially harmonious America. Yet, except for occasional moments of chanting, this was a far less spontaneous assembly that professed its allegiance to dozens of causes through T-shirts and placards. Some stressed disarmament, others non-intervention in Latin America. Union contingents demanded jobs. A Bazaar of Slogans There were appeals for voter registration and for an end to the death penalty, for greater women's rights and for the acceptance of homosexuals. There were posters calling for the ouster of the Reagan Administration, and there were units representing black fraternities, ecological parties, leftist splinter groups. Each of these seemed tolerant of the others, although they all stressed their own favorite causes in what sometimes appeared to be a bazaar of slogans and strategies. For this reporter, it all contrasted sharply with memories, perhaps tinged with nostalgia, of the scene 20 years ago. In that earlier gathering there had been more cohesion and more sense of purpose. The demands had been clear: the immediate passage of a comprehensive civil rights bill guaranteeing access by black people to public accommodations, housing, integrated education and the ballot box. The target was Congress. In Their Sunday Best Few of the people who came then had been in previous demonstrations, and none had been in such a huge protest. There were no rules, and people were on their best behavior, often wearing their Sunday best. Most were black, although there were many whites. There was the pressure of the crowd wedging a young white man against a group of middle-aged black women from South Carolina, leading to an exchange of ''I'm sorry's,'' apologizing not so much for the pushing but for the conditions that were not the fault of anyone then present. If a crowd can have a personality, then the personality of that earlier coming together was shy. In the course of that Wednesday afternoon, the crowd, aware of the fears and predictions of violence, discovered its own strength and grew proud of its discipline. A spirit had spread rather spontaneously, and a collective consciousness was shaped and given definition by Dr. King's speech. More Confident, Less Uplifted This morning, while the busloads were still pouring in and the crowd behind the Lincoln Memorial was rallying to its many disparate slogans and symbols, the people seemed much more assertive and self-confident though less united and less uplifted. It was as if they had moved from dreams to demands. Dick Gregory, the comedian, referred to this as he and Bill Cosby gave directions to the crowd for its walk to the Lincoln Memorial. ''Don't go comparing this march to the one 20 years ago,'' Mr. Gregory said. ''When we came here 20 years ago, most of us were scared. We're not scared today. When we came here 20 years ago, we came to ask the folks to take care of our business. We're here to take care of our own business today.'' James Harris, a marcher today and 20 years ago, agreed. ''It's like Dick Gregory said, we were scared,'' said Mr. Harris, a black Virginian who had come here with a delegation from the United Automobile Workers. He said he thought that despite the fears there was more discipline two decades ago. Changes in Crowd's Mood ''Just before that first march there had been real trouble in Danville, Va., and there had been the sit-ins,'' he said, ''and while people didn't know what to expect here in Washington, they were alert and aware.'' It seemed that the crowd kept gaining confidence throughout that day, surprising itself and its leaders in the early afternoon when, unbidden and undirected, it set off for the Lincoln Memorial without Dr. King, arriving at the site before the leaders did. At today's march, which seemed to have more white participants than the first one, there was a similar change of tempo when the multitude was sent off to walk along the Mall to the Lincoln Memorial. After mostly perfunctory responses to the morning speeches, a new liveliness set in as the groups began to walk. Some were transformed from audience to performers. And for the first time, some began to sing ''We Shall Overcome'' and to chant ''Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom,'' as Dr. King's followers did 20 years ago. Criticisms of Reagan One group, marching under the banner of Malcolm X, the assassinated Black Muslim leader who had boycotted the 1963 march, demanded ''Peace, bread and black power.'' But it was far outnumbered by those who marched in support of disarmament and jobs, and the closest thing to a unifying rallying call was a periodic castigation of President Reagan and his Administration. ''We've got to watch our feet because we have a President who dances with his mouth,'' said Mr. Cosby to great laughter at one point. ''Let's wave bye-bye to Ron as he rides off into the sunset,'' said Margaret Kuhn, the leader of the Gray Panthers, a group opposing discrimination against the elderly. One feminist marcher walked under a sign identifying herself as ''a low-level Munchkin,'' a profession of solidarity with Barbara Honegger, the Justice Department aide who resigned this week after denouncing the Administration's policies on women's rights. A Festive Occasion It was a festive march today, and most people were dressed as if for a picnic. Nowhere were there the young men and women in the blue country overalls that served in the 1963 march as the uniforms of the young organizers who had been in places like Selma, Danville and Sunflower County, Miss. Jacqueline Schmitt is an Episcopal minister who came here from Raleigh, N.C., where she is a chaplain at the University of North Carolina. She said she had come with the hope that with so many people reflecting related views, a new consciousness might form. ''There's definitely more coming together than breaking apart,'' she said, ''and people are beginning to understand that things like jobs, racism and the interventions in Latin America are related.'' Government, too, had become more subtle, she said. ''They don't come down on you with dogs any more,'' she said, ''but they effectively ignore the concerns we are raising here.'' As for the spirit of the day, she remarked: ''What we need is the spirit, and you can't predict the spirit. What we're talking about is getting religion. A lot of progress has already been made, and I'm sure there will be more.'' And that spurred another 20-year- old memory: picking up a black hitchhiker on the way home from the rally, and stopping in Ann Arundel County, Md., at a restaurant for a late dinner. The sign on the door said: ''No Negroes.''

1238-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Economist Named Dean at Rochester
Paul W. MacAvoy, an economist who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, was named yesterday to a 12-year term as dean of the University of Rochester's Graduate School of Management. The appointment surprised some of Mr. MacAvoy's colleagues because of his moderate stance on national economic policy. Rochester is ranked second only to the University of Chicago as a center for monetarist, or conservative, economic philosophy. ''Mutual discussion and some disagreement on issues will make a better economist of me,'' Mr. MacAvoy, now an economics professor at Yale University, said in an interview yesterday. He added that in meetings with faculty members at Rochester before his appointment, ''I perceived enthusiasm over my coming on board.'' ''The issues that brought us together were ways to improve business education over the next 12 years,'' he said, adding that his appointment, announced yesterday by Robert L. Sproull, Rochester's president, followed a review and recommendations by all faculty committees at the university. Mr. MacAvoy, 48 years old, succeeds William H. Meckling, who announced last fall that he intended to step down and return to teaching at the university this summer. Mr. MacAvoy said he had discussed openings at two other business schools, but found Rochester to be ''the only program I was comfortable with.'' A member of the Yale faculty since 1976, Mr. MacAvoy had been a member of the economics faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1963 to 1974.

1239-> MORE FIRE-RESISTANT FURNITURE
By doing such things as putting aluminum foil in welt cords and eliminating cotton ticking, upholstered furniture manufacturers expect that 85 percent of their products will soon resist ignition by smoldering cigarettes. ''We've come a long way,'' Charles M. Carey, co-chairman of the Upholstered Furniture Action Council, said in a recent interview. Seven trade associations, representing major manufacturers, formed the research group in 1977, following initial efforts by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission to set mandatory fire safety standards. The commission had no comment on the council's projections. In 1980, the commission did a test burn of upholstered furniture that complied with the council's phase one standards and found that more than 50 percent could be ignited by a cigarette. This summer, the commission plans to do another fire test on the council's phase two standards. Under phase two, manufacturers will voluntarily replace inflammable interior fabrics, such as cotton ticking, with more fire-resistant synthetics. In addition, welt cords, which are used to trim some upholstered furniture, will be lined with aluminum foil. Fire researchers at the council found that the aluminum strips will conduct heat away from the welt-cord area, where many fires begin. Furniture shipped from factories after July 1 and bearing the council's U.F.A.C. label will have these safety improvments. Furniture shipped before that date and kept in retailers' inventories will meet only the earlier safety standard. Since the council represents 89 percent of upholstered furniture manufacturers, the new safety improvements should be incorporated in about 75 percent of all upholstered furniture sold. The industry had $7.2 billion in retail sales last year. The product safety commission, which has been generally satisfied with the trade group's reseach and compliance efforts, may still have to issue regulations to make all upholstered furniture fireresistant. Upholstered furniture fires, generally started by cigarettes, account for more than a quarter of all fire fatalites. In 1981, fires in upholstery caused 1,500 deaths in 39,000 fires, according to the commission. The industry's and the commission's handling of the problem has drawn criticism from consumer groups and a state regulator. ''As far as I'm concerned,'' said Gordon H. Damant, chief of the California Bureau of Home Furnishings, ''it is inexcusable that the we still don't have a mandatory Federal standard 11 years and 30,000 to 40,000 deaths after the commission first published a Federal Register notice indicating the need for one.'' Since 1975, California has required all furniture components to be resistant to open flames as well as smoldering cigarettes, the only state to do so. To meet these standards, manufacturers treat foam cushioning and fabrics with flame retardants. As a result, the number of furniture-initiated fires decreased by 30 percent and the number of deaths associated with furniture fires declined by 20 percent in the first five years the regulation was in effect, Mr. Damant said. The commission, however, said that in its limited 1980 survey the furniture meeting U.F.A.C. standards performed as well as furniture meeting California standards. In addition, that state's standards have resulted in price increases of about 5 percent.

1240-> RELIGION COUNTS IN THE SOUTH BRONX REVIVAL
To the Editor: ''Cooke: The Quiet Leader of New York's Catholics,'' your March 17 news profile of the Cardinal, omitted something I think is very important: his ministry in the South Bronx. In my four and a half years in the difficult enterprise of revitalizing the South Bronx, I have come to know about areas of strength. The religious community is a very important element of strength. The Catholic parochial school effort, open to non-Catholics as well as Catholics, is outstanding and a major stabilizing factor. The dedicated service of the religious is more important than outsiders realize. The priests, nuns and brothers are not only dedicated, they are effective. I hesitate to cite any because that would mean unfairly leaving someone out. But they have made a difference. I wish they could be cloned. I would feel very lonely without them. The other denominations are equally important, as are their individual clergy. It is the current underpinning of social stability in the South Bronx. It is a very important part of the Cardinal's ministry, and too little is known about it. EDWARD J. LOGUE, President, South Bronx Development Organization, Inc., New York, March 28, 1983

1241-> Mr. Scowcroft's MX Mouse
The President's Commission on Strategic Forces seems ready to recommend, finally, how to base the MX, that Flying Dutchman of a new American missile: in strengthened versions of the silos that now house Minuteman missiles. That solution may support Mr. Reagan's determination to ram the MX through Congress, but it makes a mockery of the case on which the MX was built. The President set up the commission, under Brent Scowcroft, after Congress rejected Dense Pack, the latest of many different basing modes considered for the MX. The commission was given the opportunity to step free of past dogma and find a fresh approach. Having interviewed a mountain of witnesses, it has labored mightily - and now seems likely to produce a mouse. The reason for building MX was to counter the alleged vulnerability of the land-based Minuteman force by making a mobile missile. For the commission to recommend that MX be put in the same silos whose vulnerability provided its rationale is to stand reason on its head. The Air Force claims the silos can be strengthened. But no amount of strengthening can alter the fact that a vulnerable missile, carrying 10 warheads capable of destroying Soviet silos, would be a prime target. And accurate new Soviet missiles can create craters that will defeat any amount of hardening. The 100 or so MX's the Scowcroft commission is expected to recommend are too few to threaten decisively the Russians' land-based missile force but enough to encourage them to make their missiles mobile. That would set in motion a vast redeployment of land-based missiles on both sides. During the decade it might take to complete such a project, the chances of reaching agreements on limitations would be substantially reduced. The only prudent way for the United States to protect its landbased strategic missiles is by reducing the number of Soviet missiles that threaten them: in other words by arms control. A decision to deploy the MX outside the context of arms control would be an invitation to a new arms race in land-based missiles. Some critics of the MX call for ''de-MIRVing,'' that is, replacing multiple-warheaded missiles, which are tempting targets, with smaller, single-warhead missiles. But this promising ''Midgetman'' concept cannot even be tested if the MX is deployed. The SALT II framework allows each side to flight-test only one new land-based missile. Instead of recommending any deployment of MX, let alone into Minuteman holes, the Scowcroft commission would have done better to urge a moratorium on the flight-testing of new land-based missiles by both sides. That would allow more time, among other things, for negotiating the reductions that both sides have proposed. If such negotiations prove unsatisfactory, testing MX or a better alternative could begin with little lost. What irony. The Administration, which set out to praise the MX, ends up by proposing a makeshift burial instead. What is required now is a decent interment; that will have to come from Congress.

1243-> OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE TO TAKE COLUMBIA STUDENTS
Thirty-three undergraduates from Columbia University will begin a year's study at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England this fall through a new foreign-study program at Columbia. Under conditions of an agreement reached after nearly a year of discussions among the three schools, as many as 70 places at the two British universities will be open annually to juniors from Columbia College. Each class at Columbia has about 700 students. The first group of students from Columbia were chosen from 55 sophomore applicants last January. 'A Terrific Opportunity' ''It's a terrific opportunity for our students,'' said Michael Rosenthal, Columbia's associate dean. ''We would very much like this to be successful.'' Columbia is affiliated with one other foreign-study program, its own Reid Hall division in Paris. About 20 students from Columbia College study there each year, according to Patricia Geisler, an assistant dean of students. She said that a few students had studied at other schools abroad but that the inception of a cooperative program with Oxford and Cambridge signaled a shift in format for Columbia. It would allow for the first time a significant portion of the school's population to study abroad. ''Studying for a year in a system so remote from the American will show students that life is more complicated and less mythic there than they might believe,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. 'A Bit of Diversity' James Noggle, who is 20 and is majoring in English at Columbia, will be in the first group of students going to England. ''It adds a bit of diversity to my education,'' said Mr. Noggle, who is from San Jose, Calif. ''I've never been to England.'' He will study English literature at Cambridge's Fitzwilliam College. According to Mr. Rosenthal, the students going to Oxford and Cambridge will study subjects including philosophy, politics, economics, literature, history and biochemistry. Robert Ripin, a 20-year-old Columbia junior from Queens, said he was eager to ''see American society and education from a different perspective.'' Mr. Ripin, a political-science major, will study politics, philosophy and economics during the academic year that begins in the first week of October and ends next June. 'Much More Intensive System' ''They have a much more intensive system of learning,'' Mr. Ripin said of the English university system, where students take courses in only one subject each term. ''I'll be forced to challenge myself constantly in this program.'' Mr. Ripin, who has never been to Europe, will study at St. Anne's College at Oxford. Columbia will grant its students a full year's credit in the subjects they study, Mr. Rosenthal said. Credit will be based on the comments of the students' professors in England and on evaluation by Columbia professors of the papers the students write while studying at Oxford and Cambridge. Students who receive financial aid from the state or Federal Government would be unable under current legislation to transfer that money abroad, so Columbia has arranged to have the students register for their programs and pay fees at Columbia. Columbia will pay the English colleges for the Columbia students' tuition, room and board, which is about the same as the cost at Columbia, now slightly more than $13,000 per student a year, Mr. Rosenthal said. The foreign study-program was initially conceived by Columbia administrators after they learned of cutbacks in British Government aid to universities. Mr. Rosenthal said officials at the English universities welcomed the plan as an opportunity to increase academic income.

1244-> Books Of The Times
ARARAT. By D.M. Thomas. 191 pages. Viking. $13.50. VLADIMIR NABOKOV would probably not have appreciated D.M. Thomas's ''Ararat,'' the fourth and latest novel by the English poet who wrote ''The White Hotel.'' Nabokov would have objected to all the Freud in ''Ararat'' - the proximity of Eros and Thanatos and artistic creativity, and the horn removed from the unicorn and placed in the lap of a female statue. All the same, ''Ararat'' is a homage to Nabokov, along with many other figures in Russian literature. By enfolding tale within tale within tale -each containing details of the one that frames it - Mr. Thomas has created a construction of mirrors that reflects a light captured only in the human imagination. Of this, Nabokov would have greatly approved. Actually, a more immediate literary presence in ''Ararat'' is Alexander Pushkin. The novel's most captivating sections involve a retelling and completion of the Russian master's story-fragment, ''Egyptian Nights,'' written and left uncompleted in 1835, two years before Pushkin was killed in a duel. The story concerns the sudden appearance in St. Petersburg of a Neapolitan ''improvisatore,'' whose genius it is to be able to recite instantaneously epic poetry on any subject that his audience requests. In the Pushkin original, the improviser recites a charming verse about three men who accept the challenge to make love to Cleopatra at the price of their lives. As the game begins, the original story breaks off, but Mr. Thomas's narrator, a contemporary Russian poet named Victor Surkov, continues to create what reads for all the world like a slightly awkward translation of a masterpiece. In the poem within the story, the first two lovers are executed, but the third, who turns out to be Cleopatra's son by an incestuous coupling with her brother Ptolemy, executes the executioner. The only problem is that the framing story eventually leads to Pushkin's death in a duel with a guards officer he suspects of being his wife's lover, an actual reflection of history. Horrified, Surkov, who has by now identified himself with Pushkin, undertakes another version of the ending in which the Neapolitan, failing to complete his improvisation, winds up getting himself beheaded for making love to a contemporary version of Cleopatra. The new ending is pure wit. The first is too close to actuality for comfort. Presumably, the artist's role is to alter reality. But this is a trivial aspect of creativity. The more important point seems to lie in the fact that Surkov's completion of Pushkin's story about improvisation is itself an improvisation by a Russian poet who is competing in a game of improvisation with an Armenian storyteller and an American ''writer of romantic fiction'' (whose contributions to the contest we will also read). And these three improvisations are in turn the creation of Sergei Rozanov, a Russian writer who, in the novel's ultimate framing story, has promised to improvise a story for a blind woman as recompense for having failed at making love to her. We need only take this game of backward extrapolation two steps further to arrive, first, at D.M. Thomas himself, who, after all, improvised this chain of improvisations, and then to the ultimate creator, who seems to be proposed in the following musing by Victor Surkov, as his jet-plane, in another improvisation, approaches Kennedy International Airport to land him on a tour of America: ''And God? To imagine a maker of this blue gulf, those fleecy clouds, was merely to compound the impossible. For it was impossible, logically speaking, for all this, including Surkov, to exist. Yet of course nothingness, also, was inconceivable. Moreover, the sky, the clouds, exhibited order and beauty,'' Surkov reflects. ''Darwinism doesn't explain it. To create all this mysterious existence, in only ten thousand million years - the merest blink of an eye! The spontaneous creation of order, like the improvisatore's 'Cleopatra'! No, I can't believe it. It may have happened by impulse, but it's not random.'' Why Ararat? Mount Ararat was of course where Noah's Ark came to rest when the flood waters receded - the flood, everywhere evoked in Mr. Thomas's text, that washed away the evil of the world. Mount Ararat stands at the site of one of the earth's great modern evils, the act of genocide as it was practiced on Armenians by Turks in 1915. Ararat is the place toward which all things in Mr. Thomas's novel tend -another version of the pastoral place of rest that is envisioned in the final chapter of ''The White Hotel.'' And Ararat's twin peaks suggest the breasts of all the women that the male characters in ''Ararat'' keep compulsively seducing. (The story of Don Juan is another leitmotif that echoes endlessly in the novel.) Such chains of association abound in ''Ararat,'' by turns with wit and grimness, and sometimes both ways. One of the novel's dourest jokes involves an unhappy old man that Victor Surkov meets who turns out to have been at Babi Yar. Yes, the man sighs, and he was also involved in the Armenian holocaust. ''In the province of Dirarbekir we got rid of 570,000.'' Oh, and he ''was also at such camps as Dachau, Birkenau, Belsen, Auschwitz, Sobibor, Maidanek, Treblinka. It was not easy.'' The name of this monster is Finn. Is this a grisly tribute to a non-Russian masterpiece to which ''Ararat'' also owes something of a debt -a work that created Finn again and again? But I am making ''Ararat'' sound like a game within a puzzle. It is not. Its narrative is magnetic, not elusive. As it spins it charges the air around itself and draws the reader irresistibly along. We are compelled to solve any riddles it creates, not out of bafflement but because of intense and pleasurable curiosity.

1245-> OPERA: NIGHT OF OFFENBACH BY BEL CANTO
THE Bel Canto Opera gave us two rarities from Offenbach's seemingly bottomless fund of musical works for the stage Saturday night. Both were one-act affairs; both concerned the subject of lotteries; both used three characters each, and both mixed hasty, often cursory, dramatic craftsmanship with music of great charm and substance. The first, ''A Lady in Lottery,'' was the more brittle of the two. Nelson Sheeley's English translation and staging was amusing to a point, but it was Offenbach's gleaming trios and an extended love duet between Aspasie (Carol Lurie) and Pigeonneau (Timothy Braden) that held our interest. Both voices were strong and agile - Miss Lurie's soprano the more reliable, Mr. Braden's baritone sometimes wandering out of tune. Paula Florea was an equally attractive soprano in the second piece, ''No. 66''; but Dennis Kotecki, though he sang and acted pleasantly in both works, had the kind of slight, underdeveloped tenor that tends to be lost behind orchestral accompaniments. Some, if not much, of the problem, may have rested with Gregory Ortega's heavy-handed conducting and the overactive reverberation of the Wagner Junior High School auditorium. Thomas Haddow's baritone - a much more substantial voice - was also overpowered by the pit. ''No. 66'' represented a softer-edged, more pastoral Offenbach than ''Lady in Lottery''; and together, these works pointed to the depth of musical versatility that lay half-hidden beneath the frenetic and frivolous goings-on on stage.

1246-> PRESSURE IS GROWING IN BRAZIL TO PUT OFF PAYING FOREIGN DEBT
The Brazilian Government is coming under pressure from increasingly diverse elements of the nation to declare a moratorium on the repayment of its $90 billion of foreign debt. Until recently, the calls were heard only from union groups and militant legislators from the opposition party. But now they are coming from businessmen, establishment economists and legislators from the Government's own party. ''The two ends of Brazilian society - the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao Paulo and the Brazilian Communist Party - seem to be coming together on this,'' said Thales Ramalho, a prominent Congressman in the Government party. The proponents of a moratorium are not calling for a unilateral rupture of repayments that could close off future assistance from the banking community. Instead, they envision renegotiated terms of payment, ''supportable'' interest rates and extended grace periods. The proposals call for lapses of two to three years before payments of principal and interest would resume. The proponents of a moratorium include the Vice President, Aurelian Chaves, who is the acting head of state while President Joao Baptisto Figueiredo recuperates from a heart operation. Mr. Chaves told bankers who visited him in the Presidential Palace recently that ''Brazil needs a break long enough to be able to produce to pay off its debt'' But the President and important members of the Cabinet oppose a moratorium. They warn that such an action would jeopardize the nation's supply of petroleum, 70 percent of which is imported and paid for in dollars. On a more general basis, they argue that a moratorium would make Brazil a pariah in banking circles. Those joining the campaign for a moratorium argue that the approach being worked out between the Government and the International Monetary Fund would commit the country to a long and deep recession. By curbing the country's productive capacity, they argue, the process would close off Brazil's means of repaying its debt. Rescheduling Requested As expected, the Government today formally requested a formal rescheduling of $1.5 billion of debt to foreign banks that falls due this year. The announcement came as Ant^onio Delfim Netto, the Brazilian planning minister, met in Paris with Jacques de Larosi ere, managing director of the I.M.F., Brazil must win I.M.F. approval of a newly fashioned economic recovery plan in order to gain the release of $800 million in I.M.F. loans. If the I.M.F. approves the plan, which was worked out earlier this month in Brasilia, the Government could receive billions of dollars in credits from banks, in addition to the $800 million from the I.M.F. Mr. Delfim also met with Michel Candesus, chairman of the Club of Paris, a group that represents industrial nations with loans to Brazil. The Brazilians want more time to repay loans from governments and credits guaranteed by governments. The Brazilian Government is expected to ask for a deal on state-to- state loans similar to one it has with private banks: A rescheduling of payments on principal while the nation continues to meet interest payments. According to Government and foreign sources, Brazil would still need as much as $4 billion in new money this year to pay its creditors. A central bank spokesman, Reinaldo Ferreira, said today that, ''officially, there doesn't exist a number, but it is said to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion.'' Already in Arrears Now about $2 billion in arrears on its debt payments, Brazil, in effect, is in a moratorium already, a point the proponents turn to their favor. ''We are in a tacit moratorium, and that's the worst kind because the terms are being set by the creditors,'' said Celso Furtad, a Brazilian professor of economics at the Sorbonne in Paris. He is the author of a moratorium plan put forward by the opposition Democratic Movement Party. Marco Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, an influential Government party Congressman and former Minister of Industry and Commerce, said, ''There is no way to justify a strategy that contemplates stopping the nation and turning it into an exporter of liquid capital.'' The advocates of a moratorium say the country cannot continue to meet interest payments on the nation's total foreign debt. This year, an estimated $10.5 billion of interest falls due, and next year $11.2 billion falls due. The only foreign currency the country gets these days comes from a trade surplus. But that is not enough to cover its debt service, and the favorable trade balance is only being achieved by a drastic curb on imports. Meanwhile, the import curb is crippling the nation's industrial sector, the largest in Latin America. Brazil is in its fourth year of recession, and the Government's economic plans point to at least two more years of a contracting economy. The consequences are evident throughout Brazilian life today. Bankruptcies have become more numerous, various financial houses have been taken over by the Government to protect investors, peddlers throng the downtown streets of major cities and unemployment, already more than 20 percent of the labor force in major cities, is rising. Two natural calamities, a drought now in its fifth year in the northeast and recent devastating floods in the south, have deepened the crisis. ''There seems to be some confusion abroad that Brazil is a South Korea, a Taiwan or a Singapore, with an economy largely based on exports,'' said a European financial analyst based in Rio. In fact, he said, only 7 percent of the country's gross national product is derived from exports. Business Lobbying In recent days, business leaders have pressed the Government to pursue a policy that would start up idle industries again and take advantage of Brazil's large domestic consumer market. In a joint statement, 12 leading industrialists in Sao Paulo denounced the current policy as one of ''recession with no purpose.'' There is clearly a division within the Government over how to proceed, and political commentators report that those favoring some kind of moratorium, among whom are several close advisers in the military, are planning to take their case to Mr. Figueiredo next week. President Figueiredo temporarily relinquished office July 14 to have a double coronary bypass operation in the United States. He is now recuperating on his farm outside Brasilia and is to reassume office on Aug. 29. In particular, the delegation is expected to press Mr. Figueiredo to dismiss his two key economic advisers, Mr. Delfim and Treasury Secretary Ernane Galv^eas. A poll conducted by Exame, a financial magazine, showed that 60 percent of 667 businessmen interviewed thought the job performance of Mr. Delfim was ''terrible.'' The rating for Mr. Galveas was even worse, 66 percent. President Staying Course Mr. Figueiredo has shown no signs of yielding either to the call for a moratorium or for the heads of his two principal economic associates. ''You don't change crews in the middle of a storm,'' he said on the eve of his return from the United States. Mr. Delfim and Mr. Galv^eas turn aside all talk of a moratorium. ''Renegotiation is the right path,'' Mr. Delfim said in Sao Paulo on Thursday. ''We are working things out that way and that's what we're going to continue to do.'' Mr. Delfim believes the best course for Brazil is to obtain I.M.F. approval of the country's austerity measures, use that to free up new money from the community and continue to make interest payments, while renegotiating principal payments due in the coming two years.

1247-> Oil-Drilling Rise Seen
An average of 2,425 rigs will be drilling for oil and gas in the United States in 1984, up 6.1 percent from the estimated average of 2,285 this year, I. C. Kerridge, a vice president of the Hughes Tool Company and an economist, predicted today. He said the company also expected 67,300 wells to be drilled next year, 6.8 percent more than the estimated 63,000 in 1983. United States drilling expenditures are expected to increase to $21.5 billion in 1984, from $19.2 billion this year, he added.

1248-> SCORSESE'S PAST COLORS HIS NEW FILM
When Martin Scorsese first read the script for ''The King of Comedy'' in 1974, he dismissed it as a one-gag film. The story of an ambitious young comic who kidnaps a famous talk-show host in order to get himself on television didn't interest him at all. Years passed, and Mr. Scorsese directed, with much acclaim, such movies as ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' ''Taxi Driver,'' ''New York, New York'' and ''Raging Bull.'' When he read the script of ''King of Comedy'' again in 1979, he says he finally understood what it was all about. Indeed the film - which opens this Friday at the Coronet - had taken on an intensely personal resonance for him. It would provide him with a means not only for making important stylistic experiments, but also for taking stock of his own career - for reassessing his early ambition and the consequences of his more recent success. In ''The King of Comedy'' Robert De Niro plays a novice comedian named Rupert Pupkin, who will do anything, anything, to get Jerry Langford, a television personality played by Jerry Lewis, to invite him to perform on his show. Pupkin wheedles, he whines, he makes a complete pest of himself, and when that doesn't work, he resorts to kidnapping and ransom. His ambition is blind and crazy, says Mr. Scorsese, and it is based on his own youthful will to succeed at any price. ''I can identify with Pupkin,'' he says now. ''It's the same way I made my first pictures with no money and with the constant rejection - going back and going back and going back until finally, somehow, you get a lucky break. Actually luck doesn't have that much to do with it; it's just this constant battering away at this monolith. Pupkin goes about it the wrong way, but he does have drive. I remember I'd go anyplace, do anything. I'd try to get into screenings, get into any kind of social situation to try to talk up projects. It's important who you meet -after all, if you meet 40 or 50 people, the one person who will produce your first film might just be there.'' It took almost a decade of struggling - after receiving a master's degree from New York University's film department in 1968, he edited documentaries and made commercials -but Mr. Scorsese's hustling paid off. Made in 27 days for $650,000, his third feature, ''Mean Streets,'' earned critical acclaim at the 1973 New York Film Festival and helped establish him as one of the country's oustanding directors - a reputation he would enhance with each successive film. In retrospect, however, he says that that succcess incurred heavy personal costs - three marriages fell apart, and his friendships, too, suffered from the pressures of his work. Intense, driven and passionate in his love of film, Mr. Scorsese, at 40, speaks in rapid staccato sentences - sentences that pile up on each other as though he cannot talk fast enough to express all his thoughts. Though his conversation often erupts into bursts of good-natured humor, he also possesses the nervous introspection of someone who has always been a loner. ''I wanted to look at what it's like to want something so badly you'd kill for it,'' he says of ''King of Comedy.'' ''By kill I don't mean kill physically, but you can kill the spirit, you can kill relationships, you can kill everything else around you in your life. It does affect personal relationships, and the final line for me at the time was that if I had to make a choice between work and a relationship, the personal relationship would go by the wayside. I don't have regrets - whatever's happened over the years, I think happened for the better, but maybe the reason I made this picture is because I hope I wouldn't think the same way now.'' If Rupert Pupkin represents the unaccommodated ambition Mr. Scorsese possessed as a young man, the Jerry Langford character serves as a kind of metaphor for the success the director - and his star, Robert De Niro - have since achieved. Like Langford, he worries about the demands of others who want to latch onto the coattails of his good fortune, and like Langford, he has experienced the isolating consequences of fame. ''It does cut off your social behavior,'' he says, ''In the period of the last three or four years, I've cut off a lot of the people around me - usually they need something, they want something and they think you can give it to them, but you can't. You have to be very, very careful. And while it's nice to be the center of attention, the danger is it may alter your perceptions. The most important thing for a director is his sense of the relationships between people. This social behavior I find fascinating, and very often, if you walk into a room and you're the center of attention, it's harder to pick up on these things. So what you have to do is go to things that are more deeply rooted - things that haven't altered, things that have obsessed you for years, things that you really know.'' One of the things that Mr. Scorsese has captured best in his films is a sense of American life - not so much life lived in the mainstream, but life lived on the margins, where the promises of the Dream seem both alluring and elusive. Charlie, the young would-be hood in ''Mean Streets,'' works for his gangster uncle and aspires to rise in the world of crime. Alice, liberated from the past by her husband's death, sets off for Monterey, hoping to make a new life as a singer. And Jake LaMotta in ''Raging Bull,'' and the Jimmy Doyle and Francine Evans in ''New York, New York'' also harbor dreams of success. Through these characters and a kind of documentary approach, Mr. Scorsese has created perfectly observed worlds: in 'Mean Streets,'' a portrait of life on the Lower East Side, as it is played out in the local pool halls and bars; in ''Alice,'' a portrait of blue-collar life amid the motels and diners of the Southwest; and in ''Taxi Driver,'' a portrait of night-life in New York. The last movie in particular purveys a dark vision indeed; it portrays the city as a place where alienation erupts into violence and despair. But while his movies often seem to be making certain social observations - ''King of Comedy,'' for instance, may be viewed as a kind of comment on America's obsession with celebrity -Mr. Scorsese says that those aspects do not really interest him. ''Taxi Driver,'' he explains, ''is much more Dostoyevskian than political.'' More than any of his contemporaries, in fact, Mr. Scorsese has been concerned with using film as a means of exploring his own behavior and preoccupations. The random violence in his movies, the sense that anything can happen, stems from the aimless street action the director witnessed as a child growing up in Manhattan; and the fact that all his heros, Pupkin and Langford included, are outsiders, afflicted with guilt and hungry for recognition or human contact, also has autobiographical roots. The son of a clothes presser, the director grew up in Little Italy, where asthma and a frail physique prevented him from taking part in the macho, street-smart life around him. He spent most of his free time going to the movies, and those movies made him want, more than anything, ''to be part of that incredible world of the creation of films.'' ''Films are like having a person around,'' he says. ''And to have films be so much a part of your life that you can't live without them is kind of nice, and I thought that's what I wanted to achieve for other people.'' In ''Mean Streets,'' Mr. Scorsese created a dark, vital portrait of street life on the Lower East Side - the very life he once felt so excluded from. Although the picture chronicled the attempts of young men trying to make it as small-time gangsters, it was more concerned, at heart, with exploring the hero's struggles to reconcile the moral dictates of his conscience with the brutal code of life around him. It raised the question, says Mr. Scorsese, of ''how does one practice Christian ethics and morals when you're in a world of that sort - and can you be a hoodlum and also be a saint'' The religious themes, of course, grew out of Mr. Scorsese's own Roman Catholic upbringing and his adolescent determination to become a priest. Although he later dropped out of the seminary and has since become an agnostic - ''I lost my faith in the man-made aspects of the religion'' -he says he still harbors a ''fascination, not necessarily with the Church, but with the teachings and trying to understand what the teachings are about.'' Indeed his films are all animated by this spiritual vision; they are inquiries of sorts into how to live and find an honest, noninstitutional faith. In Mr. Scorsese's first feature ''Who's That Knocking at My Door?,'' a young man attempted to reconcile sexual desire with his Catholic sense of guilt. In ''Taxi Driver,'' the demented hero's ascetism and isolation turned him into a kind of saint-run-amok; his determination to purge New York of its pimps and prostitutes, possessed all the fervor and intensity of the Old Testament God. And in ''Raging Bull,'' the story of the boxer Jake LaMotta's rise and fall took on mythic qualities of suffering and redemption. Not surprisingly, ''Raging Bull'' also reflected certain spiritual struggles Mr. Scorsese was experiencing at the time. It was 1978, and the director had just finished making ''New York, New York'' - a picture, he says now, that marked the end of his love affair with film. Employing painted backdrops and big musical numbers, the movie had been intended as a kind of homage to the Hollywood films of the 40's that Mr. Scorsese loved so much, but in shooting the picture, he found that it was ''nightmarish'' to try to recreate what no longer existed: the ''factory'' provided by the old studio system was gone, and the visual style of the old movies proved difficult to merge with his own. To make matters worse, Mr. Scorsese was also feeling overextended: while finishing ''New York, New York,'' he was also involved with making ''The Last Waltz,'' a documentary called ''American Boy'' and staging Liza Minnelli's Broadway show ''The Act.'' He was traveling too much and spending too much money, and he had begun to question all his values. ''Your values are upside down when the fun begins to take over, and you don't even know where you are,'' he says. ''I think L.A. became too much during that period, too much of a movie star town, and I realized I didn't belong.'' And so, before beginning ''Raging Bull,'' Mr. Scorsese took a 10-day vacation and did a lot of thinking. He thought about how messy his life had become and he thought about how the success he had wanted so much had turned out to be so hollow. Somehow, in the midst of this, he says he had a kind of revelation about how to make ''Raging Bull.'' In ''New York, New York,'' he had already touched upon the consequences of success - the marriage between the Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro characters falters when her career takes off and his does not - and he realized that a similar parable was provided by the story of how Jake LaMotta won a boxing championship at the expense of his family and self-esteem. The movie not only transformed Mr. Scorsese's personal dilemmas into a critically acclaimed work of art, but it also represented a kind of stylistic breakthrough. In the past, his films had possessed a nervous, eclectic style. They were filled with references to previous films - the Wizard of Oz homage in ''Alice,'' the ''Star is Born'' allusions in ''New York, New York'' - and his hectic, expressionistic camera work often jarred with his tendency to work with actors in a naturalistic, almost documentary, fashion. Largely in reaction to the high stylization of ''New York, New York,'' he had tried to simplify his technique in ''Raging Bull'' - the movie was even shot in gritty black and white - and in doing so had managed to integrate all these disparate elements into ''a complete cohesive style.'' In ''King of Comedy,'' the director's camera is even more static; it represents, he explains, an effort to simplify things further. In a sense, Mr. Scorsese has tried to do the same thing with his life. At the end of 1979, he left Los Angeles and moved back to New York, and now lives quietly in Lower Manhattan. The apartment has the same empty, almost antiseptic look of Jerry Langford's apartment in ''The King of Comedy,'' and it is filled with the sort of provisional furniture - metal bookcases and cheap metal and rattan chairs - someone acquires in the wake of a divorce. The television set is frequently left on without the sound -to give the illusion that someone else is home - and Mr. Scorsese says the first thing he does every morning is check the TV listings to see what movies are on. Although he has remained in touch with such friends as Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, he sees far less of them than he did during the late 60's and early 70's, when they were all starting out together. Most of his time, in fact, is spent working. At the moment, he is making plans to shoot his next picture based on Nikos Kazantzakis's ''The Last Temptation of Christ.'' ''It's calmed down a lot,'' he says. ''It may be kind of boring and lonely at times, but it's better for the work and it's better for you as a person. At 40, you do start to think about things differently. I must say, I can understand why people eventually stop making pictures - because to make films in such an impassioned way, you really have to believe in it, you've really got to want to tell that story, and after a while, you may find out that life itself is more important than the filmmaking process. Maybe part of the answer for what the hell we're doing here has to be in the process of living itself, rather than in the work.'' He pauses, and then laughs. ''Of course,'' he adds, ''you're talking to a person who's leaving this Sunday to look for new locations for the next picture.''

1249-> DEPAUL IN FINAL WITH FRESNO STATE
Like a zephyr out of the West, Fresno State swept into town yesterday and proved a point it has been trying to make for a long time. The Bulldogs answered those who criticized their credentials with an impressive 86-62 victory over Wake Forest to advance to the final against DePaul in the National Invitation Tournament. DePaul, the sentimental favorite, ran into trouble late in its semifinal game with Nebraska before winning, 68-58. The title game will be played at Madison Square Garden Wednesday night. It was more the ease and finesse that Fresno State displayed than the size of the score that reflected their prowess. The Bulldogs would have rolled up an even bigger margin had they not been so polite, passing off scoring opportunities to teammates. Ron Anderson took enough shots on his own to lead the Bulldogs with 24 points, one more than his teammate, Bernard Thompson. They provided an exciting tandem to the Garden crowd of 8,614, which included several planeloads of Fresno State fans flown in from California. Seventh Trip for Meyer Coach Ray Meyer of DePaul, who has brought seven of Blue Demon teams to the N.I.T. during four decades of coaching, admitted that he did not see the impressive Fresno State victory. ''I was in my hotel room,'' he said. ''I used to see them play in their gym all the time. I tried to recruit a couple. We were outrecruited, but I hope we're not outplayed.'' Five of the Fresno State players are from the Chicago area, including Anderson. Said Thompson: ''We wanted everyone in the nation to know that there were no if's, and we came here with the idea of winning the whole tournament.'' Fresno State Defense Tough It was the defense, a tough, unyielding network that functioned as well when played in zone or man-to-man, that won for Fresno State. The .667 percent accuracy from the floor just made everything easier. ''I thought that Wake Forest would run the ball more on us than they did,'' said the Fresno State coach, Boyd Grant, afterward. But Anderson and Company made that virtually impossible. ''All we tried to do,'' said Anderson, ''as to try to get as big a lead as we could and they would then have to come from behind.'' The Bulldogs did race off to a 9-point lead in the first half and they ran their advantage as high as 26 points in the second. In taking their 11th game in their last 12 starts and their 24th in 34 games over all, the Bulldogs proved why they are one of the topranked defensive teams in the country. The Wake Forest attack was reduced to desperation long shots, few of which went in. Only Delaney Rudd hit steadily, and he led the Deacons with 16 points. Anderson was the most versatile player for Fresno State. He scored layups, set shots, and fallaway jumpers, leading the Bulldogs to a 38-24 halftime lead. Alvis Rogers, wearing a two-pound cast on his leg as he closed out his college career, and Rudd tried valiantly to keep Wake Forest in the game, but the odds were overwhelming. In the closing minutes, Rogers fouled out and Rudd could not do it alone. DePaul's Meyer, who may close out his career if his team can take the final, thought his team played below its ability despite the victory. ''We didn't play well because Nebraska defensed us well,'' said the coach, whose team is 21-11. ''They came at us very strong and tried to deny us and force us out of our patterns.'' ''But by the same token, we did what we had to do when the game got close,'' said the 69-year-old coach. Nebraska picked away at DePaul's lead, which was 36-31 at the half and never went over 7 points in the second half. The Cornhuskers tied the score with nine minutes remaining, primarily because of the efforts of Dave Hoppen, a 6-foot-6-inch freshman. First Tony Jackson, who led DePaul with 17 points, and then Walter Downing fouled out in their efforts to control Hoppen in the final nine minutes, and the big center benefited at the free-throw line. He finished with 15 points. Nebraska's Claude Renfro, who scored 11 of his 13 points in the second half, also helped the Cornhuskers close the gap. Then DePaul's Tyrone Corbin made three crucial foul shots and a basket in a 12-2 run that enabled DePaul to pull away again.

1250-> News Summary; MONDAY, MARCH 21, 1983
International An effort to redefine currency values failed again at a meeting of Common Market finance ministers in Brussels. The ministers of the eight countries that maintain fixed exchange rates between their currencies also did not take other steps to turn back a wave of speculation that has engulfed their financial markets. Their inaction means that the central banks of the eight countries will not buy or sell currencies on the financial markets today to defend the fixed exchange rates they are required to maintain under the terms of the European Monetary System. Negotiations, however, will continue. (Page A1, Column 6.) A member of France's Cabinet quit, the first of President Francois Mitterrand's Socialist Government to depart. The Minister of Foreign Trade, Michel Jobert, resigned, saying that he had not been given enough authority to carry out his assignment to close France's foreign trade deficit. His resignation was announced during hectic Government consultations on economic policy and the flagging negotiations in Brussels on the Common Market's monetary system. (A1:5.) Venezuela may run out of food for its population of 16 million. The country is feeling the results of its neglect for agriculture during its preoccupation with its oil boom. The Government bank has reneged on promises of credit for farmers to enable them to buy such supplies as seeds and pesticides. (A1:3.) El Salvador's largest party split on the nomination of a candidate for president. The Christian Democrats suspended a convention to avoid having to decide between two popular party leaders. The meeting ended after Jose Napoleon Duarte, the party's most prominent figure, and his rival, Foreign Minister Fidel Chavez Mena, appealed jointly to the convention to allow them to meet privately to seek a nominating formula that would not divide the party. (A6:1.) The Syrian Army is stronger than before the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, according to military analysts in DeThey said the Soviet Union has replaced equipment destroyed by Israel in the invasion and has rebuilt the air defense system. (A4:3.) National The largest chemical waste handler in the United States has violated state and Federal laws in disposing of dangerous wastes at six or more of its 20 sites around the country, according to government documents, court records and former employees of the company. The company, Waste Management Inc., a billion-dollar public corporation, has within the last two years been cited several times for violation of environmental laws. (A1:1.) Public tolerance of illegal drugs is growing among all levels of American society, according to social scientists. They believe that the increasing availability and acceptance of drugs is bringing about profound social changes and that have neither been fully acknowledged nor fully understood. (A1:1.) The Mexican peso's decline has devastated the economy of El Paso, Tex., and other border cities. Since 1981, the peso-dollar exchange rate has dropped from 26 to the dollar to 157 to the dollar, cutting back the average Mexican's buying power, which had been a staple of El Paso's economy, to one-sixth of what it was in February 1981. (A12:1.) Skeptical Westerners are being told by Federal land managers that the Reagan Administration's proposal to sell millions of acres public lands will not be a threat to the region's economy, environment or way of life. The Bureau of Land Management has begun a series of open houses to explain the program. (A12:1.) Metropolitan Renewal of the Queens waterfront in the Hunters Point area is planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It proposes to turn 70 acres into a harbor project containing thousands of apartments and millions of square feet of commercial space. The development money would come from the sale of $100 million of the authority's bonds and $500 million from private developers. (A1:1.) A major auto race in a Queens park, proposed by an American promoter of the international Grand Prix races, has caused a commotion in the neighborhood of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the promoter, Daniel Koren, would like to stage the race in September. (A1:3.) Ogden R. Reid is re-entering politics. He announced that he will seek the Democratic nomination for Westchester County Executive. He served five terms in the House as a Republican and one as a Democrat before leaving in 1974 to run for Governor of New York State. (B2:1.) A routine test in New Jersey of the emergency shutdown system at the Salem nuclear plant in Lower Alloways Creek is incapable of detecting faults in the automatic shutdown system, a utility spokesman said. The plant's shutdown system failed last month, the first such failure at a commercial reactor in the United States. The plant has a another, more thorough, test of the system, but it is used less frequently, according to the spokesman. (B2:6.) Jury selection is to begin today in the trial of Donald Nash, who is charged with shooting to death a Federal witness and three CBS employees in a Hudson River pier parking lot nearly a year ago. (B4:4.)

1251-> SCOUTING;Vassallo on Deck
Though other athletes might have won more medals in the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, there was no greater hero than Jesse Vassallo. The Puerto Rican native, swimming for the United States, won two gold medals and one silver, and every time he swam, hundreds of relatives and friends, all wearing similar T-shirts, cheered him on. Vassallo is in Caracas, Venezuela, now for the Pan American Games. His once carefree attitude is restrained, and he watches the races with a look that says he would rather be in the pool. Last summer, while training for the world championship trials, Vassallo tore two ligaments in the left knee. He underwent surgery in October, and for three months he did not swim. Now the University of Miami senior is training 15,000 meters a day, but at an easy pace. He cannot sprint and he cannot bend the knee for the breast- stroke kick he needs in his specialty, the individual medley. ''In six months,'' he said, ''I think I can do everything normal. I want to swim. It was hard deciding whether to come to Caracas, but I think it was the best thing I could do. Maybe this will help me get hungrier. I think it has already.''

1252-> CONVINCING EUROPE AND CHINA
Vice President Bush and George P. Shultz have their work cut out for them. Mr. Bush will have to convincingly demonstrate to the Europeans that America does have a sense of direction on strategic and arms control matters, that it has a constructive and --------------------------------------------------------------------- Second of two articles --------------------------------------------------------------------- long-term program for dealing with the deeper causes of East-West instability in Central Europe, and that it is prepared to move forward with genuine political will in its quest for a Middle Eastern peace settlement - something of direct significance to the Western Europeans. Secretary of State Shultz needs to engage the Chinese in a serious strategic dialogue on the state of the American-Soviet-Chinese relationship. China should be treated as a genuine global partner, not merely as a bilateral squabbler over secondary issues such as textiles or even Taiwan. If the American-Chinese relationship narrows only to a diplomatic connection, these divisive issues become para- --------------------------------------------------------------------- Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, is senior adviser at the Georgetown University Center for Strategic and International Studies and professor of government at Columbia University. mountly important. But if the relationship is broadened, secondary disagreements can be subsumed in a larger pattern of strategic-political cooperation. It is difficult to demand that the Europeans deploy intermediate-range nuclear forces while the Administration waffles and mismanages the MX issue. Just as European willingness to deploy the missiles has become a litmus test of allegiance to the alliance and of willingness to shoulder the burdens of collective responsibility, so too MX deployment has become a test of our willingness to face up to the realities of the longer-term implications of the Soviet strategic challenge. Mr. Bush should be prepared to say that President Reagan will put his prestige on the line in favor of a mode of MX deployment to be recommended to him in the foreseeable future. The Europeans should be informed that the Administration is prepared to move expeditiously with arms control initiatives. For good tactical bargaining reasons, it would be premature for the Administration to give up its commitment to the ''zero option.'' But there is no reason why Mr. Bush could not indicate that in return for Soviet acceptance of the zero option as the eventual goal of progressive arms control arrangements, the Administration would in return be prepared to implement that objective by stages which in the meantime maintain relative symmetry between Soviet deployments targeted on Europe and an alliance response. Our public posture in Europe would be much better if the negotiator Paul H. Nitze's reported formula for an interim missile settlement - 75 on each side - was seen as rejected by Moscow while being sympathetically considered by Washington. The Soviet Union's economic crisis, matched by Eastern Europe's economic stagnation, is likely to make the Polish political crisis an enduring one. Mr. Bush should be prepared to say that America sees a major danger and a significant opportunity in the continuing Polish tragedy. A political eruption in Poland would probably precipitate Soviet intervention, with calamitous consequences for all parties concerned. Our sanctions are justified as an initial response to the brutality inflicted upon Poland, but a longer-term strategy must have both negative and positive sides. Europeans would be both more impressed and more supportive of our efforts if Mr. Bush could inform them that Mr. Reagan has appointed a high-level interagency task force, headed by someone of established expertise and reputation, to develop jointly with our Western European friends a longer-term economic package for Poland, possibly subject to International Monetary Fund supervision, in the event that Moscow and Warsaw were to opt for national reconciliation and political relaxation. Such a concrete step would help convince the Western Europeans that our policy on Poland is not motivated merely by tactical animus and designed to maximize Eastern European and Soviet difficulties but is also part of a longer-range strategy aimed at eventually shaping a more constructive East-West framework in Central Europe. In China, Mr. Shultz should provide assurances that Washington is prepared to revive and implement some of the strategic understandings developed in the latter stages of the Carter Administration and reinforced in Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s first discussion with Peking, including the willingness to provide some types of defensive weapons systems. Beyond that, Peking should be told we do not object to normalization in formal Chinese-Soviet relations, provided that China make such normalization truly conditional on Soviet fulfillment of the three conditions publicly set by the Chinese. These involve Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia and reduction of the Soviet troops stationed on the Chinese frontier, particularly of the Soviet forces deployed in Mongolia. From our standpoint, fulfillment of these three conditions would not be disadvantageous, and in any case their implications ought to be systematically reviewed in comprehensive joint discussions, designed to establish some shared American-Chinese perspectives on key global problems. A strategically substantive approach is needed regarding both Europe and China, not to intensify the cold war but to prevent what clearly is in the forefront of current Soviet strategy: a progressive American-European divorce and a separation of China from America.

1253-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Theaters Join Battle To Save Arts Budget
At the Philharmonic one night last week, music lovers learned from their programs that the Haydn was Symphony No. 88 in G major, that the Dvorak was Symphony No. 8 in G major and that the New York State Council on the Arts could get a $4.5 million budget cut. Thousands of fliers are being tucked into programs at music halls and theaters around town as the Emergency Committee to Save the Arts in New York State lobbies cultural consumers, urging them to write Governor Cuomo about the council's proposed $28 million budget. On Friday, legislative leaders and the Governor agreed to a budget outline, but specific reductions have not been made known. The council gives grants to institutions from the most modest dance company to the Museum of Modern Art, which is distributing 30,000 fliers to visitors. For his part, Mr. Cuomo says that cuts must be made across the board and that legislators who object should suggest alternatives. ''You're talking a flyspeck here,'' countered Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, who has joined Joseph Papp, Beverly Sills, Ellen Burstyn and C. Douglas Dillon to fight cuts in the council's budget. ''Even a modest blink on estimates of revenue would cover it.''

1254-> LONGISH WAIT AT STEP;
The room is at Fifth Avenue and 50th Street, behind the sculpture of Atlas, up the escalator and to the left. It is the New York Passport Agency office, and if you want to avoid the crowd, arrive early. ''We tell our customers, be there at 7 to 7:30 to get out by lunch time,'' says Peter Cluff, an agent for JB's World Travel. One recent afternoon, the office, which is run by the State Department, was filled with about 200 people: singles and families, vacationers and businessmen, fidgety children and crying babies. It was hot. One little boy weaved among people as if they were slalom poles. About 3 in the afternoon, there was a crash. A policeman had grabbed a rowdy fellow and pressed him against a marble wall. ''Oh, that's nothing,'' said one office worker. ''That happens every day. In fact, this is the quiet season.'' Last summer, such conditions led to many complaints about service at the Federal office. The crowding persists despite the fact that applications for passports may be made at certain post offices and courthouses in the metropolitan area, so-called acceptance centers. Under that arrangement, which has existed for about 10 years, passports are mailed in three to five weeks. During the peak hours of 11 A.M. to 2 P.M., the wait at the agency averaged one to two hours. ''Why am I standing here?'' asked Coulter Watt of Queens, who had been waiting an hour and a half to renew his passport. ''It's ridiculous. It takes three seconds to fill in a form, and two hours to turn it in.'' Half those in line said they needed a passport that day or overnight, a service only the Passport Agency provides. The other half, most of whom were planning summer trips, said they did not know about the acceptance centers. Anatole C. Ritikoff of Queens said he was unaware that seven post offices in his borough took passport applications. ''If I'd known, I would have gone,'' he said. Yesterday morning, there was a trickle of business at two midtown acceptance centers. At the Franklin D. Roosevelt Station, at Third Avenue and 53d Street, two people were applying for passports at about 11 A.M. At the General Post Office, Eighth Avenue and 33d Street, six people were on the passport line at 1 P.M. Efforts to call the agency office's only published telephone number were frustrating. Calls placed before 9 A.M. and after 3 P.M. got through after about five minutes of dialing, but several calls made from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. rang for more than 20 minutes without an answer. John St. Denis, the regional director of the office, acknowledged that there was an crowding problem but said increased use of the acceptance centers would lessen his office's burden. ''In the past 18 months,'' he said, ''it's been wall-to-wall people all the time.'' About 80 percent of the passport applicants, he said, come to the passport office, while 20 percent mail in their applications or go to acceptance centers. Promoting Use of Centers ''I've been trying to get those figures reversed, or at least, equal,'' Mr. St. Denis said. ''I would be pleased to see 60 percent and 40 percent.'' Mr. St. Denis became regional director last September. Since then, he said, he has sought to promote the use of the other centers. Since last year, there has been a 16.7 percent increase in the number of applications taken at the agency, according to John Caulfield, a spokesman for the State Department. Between Oct. 1, 1981 and March 31, 1982, there were 127,043 applications taken at the New York office, while for the same six months beginning in October 1982, there were 148,310 applications. The increase, Mr. Caulfield said, was probably reflected more people travelling because of the dollar's strength overseas. Also, he said, a recent increase in the cost of a passport, which went from $10 to $35 on Jan. 1, probably caused many to apply before the higher charge took effect. Helen Strauchen, assistant regional director of the agency, said several steps had been taken to handle the increased number of applications. The office's staff of about 80 has recently been increased by 10, and the employees were switched from a 40-hour to a 48-hour week. In addition, she said, some applications are sent to passport offices in Boston and Philadelphia, which have night shifts. The agency also plans to add more telephone lines and to increase its telephone room staff.

1255-> PANEL TO PROMOTE BOND ISSUE
A campaign committee has been established, at the urging of Governor Cuomo and key aides, to raise money for the promotion of the proposed $1.25 billion transportation bond issue that will appear on the November ballot. The revenue from the bond issue would be used to improve the state's roads, rails, bridges, ports and mass transportation. Timothy J. Russert, the Governor's counselor, said Mr. Cuomo and several aides had decided that a committee should be created to collect contributions from labor unions and other supporters of the bond issue. Mr. Russert said the committee hoped to raise about $100,000 to pay for advertising about the proposed issue. The committee will be run by representatives of business and organized labor. They will be named next month. Under the state election law, state officials and agencies are restricted to providing ''informational'' material about proposed bond issues. They are not permitted to urge voter approval, Mr. Russert said. The treasurer of the group, to be called the ''Vote Yes - Rebuild New York Bond Issue Committee,'' will be Chester J. Straub, a lawyer and former State Senator. Mr. Straub filed papers Tuesday with the State Board of Elections. Various union groups are expected to promote the bond issue at Labor Day ceremonies across the state next month, said Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son and adviser. He is working with organized labor to get the bond issue approved.

1256-> MUSIC: ASTON MAGNA CONCERT
ASTON MAGNA'S concert Saturday evening at Abraham Goodman House juxtaposed the well known and the obscure in a pleasing manner. Under the artistic direction of Albert Fuller, who also plays harpischord, the troupe presented chamber music by Bach, Mozart, Biber and Buxtehude, and managed to combine scholarly authenticity with a refreshing verve and spontaneity. The least successful performance of the evening was of Mozart's luscious Quintet in G minor (K. 516), which was presented as a chamber concerto for the excellent first violin of Jaap Schroder rather than as a unified endeavor. But Bach's concerto in D minor for two violins (BWV 1043), highlighting Mr. Schroder and Stanley Ritchie, featured a warm spiritual communion, as well as some lively imitative play in the opening movement. Buxtehude's Trio in B flat (Op. 1, No. 4), could, in time, possibly rival Pachelbel's famous canon in popularity, as it is another attractive set of variations built over an incessant and irresistible riff. In addition to Mr. Fuller, Mr. Schroder and Mr. Ritchie, Aston Magna includes Fortunato Arico on cello and gamba, David Miller on viola, Linda Quan on violin, Nancy Wilson on violin and viola and Thomas Wolf on giolone.

1258-> BORG GETS CLERC AS OPPONENT
The luck of the draw could make Bjorn Borg's last tournament one of the shortest of his illustrious career. Borg has been matched in first-round play Tuesday at the Monte Carlo Open against Jose-Luis Clerc of Argentina, who is seeded third. Having dominated professional tennis for much of the last decade, Borg took a leave from competition last year. A 1983 comeback had been expected, but he announced his retirement late in January, saying that the sport had ceased to be enjoyable. The 26-year-old Swede elected to play his farewell tournament here in Monaco, where he has made his residence to avoid taxes on the millions of dollars he has earned in prize money and endorsements. Meanwhile, the tournament's organizers were able to get in only two matches on the opening day today before rain and a chilly wind caused the rest of the scheduled competition to be postponed. In one of those matches, Pablo Arraya of Peru defeated Mark Dickson of the United States, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2. In the other, unseeded Mel Purcell of the United States upset his eighth-seeded countryman, Jimmy Arias, 6-4, 6-1.

1259-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Koch Goes Into Act On Why He Lost
Mayor Koch has finally explained why he lost to Mario M. Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He had forgotten some advice given him as a little boy, he said, ''by a lusty lifeguard at Brighton Beach.'' The advice was ''Be Italian,'' which happens to be a number from the Broadway musical ''Nine.'' Backed by cast members, the Mayor performed his rebuttal to ''Koch on the Rocks,'' the three-act political spoof by members of the Inner Circle at their annual dinner Saturday night. The organization is made up of past and present political reporters. Governor Cuomo, Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato and local politicians were among 1,200 guests at the New York Hilton. Mr. Koch twitted the journalists but mostly himself, over his September defeat. The onstage admonition to be Italian, addressed to a child actor playing the young Edward I. Koch, included a warning that, otherwise, ''you'll only be Mayor and have to live in Grazia Mansion.'' In black tie, Mr. Koch did a little dance, played the tambourine and sang a song by Clark Whelton, his speechwriter: ''I would like the universe to get down on its knees/and say, 'Edward, whatever you please./ It's O.K. even if it's reee-dic-u-lous.' ''

1260-> STATE 1,600 IS WON BY CARMEL'S STAHR
Mike Stahr of Carmel High School is undefeated as a miler for the last two years. Today, however, he came just 2 feet from being beaten. Stahr narrowly won the 1,600-meter run from Charles Marsala of New Dorp in Staten Island in the New York State Boys and Girls Interscholastic Indoor Track and Field Championships at Cornell's Barton Hall. Stahr's winning time of 4 minutes 13.26 seconds was a meet record. Marsala, who barely missed catching the Carmel senior with a furious sprint over the final 100 meters, was second in 4:13.31, also under the previous meet mark of 4:15 set by Jim Tyler of Norwood-Norfolk in 1981. Rodney Clarke, a junior at Automotive in Brooklyn, defeated the pre-race favorites, Jeff Van Wie of Suffern and Miles Irish of Burnt Hills, in the 600-meter. Clarke's time was 1:20.8, tying the national indoor record, hand-timed, set by Irish last week. Rhonda Phillips of Mont Pleasant, Schenectady, caught Debbie Grant of Ramapo in the final 10 meters of the girls' 600 meter run to win in 1:34.66, a personal best. Tom Day of Bishop Gibbons (Albany), who started the indoor season late, turned in his best performance when he took the 1,000-meter run in 2:30.12, a meet record. Irish was an easy winner of the 3,200-meter run in the meet-record time of 9:08.62. James Drake of Jamesville-DeWitt and Veronica Haberle of Longwood (L.I.), were double winners. Drake won the 55 meter and 300-meter dashes, and Miss Haberle was first at 1,000 meters and 1,700 meters (the field ran an extra lap in the latter event).

1261-> SUIT CHALLENGES ILLINOIS DEATH ROW CONDITIONS
Illinois has opened a second death row to house an overflow of condemned prisoners, and conditions at both places are under legal challenge. A suit by the American Civil Liberties Union will go to trial, probably this year, charging that both the original death row at the Menard Correctional Facility downstate and the new one at the Pontiac Correctional Facility about 40 miles from Chicago violate the United States Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. The A.C.L.U. also contends that the facilities violate Illinois law, which says, ''A person is unfit to be executed if because of a mental condition he is unable to understand the nature and purpose of such sentence.'' The civil liberties union says the physical deprivation and emotional stress of long hours in tiny cells quickly render any prisoner on death row mentally unfit to make a decision about execution. Too Small for Sit-Ups Death row at Menard now has 44 prisoners and the new facility, which opened in December, has five occupants and room for 42 more. The individual cells measure 40 to 50 square feet, roughly the size of a small apartment bathroom, and are too small for a prisoner to do sit-ups on the floor. In these cells, prisoners spend a minimum of 21 hours a day. Five days a week they get one and a half hours of recreation and one and a half hours in the library. The A.C.L.U. and other civil rights groups say the facilities are cruel, not only to those who might spend several years there before being executed but also to prisoners whose death sentences are overturned and are released into the general prison population. ''Spending years in conditions like that are bad enough if you are executed, but it can be a psychologically damaging experience that lasts a lifetime if you are eventually released from death row,'' said Harvey Grossman, an A.C.L.U. lawyer heading the case against the state. Told to Ready for Trial The state tried to get the lawsuit dismissed, but a Federal district judge ruled in late December that both parties should begin preparing for trial. The civil liberties union contends that many of the prisoners on death row do not need to be there, and Mr. Grossman cites a November 1981 comment by Michael Lane, the head of the Corrections Department, who said, ''In my judgment, not all of the inmates require this ultra-maximum restraint we impose on them in death row.'' Some states, including Pennsylvania, have no death row, and Mr. Grossman says it exists in Illinois primarily to placate guards who are afraid of an uprising by desperate prisoners. A Department of Corrections official would not comment on that issue. It costs Illinois $20,000 a year to maintain a prisoner on death row, about twice as much as a regular maximum-security prisoner, according to Mr. Lane. The state's financial troubles recently resulted in a $164 million budget reduction, but the Corrections Department, struggling to keep abreast of the growing prison population, took a relatively light cut. 25% More Inmates Expected The state is building new institutions and renovating old mental hospitals to handle an expected 25 percent increase in inmates by 1985. The death row population is no exception. Since Gov. James R. Thompson signed a death penalty law in June 1977, about 10 new prisoners have moved onto death row each year. An Illinois prisoner was last put to death in 1962. Of the 49 inmates now on death row, one is scheduled to die this month and another in May, though legal action may well postpone the executions. Their projected fate, though the Legislature has recently debated the use of lethal injection to carry out death sentences, is electrocution.

1263-> Davis Outpoints Baltazar in Jersey
Howard Davis Jr. was knocked down twice with left hooks today, but he got up twice and went on to score a unanimous 10-round decision over the previously undefeated Tony Baltazar in a nationally televised lightweight fight at Resorts International. ''You can punch,'' Davis told Baltazar afterward. Davis said he could remember only one knockdown: ''That's how hard he hit me.'' Baltazar, a 22-year-old Californian who entered with 20 knockouts and a 24-0 record, floored Davis in the fifth and eighth rounds. Moments before the final bell, he staggered the 1976 Olympic champion again, but if the crowd thought Baltazar's obviously harder punching had won this fight, the judges were in complete disagreement. Frank Cairo, one of the three judges, in fact gave Baltazar only the two knockdown rounds on his 8-2 scorecard. Charles Spina had Davis ahead by 7-3 and John Stewart scored it 5-4-1. Criticism of Judges ''I thought the judging was ridiculous,'' said Davis. ''I thought I won, but I thought it was much closer than 8-2. I think 6-4 would have been more like it.'' Baltazar did not claim victory, but agreed that the ''fight was a lot closer than the judges thought.'' ''But I'm a long way from home,'' said the 134-pound La Puente, Calif., boxer. ''I came to his backyard to fight him and I kind of expected it.'' This was Davis's 22d victory against a loss that came in his attempt to win the World Boxing Council 135-pound title three years ago from Jim Watt of Scotland. Although Davis continued on his drive for a match with Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini for the World Boxing Association lightweight title, he was not impressive today. He still pulls back while throwing punches, thus reducing his already limited power, and despite his great speed, he still gets caught. His jab and foot speed kept him safely away from his opponent in the early rounds, but Baltazar said he never was frustrated. ''I knew I was going to hit him and I knew he was going to go down,'' said Baltazar. Davis, a 133 3/4-pounder from Dix Hills, L.I., seemed in control against a fighter who had beaten no one of note (Baltazar had knocked out Roberto Garcia four times to pad his record). But after landing a combination in the fifth round, Davis left his right hand down low. Baltazar threw a hook over the dropped hand and Davis went down quickly. He had been knocked down before -by Norman Goins, Luis Davilla and Vilomar Fernandez - and he had always gotten up. Davis fought back while he quickly regained his composure and was dancing again by the end of the round. Baltazar, whose defense against the barrage of Davis punches was surprisingly good, now seemed mesmerized. He began looking for the big punch. Finally, in the eighth, it came again, another hook. But Davis again had the instincts and experience to fight back. By the 10th round, with Baltazar clearly tired, Davis was in complete control - until staggered by another hook just moments before the bell. Boza-Edwards Wins LAS VEGAS, Nev., Feb. 27 (UPI) -Cornelius Boza-Edwards, in his last bout before attempting to regain the World Boxing Council junior lightweight title, stopped Pedro Laza at 1:49 of the ninth round today. The victory was Boza-Edwards's 38th against three losses and set the stage for his fight against Bobby Chacon, the W.B.C. champion. That fight will take place this May in either California or Nevada, according to the promoter Don Chargin. In the eighth, Boza-Edwards knocked down Laza with a right hand. In the ninth, a left-right-left combination by Boza-Edwards prompted the referee Richard Steel to call for a standing 8-count. Boza-Edwards then landed three rights to drop Laza for a final time. The knockout was the 29th for Boza-Edwards. Laza's record slipped to 22-2.

1264-> Loughlin, St. Anthony's Gain
Mark Jackson scored 11 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and led Bishop Loughlin to a 87-78 upset victory over St. Agnes yesterday to win the Catholic High Schools Athletic Association B title at St. Francis Prep in Queens. With the victory, Bishop Loughlin took another step forward in the New York State basketball championships. In the second game, Ray Rath hit two free throws with five seconds left in overtime to give St. Anthony's of Smithtown, L.I., a 54-53 victory over St. Peter's of Staten Island for the A Division championship. Bishop Loughlin will meet Long Island Lutheran Tuesday night at Archbishop Forbes High School in Brooklyn to determine the C.H.S.A.A. and Alliance of Independent Schools B Division champion. The winner will go to Glens Falls, N.Y., Friday to play Printing High School, the Public Schools Athletic League B Division champion. St. Anthony's will play Springfield Gardens, of Queens, Friday in Glens Falls in a semifinal game of the state championships. Bishop Loughlin opened a 12-point lead in the third quarter. Along with his 25 points, Jackson blocked two shots and contributed two steals, five assists and seven rebounds. James Major finished with 28 points for Bishop Loughlin.

1265-> NONPROFIT GROUP GOES INTO BUSINESS
Confronted with a $5 million cut in Federal grants to help New York's jobless, the 49-year-old Federation Employment and Guidance Services says it considered scaling back its program drastically. "We didn't do it," said Alfred P. Miller, executive director of the nonprofit agency, which last year served 70,000 workers. "What did we do? We could no just sit there. We had to move along. We got in our covered wagon and headed West." "Our wagon - our vehicle for change - was exploiting our experience in training workers and persuading companies in the city we could help improve their employment practices and marketing systems, make them more profitable," Mr. Miller said. The profits from these commercial ventures are being plowed back into the agency so it can continue to train and find jobs for hte hard to employ. Agency Still Gets Federal Funds The agency has already obtained contracts totaling $150,000. It now has a score of clients for the commercial ventures in the metropolitan area - including hospitals, utilities, a university, insurance companies and three major industrial concerns - and it has prospects for potential earnings of $3 million a year, Mr. Miller said. The agency still gets $13 million in Federal funds for programs to assist newly arrived immigrants, help bring high school dropouts back to the school system, work with women returning to the labor market, and conduct treatment services for the mentally retarded and physically handicapped. The services offered in the new venturew range from helping clients run a preretirement counseling service to improving systems in assessing the promotion and career potential of employees. One company received help in setting up a rehabilitation service for alcoholics. The agency also provides courses in computer work, accounting and bookkeeping. Typically, the agency also has been called in for help when a concern intends closing down a plant and wants to try placing workers elsewhere. Continues to Assist Employees The agency assisted the F.W. Woolworth Company when it closed Woolco Stores and 35,000 employees around the country lost their jobs. It is continuing to assist employees who had worked witht he Warner Lambert Company, which closed the American Chicle Company in Long Island City and laid off 455 workers. That was in 1981, but some employees still have not found new jobs. "Once we get involved with such people, we continue to give them assistance, even though our contract expires," said Mr. Miller, who started his career as a foreign-affairs student specializing in Eastern Europe, but then shifted to social welfare work and rehabilitation counseling. Since the agency first opened its doors in lower Manhattan in 1934, it has grown into the largest nonprofit employment and training undertaking in New York. The operation is directed from headquarters at 114 Fifth Avenue and has workshops and counseling services in 50 locations around the city. A few have been lcosed to trim costs after the budgets cuts. The organization is one of 130 member agencies of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, which provided $1 million this year. The reduction in Federal funds, Mr. Miller said, had underscored the danger of becoming overly dependent on government resources. Other nonprofit organizations outside New York are facing similar problems, he said. A number of such groups are continuing to seek his agency's assistance in developing similar services, he said. ''We'll give our technical help free to any nonprofit agency wanting it,'' he said, ''because we consider them members of the same family.''

1267-> MARINE SAYS ISRAELIS FIRE INDISCRIMINATELY
The commander of the 1,200 United States marines in Lebanon said today that Israeli Army units were endangering civilians and marines with indiscriminate gunfire. He said the situation was due to the Israelis' ''gross lack'' of discipline. The complaint by the Marine commander, Col. James M. Mead, was the latest in a series of confrontations and criticisms that have strained relations between Israeli and United States forces in Lebanon. The Marines are there as part of a peacekeeping force that also includes British, French and Italian troops. Asked about Colonel Mead's remarks, the Israeli military command issued a statement saying, ''Lately the Marines are publishing data that have no basis.'' (A Marine spokeman quoted by Reuters said that on Saturday Israeli forces were refused permission to patrol an area on the edge of Beirut controlled by American and Lebanese forces. (The spokesman, Maj. William Grein, said Israelis in two jeeps had asked Lebanese soldiers at a joint American-Lebanese checkpoint for permission to send tanks and armored personnel carriers into an area out of bounds to Israelis. He said the Lebanese had refused the request and the Israelis had left without incident.) Colonel Mead said Israeli units on the edge of the southern Beirut sector patrolled by the Marines had engaged in ''reconnaissance by fire'' - indiscriminate firing into roadside areas to deter ambushes. He said this practice might be a reason why the Israelis were trying to keep marines from patrolling the area. 5 Civilians Reported Slain Hisham Shaar, head of Lebanon's internal security force until early March, said last month that five civilians had been killed by the Israeli shooting. A spokesman for the force was unable to provide casualty figures Sunday but said some civilians had been killed and others wounded. Israeli military sources who asked not to be identified said the Israeli authorities had already denied a Lebanese accusation that civilians had been killed when Israelis had fired along roadsides to flush out ambushers. Shooting along the Sidon highway is directed only into unpopulated areas, the officers said. Colonel Mead said in an interview that for the last two months the Israelis had ''come down the Sidon highway and, without having been fired upon, they just fire great numbers of rounds to the east of Sidon highway.'' He said the Israelis had originally barred the marines from crossing the Sidon road ''because they were concerned for our safety.'' ''Apparently the Israelis are concerned about their gross lack of fire discipline,'' he said. Colonel Mead said the Israelis had been firing to the west of the highway, toward Marine positions, ''and we were catching ricochets in our positions.'' ''We told them to cease and desist the indiscriminate fire,'' he said. ''So now the indiscriminate fire only happens to the east.'' 'It's the Old Vietnam Tactic' ''It's the old Vietnam tactic of recon by fire,'' he added. ''It's a very poor tactic. All it does is endanger, via ricochets, other forces or civilians. It never stopped a terrorist.'' Colonel Mead said the Israelis might have planned recent confrontations in which Israeli soldiers stopped Marine patrols and taunted the Americans. ''It's my thought that because of the frequency of the incidents it must be greater than happenstance,'' he said. He added that the Israelis had been told repeatedly that the marines, at the request of the Lebanese Government, were free to patrol anywhere in greater Beirut. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Robert H. Barrow, recently wrote to Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger to complain of what he called Israeli provocation of the marines, ''complete with verbal degradation of the officers, their uniform and country.'' Last week Defense Minister Moshe Arens of Israel urged that better relations be established to avoid friction between Israeli troops and marines.

1268-> Brooklyn's Boys of TV
THE title was appropriated by the author Roger Kahn from the phrase of a poet. Dylan Thomas once wrote, ''I see the boys of summer in their ruin...'' But the title of Roger Kahn's book continues to define a certain team in a certain time - the Brooklyn Dodgers of three decades ago. At its spring training base in Vero Beach, Fla., now, the Dodger organization talks of the coming baseball season being the 25th anniversary of the club's arrival in Los Angeles. But to anyone who remembers those Dodgers, the club's emphasis is backwards. It's the 25th anniversary of the Dodgers abandoning Brooklyn. In baseball or any sport, most famous teams gradually separate, if not disintegrate. But the phrase has kept the Boys of Summer tied together. They don't see one another that often. But they are always thought of as a group. Mention one and you mention the others. Baseball oldtimers talk about the 1927 Yankees as having had a similar group identity, but only a few are still alive. Now those Boys of Summer have been spliced together for a charming and compelling two-hour television special produced and written by Marty Bell. As they talk of their time, they are seen occasionally in old black-and-white film as they were then, but mostly as they are now. Pee Wee Reese inspecting bats in the Louisville Slugger factory. Duke Snider broadcasting a Montreal Expos game. Roy Campanella being lifted out of his wheelchair into the front seat of an automobile. Carl Furillo acknowledging he has leukemia. Carl Erskine swimming with his retarded son. Preacher Roe showing how he doctored his spitball. Joe Black at his desk as a Greyhound bus executive. Clem Labine putting an arm around his son who lost a leg in Vietnam. In the decade since Roger Kahn revisited the Boys of Summer for the book, Jackie Robinson has died. So has Gil Hodges, so has Billy Cox. Even so, Jackie Robinson remains the most dominating personality on the TV show, just as he was on the team. More than anyone else, Jackie Robinson gave those Dodgers their identity as the ''Jackie Robinson Dodgers,'' the first integrated major league baseball team. But in one of Roger Kahn's lines that is repeated on the show by the host, Sid Caesar, nobody went to Ebbets Field for sociology. ''I don't know what made it different,'' Pee Wee Reese says on the show of having played in Brooklyn then, ''but it was.'' One element that made it different was the rivalry with the New York Giants, who later went to San Francisco for the 1958 season as passengers in Walter O'Malley's covered wagon. Two teams in the same league in the same city a subway ride apart who played 22 games against each other every season. That's a rivalry. ''We hated the Giants,'' recalls Carl Furillo, ''we just hated the uniform.'' After the 1956 season, the Dodgers dared to trade Jackie Robinson to the Giants for Dick Littlefield, a left-handed pitcher, and $30,000, a fairly substantial sum then. But rather than report, Jackie Robinson retired from baseball; the deal was canceled. ''Of all people, the Giants,'' remembers Pee Wee Reese with a sneer. ''I'd have been disappointed if he'd gone. Glad he didn't go.'' Another element that made it different was that, until 1955, those Dodgers lost four World Series to another neighbor, the Yankees. ''Billy Martin, now he was a mediocre hitter,'' Carl Furillo says of the Yankee second baseman who batted .500 with a record 12 hits in the 1953 World Series. ''Pretty good second baseman, but a mediocre hitter. Yet when he played us in Ebbets Field, I think he hit two doubles or two triples into right-center field.'' In old film, Carl Furillo is seen fielding balls at Ebbets Field off the scoreboard and the angled right-field wall. ''They used to give a suit to anybody who'd hit that sign,'' Pee Wee Reese says, referring to the Abe Stark clothing sign at the base of the scoreboard. ''But Furillo played right in front of it. Nobody ever hit it.'' Some of the Boys chide Duke Snider, now a Hall of Famer, for not having been an even better player. ''I once asked him, 'Why don't you charge those ground balls? These guys don't even hesitate at second base,' '' Pee Wee Reese says. ''He said, 'I was an infielder when I was younger and I hated those ground balls and I still hate 'em.' '' ''He could've been greater,'' Clem Labine says. ''I think Clem's right,'' Duke Snider says. Preacher Roe, now doing public relations for a West Plains, Mo., bank after years of owning a food market there, stands in his backyard with a baseball as if he suddenly needed to throw his spitball for a strike. ''When you touch your hat,'' he says, ''that's when you could get it and put it on your hand.'' But like the book, much of the show is concerned with what makes the men, for better or for worse. Of Clem Labine's search for the love of his son. Jay Labine's resentment of living in his father's shadow as a youngster almost slashes the TV screen when he says, ''I didn't pitch for the damn Dodgers, I'm me.'' As he talks about it, Clem Labine weeps. Of Joe Black, married five times, being with his 12-year-old daughter as she practices long jumps in the Arizona heat. ''Men see their children 3 years old,'' he says. ''The next time they look they say, 'I didn't know you were 14.' '' Of Carl Erskine, now the president of an Indiana bank, trying without success to teach his retarded son, Jimmy, to say, ''No, thank you'' to others instead of grunting. One day Jimmy did something that merited a spanking. ''I took him upstairs,'' Carl Erskine says, ''He looked at me. He said, 'No, thank you.' '' Of Roy Campanella, smiling in his wheelchair as he remembered the auto accident on a slippery street near his Glen Cove, L.I., home that ended his Hall of Fame career before he could resume it in Los Angeles. ''I wanted to play in the Coliseum,'' he says, referring to where the team played before Dodger Stadium was completed. ''I never saw a left-field fence like that.'' Roy Campanella works in community relations for the Dodgers in Los Angeles now. But even 25 years later the Boys of Summer have never really left Brooklyn, and they never will.

1269-> OFFICIALLY, SPRING WAFTS IN
Bursts of sunlight through occasional clouds, rows of tentative tulips at Rockefeller Center and the patter of jogging sneakers in Central Park offered a preview of spring in the metropolitan area yesterday. But officially, spring did not begin until last night. Offering a technical definition, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, Stephen Hogan, said: ''At 11:39 Sunday night, the sun moves from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere and is directly over the equator.'' Yet spring took on more personal meanings in celebrations around New York. The crowds at Rockefeller Center, for instance, were looking at sea horses, dragons, mountain goats and swans. The animals had been sculptured from ice, and by noon they were dripping in the sun and shooting off rainbows. Molly Siple, who was ice skating, said: ''There's no better way to start spring! I climbed up and had my picture taken standing by Prometheus and all the ice sculptures. What could be more garish? But I loved it!'' Max Wessels, a chef and freelance ice sculptor, revved up his chain saw. His sculpture, the Statue of Liberty, was sinking into a large pool. Liberty's left arm kept slipping off, the torch in her right hand had melted away, and her crown, tilting like a beret, was held on by a bandana. ''She's been in the sun all day,'' said Mr. Wessel, wiping his own dripping brow. ''The warm weather is really back.'' But not for long. The National Weather Service forecast for today calls for a windy day with rain, ''heavy at times, causing some road and urban flooding.'' The highs are expected to be in the low 40's. Yesterday, in the gray canyons of midtown Manhattan, the air smelled sweet and was mild on the cheek. There was a boy in khaki shorts and a girl in a red miniskirt. A sidewalk salesman was selling sunglasses instead of umbrellas. A Day for a Picnic Although Central Park is crowded on every sunny day, this day seemed special. Thomas K. Ramsey and Evelyn P. Kelso were standing in front of a forsythia bush, looking at one its small yellow buds. They said they were searching for signs of spring. ''We just had a picnic on a rock,'' Mr. Ramsey said. ''We had cheese sandwiches, yogurt and oranges. We were visited by a bee, but he was sluggish. He still seemed to be in his winter habits. We are enjoying the colors of the park, the smell of the earth.'' At the Central Park Zoo, a man threw mackerel from a bucket labeled ''Bears'' into the tank for seals. He threw them as if he were throwing footballs, in overhand spirals. There was a crowd, five people deep, around the tank. When a seal made a spectacular catch across the pool, in the end zone, the crowd burst into applause. ''Seals are incredible,'' one woman said to a friend. ''I hear they will swim thousands of miles, even up to the North Pole, to find a mate.'' It was a fine day for human performers, as well. In front of the Plaza Hotel, a juggler kept three balls in the air as he told a story called ''Man, Woman and the Forces of Evil.'' At Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, spectators watched a man perform a martial arts dance next to a sign that proclaimed ''Tai Chi is a gift from God.'' Further down Fifth Avenue, a crowd gathered as James Graseck, a musician who enjoys street performing, played the Bach Fugue in G-Minor on the violin. ''Spring is the dawn of life,'' Mr. Graseck said afterward. ''There is a sense of newness and freshness today. I try to put some of that in my playing.''

1270-> NEEDIEST CASES FUND ENDS WITH RECORD $1,886,50
With a record total of $1,886,500.24 in donations from a record high number of 13,236 donors, the 71st annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund ended last Monday. Despite the recession, total contributions to the drive were substantially greater than the previous record of $1,535,501.54 given by the more than 10,350 donors during the 70th annual appeal. The fund was established in 1912 on behalf of New York's poor. Although the formal, three-month-long campaign for donations has ended, gifts have continued to arrive. These contributions, as well as others expected to arrive in the months ahead, will be credited to the 72d annual appeal. The annual fund drive traditionally begins on the third Sunday before Christmas and continues through the following February. For those wishing to contribute to the fund's 72d annual appeal, checks or money orders should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and sent to the fund at P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087. Donors From All Walks of Life As in the past, the list of contributors to the 71st annual appeal included the wealthy and those on limited incomes, children and the elderly, giant corporations and office workers. Checks came from residents of the New York area and from former residents who wanted to remain loyal to the city they still consider home; from first-time contributors and from those representing a second or third generation of supporters. Gifts expressly designated to help the elderly, the homeless, the hospitalized and the handicapped - those especially vulnerable to poverty or neglect - continued to represent a large proportion of the contributions. But another important factor in the growth of the gifts was a belief held by hundreds of donors that the nation's economic woes made the need for help greater. Many annual contributors increased their gifts for that reason. Willena Todd Sturgis of Ridgefield, Conn., sent $50 and a note that said, ''The need is so great this year, hence my contribution has doubled so fewer might suffer.'' A check for $200 came from Elsa G. Herst of Manhattan, who wrote: ''Enclosed is my annual donation to your worthy cause. I have doubled my last donation due to the present economic situation.'' Frank R. Bingham of White Plains increased his annual donation to $65 in celebration of his 65th birthday. 'Lots of Needy People' ''In these difficult times,'' he wrote, ''there are lots of needy people and I hope all previous donors will increase their gifts to some extent to help those that are suffering due to our present economic conditions.'' From Claudia and Al Arioli of Manhattan came a check for $50 and a note that said, ''We hope this donation can go to someone who has been unemployed because of the recession.'' And Joseph and Estelle Schulman of North Bergen, N.J., sent $100 with the explanation that ''because these times are so hard for so many, we want to do a small bit to help.'' ''Things are so tight this year but not so tight that I can't give a dollar a week,'' W. Peter Strouse of West Redding, Conn., said in note accompanying a check for $52. ''Maybe this will buy someone a decent pair of shoes.'' 'We Had to Do Our Part' Adolph and Charlotte Smyla of Patterson, N.Y., sent a first-time donation of $100, explaining, ''With the terrible conditions today, we just felt we had to do our part.'' Joining the thousands of individuals are family foundations whose gifts annually help swell the Neediest Cases Fund significantly. Among them was the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Foundation of Manhattan, which sent $5,000 with a letter that said, ''In these particularly difficult times we would like to make a special contribution to help those who are less fortunate.'' Seymour M. Klein, president of the Willard T.C. Johnson Foundation, gave $3,000 in behalf of the foundation, with the request that it ''be used toward your meal programs for the poor and homeless, familiarly known as 'soup kitchens,' specifically in the borough of Manhattan.'' 'A Genuine Public Service' Marvin and Donna Schwartz of Manhattan donated $1,000 in behalf of the Dover Fund and wrote, ''The New York Times provides a genuine public service for the needy and underprivileged of our city, and we feel fortunate in being able to help support your fine work.'' The donations made between last Tuesday and the formal opening of the 72d annual appeal later this year will become a start-up fund on which future gifts will build. The start-up fund for the 71st annual drive totaled $569,885.23 when the campaign opened last Nov. 28, compared with the $560,711.41 that kicked off the previous year's campaign. The fund was established in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, in response to reports of hardship and misery among New York City's many destitute families. In that first year, 117 contributors gave a total of $3,603.88. In the decades that have followed, with a steadily growing number of benefactors and contributions to the fund, the yearly appeal has brought comfort to thousands of impoverished or distressed people in the New York metropolitan area who might otherwise be neglected or overlooked.

1271-> TWO FAMILIES TO A TWO-FAMILY HOUSE
To the Editor: I agree with you that three-family landlords are nice, but I think four-families-and-over landlords are nice too. How come three-family landlords are allowed to make whatever profit they can in the free market, while four-family-and-over landlords are rent-controlled? How is it that tenants in multi-family buildings need protection from rent-gouging landlords but three-family tenants can take care of themselves? I suppose The Times would reply that life is unfair.

1272-> Miss McLaughlin To Marry in June
Mr. and Mrs. David T. McLaughlin of Hanover, N.H., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Susan Dean McLaughlin, to Joseph Phillip Jangro Jr., son of Mr. and Mrs. Jangro of Wakefield, Mass. A June 25 wedding is planned.

1273-> Latins to Meet On Debt Crisis
Latin American finance ministers and officials from foreign banks are to meet here Monday to discuss the region's acute financial crisis and the decline in fresh credits from private banks. Debt renegotiations are expected to dominate private talks between more than 1,200 foreign bankers and an estimated 250 government representatives attending the annual governors' meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank. United Nations officials here say net foreign loans to Latin America plunged to $19 billion in 1982, from $48 billion the year before. This reduction has forced eight countries to open talks with private banks on rescheduling their debt payments, they added. The 43 member governments of the development bank agreed last month to increase the bank's lending by about one-third, but that agreement awaits formal ratification by individual nations.

1280-> BRAVES' ROOKIE DOWNS ASTROS
Craig McMurtry yielded only four hits in six innings, and Dale Murphy hit his eighth home run as the Atlanta Braves defeated the Houston Astros, 6-3, tonight. McMurtry (3-1), a rookie right-hander, struck out two and walked one before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the sixth. Three pitchers followed McMurtry, including Steve Bedrosian, who recorded his third save. Murphy, who leads the National League in home runs, also had singles in the fourth and sixth and stole two bases as the Braves recorded their 11th victory in 12 home games. The Astros got a run in the first on Dickie Thon's sacrifice fly. The Braves took the lead in their half of the first when Murphy homered after Rafael Ramirez reached base on an error by Ray Knight at first base. Alan Ashby's sacrifice fly tied the score for the Astros in the second. The Braves regained the lead in the third when Murphy opened with a single and scored on Bob Horner's double. The Braves increased their lead in the sixth after Murphy again led off with a single and again stole second. Murphy took third when Terry Harper forced Horner, who had walked, and scored when Bill Doran committed an error at second base on Bob Watson's grounder. Houston pulled within a run in the eighth on a run-scoring single by Phil Garner, but Glenn Hubbard hit a two-run homer in the eighth.

1281-> SYRIA'S BUILDUP CALLED A TACTIC FOR TALKS
A flow of well-armed Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas into Lebanon and a significant reinforcement of Syrian forces there, both reported this week by United States officials, are intended to strengthen Syria's position in negotiations on the withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon, American intelligence officials believe, These military movements, American and other Western intelligence officials say, were encouraged by the Soviet Union, whose stake in Syria has grown rapidly in the last year as it has given more than $2 billion worth of weapons and aircraft to Syria. The consensus of Western intelligence officials is that Syria, supported by the Soviet Union, will use these reinforcements to demand guarantees as firm as those obtained by Israel before withdrawing a soldier or a gun. The officials said P.L.O. personnel, believed to be drawn from the remains of the regular battalions driven out of Beirut last summer, began to move into Lebanon from Syria last Friday. The first observed detachment was 500 to 600 men armed with infantry weapons up to heavy mortars and moving in trucks. Intelligence sources report that P.L.O. strength in Lebanon has risen in recent weeks to between 12,000 and 15,000. Until three weeks ago P.L.O. strength was estimated at 9,000. Role of Soviet Military Aid The Syrians are better prepared for fighting now than at any other time since last summer. American intelligence sources report that 10,000 Syrian troops have moved into Lebanon in the last two months, raising Syrian troop strength there to just under 50,000 troops or about twice the Israeli strength. Intelligence sources in this country and European NATO countries link the increasingly aggressive Syrian dispositions in Lebanon to Soviet military support that Israeli intelligence says has reached a very high level. One of its most significant aspects, American sources said, is that the Soviet command in Syria is linked closely with general staff headquarters in Moscow and with early warning stations in the Caucasus mountains. The number of Soviet military advisers in Lebanon is said to have been rising steadily. According to Israeli sources, units drawn from a Soviet airborne division guard two SA-5 antiaircraft missile installations, and Syrians cannot approach them without permission from the Soviet military mission headquarters in Damascus. Helping Instruct Syrians In addition to the airborne units, Israeli sources report the presence of about 5,000 Soviet advisers and technicians in the country. One explanation is that their presence is necessary to instruct the Syrians in the use of advanced equipment delivered in the last year, including the MI-24 helicopter and the MIG-23 fighter equipped with a new radar. According to one Israeli report, which could not be confirmed, Soviet crews fly the helicopters, and combat pilots from Soviet-controlled countries pilot the fighters. The Russians have also installed an extensive command, control and communicatios structure throughout Syria that Israeli sources say is operated by Russians. It can communicate directly with Moscow and with three ships of the Mediterranean squadron that are based at Tartus in Syria. There are also reports that the Russians have installed electronic warfare equipment intended to match that deployed by the Israelis in last summer's fighting. Americans say all the Soviet equipment and troops are stationed in Syria. Israeli sources, however, contend that teams of Soviet engineers have been sent to Baalbek and Shtaura to advise the Syrians on strengthening their lines.

1282-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; ARMSTRONG WORLD ELECTS NEXT CHIEF
Armstrong World Industries, which makes flooring and other interior furnishings, said yesterday that its board of directors had named Joseph L. Jones as chairman, chief executive officer and president, effective Aug. 1. Mr. Jones, 60 years old, will succeed Harry A. Jensen, who reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65 at that time. Mr. Jensen, who joined the company in 1940, will remain a board member. He has been chief executive officer since 1978. The company, based in Lancaster, Pa., reported sales of $1.3 billion for last year. Mr. Jones, who joined Armstrong in 1947, is currently executive vice president. ''We are beginning to feel some pickup as housing recovers,'' he said yesterday. ''We are certainly encouraged.'' He said Armstrong's furniture, carpet and resilient flooring operations, which had been hurt by the recession, ''are turning nicely.'' The company, however, is expected to continue to have expenses connected with asbestosrelated litigation. Mr. Jones, a graduate of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, will become the ninth president of Armstrong (formerly known as the Armstrong Cork Company) in its 123-year history. In 1968 he was named a general manager of Armstrong's newly formed carpet operations, and in 1973 he became a senior vice president of the company. He moved to his present post and was also named a director in 1974.

1283-> A RARE APPEARANCE FOR STAN FREBERG
IRREVERENT parody has always been a flourishing subcategory in pop music but never more so than in the 1950's, when the charts were dominated by inane novelties and sappy love songs. The overriding silliness of pop in those days inspired a golden age of pop satire when humorists like Stan Freberg, Spike Jones and the country and western duo Homer and Jethro wickedly spoofed the hits and crazes of the moment. Stan Freberg, the most sophisticated of these pop satirists, did more than parody passing fads. His records, like the two-million selling hit of 1953, ''St. George and the Dragonet'' (a still hilarious sendup of the television series ''Dragnet''), were miniature radio comedies and the true forerunners of the satirical style of ''The National Lampoon'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' This weekend Mr. Freberg will make a rare appearance in the metropolitan area at the Orrie de Nooyer Auditorium, in Hackensack, N.J., where he will be among such stars as Margaret Whiting, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Kay Starr, Nancy Wilson, Ray Anthony, Al Martino, Les Paul, Johnny Johnston, and Keely Smith, who are participating in a marathon salute to Capitol Records. The six-hour show is the second volume of the 40th-anniversary salute to the label, which was started last year by Roger and Deborah Rudnick as part of their ''40's in the 80's'' series. ''I was such a big radio buff when I was growing up that when the other kids ran out to play baseball, I ran inside to listen to the radio,'' Mr. Freberg recalled the other day in a phone conversation from his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. ''My idols were Jack Benny and Fred Allen. By the age of 16 I was working regularly as an actor on radio shows, and at 18 I was the last network actor to impersonate F.D.R. before he died. In those days, when you impersonated a President you had to get written permission from the White House.'' Parodies of Big Names A master of dozens of different voices, the 57-year-old humorist developed a nightclub act in the late 1940's that included such famous routines as ''John and Marsha,'' an extended two-word dialogue between a couple who moan each other's names over and over in different melodramatic inflections. This satire of radio soap opera became Mr. Freberg's first record for Capitol in 1950. Mr. Freberg went on to do memorable parodies of Johnnie Ray, the Platters, Elvis Presley and ''The Yellow Rose of Texas.'' In ''Point of Order,'' he kidded Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. And his Lawrence Welk parody, ''Wunnerful, Wunnerful,'' featured his impersonation of Mr. Welk imploring, ''Turn off the bubble machine,'' as the Welk ballroom floated off into the Pacific Ocean on a torrent of champagne. Fueling these parodies was Mr. Freberg's real disdain for most pop music. ''It's still almost 100 percent junk,'' he said. ''My tastes run to jazz - to Count Basie, Buddy Rich and Marian McPartland.'' Now and then a satirical jab, like Mr. Freberg's ''Green Christmas,'' his attack on the commercializiation of Christmas, have hit too close to home for some people's comfort. This symphonically orchestrated version of ''Jingle Bells,'' punctuated by a jangling cash register, prompted some radio sponsors to refuse to have their commercials used anywhere within half an hour of its being played. In 1956, Mr. Freberg turned his talents to advertising and produced dozens of commercials that remain classics of the comedy soft sell. In his very first ad campaign, for Contadina Tomato Paste, Mr. Freberg created the classic line, ''Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?'' Sales of Contadina soared. For Sunsweet Prunes, Mr. Freberg came up with the tag, ''Today the pits, tomorrow the wrinkles.'' For Heinz's Great American Soups he had Ann Miller and 20 hoofers tap dance atop a giant soup can. And his ad for Jeno's Frozen Pizza featured the original Lone Ranger and Tonto, plus a cast of 52 extras. ''I really went into advertising as a totally outraged consumer,'' Mr. Freberg recalled, ''although my outrage also stemmed from the evangelical attitudes of my father, who was a Baptist minister. Day after day, I sat watching the tube and listening to the radio, and I was stunned by the ineptness. So I started creating the sort of advertising I knew could reach me.'' Radio's Last Comedian In the summer of 1957, Mr. Freberg finally starred in his own short-lived network radio show, replacing Jack Benny on CBS. It was, he says, to be the last network radio comedy show in America. In the early 60's, Mr. Freberg released ''Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America,'' an album that has become a cult classic and a collector's item. The first of a projected series of comedy albums dealing with American history, it was never folllowed up, because David Merrick became interested in turning the concept into a Broadway show. But that project never got off the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Freberg devoted most of his energies to advertising, doing consulting work for General Motors, the Sheraton hotel chain and dozens of other clients. Only in the last five years has Mr. Freberg turned his attention back toward entertainment. ''Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America'' is now a finished screenplay waiting for the right studio. With his closest friend, the author Ray Bradbury, Mr. Freberg is designing an indoor theme park in Baltimore. He's also helping to turn an entrepreneurial guidebook, ''The Un-Harvard Way to Fame and Fortune,'' into a videocassette. And if the funds can be found, he may be host of a live comedy-variety series on radio. If the show comes about, Mr. Freberg will have returned to the medium that is his truest love. This weekend, Mr. Freberg will perform at least half a dozen of his best-known spoofs live with the Les Baxter Orchestra, and his segment will be introduced by clips of some of his most famous commercials. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 8 P.M. and Sunday at noon. Tickets are $37 to $40. The number for reservations is (201) 825-8793 or (201) 327-5253. Tickets are also available through Chargit, 944-9300.

1284-> STAGE: NEGRO ENSEMBLE, 'MANHATTAN MADE ME'
It's a real surprise to go to the Negro Ensemble Company, where plays have not tended to be airy of late, and find a comedy of manners whose characters listen to Rodgers and Hart, sip Scotch before a glittering New York skyline and read Town and Country magazine. But perhaps one should expect the unexpected from the evening's playwright, Gus Edwards, whose last N.E.C. effort, ''Weep Not for Me,'' found wacky comedy in the blighted, impoverished precincts of the South Bronx. ''Manhattan Made Me'' is the title of Mr. Edwards's new play at the Theater Four, and, to an extent, Manhattan is its subject. Its people are strivers who have come to the glossy big city to find success, with varying results. One of them defines New York as a place where ''anything's possible - and probable.'' Another contends that the city ''will bust you apart and leave you a cripple and then offer you tap dancing lessons for free.'' The hero, an unemployed art director named Barry (Eugene Lee), laments that ''the city takes the most incongruous types and forces them together'' - sometimes for better, but usually for worse. Barry in particular knows whereof he speaks. A black Army brat raised in Europe, he is the incongruous adopted pet of a white married couple from Virginia. The husband, a struggling actor, has become Barry's best friend; the wife, an heiress who paints with the Art Students League, is the woman he'd most like to take to bed. Barry spends most days and nights hanging out at the pair's swank apartment, serving as all-purpose confidant and permanent dinner guest. The plot has to do with the inevitable love triangle that develops when the husband flies to Los Angeles to make a television pilot, leaving Barry at home with his wife for three weeks. Mr. Edwards is too witty a writer to play the ensuing soap-opera developments for keeps. As the panting liaison unfolds - complete with guilt, recriminations and a whoppingly inopportune phone call - the dialogue takes on a stylized, fruity air that seems to parody New York-based romantic movie comedies of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson vintage and earlier. Even the lines that deal with the illicit lovers' ''different backgrounds'' are written as blithely ironic repartee. The director, Douglas Turner Ward, follows Mr. Edwards's suit by staging the play in a brittle, deliberately artificial style that makes us feel everyone should be wearing evening clothes. What Mr. Ward has failed to do - in both this play and ''Weep Not for Me,'' which he also directed - is convince the author to pursue his offbeat premises through to the end. Much like its predecessor, ''Manhattan Made Me'' begins to fall apart late in Act I (which has at least three endings) and derails entirely in Act II. It's then that Mr. Edwards starts to pinpoint his other themes, which have to do with the self-destructive male libido and the loss of pride that leads the rootless Barry to become totally confused about his identity (black and otherwise). ''Manhattan Made Me'' is much more trenchant on these matters when dramatizing them with elliptical humor. Though there is a smart gag, reminiscent of Murray Schisgal's ''Luv,'' that brings the play's view of sexual and racial exploitation to sharp fruition at the very end, the prior hour or so is all somberly written and statically staged build-up. Yet even when he loses control of everything else, Mr. Edwards gently satirizes characters of both races convincingly: He has no trouble making white theatergoers laugh at his bemused but not unkindly portraits of his Town and Country couple. The black roles, however, are better acted. Robert Gossett contributes some buoyant turns as a philosophical, jive-talking derelict who knew Barry way-back-when and now pops up to haunt him with a vengeance. Mr. Lee - who has had a bangup season both at the N.E.C. and in the WPA Theater's ''Back to Back'' - is Mr. Edwards's ideal leading man. His likeably enigmatic air and offbeat, deadpan timing reinforce the play's unusual tone and, at the climax, pay off in an unexpected explosion of wild comic anger. If the playwright can only learn to balance his wry intelligence and tigerish passions as dextrously as this young actor does, he'll make it in Manhattan yet.

1287-> THE DAY LILY MEETS A GARDENER'S NEEDS
Gardeners are always looking for the perfect plant. It should require little care, bloom with spectacular flowers, grow just about anywhere and last for years and years. The day lily comes close to all those attributes. The name describes the flowering habit. Although blossoms last but a day, this should not be considered a negative quality. Buds form on a long stem called a scape, which may bear from 15 to 75. As one flower fades, another opens the next morning. The day lily, of the genus Hemerocallis (hemera means day in Greek and kallos means beauty), has the typical funnel or trumpet form of the lily family. However, it is not grown from a bulb but is a herbaceous perennial with strong, fibrous roots and grassy foliage. The leaves die down in winter and new shoots come up in spring. With a judicious choice of varieties, bloom can extend from late May through September. For most gardeners the peak day lily season is July and August, a welcome time for flowers, when many other border perennials have ceased to bloom. The colors span most of the spectrum, from palest yellow to peach, orange, red and almost maroon-black; only blue is missing. Lynne Rosenthal, who has been growing day lilies for about five years in her Fairfield County, Conn., garden, has described them as masters of illusion. ''Their needs are minimal,'' she explained. ''Although the plants do best in full light, day lilies flower well in moderate shade. They can be planted anytime.'' ''Day lilies adapt to so many landscape uses,'' she continued. ''They can be planted in difficult areas -slopes, along roadways or narrow places by a fence. Wherever you want color emphasis, they can fill the gap.'' An organic gardener, Mrs. Rosenthal believes improvement of the soil is the most important part of her work. She does not feed her plants excessively on the ground that they will come to need feeding. For those who do like to apply fertilizer, she suggests either a complete fertilizer, 10-10-10, which English gardeners like, or the more readily available 5-10-5. Although the point does not seem important in light of record rainfall this spring, day lilies are virtually drought-proof because their roots form a spindle shape at the tip that stores water and food. ''I never water my plants and they come through dry summers very well,'' Mrs. Rosenthal said, adding that insects and disease were not much of a problem either. As for fragrance, day lilies, except the old-fashioned Hemerocallis flava, or lemon lily, which has almost disappeared from the stores, have none. Most modern hybrids are from a native orange-tawny species, H. fulva. So many day lily varieties are available that beginners can refer to the American Hemerocallis Society popularity poll, which is published each year and listed in the catalogue ($2) of Gilbert H. Wild & Son, Sarcoxie, Mo. 64862. Other sources are Stanley Saxton, 1 First Street, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 12866; White Flower Farm, Litchfield, Conn. 06759 (spring-fall catalogue subscription, $5).

1288-> SCOUTING; Iowa Connection
After Bernie Wyatt scored 170 points as a tailback for the Amityville (L.I.) High School football team in 1956, he was recruited to the University of Iowa by an assistant coach for the Hawkeyes, Whitey Piro, another native Long Islander. Wyatt went on, after a switch to defensive back, to be a fine player for Iowa, voted its most valuable player in 1961. After 10 years as a high school coach in Iowa City and Lindenhurst, L.I., he returned to Iowa as an assistant coach in 1974. Since then, the Hawkeyes have not lacked in quality players from New York and New Jersey, thanks mostly to Wyatt. When Iowa plays Ohio State tomorrow, seven players from New York and New Jersey are expected to start for the Hawkeyes, who are ranked sixth in the nation by United Press International and seventh by The Associated Press. They are among 18 players from the New York metropolitan area that Wyatt has lured recently to Iowa. ''The connection keeps flowing,'' Wyatt said yesterday. ''The population in New York and New Jersey is so huge that there have to be a lot of good players there. And we realize that 90 percent of the players there want to leave the metropolitan environment when they go to college. ''A lot of scouts and coaches are wary about going into that area to recruit kids. But recruiting is based on who you know and I have contacts with many men in the New York area who played football at Iowa who keep me posted on the best players. ''Most kids are totally surprised when they get to Iowa City. They think of Iowa as nothing but farmers and cows. Most of them are surprised that Iowa City has an attractive environment. They are usually charmed by the campus and town. ''I've lived here for 10 years with my wife and two children - except for the times in the winter when I go to New York to do my recruiting.''

1289-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Tomorrow, the Decision
In the morning, two men in crewneck sweaters were leaning against a marine art store only a block from where the America's Cup yachts are docked. ''Are you going to watch the cup race?'' one asked. ''No,'' the other said. ''I really don't care.'' Until now, millions of Americans probably didn't care either. But tomorrow that casual Newport citizen will care, and so will many Americans who think a tack is something you hammer into wood. Tomorrow, out on Rhode Island Sound, the America's Cup will go to the winner of a decisive seventh race between Liberty, suddenly the embarrassed defender, and Australia II, the controversial challenger, which won yesterday's sixth race by 3 minutes 25 seconds. In yachting, that time is comparable to Nebraska's 84-13 rout of Minnesota last week. What has evolved here is similar to the seventh game of the World Series or to a Super Bowl showdown. One game, one race - to the winner belongs the silver cup. Until now the America's Cup competition was always too one-sided and too snobbish to enter America's psyche. But if it's coming down to a seventh game, so to speak, it must be competitive. And if it's known as the America's Cup, it must be significant. By any other name, the cup would be just as important to yachting people, but it wouldn't be so important now to any American who ever rowed a boat, much less sailed one. In a real sense, tomorrow's race surpasses the tension of decisive seventh games for the World Series, the National Basketball Association championship or the Stanley Cup. For the first time since the schooner America won the America's Cup trophy in a race off the Isle of Wight in 1851, the cup final has melted into one race that will either prolong or end a 132-year winning streak. No team in American sports has ever had to maintain that much of a winning streak. Perhaps nobody in sports history has ever had the burden that will be a silent passenger tomorrow on the red boat with ''Liberty'' painted in silver on its hull. ''It's going to be very exciting to be involved in the race of the century,'' said Dennis Conner, Liberty's skipper. ''But we have a great tradition going for us, and a courageous crew, and somehow I think we'll pull it out on Saturday.'' Great tradition, certainly. Courageous crew, no doubt. But not the faster boat. Australia II, with its mysterious winged keel, is obviously the faster boat, as had been feared by the Liberty crew. ''And the small adjustments we've made this week,'' said Alan Bond, the chairman of the Australian syndicate, ''have allowed us to improve each day.'' Before the finals, Ladbrokes, the English bookmakers, had listed Australia II as an 8-to- 11 favorite. Even Dennis Conner had acknowledged that Australia II was the ''faster boat,'' meaning that Liberty would have to win with faster thinking. But early in yesterday's race, Dennis Conner's tactics provoked as much second-guessing as Billy Martin has created lately. ''Yes, we made mistakes,'' Dennis Conner acknowledged, ''but relative to the potential of our yachts, we've done a good job.'' ''Relative to the potential'' - that's a phrase used by losing skippers in any sport to ease the pain. But the cruel truth looms: Unless Liberty is sailed much faster than she was yesterday, outclassed in a race without any mechanical problems for either boat, the America's Cup appears to be on its way to Australia. Not right away, of course. Not until the New York Yacht Club unscrews the cup from its mooring on a thick wooden table inside the club itself in midtown Manhattan, a yacht club with a sidewalk, not a dock. In other sports, the championship cup is always at hand on the day of decision, to be presented to the winner, to be used as a chalice for champagne. But not only is the America's Cup not here, it wouldn't even be possible to present it to the Australians until it was removed from its trophy table in the New York Yacht Club, at 37 West 44th Street, an 82-year- old building with three bay windows above the sidewalk. Down a blue-carpeted stairway and surrounded by red-velvet upholstered wooden love seats and armchairs, the America's Cup glistens atop red velvet inside a four-foot-high glass case perched on a wooden octagonal table. High on the beige walls with mauve paneling, two church-type windows create the atmosphere of a shrine. The America's Cup is 27 inches tall and has the names of the early winners engraved on it; on a relatively new seven-inch base are the names of the winning yachts since 1958, the start of the 12-Meter era. Barely visible at the top of the trophy, a 40-inch bolt descends inside the cup into the wooden table, anchoring it there as if the New York Yacht Club considered it to be on permanent display. But now, for the first time, the cup is in seventh-race jeopardy. ''If we win the cup,'' Alan Bond has joked, ''we'll run over it with a steamroller and turn it into the America's Plate.'' If the Australians win, of course, the cup will probably be put on display at the Royal Perth Yacht Club on Pelican Point, Crawley Bay, with slips for nearly 300 yachts. Perth, in western Australia, would be the site of Australia's defense of the cup. Yesterday, as Australia II sailed away from Liberty in rolling seas, Ben Lexcen, the designer of the challenger from Down Under, stood alone in a green sweater on the bow of Black Swan, a 50-foot cruiser. His arms crossed, Ben Lexcen had the look of a conquering admiral. Not far away, on the Fox Hunter, a 75-foot motor yacht, the nine members of the New York Yacht Club's America's Cup Committee at first stood on the bridge in their blue blazers, peering through binoculars. But after Liberty had quickly fallen far behind, they disappeared into the main salon for their buffet lunch and remained there. On a nearby boat, an onlooker smiled. ''Have you heard about the New York Yacht Club's new rule change?'' he said. ''You've got to win by two races.''

1291-> AT THE MOVIES; Three women and their road to directing
FOUR years ago, the American-born Joyce Bunuel wrote and directed her first movie, ''Dirty Dishes,'' in Paris. Last week, it opened in New York at the Carnegie Hall Cinema. Mrs. Bunuel says it's hard for her to think about it now, because she was a different person when she made the picture. ''But it's honest,'' she says. ''And it mirrored the confusion of a lot of women I knew. We couldn't win. Staying home was a drag. Going to work was hard. Being married was a pain. Not being married was lonely. If you had kids, you had headaches. If you didn't have kids, you felt you weren't a woman. For women in 1977 and 1978, she observed, all the old certainties seemed gone. ''Even love making was up for questions,'' she said. ''Everybody thought they should have six orgasms a day and went looking for them so madly they were exhausted.'' Mrs. Bunuel was a student at City College when she met John Bunuel, son of the famous Spanish director, Luis Bunuel. ''I went to a neighbor's loft,'' she says, ''and there was John in his shorts, painting a wall. When we got married, I didn't know who Luis Bunuel was. In 1964, I wasn't interested in cinema. I was a political-science major. But I fell in love with this house painter who was, in fact, an assistant movie director, and I left New York and never came back. I traveled around with him and the movie crowd for years, living between Mexico City and Paris and Madrid. It was marvelous; it took me eight or nine years to get itchy.'' Mrs. Bunuel never intended to make a movie - ''I didn't even want to do it when I did it'' - but she'd been translating screenplays from French into English, because she was always around people who were writing for the screen and because writing was something she could do at home, while tending two small children. She wrote the script for ''Dirty Dishes,'' presented it to the jury of the Centre Nationale de Cinema and was awarded ''a bundle'' of money. Which brought her up against a moment of truth. ''You can't just pocket the money and go home,'' she says. ''In France, the money is given to aid production. So I found myself directing the film.'' When ''Dirty Dishes'' came out in Paris, it got wonderful press, but, says Mrs. Bunuel, who has since been divorced from John Bunuel, ''That film was not appreciated by everybody in the family.'' What about the public, then? Well, women were angry, because the heroine compromised at the end, by going home with her husband. ''When she goes back up to her little apartment from the parking lot, there's an arrow over the ramp that says 'No Exit,' '' Mrs. Bunuel says, laughing. ''I guess that's how I was feeling at that time. You don't start your life over at 30. This woman had no training to become anything, and she had two kids, and I don't think it's easy to say, 'I'm shedding all this, and going on to great new heights.' ''I think before you can feel free, you have to figure out, how can I scramble eggs and write a film at the same time? But I think what's happening now is that everybody's figured out how to scramble eggs, make films, take care of kids, go on television, fill out the tax forms, pay the bills. Women can do everything now, but they're so tired. It's 'God, am I liberated, and God, am I tired.' ''The comedy of it now is that the burden isn't less, it's doubled. ''But enough with women. They had their day. I don't care if they wear black garter belts, or what they do. There are a lot of men I would like to console. I don't feel sorry for myself anymore, so I've got beyond that place where the woman in the film was. But I'm always ready for a fight.'' True Story of an Actress And Her Husband Josefina Molina, whose ''Evening Performance'' was seen in this year's ''New Directors/ New Films'' series and is soon expected to be shown commercially, is the first woman ever to be graduated from the Escuela Oficial de Cinematografia. (Many women had entered before her, but no other had left with the Escuela's seal of approval.) In fact, it took Miss Molina six years before she emerged, in 1959, with her diploma. Whether you're male or female, those teachers make you repeat the courses until you get them right. Miss Molina, who speaks no English, recently visited New York, and communicated through an interpreter. She said seven years had passed between her first feature film and ''Evening Performance,'' and that she had been directing plays for television and theater between times. The star of ''Evening Performance'' is an actress named Lola Herrera, upon whose midlife crisis Miss Molina and Jose Samano based their script. Miss Herrera plays opposite her own former husband, Daniel Dicenta, and in one long scene in a backstage dressing room, the couple improvised their dialogue. ''Lola and Daniel were getting together for the first time in a long time,'' Miss Molina says. ''The official annulment of their marriage was coming up. They had no idea what they were going to say. ''We had eight video cameras hidden in the room, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Later, Lola and Daniel were also totally surprised by what they had revealed. ''All that about her never having had an orgasm all the years they were married, that was a complete surprise. Their hypocrisy, their inability to communicate, had caused almost all their problems, and now Lola was saying she had never really reacted to him at all. It showed that, if they could have talked honestly, they might have - ah, but they were brought up in another age, in another political situation. ''The most telling moment is when she is talking about their wedding night, and he looks at his watch.'' Breaking Through With 'Valley Girl' Martha Coolidge, whose ''Valley Girl'' is playing all over town, made her picture not in France or Spain but in the San Fernando Valley. Having been considered a serious sort - she made documentaries, and her first feature, ''Not a Pretty Picture,'' was an autobiographical story of rape - she was stunned to be offered the job of directing ''Valley Girl.'' ''What's great,'' she says, ''is that it's broken a barrier for me. ''It's overtly commercial, and now instead of being offered 'women's material,' I'm being offered comedies. My next picture is going to be 'National Lampoon's the Joy of Sex' for Paramount.'' Miss Coolidge always knew that she was meant to be a director. She worked on commercials in New York, she worked on television series in Canada, she worked on documentaries including one called ''Old-Fashioned Woman,'' a portrait of her grandmother. ''She loved it,'' Miss Coolidge says. ''She was an interesting Yankee lady. She'd say, 'My granddaughter's a film maker, and she's practicing on me.' '' Eventually, Miss Cooldidge went West, got an agent and a development deal at Zoetrope to do a rock-and-roll love story called ''Photoplay.'' When Francis Coppola's dream collapsed, Miss Coolidge's was one of the hearts that broke. ''It was terrible,'' she says, ''because the promises had been so serious. At Zoetrope, they said: 'We're not like the rest of the industry. We don't cancel projects.' I was there two years. Then 'Photoplay' was canceled.'' For ''Valley Girl,'' Miss Coolidge says, ''I sent my whole cast to high school in the Valley. We hung around and met people. I don't like movies that are snooty toward their subjects, so we tried to get to the source.'' These days, Miss Coolidge lives in Hollywood. ''It's a good place to work,'' she says. ''As my agent said, 'Don't add to the problem of being a woman director that you live in New York.' ''

1292-> AROUND THE NATION; Miss Hearst's Kidnapper Is Freed on Parole
William Harris, who pleaded guilty in 1978 to the kidnapping in 1974 of Patricia Hearst, has been paroled from prison and is working as a legal aide, his lawyer says. Mr. Harris was released on April 26 from the California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo and is living in Alameda County, according to the lawyer, Stuart Hanlon. He declined to say in which city Mr. Harris was living. Mr. Harris's wife, Emily, who also pleaded guilty to the kidnapping, is scheduled to be released May 27 from the California Institution for Women at Frontera, Mr. Hanlon said. The Harrises pleaded guilty to kidnapping Miss Hearst, now Patricial Hearst Shaw, on Feb. 4, 1974, and were sentenced to from 10 years and eight months to life.Under state law, prisoners can be released after serving two-thirds of the minimum sentence.

1293-> Soviet Aide in Ottawa Says Tapes Could Be 2 Years Old
A Soviet Embassy official said today that tapes played by President Reagan on Monday and offered as proof that a Soviet fighter shot down a South Korean airliner could have been made two years ago. The official, Yevgeny Pozdnyakov, a counselor at the embassy, said in a television interview: ''Tapes of this kind are not accepted in court as evidence. How do you know when this tape was recorded? Maybe two years ago, maybe it was just a drill.'' He told Canadian Television News, ''Maybe it was a recording of exercises of the planes and doesn't belong to this action at all.'' Mr. Pozdnyakov said that considering the South Korean airliner ''deviated from the route to fly over Soviet defense areas while another plane, a spy plane, was in the area, it looks as if the plane was used as a sitting duck, or should I say a flying duck.''

1295-> SEARCH GOES ON FOR JET'SBLACK BOX
The commander of United States search operations in the Sea of Japan said today that Navy ships had ''some reasonable prospect'' of finding the vital recording instruments of the South Korean passenger plane shot down by Soviet fighters three weeks ago. But the commander, Rear Adm. William A. Cockell, avoided any prediction that the airliner's ''black box'' could in fact be found. Thus far, he said, his task force has ''not located or picked up any remains from the plane,'' and Soviet ships working the same waters have not been seen ''removing objects from the ocean bottom.'' However, the admiral added, ''I would not preclude the possibility.'' American search vessels reported Monday that they had twice heard, then lost, signals of the type emitted by ''pinger'' equipment attached to recording instruments to make it easier for searchers to find them. These instruments - there actually are two ''black boxes,'' one containing flight data, the other cockpit voice transmission - might provide important information about the final moments of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. One key question is why the plane, carrying 269 people, had been over Soviet territory for quite some time before being shot down near Sakhalin Island. Needle in a Haystack Admiral Cockell, who has set up a temporary headquarters aboard this guided missile cruiser, declined repeatedly to discuss specifically where the ''pinging'' had been detected, exactly how many times and whether the signals were still being picked up. A senior Navy officer, however, said privately, ''It could be,'' when asked whether the pinging continued. The hunt for the black boxes seemed to qualify for needle-in-the-haystack comparisons. The search area forming the focus of both American and Soviet interest lies in international waters just west of Sakhalin and 16 miles north of tiny Moneron Island - a total of 350 square miles of water surface. That is an area 15 percent bigger than all of New York City, and the objects being sought are each said to measure 15 inches by 9 inches by 5 inches, although they could still be attached to larger pieces of the plane's tail. Reporters allowed to tour the search area today in Navy helicopters could see at least three American ships and three or four Soviet vessels, all within a mile of one another. At one point, a Soviet patrol boat crossed in front of the United States frigate Badger, albeit from a safe distance. Complaints of Harassment The Americans have complained of ''harassment'' from the Soviet ships, which Admiral Cockell said involved ''moving close to our own ships, requiring them to back out or maneuver to avoid collision.'' This ''peaked a couple of days ago,'' he said, but he did not say whether it remained a problem. He knew of no similar Soviet complaints about American behavior, he said. At an hourlong news conference in a lounge area of the Sterett, Admiral Cockell declined several times to describe the operation as a ''race.'' But it appeared to be just that, not only against the Soviet task force but against time. The water-activated batteries of the ''pingers'' are not guaranteed to last more than 30 days, and the admiral acknowledged that ''the sooner one can commence the search, the greater the probability of success is.'' The American hunt did not begin until Sept. 15, two full weeks after the Korean plane was shot down. Asked why such time had been allowed to elapse, Admiral Cockell replied, ''I am not going to comment other than to note that preparation time was needed.'' Among other things, he said, the task force had to be assembled of seven vessels drawn from home ports in California and the Philippines. Besides the Sterett and the Badger, they are the salvage ship Conserver, the oceangoing tug Narragansett, the Coast Guard cutter Munro, the guided missile destroyer Callaghan and the supply ship Wichita. The equipment used includes sonar, ''towed locaters'' to detect pinging sounds and a ''deep drone device'' that can take photographs of any material that may be found. Soviet Operation Is Larger The Soviet operation is far larger and, according to Admiral Cockell, has included nearly 40 vessels at a time, ranging from large rescue ships and missile cruisers to relatively small fishing boats. The total now is down to 16 or 17, the admiral said, and Japanese patrols in the area have reported spotting a small submarine and other underwater equipment. As described by Admiral Cockell, the Soviet and American procedures are totally dissimilar, partly because ''they have different assets down here than we do.'' The Russians have relied on ''a large number of ships and some sort of organized formation over a rather wide expanse of ocean,'' including underwater trawling by the fishing boats, he said. The Americans have tried a more pinpoint approach, selecting ''those areas that might have the most promise in containing some remnants or debris of the aircraft.'' Soviet officials have reported collecting debris and said Wednesday that they would turn over unspecified ''items and documents'' next Monday to the Japanese. The transfer is to take place in the Port of Nevelsk on Soviet- controlled Sakhalin Island.

1296-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Problems for Cowboys
Ticket sales to Dallas Cowboy home games have been lagging, and, according to the team's president, Tex Schramm , it's all because of fan disenchantment resulting from last season's strike and a series of off-season published reports linking Dallas players to drug use. ''The strike and the drugs turned a lot of people off,'' said Schramm, who still has 5,000 tickets available for the home opener against the Giants on Sunday. . . . Meanwhile, on the field, the Cowboy coach, Tom Landry , has some special worries of his own this week - the disappointing play of the Cowboy special teams. ''We've got to concentrate on our kicking game - sometimes it gets lost in the shuffle,'' said Landry, who has hit on a way to assure that the units get the attention they deserve. He has taken personal charge of the kicking teams as they prepare for the Giants.

1297-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; VIOLENCE AND BOXING
He says he could tell as soon as he climbed into the boxing ring that ''another of those things'' was about to happen. The man stretched out below him was going into spasmodic contractions, and his right pupil was bigger than his left. ''That indicated brain hemorrhage to me,'' said Dr. Bernhardt Schwartz. ''You're never called into the ring until after it happens.'' The man was Francisco (Kiko) Bejines, and he died on Sunday, three days after having been felled at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles during a bantamweight title match with Alberto Davila. Bejines was the fourth boxer in 43 years to die of injuries in matches supervised by Dr. Schwartz. ''I've seen a million fights,'' Dr. Schwartz said in a telephone interview. ''You figure it out. Forty-three years, working 4 to 7 nights a week, maybe 8 fights on a pro card, 20 on an amateur card. I used to fight, too. I was a lightweight. Been following fights since I was 9.'' He is 70 now, a throat specialist by training, a general practitioner in Watts for the last 35 years and a doctor who has seen 15 fighters carried to the hospital unconscious. Four of them died: Bejines, Johnny Owen in 1980, Alejandro Lavorante in 1964, a year and a half after his last fight, and Davey Moore in 1963. The doctor has heard all the criticisms by now. A journalist who made it clear that he was a critic of boxing asked Monday whether a healer should lend his skills to it. ''You read all the time that they want to ban boxing,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''I think there's been 314 deaths in boxing since 1964, 3 last year. But if they want to ban boxing, they'd better ban mountain climbing, horse racing, football, too. There's more deaths from them.'' The caller said that boxing is the only sport in which two people stand toe-to-toe and slug each other. ''You're talking about man-to-man combat,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''Football is mayhem, too. ''Look at the way that guy from Oakland tackled Darryl Stingley; the kid's paralyzed for the rest of his life,'' he added, referring to the tackle by Jack Tatum that led to the paralysis of the New England receiver. ''Look at the knees in football,'' Dr. Schwartz continued. ''If you're going to pick on sports, pick on all of them. Look at auto racing. Those people go to the races to see people killed, not to see cars go around in circles for 500 miles.'' Not all doctors would agree with Dr. Schwartz. Boxing has come under strong attack in the last year, after the death of Duk Koo Kim in Las Vegas, Nev., and several subsequent brutal major fights. Several prominent doctors and medical groups have called for an end to boxing because of its inherent potential for brain damage. ''I attend lectures at Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood every day,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''There are usually 75 to 100 doctors there. Most ask me questions about the fights. Most guys like the fights.'' Some people believe that violence begets violence, that the sanctioned violence of boxing contributes to more widespread violence. Dr. Schwartz said: ''There will always be fights as long as there are wars, and you can just look around and see there are still wars.'' Some people believe boxing should be banned, prosecuted and treated with the moral distance it deserves. Dr. Schwartz said: ''If you banned boxing, there'd still be boxing on barges and in garages. There'd be no way to get medical help to them then.'' The doctor has no proposals to reform boxing. He said that the new thumbless gloves ''will only break thumbs,'' and added that head guards, used in amateur boxing, ''only protect them from cauliflower ears.'' As a human licensed to heal other humans, Dr. Schwartz is not blind to the dangers of boxing. ''The brain is encased within the hardest bone,'' he said, ''and it's supposed to float. Every time you take one on the chin, you can rupture a blood vessel of the brain. ''Usually it takes 10 seconds to recover from a hard punch. That's why you have a standing 8-count, to give you time to recover. But every time you get hit on the jaw, you can get a small hemorrhage. You get enough of these, you damage the brain tissue and you get the traumatic condition we call 'punch drunk.' '' Dr. Schwartz says his function at ringside is to tell when a fighter has had enough. He says that he looks for signs that a fighter's eyes and limbs are not functioning properly, and that ''in the last three years the State of California has been much tougher about this.'' The enforcement has been more strict since the bantamweight fight three years ago - in the same building where Kiko Bejines fell - when Johnny Owen of Wales was knocked unconscious in the same round, the 12th, by Lupe Pintor. Owen died 45 days later. ''Exact same thing,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''He went down in the 12th round. I thought about Johnny Owen the other night. There was no warning. Davila is not known to be a knockout puncher. He's a technician, not a punisher. Slip, slide, block, feint, parry. ''When they were introduced, I saw the definition of Bejines's abdomen. It looked like a washboard. He seemed stronger than Davila. From where I sat, Bejines looked tired in the ninth round. He had no zip, he was just punching. But he won the next two rounds, according to some people. If he hadn't gone through this sad thing, he might be champion.'' In fact, Bejines was leading on the cards of two of the three judges when he went down, and the fight crowd in Los Angeles says there were no warnings, no cries for intervention, before the final blow. Bejines was not some mystery fighter imported from the Orient like Duk Koo Kim in Las Vegas a year ago. He was a well-known quantity from Guadalajara, and the record of his brain scans was in good order, at least according to Jose Sulaiman, the head of the World Boxing Council, whose bantamweight title was at stake in the Davila-Bejines match. ''Nobody could have prevented this,'' said Dr. Schwartz. ''This was a well-conditioned boxer. His head was going forward, and the punch was coming at him. There were no signs. I try to keep an eye out for danger. Usually I do a good job.'' Asked what he had been doing since the fight, Dr. Schwartz said, ''Mourning the death of Kiko Bejines.'' And he added, ''I'll be at ringside whenever and wherever the next fight is.'' Undoubtedly, Dr. Schwartz and most other ring physicians do the best they can once they get into the ring. But sometimes it is too late, as it was for Alejandro Lavorante, for Johnny Owen, for Kiko Bejines, for Davey Moore. After the Moore fight in 1963, Bob Dylan wrote a song entitled ''Who Killed Davey Moore?'' The verdict was that everybody killed Davey Moore, all of a society, including journalists, that encourages men to pound each other in the head for money. ''I've heard of the song,'' Dr. Schwartz said.

1298-> PLANNED PARENTHOOD DELETED FROM FEDERAL CHARITY DRIVE
The Federal Office of Personnel Management today ousted Planned Parenthood from its annual Federal employee charity drive, handing anti-abortion groups a major victory. Donald Devine, the office's director, made the ruling after 10 days of hearings, after a Federal judge ordered him to hasten his decision. Mr. Devine said that Planned Parenthood did not meet financial guidelines for the drive. Planned Parenthood, which may fight the ruling in Federal court, had been a member of the Combined Federal Campaign for 14 years. The campaign is the Government's version of the United Way; it allows Federal workers to contribute to some 150 charities through one payroll deduction. Fraction of Group's Budget Last year, Planned Parenthood received about $500,000 from the campaign. The group has a $170 million budget. Dr. Richard Glasow, director of the education fund for the antiabortion National Right to Life Committee, praised the decision as an important step in challenging all Planned Parenthood fund-raising. Mr. Devine's decision essentially upheld a ruling by the campaign eligibility committee, which ruled two weeks ago that Planned Parenthood did not meet financial guidelines. Eligibility Standards Cited At the eligibility hearings, Right to Life asserted that Planned Parenthood received more than 50 percent of its funds from the Government and less than 20 percent from the public. Both were standards that could disallow participation in the employee campaign. Mr. Devine took the eligibility committee decision under advisement and held three more days of hearings on Planned Parenthood's application, but did not make a decision. ''This is an extremely important decision,'' said Mr. Glasow of Right to Life. ''It shows Planned Parenthood does not live up to regulations. ''It shows there are serious questions about their entire operation and that it represents to the Government things that are not true. This will cloud all of their financial fund-raising across the country.'' Motivation Is Assailed WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 (AP) - Planned Parenthood today asserted that its removal from a Federal employee charity drive was motivated by hostility to its activities in regard to abortion. Faye Wattleton, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that Mr. Devine of the Federal employee charity office had based his decision not to list Planned Parenthood on his publicly stated opposition to abortion. ''Mr. Devine has made no secret of his hostility to the activities of Planned Parenthood,'' she said. ''It is this hostility and not any of the various so- called technical issues that are at the root of his decision.''

1299-> SCOUTING; Back on the Farm
For a man who had just been released from a major league ball club at age 43, Woodie Fryman sounded remarkably cheerful yesterday from his home in Ewing, Ky. ''I'm always happy to be home,'' said the left-handed pitcher who won 141 games and lost 155 in an 18-year career with 6 teams. But his last season with the Montreal Expos was almost a waste. He won no games, lost 3 and had an earned-run average of 21.00 for only 3 innings of work. ''I hurt my arm in spring training,'' he said. ''Then, after a long rest, I reinjured it in July. I decided toward the end of the season that I'd call it a career. ''I figure I got eight extra years on my career. Specialists in 1975 told me that arthritis could prevent me from pitching anymore. But I fooled them. A pitcher who lasts a long time - like Gaylord Perry or me - has to be mentally strong. You've got to be able to accept the pain and pitch anyway and get batters out. ''I'm proud that I never said 'no' to a manager when he told me to pitch. I never turned down the ball when it was handed to me. I did my job.'' Fryman said he was content for the moment to work his 560-acre tobacco farm with his sons, Jeff, 20, and Pat, 17. ''They play baseball, but only for fun,'' Fryman said. ''I tell them that working on a farm can be just as good as pitching in the major leagues - but it doesn't pay as well. ''Playing in the majors, I put enough away to get ready for this day. I'll just stay on the farm for now and maybe go down to Florida during spring training and say hello to all my old friends.''

1300-> QUESTIONS ARE RAISED ABOUT NEW EVIDENCE IN VON BULOW CASE
On the evening of Aug. 16, policemen patrolling just north of Boston came upon a scene that continues to puzzle them, one that is now raising questions about some of the new evidence offered in the case of Claus von B"ulow, who was convicted last year of trying to murder his wealthy wife. A young man lay on the ground beside a new Cadillac. The driver's window was smashed, but the man was not cut or showered with glass, and there were no swerve marks on the road. The driver said he was David J. Marriott, 25 years old, of Wakefield, Mass. He said that he was a new witness in the von B"ulow case and that he had been receiving threats of death if he did not keep quiet, a Metropolitan District Police spokesman reported. Mr. Marriott also told the officers that he had been run off the road by a car, from which a man in a mask had thrown a stone through his window. The Cadillac, Mr. Marriott said, had been lent to him by a Rhode Island priest, the Rev. Philip Magaldi, who had been telephoned at his Boston hotel with a threat against Mr. Marriott the night before. The oddity about that, as the police say Father Magaldi subsequently told the District Attorney's office in Cambridge, was that Mr. Marriott was the only person who knew the priest was registered at the hotel. New Trial Is Asked Now, two months later, Mr. Marriott and Father Magaldi have become a prominent new part of the von B"ulow case. Last year, in a trial in Newport, R.I., Mr. von B"ulow was convicted of twice trying to murder his heiress wife, Martha von B"ulow, by injecting her with insulin. Mr. von B"ulow, who is free on bail, then hired Prof. Alan Dershowitz of the Harvard Law School to handle his appeal. This month, just two weeks before the arguments on the appeal of the convictions were to be heard before the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Mr. Dershowitz filed a separate motion for a new trial. In his brief, he said he had ''discovered dramatic new evidence that demonstrates the invalidity of every key aspect of the state's case and establishes defendant's innocence.'' Attached to the motion were affadavits from 24 people offered as new witnesses. They included acquaintances of Mrs. von B"ulow such as Truman Capote and the socialite Sheila deRochambeau, who talked about Mrs. von B"ulow's drinking habits and use of drugs. They also included medical experts and former servants. But the first and most dramatic affadavits were Father Magaldi's and Mr. Marriott's. Mrs. von B"ulow lapsed into coma at her Newport mansion in December 1979 and again in December 1980. She has never regained conciousness. The jury found Mr. von B"ulow guilty of causing the two episodes by injecting his wife with insulin through a used hypodermic needle found in a black bag in his closet in the mansion. Says He Delivered Drugs But in his statement, Mr. Marriott says that ''at least half a dozen times'' in the summers of 1978 and 1979 in Newport, he was given packages containing hypodermic needles, bags of white powder, vials of demerol and pills to deliver to Alexander von Auersperg, Mrs. von B"ulow's son by her first marriage. The packages were from a mutual friend of his and Mr. von Auersperg's, Mr. Marriott swore, and sometimes he delivered them to Mr. von Auersperg at the mansion. Once, he stated, he untied the package, discovered the contents, became frightened and retied the package. When he rang the back doorbell, ''a woman came out, and said that Alex had expected me and took the package, which I had tied up again; the woman introduced herself as Alex's mother.'' In his sworn statement, Father Magaldi said that he had been counseling Mr. Marriott for some years and that Mr. Marriott had told him all of this in the summer of 1978, ''three years before the names of Auersperg and von B"ulow were in the media.'' ''It was I who read about the von B"ulow case in the papers and then pleaded with him to come forward,'' the priest said. These statements, Mr. Dershowitz said, raised the spectre ''that Alex sought to 'frame' his stepfather.'' He also spoke of new medical laboratory evidence that ''the 'murder weapon' supposedly found by Alex in the black bag could not have been injected into Martha von B"ulow, that instead it was 'dipped into solution' and that it may not have contained insulin at all.'' New Story Is Derided Mr. Dershowitz's offensive has raised hackles on the other side. Family friends and observers deride the notion that Mrs. von B"ulow, in a houseful of servants, ever answered her own door or that she would speak to a stanger on her back lawn at night. And Richard Kuh, the former Manhattan district attorney who represents Mrs. von B"ulow's family, reacted in outrage to the suggestion that his client, Mr. von Auersperg, might have tried to use his mother's coma to frame his stepfather. Mr. Kuh called Mr. Marriott ''a damned kook,'' and questioned Mr. Dershowitz's professional conduct in relying on him. Mr. Dershowitz, speaking on a Boston radio talk show recently, replied by questioning Mr. Kuh's performance as assistant Manhattan District Attorney in the 1960's, when he won a conviction of the nightclub comedian Lenny Bruce for obscene performances. It now falls to the Rhode Island courts to decide whether the new statements constitute new evidence and whether they merit a hearing and perhaps a new trial. Contest of the Experts' The issue of Mrs. von B"ulow's drinking and her use of drugs was the subject of testimony at the trial. They are raised again ''strictly for sensation,'' Attorney General Dennis J. Roberts II of Rhode Island said today. The medical interpretations of what brought on her coma, he said, ''will be a kind of contest of the experts.'' As for Mr. Marriott, ''a review of who he is and where he's coming from'' by the authorities, Mr. Roberts said, ''leads me to believer that a lot of what he has to say has been contrived by Mr. Marriott and by Claus von B"ulow, to whom he has a very close social and economic tie.'' Speaking of him as ''a mostly unemployed printer's assistant who apparently travels a great deal in limousines,'' Mr. Roberts said: ''Mr. Marriott apparently lives a substantial amount of the time with Mr. von B"ulow. Mr von B"ulow's chauffer apparently drives him around.''

1301-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; METS PUSH A GOOD BUTTON
At first he was going to be a doctor, so he enrolled at Texas A&M and took courses toward a pre- med major. Later he realized he was going to be a baseball player, so he gave up the thought of medicine and majored in architecture at Trinity University, instead. Either skill would come in handy in Dave Johnson's new career of managing the Mets, a team in need of a heart transplant in a stadium in need of structural renovation for the last decade. But the new manager is neither physician nor architect. As he explained it yesterday, ''One hundred-sixty credits later, I was still in college, so the only degree I qualified for was a B.S. in mathematics.'' With his education, he will not operate or renovate while with the Mets, but he will try to use a computer to help him with the percentages. Oh, yes, and his mustache and his cowboy boots give him a western look: the Marlboro Man working with a floppy disk instead of a lariat. This son of Texas, who now lives in Florida, is coming to New York to try to persuade them doggies to play better baseball. He is looking for a leadoff man and a 10-megabyte computer, in that order. Johnson was unveiled as the Met manager yesterday on a travel day during the World Series. The Mets have not been in a Series since 1973, and they have not won one since 1969, when the last Baltimore out was made by none other than Dave Johnson. ''I was mobbed,'' he recalled yesterday. ''I remember what a crazy scene it was. I'd like to see that happen again. I'd enjoy it more this time.'' He participated in four World Series for the Orioles and spent considerable time studying the ways of Earl Weaver, who took over the club in 1968. Then as now, the Orioles were a team of secure and interesting individuals who blended for the common good. The Orioles have traditionally been confident enough to allow pointed controversy and sharp heckling in the clubhouse. Nobody was safe. Johnson, with his 160 credits and his opinions on the state of the world, was known in the Oriole clubhouse as ''Dum-Dum.'' He never backed off, then or now. ''I don't know everything,'' Johnson told the news conference yesterday, trusting that his broad smile would soften the cocky words. ''But I do know a little about everything.'' It was not a bad start for a new manager who is going to have to resuscitate a comatose clubhouse. Johnson was not even afraid to tease Frank Cashen, the general manager who had just hired him. ''I want to thank Mr. Cashen for being the intelligent man I know he is and hiring me,'' Johnson said, again laughing. ''I wish I had known what he thought of me when we talked money. I never did have much luck with him.'' As a player, Johnson was known to hold out for higher wages. He was also known to question the preconceptions of the manager. He was not afraid to remind his bosses that he was a college graduate who could handle a computer. He told this story yesterday: ''I used to want to bat second, and Earl wanted me to bat sixth. So one year I borrowed the computer at the National Brewing Company and blew out the entire system for Colt 45 in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, or something like that. ''Finally, I fed in all the information to prove that I should bat second. I put all the computer printouts on Earl's desk and I left a note saying, 'You might want to take a look at these figures.' In two seconds, they were in the garbage can.'' Until he became the Don Meredith of the summer airwaves this season, working alongside Howard Cosell, Weaver was known as a manager who used lefty-righty statistics to support his platoon system for outfielders. ''But Earl wouldn't figure other things in,'' Johnson said yesterday. ''He'd say, 'This guy's 3-for-10, and this guy is 1-for-6, so I'm going with the 3-for-10.' I say there are other probabilities.'' Johnson does not fit the computer printout of the aging player who stays in the game. He rebounded from injuries to hit 43 home runs, many of them in Atlanta's jet stream, in 1973 (''I watched Henry Aaron, and I tried to do the same thing,'' he explained with a smile). Two years later, he was playing with the great Japanese player Sadaharu Oh, and four years after that he was the playing manager and general manager for the ill-fated Miami Amigos of the Inter-American League. He has won championships in all three years he has managed, including last year at Tidewater. He has also ''worked for Litton Industries, a real-estate firm, managed some large apartment buildings, had my own ranch with some cows for a while'' and found time to become an excellent golfer. His general manager at Tidewater, Dave Rosenfield, says Johnson ''plays scratch golf and asks for an eight handicap.'' Last year, Johnson talked a Virginia firm into sharing its computer with him. He had just finished programming when his team roared through the International League playoffs and the Triple-A World Series in Louisville. He understands the Mets have access to a computer and would like to use it, ''unless somebody's afraid I'll blow the entire Doubleday empire out of business.'' The man once known as Dum-Dum did not check his opinions at the door when he agreed to become manager. He told reporters he had no problem with Frank Howard, the deposed interim manager, returning to coach for him because ''Frank is a stubborn man, he won't hide his opinion from you. To be honest, I didn't like the way he managed. But he's a good baseball man.'' Johnson apparently did an excellent job coaxing good seasons out of players like Gary Rajsich, Ron Gardenhire and Wally Backman, players who had been with the Mets the year before. He adds: ''I wouldn't want to call it musical chairs, but it's time to decide on a lineup. A good team should be strong up the middle, second, short and catching, and the Mets have not been strong there.'' His former Oriole teammates would have recognized Johnson as he gave his opinions on Japanese baseball (''too much running''), fraternization between teams (''if they want to talk at first base, they'd better get the signals first''), the squeeze bunt (''the only time I'd use it would be to end the game'') and the refusal of Dave Kingman to play first base late in the season (''I'd tell him to pack his bags''). He declined only to give an opinion of himself, saying, ''I'll let other people describe me.'' First impression: A breath of fresh air.

1302-> Rate Increase Is Predicted
Solomon Brothers chief economist, Henry Kaufman, said today that interest rates would move up slightly in this quarter, probably in December. Mr. Kaufman made the prediction in a speech and in a meeting with reporters in Washington. He said that a reduction in the budget deficit would produce lower interest rates for only a few months during an economic recovery. ''Interest rates would decline after a reduction in the deficit only if economic activity were to slow noticeably, thus increasing the availability of real resources,'' he said. Mr. Kaufman said the role of the International Monetary Fund should be broadened and major governments should make greater financing commitments to solve global debt problems.

1303-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Fight Against Apartheid
Arthur Ashe and Harry Belafonte, with other athletes and performing artists, urged their colleagues yesterday to join a newly organized boycott of South Africa to protest apartheid. At a news conference in the United Nations Secretariat, the two maintained that South Africa refused to allows blacks to vote, to own property and to move freely about the country. Therefore, they said, performers should not appear there. The boycott is up for approval before the Screen Actors Guild and Actors Equity, the two added. Persuasion, they said, would be their weapon. ''John McEnroe was offered seven figures to play tennis in Sun City,'' Mr. Ashe said. ''Once we explained why he shouldn't go, he decided not to.'' Because the the group's members are well-known, Mr. Belafonte said, others might be persuaded to join the boycott. ''Artists have had a powerful impact on many issues in recent years - Vietnam, civil rights,'' he noted. ''We're part of people's lives.'' Among the white boycotters is Joel Grey, who said he had declined to perform in Sun City. His friendship with Mr. Belafonte dates back two decades. ''We worked together in Las Vegas and he couldn't stay in the hotel,'' Mr. Grey recalled. ''I'll never forget that, and I'll never accept that.''

1307-> CITY, UNDER PRESSURE, TO BUY MORE TRUCKS MADE UPSTATE
The Koch administration, responding to what it said were pressures from Governor Cuomo's office and members of the Board of Estimate, decided yesterday to increase its purchase of garbage-collection trucks from an upstate company and reduce its order from a competitor in Oklahoma. ''There were people pressuring us to buy in New York State,'' Deputy Mayor Nathan Leventhal said, ''and we decided to reconsider our original order and give a larger share to the New York manufacturer.'' Under the compromise plan, reached hours before the proposal was unanimously approved by the Board of Estimate, the city will buy 25 trucks from the upstate company, American LaFrance of Elmira. The city will pay $2,653,200. Originally the Sanitation Department had proposed buying five American La France trucks for testing. Compromise Lauded by Koch The city will buy 431 trucks, instead of 450, from the Oklahoma concern, the Crane Carrier Corporation of Tulsa. They will cost $39,907,400. ''What we've come up with is a reasonable compromise,'' Mayor Koch said. ''If buying 5 trucks is reasonable, then buying 25 is not unreasonable.'' The compromise was worked out after telephone calls yesterday morning between Michael J. Del Giudice, the Governor's secretary, and Deputy Mayor Leventhal. Members of the Mayor's staff were also informed by representatives of City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and Manhattan Borough President Andrew J. Stein that they were not pleased with the original recommendations by the Department of Sanitation. Trying to Help Elmira Mr. Del Giudice described his conversations with Mr. Leventhal as ''cordial.'' ''I told Nat that the Governor wanted to make sure that everything possible was being done by the city to buy in New York State,'' Mr. Del Giudice said. ''After all, we wanted to do all we could to help bring jobs to Elmira.'' Elmira, in Chemung County, has one of the highest unemployment rates in New York, according to the State Commerce Department. In past months, other legislators from upstate also wrote to the Mayor urging him to buy trucks from American LaFrance. The Koch administration insisted it greatly preferred the Oklahoma trucks. The City Sanitation Commissioner, Norman Steisel, cited an evaluation by his department that detailed mechanical problems found in the trucks manufactured in Elmira. Recommended by Cleveland Aide Officials in Cleveland, one of the cities cited in the report as using American LaFrance trucks, said they were misquoted. ''I have no problem with the LaFrance trucks, and I would recommend their purchase,'' said John Griffen, superintendent of maintenance for waste collection in Cleveland. Kevin Smyley, inspector general of the New York Sanitation Department, said in an interview after the Board of Estimate vote, ''When I spoke with Griffen, he went on in detail about all the problems he was having with the LaFrance trucks, and I have the notes to prove it.'' Mr. Steisel, repeating that his survey had found problems with the Elmira trucks, said in an interview yesterday in the Board of Estimate chamber that he now favored increasing their number. ''We now have an opportunity to give LaFrance a fair test,'' he said. ''And we're also giving a New York company an opportunity to prove itself for future bidding. We will, after all, be ordering more than 200 rear loaders each year.'' When asked why he had changed his mind and approved the purchase of 20 additional trucks from a company whose performance he had questioned, Mr. Steisel said: ''In politics you learn to rethink things. You learn that compromises always follow decisions.''

1308-> THE CITY;
A State Supreme Court jury in Brooklyn found a 22-year-old Brooklyn man guilty of second-degree murder yesterday for forcing his way into the Coney Island apartment of an 87- year-old woman and killing her during a robbery last year. The woman, Anna Krasner, died of asphyxiation after her assailant bound and gagged her. Much of the testimony at the weeklong trial dealt with the fingerprints of the defendant, Nelson Longg, which police had found throughout the apartment. Mr. Longg, who was also convicted of robbery, could receive a prison term of 25 years to life when he is sentenced Nov. 16.

1309-> TV: DOM DELUISE MOVIE
DOM DeLUISE, the comedian, is the executive producer and star of a television movie entitled, ''Happy,'' which can be seen on CBS-TV at 9 o'clock tonight. The film is supposed to be the funny-sad story of a clown named Happy. Unfortunately, it comes closer to an alarming display of manic-depression. Happy used to be the star of a television show for children. Now, he and his longtime partner Bernie, nicely portrayed by Jack Gilford, are reduced to playing for the openings of shopping malls. At home, Happy is trying to raise his son with the help of his former, still amiable wife. When Happy and Bernie finally get a date at a local nightclub, things begin looking better, especially when the beautiful waitress (Dee Wallace) takes a fancy to Happy and his heart of gold. She is really a sculptor; therefore, she is also very sensitive. Then, in the middle of the act, a man enters the club and begins shooting at the staff and customers at random. One of his victims is Bernie. This so upsets Happy that he momentarily confronts the killer and becomes a hero. After the villain escapes, the police arrive and just about all the witnesses claim he was a black man. Only Happy disagrees, arguing that the killer was wearing make-up, and he adds, ''I know faces, bone structure, make-up.'' So while the police are looking for a black suspect, Happy is the only one who knows what the killer really looks like. With the help of his new sculptor friend, he even makes a puppet revealing the wanted man's features. At the same time, Happy the public hero has been given back his old television show, making him a convenient target for the psychotic hit man. We know he is psychotic because both before and after committing his sadistic acts he listens to tapes of Italian opera arias. Mr. DeLuise runs, often quite literally, through all of this in a state of either hyperagitation or profound despair, the transformations from one to the other inevitably drenched in sentimentality. Sporting a beard, the comedian bears a startling resemblance to the tenor Luciano Pavarotti after finishing an especially sumptuous meal. In fact, artistically speaking, ''Happy'' approaches the level of Mr. Pavarotti's ''Oh, Giorgio.'' The cast includes Mr. DeLuise's real son David playing his screen son. In addition, among the smaller roles can be found Mr. DeLuise's wife and other two sons. Being executive producer obviously has its extra benefits.

He said it would be up to the Federal parole commission to release the 65-year-old defendant, convicted in 1980 of bribery and conspiracy for sharing in two $50,000 bribes in the Federal Abscam investigation. Mr. Thompson was at the Federal Correctional Center in Lexington, Ky., for three months so doctors could evaluate the effect prison would have on his physical condition. His lawyers had argued against a long prison term, citing a history of treatment for heart problems.

1321-> MEDICAL EYE PROBLEMS REQUIRE MEDICAL DOCTORS
To the Editor: The State of New York has, quite correctly, reserved the prescribing of drugs to those whose training qualifies them to prescribe: namely, the doctors of medicine licensed by the state. Edward R. Johnson, president of the State College of Optometry - whose letter (''Optometry Doctors Hindered by State Law'') you published on June 3 - knows, or should know, that the training of optometrists is not comparable to that of doctors of medicine. And he is mistaken when he says the curriculums of colleges of optom-etry have expanded ''so that their duration, scope and intensity now equal that of medicine and dentistry.'' He further errs when he suggests that patients save money by first being examined by an optometrist, only to be referred to an ophthalmologist for treatment when pathology is detected. Only one professional is qualified and licensed by the State of New York to diagnose and treat all levels of medical and surgical eye problems: the ophthalmologist, a medical doctor. BRUCE E. SPIVEY, M.D., Executive Vice President, American Academy of Ophthalmology, San Francisco, June 8, 1983

1322-> PUBLISHING: WHAT'S SELLING BEST IN '83
SALES of best selling books were mixed during the first six months of 1983, according to figures compiled yesterday by The New York Times. Hard-cover nonfiction gained a whopping 23 percent over the same period last year, led by John Naisbitt's ''Megatrends,'' predictions about America during the next decade, and ''In Search of Excellence'' by Thomas J. Peters and Robert Waterman, lessons to be learned from what the authors consider the best-run American corporations. Massmarket paperbacks gained just over 3 percent, paced by ''The Parsifal Mosaic'' by Robert Ludlum, a novel about impending nuclear destruction, and ''When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' by Harold S. Kushner, a book of comforting thoughts from a Massachusetts rabbi. But hard-cover fiction was down less than l percent, despite the best efforts of ''The Little Drummer Girl'' by John le Carre, the spy novel about Israeli intelligence agents and Palestinian terrorists, which during the period sold twice as many copies as ''Christine'' by Stephen King, a novel about a killer car. And overall trade paperback sales, led by ''Items From Our Catalogue'' by Alfred Gingold, plunged 14 percent. This turnabout is the more puzzling in that the sale of trade-paperback best sellers soared 69 percent from 1978 through 1982, making far and away the highest gain of the four best-seller categories during those five years. Two novelists and a nonfiction writer had books on both the 1983 and 1982 lists. Stephen R. Donaldson's ''White Gold Wielder'' is the fourth-best-selling fiction title so far this year, while his ''The One Tree'' was No. 7 this time last year. Dick Francis's ''Banker'' finished the first half of this year in 14th place, while his ''Twice Shy'' was 15th last year. Andy Rooney, the television personality and syndicated newspaper columnist, is seventh this year with ''And More by Andy Rooney,'' and he was third in 1982 with ''A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney.'' Three nonfiction books that finished in the top 15 during the first half of 1982 are still there: ''Jane Fonda's Workout Book'' (No. 3), ''A Light in the Attic'' by Shel Silverstein (No. 12) and ''Living, Loving & Learning'' by Leo F. Buscaglia (No. 6). Mr. Buscaglia is a publishing wonder. He is the only author with two books on the hard-cover list for the first six months of this year (the other, ''The Fall of Freddie the Leaf,'' is 10th). He shares with Jim Davis, creator of Garfield the cat, the distinction of having two books on the trade-paperback list (''Living, Loving & Learning'' in fourth place, ''Personhood'' in 12th). And he has a mass-market best seller, ''Love'' (No. 15), giving him the singular distinction of being represented in three of the four best-selling categories. The relative position of the best-selling books will surely change over the next six months. ''Return of the Jedi,'' for example, is only No. 5 on the fiction list for the last six months, even though it is outselling its competitors about three to one. But it has been out less than two months, and by year's end, it should be at or close to the top of the list. The more important question is whether publishing will begin to recover its vigor and financial health, and while there are some signs that recovery may already be under way, these are not yet reflected in the latest best-seller figures. Government-Books Plan Hasn't Been a Best Seller It seemed like a good idea early this year when the Government Printing Office, responding to the inquiry of a syndicated newspaper columnist, said that individuals as well as bookstores were eligible to sell any of 18,000 Government publications. A Printing Office spokesman said that the plan went hand in hand with the Reagan Administration's encouragement of private initiative and added that individuals might expect to make $50 to $100 a week by taking the catalogue to potential customers, receiving an order and money, and then later delivering the publications to the customer. The plan may still be a good deal, but the public has not been banging down the Government's door for the right to sell its books and pamphlets. Since the plan was first announced in January by Milton Rockmore, who writes the syndicated column ''How to Make Extra Money'' and who suggested the idea to the Government Printing Office, the office has received only about 850 letters of inquiry and telephone calls and only 46 individuals have actually been certified. Certification is a relatively uncomplicated procedure requiring only a photocopy of a license to do business in a city, county or state, if one is required, plus a letter on company stationery requesting such certification. Asked if the office was disappointed by the response, Carol Cini, a public-affairs officer in the Printing Office, said there simply had been no way of knowing what to expect. ''But some people may have thought it was a quick way of making money, when in fact door-to-door sales involves a lot of work,'' Mr. Cini said. Government publications include handbooks about many foreign countries, pamphlets on consumerism, energy and the environment, as well as advice to the budding beekeeper. They can be ordered by mail from the Superintendent of Documents, which periodically issues a ''U.S. Government Books Catalogue,'' free upon request, or by telephone: (202) 783-3238 between 8 A.M. and 4 P.M., Monday through Friday. Orders can be charged to Visa and MasterCard. There are also 26 Government bookstores across the country, and many private bookstores sell Government publications, particularly books about space. Unlike books bought from commercial publishers, Government books are not returnable, payment is required in advance of shipment and they carry a 25 percent discount instead of the usual trade discount of slightly more than 40 percent. The Government Printing Office has asked Congress to consider increasing the discount rate to 40 percent, but Congress has not yet done so. After ending 1982 with a $4.9 million surplus, the Printing Office recently eliminated a 10 percent surcharge that was added to the price of its publications in 1981. The reduction will remain in effect until Oct. 1. Then price changes will be introduced, presumably lowering the price of many pamphlets and raising the price of many books. Meantime, the Government's biggest selling book remains ''Infant Care,'' a 67-page guide to coping with baby's first year. Revised periodically, it has sold 17 million copies since it was published in 1914.

1324-> Doing Business With Racists
Uniquely among modern governments, South Africa's white regime employs all the instruments of state to subjugate a racial majority. Having chosen to be a nation apart, it invites special contempt. Americans, as well as most other peoples, want nothing to do with South Africa. Yet South Africa is a bountiful market for American enterprise: $2.3 billion in direct investments, $1.1 billion in private bank loans, nearly $6 billion in yearly trade. Some think this economic relationship supports racism, others contend it mitigates the condition of South African blacks. Periodically, Americans ask how this market leverage might be better used against injustice. It's a hard question, and Brooklyn's Stephen Solarz, leading a score of Congressmen, proposes a hard new answer. They would legislate fair employment standards for all American companies that operate in South Africa with more than 20 employees. Though a justifiable response to the inhumanity of South Africa's system, that would be a sizable leap onto untested terrain. This much has been tested: About half the American concerns trading in South Africa adhere to a voluntary code drawn up by the Rev. Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia. It calls for nonsegregated work facilities, equal pay for blacks and whites doing equal work and the training of nonwhites for supervisory and technical jobs. The Sullivan code offends South Africa's custom, but not its laws or pretensions. The benefits to blacks, though uneven, seem to have been considerable. And by blunting demands for stiffer sanctions, the code also benefits white South Africans and all American traders. But the code is voluntary. Some companies object to any interference. Some resist for bottom-line reasons. The New York Times declines to sign because even if that were consistent with objective news gathering, the code is not applicable to small operations involving only Americans. The Solarz bill would require larger American operations to observe the Sullivan code. Desirable as that sounds, it raises troublesome questions: - Who would monitor compliance? Turning American diplomats in South Africa into plant inspectors, as the bill proposes, is unwise. If an embassy official is diligent, he becomes embroiled in domestic affairs. If not, the law goes unenforced. - Who would judge compliance? As legal cases develop, American courts would have to interpret another country's laws and weigh its citizens' petitions. And if Pretoria retaliated by limiting access to plant inspectors, the measure might be less effective than the voluntary plan. - What precedent would thus be created? Though South Africa's racism is peculiarly offensive, the proposed response would create a new American standard for economic relations. Why should Congress not then legislate similarly against injustice to, say, women in Saudi Arabia? Americans' frustrations should be obvious. They are exacerbated by the Reagan Administration's bland, unfruitful policy of ''constructive engagement'' with South Africa. Even hard-boiled European traders now talk of adopting Sullivan-style restrictions on dealings there. The Solarz bill is probably the wrong way to press our values, and it may dismiss the voluntary program too readily. But South Africans should heed the anxiety it represents. Even Mr. Sullivan, the author of the voluntary code, now supports making it legally binding. Multiracial America will not forever ''engage'' South Africa if doing so appears to condone and uphold its racist doctrines.

1325-> AGENCIES SEEKING JOBS FOR 145 JOLTED BY THE CLOSING OF A PLANT
Some had worked at the Brooklyn plant for more than 20 years. Some had never worked anywhere else. Their pay averaged more than $300 a week, and many were paying to give their children better educations than they themselves had received. But one day last month the lives of the 145 workers at the plant of SCM's office equipment group were suddenly jolted by the announcement that the entire production of the factory, at 4000 First Avenue in the Bush Terminal section, would move to Marion, Ind. Production of file folders, hanging files, tabs, index cards, envelopes and other office supplies ceased on Oct. 21, with workers receiving severance pay for up to five weeks' wages, depending on length of service. ''I almost felt like crying,'' said Andres Torres, a 47-year-old machine operator. ''I had been there 17 years. I'm not a young kid any more. I'm like an old man now. Finding a new job is very hard.'' Area Seeks New Industries The Bush Terminal area along the waterfront in southwest Brooklyn is a depressed section, with rotting docks and deteriorating buildings that belie the prosperity and efficiencies of earlier years. But the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, an association of businesses, is trying to spur new investment, attract industries and provide new jobs in the area. It was not surprising, therefore, that two young women, Jennifer Schwartz, executive director, and Constance Mackey, a human resource and labor specialist for the corporation, responded quickly to the impending departure of the SCM plant. On learning of the plans of the company to close its office-supplies plant, they solicited the assistance of the Community Service Society, which provided counselors who, with Miss Mackey, met with SCM employees, helping them assess their skills and job potentials and informing them of services available to help them. Since production operations ceased, Miss Mackey has been interviewing the displaced SCM employees on a daily basis as they come, seeking help, to the corporation offices in the old Bush Terminal building at 1 Bush Plaza, at the foot of 43d Street. Most Are Unskilled Workers ''These people are working persons who want to work,'' she said. ''But most of them have limited skills. They've been getting good pay - about $300 a week - but they don't realize that a lot of businesses don't want to pay more than the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour for unskilled labor.'' Moula Souverain, a 17-year veteran at the plant who ran a machine that made hanging file folders, has a wife and four children. He said he had been earning $7.43 an hour, plus overtime, and added: ''A job at $3.35 an hour? I couldn't take it.'' Other workers point out, Miss Mackey said, that they can qualify for more in unemployment benefits than they could make if they accepted one of the low-paying jobs. Amparo Alverio, an interviewer assisting Miss Mackey, said some of the employees may have to face a different world. ''They may have to change their life styles,'' she said. ''They may have to move to a less expensive apartment. They may have to get a less expensive car, if any at all. Wives may have to go to work if they aren't already working. It's a shock for these families.'' Jobs to Fit Workers Sought Since Miss Mackey is in close contact with the 75 businesses that are members of the Southwest Brooklyn Development Corporation, she is trying to find job openings and then match the newly dislocated SCM workers with the jobs.

1326-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
A Busy Dina Merrill D ina Merrill jumped back into New York with both feet yesterday, resuming two roles: one in ''On Your Toes'' - played for the past six weeks by Kitty Carlisle - and another as president (since 1980) of the 171-year-old New York City Mission Society. Miss Merrill spent 16 early days of her vacation as hostess aboard her family's former yacht, Sea Cloud. To cruise the Greek islands and the Dalmatian coast, the 31 passengers paid from $22,000 to $35,000 a couple - two-thirds or more as a contribution to the Mission Society. The 350-foot Sea Cloud is the world's largest sailing yacht, with an 80-passenger capacity. It was a gift of Miss Merrill's father, E.F. Hutton, to her mother in 1931 and is now owned by a West German charter company. The benefit cruise was the Mission Society's third, and some, including Miss Merrill and the George C. Whites - he heads the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. - took their grown children along.

1327-> HITACHI LTD. AND I.B.M. SETTLE CASE
A Federal judge announced today that a settlement had been reached between Hitachi Ltd. of Japan and the International Business Machines Corporation over the return of trade secrets stolen from I.B.M. Calling the negotiated settlement of a civil suit brought by I.B.M. ''far sighted and forward looking,'' United States District Judge Spencer Williams said it included a framework for the settlement of future disputes between the two companies. Terms of Agreement The accord states that Hitachi has not used the stolen secrets, that any secrets it has will be returned to I.B.M. and that the names, addresses and business affiliations of all individuals who offered to sell secrets to Hitachi be disclosed. The provisions for returning stolen secrets remain in effect until Oct. 30, 1988. Hitachi also agreed to pay the costs of investigation and prosecution. For its part, I.B.M. dismissed claims against two Hitachi employees. The agreement was negotiated by Hiroshi Asano, an executive vice president and director of Hitachi Ltd., and Ralph A. Pfeiffer, an I.B.M. senior vice president and chairman of the company's World Trade Americas-Far East Corporation unit. The settlement does not affect the National Semiconductor Corporation; a small California firm, and a consultant that were also defendants in the civil suit. Hitachi pleaded guilty in February to charges of conspiring to transport stolen property. The charges grew out of a ''sting'' operation conducted jointly by I.B.M. and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The companies also agreed to discuss any future disputes in meetings in the United States within 14 days of a written request. If the companies are unable to resolve their problem at such a meeting, binding arbitration would begin before a panel consisting of an I.B.M. executive, a Hitachi executive and a neutral chairman who would be retained at a salary of $30,000 a year, paid equally by each company. The companies said in a statement that the settlement ''was an important step that would enable them to restore the excellent relationships that traditionally have existed between them.'' Judge Williams said the settlement ''establishes a system for resolving disputes that could be an industrywide standard.''

1328-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Holiday Farewell T his was the week when some people hated saying goodbye to their Christmas trees and some couldn't wait to - or already had. Others, of course, simply folded theirs into the back of the closet for next year. But as the once-cherished trees were hurled into the streets, two special Sanitation Department truck crews patrolled Manhattan's East and West Sides, recycling them into mulch. Gardeners can pick it up at the Gansevoort Street pier in the West Village, or in East Harlem at 125th Street and East River Drive. Take a shovel and bags. In the outer boroughs, special pickups are not made ''because so many people use artificial trees and discarded trees are too far apart,'' said Vito Turso, a spokesman for the Sanitation Department. The tree pile at Gansevoort Street rose as high as two stories and was 75 feet long. Raucous wood-chipping machines were tended at both sites by sanitationmen wearing soundproof headsets, visors and needle- and splinter-proof gloves. Last year the department recycled 30,000 trees. Considering pre-Christmas prices, the resulting wood chips must rate as the caviar of groundcover.

1329-> Advertising; Gillette Dismisses An Agency
THE Gillette Company announced yesterday that it had dismissed Advertising to Women, one of its agencies for six years, because of the Federal tax problems of its former chairman, John L. Ernst. The assignments involved, all from the Personal Care division, come to $20 million in billings this year, according to Gillette. Mr. Ernst resigned from his position after having been sentenced Oct. 24 to spend 26 weekends in prison following his guilty plea in August to tax evasion charges. He was fined $20,000. Gillette said that ''the decision to terminate the relationship follows a review of the tax proceeding in which Advertising to Women's former chairman was involved in Federal court earlier this year.'' It added, ''Events surrounding that proceeding had led to a strain in the client/ agency relationship.'' The assignments are being divided among three of Gillette's Personal Care division agencies. Young & Rubicam is being assigned Silkience Conditioner, Shampoo and Hair Spray and FOHO Shampoo and Rinse; Marschalk, one of the Interpublic Group of Companies, gets Toni Home Permanent, while N. W. Ayer has been assigned Body Flowers Body Spray Deodorant. The other two agencies, unaffected, are Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and McCann-Erickson. The Standard Directory of Advertising Agencies lists Advertising to Women's annual billings at $70 million, and shows that Gillette is one of only seven of its clients. In a prepared statement, Lois Geraci Ernst, president and creative director and Mr. Ernst's wife, said it was ''apparent that Gillette was not comfortable in an environment that resulted from the adverse publicity from the personal tax problems of the A.T.W. former chairman John Ernst.'' Then, having outlined the marketplace victories it had led for the departing client, said, ''We feel that what we did for Gillette in the marketplace, we can certainly can do for somebody else.'' And E. W. Kelley, the new chairman, said, ''In light of such extraordinary rewarding successes in the markeplace it is unfortunate that corporate policy was influenced by a short-range situation which has been laid to rest.''

1330-> METROPOLITAN DIARY
THESE are difficult times for our friends in the Outer Boroughs whose identity as New Yorkers has already been shaken by the canard that the city does not exist beyond the borders of Manhattan. First the telephone company proposed to strip residents of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island of their 212 area code. And now comes word that the post office has summarily severed the three boroughs, along with the Bronx, from the city. Bruce Kurzius, a Manhattanite who frequents the West 104th Street station, tells us that the following signs appear over the mail drop slots: Slot No. 1: Manhattan only Slot No. 2: 10025 Slot No. 3: Out of Town ''Out of Town,'' according to a handwritten sign over the third slot, includes ''Brooklyn, Bronx, Staten Island, Queens and Puerto Rico.'' Meanwhile, Jerry Richman, also of Manhattan, has a theory about why the phone company chose 718 as the proposed code for Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, rather than some other three-digit code. The theory, which does nothing to boost egos in the Outer Boroughs, goes as follows: All area codes must have either 1 or 0 in the middle, but the first and last figures may range between 2 and 9. Since the caller doesn't start paying until the other phone is answered, the company wants to keep dialing time to a minimum, especially on more timeconsuming rotary-dial phones. So, the most popular call destinations get codes that are quickest to dial. New York's 212 has five dial clicks (2+1+2), the system's fewest, while Chicago's 312 and Los Angeles's 213 each have a respectably low six clicks. Among the presumably least-called codes are Alaska's 907 (9+10+7) with 26 clicks and Puerto Rico's 809 with 27. Where, on the popularity scale, does this leave Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island? Well, says Mr. Richman, the proposed 718 code, with 16 clicks, falls midway between 5 and 27, a status shared with the cities of Omaha, Fort Worth and Sacramento, the states of Colorado and Arkansas, and the Canadian province of Manitoba. ''It is the apparent conclusion of the phone company's call analysts,'' he adds, ''that without Manhattan, Brooklyn is Denver, Queens is Little Rock, and Staten Island is Winnipeg.'' Click!

The menu board of one restaurant features ''Barely Soup,'' while a sign on the door of another restaurant reads: ''Closed for Vocation.'' WALKING HOME WITH GARBO Greta Garbo and I are neighbors. I know this -she doesn't. We have lived on the same block for many years, Greta and I. We shop at many of the same local stores - the fish market, the green grocer. It is my fancy that we have many things in common. For instance, she likes papayas; she bought two yesterday. I, too, am particularly fond of papayas. We are respectful neighbors. We do not intrude upon each other's privacy. One day, when I was walking out of Saks Fifth, I saw her pass by. ''I think I'll walk home with Greta,'' I said to myself. She was a few paces ahead of me and I followed her down the block. When she stopped at the first light, I caught up and stood next to her, waiting for the signal to change. I didn't speak or even look at her. I know the rules. I wanted her to enjoy her walk home and yet I wanted to walk with her. For the next 10 blocks I kept ahead of her or behind her or on the other side of the street. She didn't notice me, I'm sure (even though we've been neighbors for so long). We finally approached the street where we live and I stepped behind her to wait for the last light. When it turned green I sprang ahead, then strode purposefully into the entrance to my building. I turned to see her pass by seconds later. '' 'Bye, Greta; it was nice walking with you,'' I said, under my breath, but audibly - or it wouldn't have counted.

1335-> PAY-TV LINK ACCEPTED BY U.S. AFTER CHANGES
The Justice Department said today that it would permit a merger of Showtime and The Movie Channel, the second- and third-ranking pay television companies, because the proposal no longer includes two major movie distributors as co-owners. The department had announced in June and again in July that it objected to merger proposals on the ground that they violated antitrust laws. But today, Assistant Attorney General William F. Baxter, who heads the antitrust division, said he no longer objected, primarily because the new proposal involved only one motion picture distributor, Warner Brothers. The earlier proposals would have included Paramount Pictures, owned by Gulf and Western Industries, and Universal City Studios Inc., which is owned by MCA Inc. The three motion picture distributors account for a large portion of the movies licensed by major pay television services. Second- and Third-Largest Showtime is the second-largest pay television service, and The Movie Channel ranks third. The largest pay television service, with 60 percent of the market, is Home Box Office, owned by Time Inc. Together, the three services control nearly 100 percent of the market. But Mark Sheehan, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said that the focus of its antitrust objection was not on the pay-TV services as such, despite their scope. He said that there was a low barrier to entry into this area by other companies and that the merger would not make the development of such competition any more difficult. The Justice Department said it had informed attorneys for Warner Communications and American Express, which own The Movie Channel, and Viacom International Inc., which owns Showtime, that it would not challenge the merger. Under the current proposal, Viacom and Warner Amex, a joint venture of the other partners, would each own 50 percent of the Showtime/Movie Channel services. Competitive Aspects Dave Fluhrer, a spokesman for Viacom in New York, said the company was very pleased by the Justice Department decision. But he declined to speculate on what financial effects the merger would have on Showtime and The Movie Channel as a result of the merger. In opposing the earlier merger proposals, the Justice Department had argued that they would have stifled competition among distributors in the sale of movies and other programs to cable systems and pay channels. The merger would increase concentration in the field, but if the merged company raised prices significantly, other services could easily enter the market, Justice Department officials said. ''That new competition would prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising,'' said Wayne Collins, Deputy Assistant Attorney General. ''It's very easy to enter into direct competition,'' he added. Mr. Sheehan, the department spokesman, said the decision was not a reversal for the department. ''They modified their earlier proposal, which we turned down on July 28,'' he said. ''The more they talked to us, the more they got an idea of what we would or would not object to.'' The previous proposal involving the three studios would have brought together distributors of about half of the market of movies for television. Such a combination would produce incentives for the merged company to raise prices. ''They could make their product prohibitively expensive for other pay television services,'' Mr. Sheehan said.

1338-> ON WATCH FOR DISASTERS ACROSS THE U.S.
In the Watch Room of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, P.R. Ray's desk is surrounded by photographs of communities wrecked by hurricanes, blizzards and floods. Some pictures show people clinging to roofs as floods engulf their homes and others show bulldozers pushing mud out of commercial buildings. ''This is what can happen,'' said Mr. Ray, an operations officer whose job is monitoring natural and man-made disasters. ''It's happening now in Louisiana, where every little creek in the state is flooding,'' he added. Floodwaters have been running five and six feet high over parts of that state and the rivers just began cresting late this week. This week, when President Reagan visited Louisiana, he promised ''every bit of assistance possible and without delay.'' But such aid must be sought by a state first and then the application must be evaluated by FEMA, based on information it receives. Such information cascades into the Watch Room from a bank of terminals for news agency, National Weather Service and computer reports. Maps of the four current disasters in Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, and Louisiana are displayed over the terminals. Color-coded flags on the maps indicate where to locate severe flood damage, the expected movement of floodwaters and the area's disaster status. Where Aid Is Allocated Red flags, which began fluttering over most parts of Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois in early December, indicate that the area has been given major-disaster status by President Reagan and that it is receiving Federal aid. Yellow flags, poked into 19 sections of Louisiana after floods began on Dec. 23, indicate that only the state government considers the area a disaster. The difference between red and yellow flags is often millions of dollars in Federal assistance, but only about half of all stricken states that seek Federal support receive it. Since 1970, Presidents have declared 412 disasters and 88 emergencies, wherein the Government provides funds in an effort to save lives and to protect property and public health to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. In the 12 years, the Disaster Relief Fund provided individuals, state and local governments with more than $4 billion in grants and loans. Emergencies and Disasters Emergencies have included such disparate events as the vast Cuban refugee influx into Key West, Fla., in 1980, and the evacuation of Love Canal residents that same year. Emergencies can sometimes become disasters, such as the Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption. According to law, the emergency management agency must determine whether the state and local governments, after committing their own financial resources, are unable to cover the costs of responding to an emergency or disaster. If, after a review, the agency deems a state unable to fully cope with its problems, FEMA recommends that the President declare an emergency or a disaster. A Presidential declaration permits the agency to shoulder 75 percent of the cost of eligible expenses. Public projects include rebuilding of roads, bridges, parks and schools. Individual assistance includes payment for minimal home repairs, help with rent or mortgage payments, unemployment benefits, food coupons, lowinterest loans and grants of up to $5,000. In addition to money, the agency provides technical assistance, crisis counseling and temporary housing in its 3,000 mobile homes. The agency also coordinates all other Federal assistance programs. Since the President decides where Federal relief money goes, one might assume that politics plays an important role, especially in marginal state applications. The President's promise to Louisiana this week may have lent unwitting credence to this assumption. Reagan Promise in Louisiana Mr. Reagan's promise of aid without delay was made even before Gov. David C. Treen, a Republican, applied for Federal assistance and, therefore, before FEMA could determine whether Lousiana's own resources could handle the problem. Governor Treen, however, has since notified the agency that he was planning to ask for Federal assisance. Agency officials said FEMA would review the application no differently than any other. Politics apparently plays a negligible part in a state's winning Federal disaster aid, according to current and past agency officials, several officials in states where aid was denied last year and a General Accounting Office study in December 1981. The G.A.O., the auditing arm of Congress, performed a ''limited analysis'' of the relationship between the disaster declaration decisions in 1979 and 1980 and the political party of governors, representatives and senators from the affected area. ''Except for the governors, we could find little if any indication that political factors influenced the outcome,'' the report states. Ironically, the auditors noted that Republican governors in the Democratic Carter Administration 79 percent of their requests approved, as against 64 percent approved for Democratic governors. Back in the FEMA's Watch Room, an aide interrupted Mr. Ray with news of a minor valve leak in a nuclear power plant in Salem, N.H. The Watch Room staff receives such alerts over direct telephone links to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army Operations Center and the National Warning System Radio. FEMA also has its own 1,000-watt radio transmitter to communicate with field officers as far away as Guam. ''O.K.,'' Mr. Ray responded to the watch officer. Bad news and disasters are just everyday stuff here.

1339-> SAN DIEGO TO CHANGE POLITICAL GUARD AFTER DECADE OF BATTLE OVER GROWTH
This fast-growing city at the southwestern corner of the nation is changing its political guard after more than a decade of stability. A new generation of leaders is vying for control of the city, and all are expressing the same battle cry: Don't ''Los Angelize'' San Diego. The nation's eighth largest city has been dominated since 1971 by Mayor Pete Wilson, a Republican, who in November defeated former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat, for a seat in the United States Senate. Mr. Wilson's leadership is widely credited with limiting urban sprawl and preserving the kind of qualities that have made San Diego one of America's most attractive cities in which to live despite a 29 percent increase in its population, to 900,000, in the 1970's. Mr. Wilson's election to the Senate has left a political vacuum in the city and touched off a battle to fill it. Four Candidates Have Emerged Four principal candidates have emerged so far for an election March 15 in which a successor to Mr. Wilson will be chosen. If no one obtains a majority, a runoff election between the two leading candidates will be held May 3. Many who follow politics here say, however, that whoever wins is unlikely soon to fill Mr. Wilson's shoes completely. He dominated the city government less through the statutory powers than through his political skills and the persuasiveness of his personality. These are the four principal mayoral candidates: - William Cleator, a 55-year-old Republican City Council member and well-to-do furniture manufacturer. Now serving as Acting Mayor, he has the support of many business leaders. - Roger Hedgecock, 36, a Republican member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, who has strong support among environmentalists and some Democrats. - William Mitchell, 49, a Republican member of the City Council, who has been active in anticrime programs and has support among some citizen groups. - Maureen O'Connor, 36, a Democratic former City Council member, who is widely credited with getting operations started on the city's 18-month-old trolley system to the Mexican border. All the candidates say they favor continuing the basic ''growth management'' policies that marked Mr. Wilson's 11 years as Mayor. Among other things, the policies established zoning and other incentives that discouraged builders from erecting new homes at the fringes of the city and diverted development instead into previously bypassed neighborhoods already served by schools, police stations and utilities. City at a Turning Point Despite the candidates' expressions of support, there is a sense here that San Diego is at a turning point in its efforts to preserve its character and avoid the freeway culture, congestion and air pollution that bedevil Los Angeles, 120 miles to the north. Given the relatively weak powers of the position of Mayor, none of the candidates are expected to be able to run the city, at least initially, as effectively as Mr. Wilson. In an emotional farewell to the City Council on Sunday, when he submitted his resignaion, Mr. Wilson said, ''The growth of San Diego is inevitable; that is the clear lesson of the past century.'' Factors in Quality of Life ''In just these 11 years,'' Mr. Wilson continued, ''we have grown from the 14th to the eighth most populous city in the nation and the second largest in the state. But how we grow is by no means inevitable. We can either suffer change or choose instead to shape it. The physical size or population of a city is by no means the sole or even the most important factor determining its quality of life.'' When Mr. Wilson, campaigning largely as an environmentalist, was elected Mayor in 1971, San Diego was widely regarded as little more than a pleasant Navy town. In the latest in a series of political scandals, nine city officials had just been accused of improprieties involving a taxicab franchise, and some of the city's largest campaign contributors were accused of fraud. Under the city charter, the Mayor had relatively few powers; the City Council set policy and the City Manager carried it out. But Mr. Wilson developed a coalition with Democrats on the nine-member City Council, local business leaders, and the Copley family, which publishes the two major local newspapers, The Union and The Tribune. This coalition expanded the powers of the job. Restraints on Developers Enacted He pushed through ordinances to restrict campaign financing abuses and restrain developers and pursued policies that kept per capita operating costs for the city among the lowest in the country. In the later years of his administration, critics said he had softened his hard stand against developers; earlier, at least one called him ''socialistic.'' Nevertheless, his style of leadership was highly popular in a city with a deep vein of political conservatism, and when he ran twice for re-election he received heavy support from business. These days, although about 25 percent of the United States Navy's fleet is based here, San Diego is no longer a Navy town. Since 1971 dozens of corporations have moved into the city and diversified its job market. Mr. Wilson failed to achieve one of his principal goals, construction of a downtown convention center, but a redevelopment program he spearheaded is rapidly changing the skyline. The nation's slumping economy has slowed migration to San Diego, which has an unemployment rate of almost 11 percent. But many political leaders expect the migration to accelerate. County Official Ahead in Polls According to one recent private poll, Mr. Hedgecock, the County Supervisor, is leading the other candidates at this stage of the campaign, followed by Mrs. O'Connor and Mr. Cleator and, well behind the others, by Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Hedgecock, a lawyer who has alienated some Republicans by his liberal views on environmental matters, is running a campagn similar to Mr. Wilson's 1971 campaign, which warned that growth controls were needed to preserve the city's way of life. ''In my opinion,'' he said in an interview, ''the issue of growth management and preserving the quality of life that brought people here is the No. 1 political issue, as it has been since 1971.'' Agreeing, Mr. Mitchell said, ''The way we're going, we're becoming another Los Angeles.'' Mrs. O'Connor is a conservative Democrat who has supported Mr. Wilson's policies and has a reputation for an independent spirit that some critics have called abrasive and aloof. She is the wife of Robert O. Peterson, a founder of the Jack-in-the-Box fast food chain, and is expected to be able to afford the most expensive campaign. Mr. Cleator, an easygoing man who often wears saddle shoes to City Hall, also has the personal resources to wage an expensive campaign. Since Mr. Wilson's resignation, he has been effectively using his post as Deputy Mayor to gain publicity and overcome one of his major shortcomings, low visibility to the voters.

1340-> NORTH KOREAN ENVOY PLEADS GUILTY TO SEX ABUSE CHARGE
After 10 months in seclusion, a North Korean diplomat left his refuge at his country's mission today and surrendered to Westchester County authorities on a charge of sexual abuse. The diplomat, O Nam Chol, pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor, and was released in the custody of his attorney and a senior diplomat on the understanding that he would soon leave the United States and never return. Today was the first time Mr. O had left his mission at 40 East 80th Street since last September. For the State Department, whose officials have been negotiating here since Thursday with North Korean aides, Mr. O's surrender was viewed as tacit confirmation of their doctrine of partial or functional immunity. Under this thesis, diplomats attached to missions that are observers but not members of the United Nations are immune from arrest only for acts connected with their official duties. Diplomats of United Nations members, or accredited to Washington, are immune from any arrest, though they can be expelled from the United States. North Korea does not belong to the United Nations, but its diplomats contend that they are entitled to full immunity. To ease the decision to yield up Mr. O, Carl-August Fleischauer, the United Nations legal counsel, issued a statement noting that North Korea is ''maintaining its original legal position.'' No Diplomatic Relations The United States and North Korea have no diplomatic relations with each other, and Mr. Fleischauer was at the center of the last four days of bargaining. After the agreement was reached but before Mr. O, driven in a gray Cadillac, turned up at the District Attorney's office in White Plains to be fingerprinted and photographed, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nations, expressed Washington's pleasure with the outcome. Robert C. Moller, the United States diplomat who negotiated the terms of Mr. O's surrender, said: ''Our bottom line was always that we wanted to see justice served. Our position on the immunity question mandated that we maintain a rigid position, that Mr. O submit to the court.'' Mr. O was indicted last fall on a charge of first-degree sexual abuse, a felony carrying a maximum sentence of seven years. According to the warrant issued Sept. 22 against Mr. O, he grabbed a 43-year-old woman by her breasts and threw her to the ground as she was walking in a park in Eastchester, N.Y., Sept. 5. She fled and, several days later, picked out Mr. O from photographs of 26 men attached to the North Korean mission. Mr. O, a 38-year-old third secretary, was one of six North Korean diplomats fishing in the park the day of her assault. Mr. O took sanctuary in his mission about Sept. 30, according to United States aides, and remained there until today. The police cannot enter a foreign mission to make an arrest, but a policeman has been on constant duty outside the mission, waiting to seize Mr. O if he emerged. The United States tried to persuade the North Koreans to give up Mr. O by delaying visas for his colleagues abroad. This failed. Not until Washington threatened to expel a ranking North Korean diplomat did the mission begin serious negotiations. Diplomat Instructed to Talk Chon Jae Hong, a North Korean diplomat, said today that he had instructed Mr. O to talk with Westchester County District Attorney Carl A. Vergari. Today's proceedings were the result of those exchanges. According to those involved, the arranged script was followed to the letter. Mr. O appeared before County Judge Francis A. Nicolai and pleaded not guilty. The mission's attorney, Stanley Faulkner, asked for a conference in the judge's chambers. Anthony Molea, the first deputy district attorney for Westchester, said he had no objection. The conference lasted about 15 minutes. Mr. O, speaking through an interpreter, then pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual abuse. Judge Nicolai said he would give him a conditional discharge because he had been told Mr. O would leave the country for good. However, the judge said he wanted to examine the fingerprint report to make sure Mr. O had never been arrested before. Final sentencing was set for Thursday, and Mr. O was released in the custody of his lawyer and North Korea's chief observer, Han Si Hae. Mr. Molea said that he had told the victim of the outcome, and that she had raised no objection.

1341-> WHITE HOUSE DROPS PLAN TO CURB DEFICIT WITH STANDBY TAXES
The Reagan Administration, according to several officials, has quietly dropped the President's contingency tax plan. The President had wanted it enacted this year so that new tax measures would go automatically into effect in late 1985 if they were needed to reduce the Federal deficit. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski, signaled today that without Presidential support Congress was unlikely to approve any tax bill this year and that he would not have his committee, where tax bills traditionally originate, bother to draft a measure. ''I am not going to draft anything without direction from the President,'' Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, said in an interview. ''In the meantime, we'll continue to review our options.'' The failure of Congress to pass any revenue-raising measure would mean that it would not comply this year with the instruction of the budget resolution for the fiscal year 1984 to raise $73 billion of revenue over three years. Without the additional revenue, the projected Federal budget deficits would be higher. The contingency tax plan has been dropped by the Administration, aides said, because both the President and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, in addition to their general opposition to tax increases, argue that the contingency plan is no longer justified because Congress has not agreed to the spending cuts requested by the Administration. In addition, they argue that the economic recovery reduces the need for new tax revenue. Congress started out this year concerned about the projected budget deficits of $200 billion or more a year and determined to reduce them. But that concern has subsided somewhat in both Congress and the Administration because the economic recovery has gotten off to a strong start, promising to increase tax collections from rising profits and wider income from wages. The President's opposition to tax increases in the next year or two and his decision now to drop the tax contingency legislation appears to have shut off the revenue option as a way to reduce the deficit. And Congress's decision, in its budget resolution, not to make further reductions in nonmilitary spending, including entitlements, means that budget deficits will not be reduced through major spending cuts. Tax writers in Congress now say that it would take a rise in interest rates later this summer, while Congress is in recess, to reignite fears that Federal budget deficits are enough of a threat to the recovery to get Congress to act. Administration officials agree that an interest rate ''spike'' could produce a change in Congressional sentiment by autumn. Under the President's contingency proposal the taxes, intended to raise $130 billion, would have gone into effect on Oct. 1, 1985, if projected Federal budget deficits were more than 2.5 percent of the gross national product and if all the President's spending reductions for the fiscal year 1984, which starts this Oct. 1, had been approved. The projected deficit for the fiscal year 1983 is more than 5 percent. The taxes would be raised with a $5-a-barrel excise tax on domestic and imported oil and a 5 percent surcharge on taxes owed by individuals and corporations. As he opened two days of hearings on the possibility of a tax increase, Mr. Rostenkowski put the problem this way: ''The general consensus on the Hill, in the White House and at the Fed is that we cannot sustain $200 billion deficits - that revenue must be increased and that spending must be reduced. ''The political facts, however, tell a different story. Bucking the forces of inertia, beginning with the President, will take an extraordinary act of political courage from Congress. ''Cynics are urging Congress to roll with the President's policy of 'benign neglect' - and gamble that the recovery will drift through the election -and then we raise taxes.'' The President and his top economic advisers have made clear their opposition to any tax increases to take effect this year or next. But they have been split on the contingency program, which would have made new taxes effective with the fiscal year 1986 budget, which begins Oct. 1, 1985. Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, has pushed vigorously for approval this year of the contingency tax, to assure the financial markets that future budget deficits would be brought under control. As recently as Monday, Mr. Feldstein said, ''The Administration remains firmly committed to these standby taxes.'' But with the economy stronger than expected, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan has prevailed in an effort to set aside the proposal. Aides said Mr. Regan is opposed to the standby tax plan, especially because Congress has not approved the spending reductions that the President required as a condition in his 1984 budget proposal for a contingency tax measure. ''The contingency tax plan as an idea is valid,'' said a high Treasury official. ''But there are no spending cuts, so we don't believe there will be one.

1342-> DELEGATES TO CHURCH CONVENTIONS GET A COURSE IN POLITICS OF RELIGION
For most of the last week Rosemary Koch toted 20 pounds of documents to meeting rooms at the World Congress Center here. Flipping through thousands of pages, she followed discussions on such topics as pensions for church workers, communion services for children and United States policies in Central America. The teacher from Great Falls, Mont., was one of the nearly 1,000 commissioners, or delegates, to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), which closes here Wednesday. In coming weeks, thousands of American church members will attend denominational conventions, making decisions that will guide their church executives in determining what kind of Sunday School materials to publish, how to lobby in Washington, how to train future ministers and dozens of other matters affecting church life. Symbols of Representative System At a time when national church leadership is frequently accused of being a bureaucracy out of touch with local church members, the conventions are regarded as powerful symbols of the representative nature of most American Protestant denominations. About 20,000 Baptists will meet in Pittsburgh this week for the annual convention of the Southern Baptist Convention. The United Church of Christ also meets in Pittsburgh this month, and 3,000 members of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod will assemble in St. Louis July 8 for a weeklong convention. Although all churches have some sort of regular convention, Presbyterians, who meet annually, probably devote more energy to this process than any other American denomination. ''The same people who wrote the Constitution of the United States drafted the rules of order for the Presbyterian Church,'' said Dr. William P. Thompson, a lawyer who is one of the stated clerks, or chief executive officers, of the denomination. They Are Back by 9 O'Clock Therefore the meeting here resembles sessions of Congress, with bills passing through various committees before reaching the floor, where they are debated and sent to the appropriate agency for action. Because of the careful way the Presbyterians legislate, the sessions may go well past midnight. Nonetheless, the delegates are back in the hall at 9 o'clock the next morning for opening prayers. As in Congress, a bill may die in committee, or a program may falter because the budget and finance committee fails to allocate enough money. Church conventions vary by denomination. When Episcopalians convene, bishops meet separately from the clergy and laity, and resolutions have to be approved by both houses. The Southern Baptist Convention, a more loosely organized denomination, devotes more time to preaching and singing than to parliamentary maneuvers. Delegates to the convention here were elected by their local churches and many attend only one convention in a lifetime, so they work hard to learn the rules. She Focused Her Efforts ''I talked to people who had been to an assembly before,'' said Mrs. Koch, ''and they told me I shouldn't try to follow it all.'' Since she is head of her local congregation, she focused on discussions about how the Presbyterian Church should reorganize itself because of the vote last Friday merging two Presbyterian denominations. ''I'm not sure we have enough of a chance to talk things over,'' said Eunice Hyllested, a delegate from Rice Lake, Wis. ''But we do seem to reach a consensus.'' At each convention some delegate, dismayed by the reams of resolutions, urges the church to cut down the paperwork. This year the effort came from the Rev. John Miller of Hilton Head Island, S.C., who asked early in the general assembly that procedures be streamlined ''before the motions start flying like geese in an autumn sky.'' Old-timers were not surprised when it took 15 minutes and three votes for the commissioners to reaffirm, somewhat reluctantly, the need for piles of paper. It costs the Presbyterian Church $1.6 million to run its general assembly, which has a staff of 40 paid workers and 20 volunteers. Heads of church agencies also attend it to make reports, promote programs and lobby for bigger budgets. Per Diem Is Inadequate The denomination pays travel and housing costs and gives delegtes $21.25 a day for food. ''That's about 75 percent of what we think they will need,'' said Otto Finkbeiner, Associated Stated Clerk of the church. Despite the hard work and expense, most delegates are eager to attend the convention. For lay people this often means using a year's vacation time to carry out church business. This year there were 8,000 registrants at the Presbyterian assembly, a larger number than usual because the vote that united two denominations attracted those who wanted to be present at a historic moment. Sometimes attendance at a convention gives the delegate a chance to play a small role in church history. When new church history books are written, they will note that at this year's assembly Lois Bakken of Denver and Joyce Bauer of Raleigh, N.C., presented the resolutions that dissolved the two former denominations and united more than three milllion Presbyterians in one church.

1343-> AROUND THE WORLD; Chinese Leader Speaks To Japan's Parliament
Hu Yaobang, the head of China's Communist Party, today became the first leader of a Communist country to address Japan's Parliament. He said Peking would continue to welcome foreign investment in its drive to modernize its economy. ''Let me take this opportunity to make clear that the open-door policy pursued by China is an important strategic policy - the result of careful consideration,'' Mr. Hu declared. ''This policy will not change.'' He reiterated that China would continue to welcome foreign trade and tourism. China has recently inaugurated a campaign against what are called undesirable foreign influences from its greater openness, particularly Western influences. The 43-member delegation of the Japanese Communist Party, which has long disagreed with the Chinese Communists, boycotted the session.

1344-> Another Marine Dies, Blast's 240th Victim
A United States marine has died from injuries suffered in the Beirut bomb blast, becoming the 240th serviceman to die from the terrorist explosion, officials said today. Lance Cpl. Terry L. Hudson, 22 years old, of Prichard, Ala., was pronounced dead at 4:10 P.M. Monday, said Ray Dery, a spokesman at Brooke Army Medical Center. Corporal Hudson had been flown to the military hospital at Fort Sam Houston here. The spokesman would not disclose the exact cause of Corporal Hudson's death, but the serviceman was badly burned and had suffered severe lung damage. His heart stopped several times as he was transported to Brooke, the nation's only military- run burn unit, on Oct. 25, two days after the bombing. ''It's so hard to tell whether these burn victims will make it,'' Mr. Dery said. ''He held on a long time, but it just wasn't enough.''

1345-> CONSUMER SATURDAY
PEOPLE often feel helpless when faced with what they consider to be examples of misconduct on the part of licensed professionals. The New York State Education Department's Office of Professional Discipline has just published a brochure that explains steps that can be taken by those who believe they have been treated unprofessionally. Entitled ''What Can You Do When They Don't?'' the brochure discusses the Office of Professional Discipline, which is empowered to enforce standards established by the State Board of Regents for most licensed professionals. The licensed professions are medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry, psychology, podiatry, chiropractic, optometry, veterinary medicine, social work, audiology, speech pathology, occupational and physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, certified public accountancy, architecture, engineering, land surveying, landscape architecture and certified shorthand reporting. The Office of Professional Discipline has the right to demand that a professional surrender his license in the case of proven misconduct, the power to suspend a license and the power to reprimand, with such a reprimand becoming part of the professional's personal record. Anyone who believes he has been the victim of unprofessional conduct in fields other than medicine should write to the Office of Professional Discipline, 622 Third Avenue, 37th floor, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-557- 2100. There is also a Professional Misconduct Hotline at 800-442-8106. The brochure ''What Can You Do When They Don't'' can be obtained, without cost, by writing the Office of Professional Discipline or by telephoning that office or the Professional Misconduct Hotline. Also available are complaint forms on which all of the details of alleged misconduct can be entered. For complaints about physicians, physicians' assistants and specialists' assistants, write or call the State Department of Health's Office of Professional Medical Conduct, Empire State Plaza, Corning Tower Building, Albany, N.Y. 12237; 518-474-8357. IN the bustle of the holiday season pets are often forgotten, occasionally neglected or mistreated, and given as gifts without adequate preparation, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. To combat such problems, the society has issued some suggestions on the care and feeding of pets during this period. It cautions that pets should not be given as gifts without adequate preparation of the new pet owners. The care required by a pet involves what the society calls a ''10- to 15- year commitment that should not be thrust upon anyone by surprise.'' Often, it points out, the animal ends up in a humane society cage. The society notes that holiday festivities and crowds frighten many animals, particularly if they are not used to their surroundings or are young or hyperactive. So a quiet place for the animal should be provided. Further, the society says, animals should not be stuffed with leftover holiday food, because sudden changes in diet can cause illness or discomfort. The society points out that a pet should not be allowed to eat chicken bones or foil that has become coated with cooking juices. The pet could choke on a bone, and gastrointestinal problems could occur if foil is eaten. Christmas ornaments are also dangerous for similar reasons. The telephone number of your veterinarian and a local poison-control center should be on hand. For further information, telephone the A.S.P.C.A. at 876-7700. OTHER aspects of urban life can also make this a difficult time of the year for pets, according to Dr. Michael Garvey, chairman of the departments of medicine and surgery of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan. Dr. Garvey says one of the dangerous substances a pet can encounter is automobile antifreeze. Its active ingredient is ethylene glycol, which is fatal to dogs and cats. Unfortunately its taste is attractive to pets, and once ingested, treatment is usually unsuccessful. He says antifreeze should be kept in airtight containers, and pet owners should be alert to puddles of yellow-green or blue liquid, typical colors for antifreeze. Pets can also be made ill if they eat rock salt, which is often used to melt snow and ice on sidewalks and roadways, and the substance can irritate the animals' feet, Dr. Garvey says. Exposure to cold can harm pets as well, particularly small animals, he says, and if a dog is to be kept out of the house, a draft-proof shelter should be provided. Dr. Garvey says that if these suggestions are followed, ''your pet should enjoy a healthy winter season.'' But if there is a problem, the nonprofit Animal Medical Center, 510 East 62d Street, 838-8100, is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is equipped for emergency medical services.

A $29.7 million bond issue for Florida's Palm Beach County, won by Citibank in competitive bidding yesterday, was priced at yields ranging from 5.5 percent to 8.25 percent. The serial bonds due in 1984 were given a coupon of 7.60 percent and were priced to yield 5.5 percent. The serial bonds due in 1993 were given a coupon of 7 7/8 percent and were priced to yield 8.25 percent. The bonds are rated A1 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poors. They are general obligation issues and are secured by a countywide property tax that is unlimited as to levy or rate. Analysts at Prescott, Ball & Turben rated the issue mid-AA. They said, ''Historical financial balance surpluses, a strong property tax base and a growing popultaion are all positive factors.'' The analysts added, ''Palm Beach County caters to a year-round tourist industry, and although agriculture is the primary sources of income, high-technology firms are a growing factor in employment.''

1348-> FINDING OUT ABOUT ANTIQUES
Americana collectors who frequent antiques fairs and gallery shows discover early on that knowing quality counts in making any purchases. To compare American Indian art, American antiques and American folk art available in the marketplace with the finest works extant is often - but not always - possible in New York's museums. The American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a treasure trove of the formal styles in furniture, tablewares and decorative accessories dating from the Pilgrim period through the early 19th century. There are many examples of Windsors, painted chests and chairs, folk carvings, trade signs and Louis Comfort Tiffany designs - his glorious wisteria blooms is full color on the Engelhard balcony. The Brooklyn Museum's collections of Colonial through Victorian furnishings - as well as the 20th- century additions - hold other surprises. The silver on view at the New-York Historical Society, Central Park West at 76th Street, is a must for collectors of everything from saucers to soup tureens. American Indian art enthusiasts will find the collections of the Museum of the American Indian and the Museum of Natural History rich in the Navajo rugs, baskets, masks, carving bowls, beadwork and quillwork so admired today. Fans of Frank Lloyd Wright have two places to visit to see period furnishings: the Francis W. Little Room at the Metropolitan and the ''Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School,'' show at Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design, Fifth Avenue at 91st Street. Those who prefer later 20th-century styles are less fortunate. Qualified scholars may apply to visit the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, but the museum's permanent design collection, containing the post-World War II classics and earlier designs shown in antiques fairs today, will not reopen until next year.

1350-> 3 BOUTIQUES: ARTFUL JEWELRY AND CLOTHING WITH DASH
Bernard's is not just a new boutique. It's two new boutiques: one on the East Side and one on the West Side. The basic concept of both is the same - comfortable, easygoing clothing for young women with a taste for the latest fashions. But there are differences reflecting the geographic locations. The one at 1256 Lexington Avenue, near 84th Street, has moderatepriced clothing. The most expensive summer jacket, for example, is $135; the most expensive sweater, $180. More typical are French Tshirts in wide bands of color by Ton Sur Ton for $18, oversize sweatshirts by Amy for $40, a white cotton minidress by Kontrast for $55, and a red rubber trench coat by Circle for $69. The Bernard's at 304 Columbus Avenue, near 74th Street, has a broader range of prices and styles - from cotton shorts at $18 to white leather overalls at $416. ''Columbus Avenue is more avant-garde,'' explained Bernard Yervanian, the owner of both shops, ''and people will spend more for what they want.'' Little-Known Designers Both boutiques carry little-known designers whose clothing has limited distribution. As a result, the merchandise looks fresh and new. The effect is heightened by the abundance of white, beige, gray and black for summer, all crisply displayed against stark gray walls and gray carpeting. The colors may be basic, but the styling has a great deal of dash. The Kontrast minidress, for example, has a mesh undershirt and a hipwrapped sash. The Amy sweatshirts have lots of detailing, such as cutouts, deep V's in the back or inserts of white patches. Matching sweatpants, at $36, come in white, gray or two-tone combinations. Sweaters, by Tijuca, are hand-knit in South America in striations of rust, gray and ivory. Standouts at the Columbus Avenue store are the white leathers by Brazilia, which include the overalls as well as safari jackets with stand-up collars (also $416); animal-printed suede T-shirts by Grand Illusion for $65; lightweight cotton separates by Malibu Sport that include collarless pullovers for $25, funnel-neck shirts for $38 and jump suits with mesh sleeves for $96, and Ton Sur Ton's sweatshirts, ribbed and waffle-weave cottons. ''We believe in the European type of relaxed, comfortable clothing,'' said Bernard's buyer, Jennifer Muessner. ''Just because clothes are oversize it doesn't mean you can't look chic.'' Another aspect of the Bernard's concept is one-stop shopping. So, on the East Side, customers find not just ready-to-wear but also hosiery, shoes, belts, hats and handbags. The Columbus Avenue store has shoes, bags, belts and gold jewelry. Most bags are $55; shoes include Indian moccasins, Bernardo sandals, and pumps by Evan-Picone, Andrew Geller and Joan & David. Jewelry - and only jewelry - is the stock in trade of Les Halles, a tiny store at 50 East 58th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues. All the jewelry is handmade in Japan by two designers: Kawanishi, who uses silk flowers or semiprecious stones, and Fujitani, who works in brass. Silk-flower earrings start at $25, and there are necklaces of beads strung on silken cords for about $100, but the most interesting designs are higher priced. A multistrand twisted choker by Kawanishi, for example, of camel bone, amber and jade with a brass and ivory pendant is $780. An asymmetric necklace that combines turquoise, several shades of jade, amethyst and tiger's eye with ivory disks and crystallike plastic lilies of the valley is $980. Most Kawanishi designs use floral, leaf or bird motifs, typically as elaborate pendants hanging from twisted strands of beads. She also makes earrings and large pins based on nature themes. Most of her birds and flowers (when they're not silk) are fashioned from a plasticlike material made from goat's milk. It has an opalescent quality and comes in various colors. Fujitani's brass collars and bracelets, in different shades of the metal, are bold and dramatic-looking but surprisingly lightweight. He uses floral, leaf, animal and architectural motifs, and most of his designs cost under $250.

1351-> REPORT ON E.P.A.: UNRESOLVED ISSUES; News Analysis
In February, besieged by allegations of political manipulation of financing of toxic waste cleanups and other possible wrongdoing at the Environmental Protection Agency, President Reagan announced, ''I have ordered a complete investigation by the Justice Department into every charge that is made.'' On Thursday the Justice Department made public a 53-page report on its investigation that left some important issues unresolved and others unmentioned. The chief unresolved issue was whether the agency's officials had slowed one toxic waste cleanup project and expedited others last year to help Republican candidates and whether White House officials knew of or authorized such actions. The report, presented by Attorney General William French Smith, was met with harsh criticism from House Democrats. They said it showed the Reagan Administration could not be trusted to investigate itself with vigor. There was no indication in the report that the Justice Department, which said it had closed its investigation of alleged political manipulation, had interviewed any White House officials about contacts with the agency. Justice Department officials did not respond to inquiries about this today. Some of those contacts have aroused suspicions among Congressional investigators. Materials released by House subcommittees months ago indicated that Rita M. Lavelle, who headed the agency's toxic waste cleanup program, had discussed several governorship races with James M. Medas, a special assistant to President Reagan. Contacts Were Not Mentioned The Justice Department indicated when it indicted Miss Lavelle last week that she had committed perjury by denying in Congressional testimony that political considerations were her basis for hastening or delaying decisions on cleanups. Neither the indictment nor the report released Thursday discussed her contacts with Mr. Medas and other White House officials. Most of the report discussed allegations ranging from conflicts of interest to perjury to destruction of Government records. It said the Justice Department had not found enough evidence for criminal prosecution of Anne McGill Burford, former Administrator of the E.P.A., or five of her top aides who were under investigation, excluding Miss Lavelle. But the department's report did not mention several allegations of possible perjury and other possible crimes by E.P.A. officials, made by Congressional investigators and witnesses interviewed in the investigation. Near the Lines of Criminality Morever, evidence summarized in the report seemed to indicate that some of the five former Burford aides whose conduct was discussed had approached lines of criminal law prohibition without quite crossing them. One of the Burford aides under investigation, according to evidence cited in the report, gave misleading testimony to a Congressional panel. Another, the report said, worked simultaneously for the E.P.A. and private clients regulated by it, evading conflict of interest laws by not serving 60 straight days at the agency. A third, the report went on, used agency facilities to conduct personal business. The report also seemed to indicate the Justice Department had heard evidence from some witnesses suggesting that crimes might have been committed but had chosen not to prosecute because other witnesses had told conflicting stories. The California Election One unidentified witness was quoted in the report as asserting that he had heard Mrs. Burford suggest last August that she was holding up a $6.1 million grant to help clean up the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a toxic waste dump in California, to avoid helping Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat, in his campaign for the Senate. ''The allegation against Mrs. Burford raised the possibility that she had committed a criminal misdemeanor violation of Federal election statute,'' the report noted, by using her official authority to interfere with or affect the Senate campaign. But the report discounted the allegation because it was supported by only two of the nine people who were present when the E.P.A. Administrator supposedly made the remark, at a luncheon aboard the former Presidential yacht Sequoia. The others including her former chief of staff, John Daniel, and Interior Secretary James G. Watt, ''denied any recollection of Mrs. Burford's making such comments.'' Mrs. Burford also denied it. The Justice Department report did not mention the events that preceded the yacht luncheon. On July 26 of last year, after months of negotiations and preparations, Mrs. Burford sent a report to Craig Fuller, assistant to the President for Cabinet affairs, outlining her plan to announce the $6.1 million Stringfellow grant at a news conference in Los Angeles July 27. After flying to Los Angeles, the environmental chief abruptly canceled the news conference, citing problems with ''legal technicalities,'' and stopped the grant. Mr. Fuller has said the White House played no role in this decision. At least seven E.P.A. employees and former employees have told Congressional investigators they believed Mrs. Burford's sudden reversal was politically motivated, but they have not supplied first-hand evidence. The report said the Justice Department had found no ''competent evidence'' of political motivation on the part of Mrs. Burford. It did not say whether Mr. Fuller or other White House officials had been interviewed in detail by investigators.

1352-> NEW YORK FISH MARKETS
OUR fish market probably looks different these days. It may be a clean new Korean-owned shop with neat ranks of refrigerated fillets and steaks. Or it may be one of the city's long-established fishmongers, such as De Martino's or M. Citarella, now under new ownership and offering new varieties of fish. Squid, fresh tuna and monkfish are among the species that used to be available mainly in specialty markets catering to Latin American, Chinese or Italian cooks and that can now be found in markets in most areas of the city. Then again, your fishmonger may be the newly expanded counter of your local supermarket. Supermarkets, notably the Grand Union stores and Shopwell's Food Emporiums in the city and suburbs, have dramatically upgraded their seafood departments, emphasizing fresh rather than frozen fish and even live specimens in tanks. Forty years ago some 1,500 fish markets were in the New York area, according to John Van Glahn, director of the Fishery Council of the Fulton Fish Market; by the early 1970's the number had shrunk to 500. Today, it is estimated, the New York area has 600 retailers, not counting supermarkets. Korean-owned markets are the most striking addition to the scene. ''Seven years ago, when we started, there were just a few Koreans in the fish business, and this year we have over 300 members,'' said Young J. Oh, president of the Korean Seafood Association of New York, which covers most of the metropolitan area. Korean owners have bought some of the older markets in Manhattan and have opened in less affluent areas of the city such as Washington Heights, downtown Brooklyn and the Fordham section of the Bronx. Some Korean produce markets have added small fish counters. Imported salmon, hard to find last year, is now sold in these establishments as well as in almost every other market in the area. Salmon flown from Norway sells for $3.59 to $10 a pound. Except for live lobsters, salmon may be the most consistently high-quality seafood available. Other imported specialties, including fresh Dover sole, are no longer rare. Leonard's, a superb fish market at 1213 Lexington Avenue (soon to move one block north to 71st Street) recently featured Dover sole as a ''budget saver'' for $7.99 a pound. This may not be everyone's idea of a bargain. Fishmongers report greater demand for cheaper fish such as whiting, porgie and scrod. The Central Fish Market at 527 Ninth Avenue has a vast selection at low prices. Whole whiting were 79 cents a pound on a recent visit; Norwegian salmon was $3.79. ''Business is good, I'm selling health food,'' said Louis Riccobono, who owns the market. The variety available is exceptional, including jackfish, periwinkles, eels and skate. If you want something unusual you will probably find it here or a few doors away at Sea Breeze, 541 Ninth. You have to know how to select fish, however, because not everything in these markets is as fresh as it should be. It is always best to shop for fish in the morning to have the best selection. Though fish are in great demand, many shoppers still do not seem to understand the difference between the marginally acceptable and the truly fresh, which will have the best flavor. At the same time the general level of quality in the city is decidedly uneven. Furthermore, salespeople in a number of markets visited did not seem to be familiar with the fish they were selling and could not be relied upon for advice. Fresh fish have a certain lively sparkle and no fishy odor. But lackluster fillets, drab-looking steaks and soft whole fish with sunken eyes are commonplace. In a Ninth Avenue market a well-dressed young man bought a piece of tuna that one would hesitate to use for bait. Consider, too, that according to a Greenwich Village retailer, people are eating more raw fish today. Valerie Kalanit, current owner of Powers, at 531 Columbus Avenue, a market that has been in business since 1889, says she goes to the wholesale market two or three days a week and orders by phone the rest of the time. It shows in the inconsistent quality of this onceexcellent store - the flounder and sole fillets often do not have an inviting pearly translucence, for example. ''This is a very tough business and young people today are not interested in getting up at 2 in the morning and working until 7 at night to scratch out a living,'' remarked Robert Neuman, the third generation of his family to own Rosedale, a luxury, top-quality establishment at 1129 Lexington Avenue. Mr. Newman's gray sole fillets, selling for $7.50 to $9 a pound, are usually magnificent. Mr. Oh, who also owns Young's Fish Market at 204 Livingston Street, Brooklyn, explained that Koreans, willing to enlist all the members of a family and work long hours, found a niche in the fish business similar to the one they have occupied in produce. But he thinks there may be fewer new ones from now on: ''There is too much competition and it's harder to make money.'' Typical of the better Korean markets is the neat little Fine Fish Market at 1392 Madison Avenue, with a small but fresh-looking selection, attractively displayed. Fillets and fish steaks are arranged in the stainless-steel compartments of a refrigerated unit with a hinged plastic cover. Few whole fish are laid out on ice in the traditional manner, and steaks are precut, an unfortunate practice that can dry them out. Baldwin, a long-established East Side market at 1208 Lexington, was bought by Changbok Kim several years ago. The quality of the fish is generally good and the jumbo cooked shrimp are excellent. Salamone, at 1410 First Avenue, was bought by Ji Lee three months ago. It carries more varieties, including smoked fish, than most Korean markets. The Korean markets tend to sell flounder, scrod, salmon, bluefish, swordfish and tuna, plus raw and cooked shrimp, scallops and, occasionally, squid. Most of the fish is offered as fillets and steaks. It looks attractive, if sanitized, with heads and bones removed, and the quality in general is fairly commendable. There are exceptions: H. & M. at 2647 Broadway used to be Harold & Morris, an inviting old-fashioned market; today the market is Korean-owned. On a recent visit the fish did not appear to be worth buying; raw fish for sushi and sashimi had been cut in advance. None of the Korean-style markets are comparable to the best fish markets in the city, which offer a larger selection, more whole fish and custom cutting. Fillets account for well over half the sales in all markets. Evidently the average buyer does not want to be bothered with heads and bones even though it is easier to judge freshness in a whole fish and any market will fillet your choice. Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas, added a fish department two years ago and carries an excellent selection, including fresh smelts, fresh Florida frog's legs and soft-shell crab. But ''fillets are the backbone of our business so to speak,'' said Andy Balducci, whose family started in the business in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. In the 1960's a number of markets, particularly in Manhattan, went out of business. Today some of the older ones are being sold, with Koreans not the only buyers. De Martino's, 132 Eighth Avenue, was bought last year by Philip Castagiola, who seems to be maintaining quality. His fillets of scrod and tilefish looked particularly appealing on a recent visit. In March Joe Guerrera acquired M.Citarella, 2135 Broadway, which had changed hands several times in recent years. The quality has improved, so it is again one of the best markets in the city. A good variety is available, including monkfish, halibut and grouper. The mussels are so clean they glisten. But even at the most reliable markets, such as Citarella, Leonard's, Pisacane (940 First Avenue), Catalano (1652 Second Avenue) and Rosedale, where the owners have a commitment to freshness and display a good variety of fish in clean surroundings, it pays to know how to eyeball a fish. The other day at Rosedale, where the halibut and salmon looked exquisitely fresh, there were some whole striped bass on ice that you would not want to take home to mother. ''These are going out tonight,'' Mr. Neuman said. ''They won't be sold.'' SINCE the early 1960's warnings about contamination of fish and s hellfish by industrial, bacteriological and viral pollutants have b een issued by departments of health and environmental protection in t he tristate area. Two guidelines are currently in force. Consumers are advised not to eat more than half a pound of freshwater fish a week unless they are certain of the quality of the source of the fish; it is recommended that pregnant women, nursing mothers and children eat none at all. The second warning suggests that shellfish such as clams and oysters not be eaten raw. Freshwater fish should never be eaten raw. A spokesman for the New York State Department of Health said that ocean fish were generally less contaminated than freshwater varieties. However, New Jersey officials have suggested that people restrict their consumption of bluefish, striped bass, white perch, white catfish and American eel if they have been caught off the state's Atlantic shore or in four river basins - Hudson, Hackensack, Passaic and Raritan. Bluefish over 6 pounds and 24 inches seem to be the most heavily contaminated. In addition, a five-state investigation has begun to trace the sources of dioxin in Hudson River fish. In New York State only 10 parts per trillion are allowed, against a Federal standard of 50 parts per trillion. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is calling for a coastwide investigation of migratory fish. If you have questions about the safety of fish call the State Health Department in Albany at 518-474-5422 or 7354. In New Jersey call the Department of Environmental Protection at 609-984-2249. Here is a selected list of markets notable for their quality or variety of fresh fish. Regular Fish Stores Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), 673- 2600. Interesting variety, fine quality, attractively displayed. Baldwin, 1208 Lexington Avenue (82d Street), 737-4100. Small, better than average Korean market; delicious cooked shrimp. Catalano, 1652 Second Avenue (86th Street), 628-9608. Small, impeccably clean, generally good quality. Central Fish Company, 527 Ninth Avenue (39th Street), 279-2317. Enormous variety. M. Citarella, 2135 Broadway (75th Street), 874-0383. Excellent variety and quality. De Martino's, 132 Eighth Avenue (17th Street), 243-6639. Good selection, reliable. Fine Fish Market, 1392 Madison Avenue (97th Street), 427-1081. Tiny but good Korean market. Small selection, mostly fillets and steak fish. Fish Factory, 1825-27 Second Ave- nue (95th Street), 369-7744. Basically wholesaler with no fish on display for retail sale. Locally caught varieties are usually very fresh. Fulton Retail Fish Market, South Street Seaport, 483-8391. Moving to new quarters, 11 Fulton Street, between Beekman and Front Streets, 483-8391. Should eventually be a showcase market. Leonard's, 1213 Third Avenue (70th Street), 744-2600. Impeccable shop, excellent quality, selling top-of-the-line varieties such as steamers from Maine, Dover sole. Licata, 531 Second Avenue (30th Street), 532-3422. Generally good quality. L. Petrosino & Sons, 161 Duane Street, off West Broadway, 732- 8131. Reliable, good variety. Pisacane, 940 First Avenue (52d Street), 355-1850. Fine quality and selection. Rosedale, 1129 Lexington Avenue (78th Street), 288-5013. Generally excellent luxury market. Ruggiero, 253 Bleecker Street, 929-8789. Good variety and quality. Salamone Fish Market, 1410 First Avenue (74th Street), 861-2662. Larger variety than most Korean markets. Sea Breeze Fish Market, 541 Ninth Avenue (40th Street), 563-7537. Large variety. Supermarkets Shopwell's Food Emporiums, throughout metropolitan area. Offer good variety but quality is hard to judge because fish is packaged. Grand Unions, throughout the metropolitan area. Fresh-fish counters are attractive and have good variety. Lobster Specialists Shell Lobster Corporation, 1650 Third Avenue (92d Street, 860- 3700. Lobster Place, 487 Amsterdam Avenue (84th Street), 595-7605 Jordan's Lobster Dock, 3165 Hark- ness Avenue Brooklyn, 646-0242 and 1 Petit Place, Island Park, L.I., 516-889-3314. These establishments offer the greatest variety in sizes.

1353-> 'WE'LL HIT BACK,' ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTER VOWS
Israel reacted to the bombing of its headquarters in Tyre, Lebanon, today with a series of military steps and statements designed to regain a posture of determination and resolve. Defense Minister Moshe Arens indicated that retaliation might be taken beyond the two air strikes conducted against Palestinian factions near the Beirut-Damascus highway. ''We'll hit back against those who commit these criminal acts,'' he said on the army radio. ''We, of course, will investigate what happened, how it happened, what must be done in order to assure that this won't happen in the future.'' He ordered the appointment of a commission of investigation. Stiffer Measures Promised The Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Moshe Levy, promised stiffer measures against the local population in southern Lebanon. ''We shall have to think about additional arrangements that will surely make life in general in that region more difficult - not only for the security forces - in order that even more extreme actions can be prevented,'' he said. Officials said the bridges across the Awali River, Israel's northern defense line in Lebanon, were closed to vehicles after the bombing. In fashioning its reaction, officials here indicated that the Government was anxious to destroy illusions as well as military targets. In recent weeks officials in Jerusalem have expressed worry that Syria and Palestinian factions in Lebanon have been seeing an irresolute Israel, weakened by domestic political objections to the involvement in Lebanon and drained of stamina by economic problems at home. Some officials believe that Syria has interpreted the Israeli pullback from the Shuf Mountains in September, which Israel undertook on its own, as a demonstrative retreat and a failure of will. They are concerned that this has emboldened Damascus and could lead to miscalculation. Indeed, the image of an Israel suddenly reluctant to use its military force has been enhanced by implications from Washington that the Reagan Administration also believes that the Israelis have not been tough enough recently. Even before today's events, Israel was exploring ways in which to make clear its resolve, at least diplomatically. In the last few days Israeli officials have reportedly told Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, that they would like to see an explicit, though not necessarily public, cooperative effort worked out between the United States, Israel and the Lebanese Government to deter Syria from toppling President Amin Gemayel and moving back into Beirut. According to officials, no specific, detailed proposals have been discussed during Mr. Eagleburger's visit, but Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minister Arens explained that without such a clear-cut alignment, Israel would concentrate on policing southern Lebanon and would not act on its own north of its defense line along the Awali River, except against elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization. This appeared to mean that Israel, which wants to see the Gemayel Government stay in power, would not be prepared to come to its aid militarily under present circumstances. Israelis have long been irritated by Mr. Gemayel's refusal to meet with them and to establish working relations. They have been critical of what they portray as the Reagan Administration's advice to Mr. Gemayel that he keep Israel at arm's length, maintain good relations with the Arab world and depend on the Incident in August Defense Minister Arens was said to have been especially annoyed in August, when he flew to Beirut in an effort to arrange a truce between Druse and Christian factions in the Shuf before the Israeli pullout. He was roundly criticized by the Gemayel Government for visiting Beirut without an invitation. Now, Washington reportedly wants to see more Israeli support for the Gemayel Government, figuring that this might act as a deterrent to Syria. But Israeli officials, recalling the Arens incident last summer, insist on President Gemayel's unequivocal endorsement of the idea and on a system of coordination with the United States. They have criticized the lack of cooperation between the United States Marines in Beirut and the Israeli Army; several officials recalled with dismay that in September 1982, when the marines arrived to take up positions at the Beirut airport, they would not enter the area until Israeli troops had left. Mr. Arens is understood to be preparing to visit Washington in about a month to work on the specifics of a plan of cooperation. Its thrust is expected to be on pressing Syria to withdraw. The Israelis have agreed to withdraw completely once the Syrians and the P.L.O. do, and Israel wants an American- Lebanese-Israeli effort. ''The very fact that three countries stand together is very important, and this is not the case now,'' a Defense Ministry official said. Israel's Military Course Israel's future military course in Lebanon is expected to be fairly limited, since Israeli officials have said they do not want war with Syria. In addition, continuing casualties would probably create political pressure on the Israeli Government to withdraw. Officials assume that this is the calculation of those who bombed the headquarters in Tyre. Except for some strafing runs against a column of tanks when the Israelis withdrew from the Shuf on Sept. 4, today's air strikes were the first since Oct. 4, 1982, when Israeli planes destroyed a Syrian antiaircraft missile battery in central Lebanon. Reacting to broadcasts from Beirut that Syrian artillery batteries were hit today, an Israeli official emphasized that Syrian emplacements were not meant to be targets and that the air strikes were conducted not in Syrian- held territory but in areas of the Shuf vacated by Israel two months ago. Mr. Arens indicated that reprisals did not have to be against the precise faction that made the attack, and he said ''all of them are receiving support from the Syrians.'' He declared: ''To our deep regret, we already know the anatomy of terror. There is a chain reaction, or the phenomenon of terrorist groups which fight each other, but are all linked together when an act of terror is carried out. The principal question is therefore not which of the 15 groups that engage in acts of terror perpetrated this specific act; whoever did it received the help of the others.''

1355-> A Step Forward in Queens
Hunters Point is a depressed stretch of Queens waterfront that faces midtown Manhattan and commands a spectacular view of its skyline. The location - only one subway stop from Grand Central - and the vistas have long stimulated the imaginations of planners and developers. Why can't this desirable site, now home only to tennis courts, cement bins and under-used industrial buildings, be developed with housing, parks, commerce and non- polluting industries? The dream has finally taken a step towards reality. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has managed to satisfy objections of New York City and state officials to including Hunters Point in a plan for riverfront redevelopment in both states. A preliminary understanding, approved by Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch, provides that the authority will commit $125 million to bulkhead the Hunters Point land and install streets, sewers and water mains. Reaching even this preliminary agreement, which requires the Legislature's approval, hasn't been easy. Each state worries that the other will get the better of the riverfront deal. City Hall has always feared - with reason - that the payments the tax- exempt Port Authority makes in lieu of taxes would be much less than the tax yields the city could expect from commercial developers. And the deal remains preliminary. A final contract must satisfy potential private developers and their backers as well as the government agencies involved. Still, it's hard not to be enthusiastic over some progress at last. Government collaboration makes it possible to overcome such past difficulties as divided ownership of the land, high costs of assemblage and lack of investment in infrastructure that the Port Authority will now finance. It's a shame all this has taken so long. But the fact that governments with divergent aims have managed to outline a mutually beneficial compromise is, in itself, reason to look more hopefully to the future.

1356-> Your MoneyLeonard Sloane Goals, Safety And Annuities
THE recent highly publicized problems surrounding single-premium deferred annuities sold by a handful of companies has focused the attention of many consumers on this insurance product. Two of the most important questions now being asked by concerned individuals are whether they should buy a single-premium annuity, and, if they already own such a policy, whether they should surrender it. Annuities in general, and single-premium annuities, in particular, have long met a vital need of some insurance buyers. An annuity is a contract issued by a life insurance company that provides a purchaser, or annuitant, with a regular stream of income. According to the terms of such a contract, an amount - determined by such factors as the cash invested, the interest earned and whether the annuity is fixed or variable - is typically paid out to the buyer over a specified number of years or the purchaser's lifetime. In single-premium deferred annuities, there is a payment of one large sum of cash, which earns interest while left with the insurer. Deferred refers to the fact that distribution, or withdrawal, of funds is delayed until a future time, often the buyer's 65th birthday. Single-premium annuities represent a very small part of the insurance business, with premiums from the annuities - most of them deferred - amounting to only $8.8 billion of the $118.1 billion in overall premiums received last year by life insurers, according to the American Council of Life Insurance. Nevertheless, these annuity premiums, which totaled $6.1 billion in 1981, have been growing rapidly, and this category has been the most talked-about type of annuity in the last few years. The major reason has been the expansion of distribution of the product beyond its traditional marketers, the old-line insurance companies, including the giant mutual companies owned by their policyholders. Most of these companies long sold single- premium annuities through their agents and insurance brokers as an estate planning device where tax-deferred funds were accumulated, compounding until retirement. The spur to the single-premium market has been the issuance of many of these policies by smaller and newer insurers and their sale through stock brokerage firms. In general, such companies promoted what the industry calls an ''aggressive'' rate of return - interest rates higher than the money-market rates offered by their competitors and sometimes available because of lower-quality securities in their portfolios - and often sold annuities as a short-term investment rather than as a long-term retirement vehicle. Some brokers sold single-premium annuities simply as tax shelters rather than as an accumulation device. Thus, it makes sense for an individual to first formulate financial objectives to determine which, if any, type of single-premium annuity should be purchased. And whatever the goals, a new single- premium annuity should not be bought without careful consideration of many related factors. Among the items suggested by advisers as worthy of study by prospective purchasers is the liquidity or illiquidity of the insurer's portfolio, as determined by its stocks, bonds, real estate and other investments. The life insurance council recommends that buyers look into such matters as the current rate of return and the guaranteed rate in the contract - two vastly different levels of interest, with the current rate variable and the guaranteed rate fixed - as well as the expected cash value of the annuity after, say, 20 years. This information can, and should, be provided by annuity salespeople to any potential customer. As to whether or not to get out of a single-premium annuity, the answer usually boils down to the owner's subjective evaluation of the financial stability and strength of the insurer. Annuity buyers have the right to cancel their contracts and liquidate them before payouts begin, since the insurer has guaranteed the investment plus interest. And as one insurance executive observed, ''If you're going to be locking away money for 20 or 30 years, you want to have a sense of comfort that you're not only going to get a high return on principal, but also get the return of the principal itself.'' This sense of comfort may be augmented depending on the states where the particular insurance company is licensed to operate. For instance, Barry Greenhouse, a spokesman for the New York State Insurance Department, said: ''Before cashing in on a company licensed in New York, you should consider the certainty of penalty against the fact that no life insurance policyholder in the history of the State of New York has ever lost a penny.'' For there are surrender penalties - in addition to the Federal 5 percent excise tax that may be imposed on many annuities and the regular income tax on the amount received - normally imposed when single-premium annuities are cashed in before a certain number of years. The average period that annuities must be held before penalty charges can be avoided is seven years, insurers say, with penalties in many instances declining one percentage point annually until none are imposed. For example, one company provided the illustration of a $20,000 single-premium annuity with a credited interest rate of 10 percent held for a year. The purchaser would have earned $2,000 in interest, but the penalty for surrendering it now would be 6 percent. Even if this annuity had a ''free corridor'' - an amount here of 10 percent of the value annually, or $2,200, on which no penalty is charged - the owner would wind up with a charge of $1,188 on the remaining $19,800. This owner might then still have to pay Federal or local taxes out of the $20,812 net proceeds.

1357-> AROUND THE WORLD; Dutch Police Have Half Of Heineken Ransom
The police said today that they had found more than half of the $11 million ransom paid for Alfred H. Heineken, the brewery chairman. The money was reportedly stuffed in plastic barrels that were buried in a Dutch forest. The police began searching the forest near Utrecht when two hikers found hundreds of $100 bills. The police rescued Mr. Heineken, 60 years old, and his driver, Ab Doderer, 57, from an Amsterdam warehouse last Wednesday after they had been kidnapped and held for three weeks. They recovered $2 million of the ransom in raids that led to the arrest of 25 people. Nineteen were later released.

1358-> AROUND THE WORLD; Ransom Is Called Ready In Heineken Case
Dutch newspapers have reported that the Heineken brewery raised $10 million for the ransom of its chairman, Alfred H. Heineken, and his chauffeur, who were kidnapped Nov. 9. Algemeen Dagblad, a Rotterdam newspaper, said Thursday that the ransom was ''packed in six suitcases,'' ready for delivery. De Telegraaf of Amsterdam reported that the kidnappers made contact with brewery officials by telephone Saturday night and said instructions could be found in a railway luggage locker. The paper's account said the locker contained two pictures showing the kidnapped men holding copies of last Saturday's issue of De Telegraaf.

1359-> Cubo-Futurist 'Opera' From 1913 Being Staged
''Victory Over the Sun,'' a re-creation of a 1913 Cubo-Futurist ''opera,'' is being presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music this weekend as part of its ''Next Wave'' festival. The text is by Aleksei Kruchenykh, music by Mikhail Matiushin, and stage and costume designs by Kazimir Malevich. The production was originally reconstructed by the director Robert Benedetti for a California production in 1980. The piece is said to be less a conventional opera than a precursor of modern performance art in its merging of text, music and staging. ''Victory Over the Sun'' can be seen tonight at 7 and 9 o'clock and tomorrow at 2 and 7 P.M. in the academy's Carey Playhouse (636-4100), 30 Lafayette Avenue, near the Atlantic Avenue IRT station. Tickets are $8 and $12.

1360-> MUSIC NOTED IN BRIEF; Music From Alaska Celebrates 49th State
At Carnegie Recital Hall on Friday night, the composer Judith Lang Zaimont made a brief speech preceding a performance of her haunting song cycle ''From the Great Land: Woman's Songs.'' In this setting of seven poems by Frank Buske, Miss Zaimont said that she had tried to ''convey the primitive raw beauty of Alaska, the discipline the climate imposes on habits of living and the overall vastness of the terrain.'' These were recurring themes throughout the first two evenings of the Alaska Music Festival. In Alaska, perhaps more than in any of the other 49 states, the weather is all important. Much of the state is uninhabitable, and as a result much of the music heard was concerned with the land itself and its dangerous beauty. In the two Carnegie Recital Hall concerts last week, the North Star Consort -which consists of the mezzo-s@oprano Suzanne Summerville, the clarinet player Theodore DeCorso and the pianists Robert McCoy and James Johnson - offered proof that there is much worthy music being made at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. The evenings offered performances of music by Alaskan composers, settings of poems by Alaskan writers and simple readings of the standard repertory by Alaskan musicians. On Wednesday night, Miss Summerville offered idiomatic and characterful performances of some art songs by Joseph Marx, Ernanno Wolf-Ferrari and Dvorak. Miss Summerville's voice is full, and her histrionic ability convincing. Mr. McCoy made a thoughtful accompanist. But the most interesting material was that specifically concerned with Alaska. Wednesday night's highlight was a stark, craggy and evocative song cycle called ''Poem Against the Cold'' by Corey Field, sung with conviction by Miss Summerville. Less successful was Ravonna Martin's setting of three Amy Lowell songs; these seemed unfinished, but did convey a certain windswept charm. William Dottman's ''Dance Variations for Solo Clarinet'' is a disjunct and anthological work that provides an excellent showpiece for the clarinet player - in this case the fluid and musical Mr. DeCorso.

1361-> RIGHTS OF CHILEANS: WHAT IMPROVEMENT?
To the Editor: Edward Schumacher's Jan. 2 Week in Review article rightly identifies recent events affecting any assessment of Chile's humanrights performance. But saying that ''the human-rights record has clearly improved but the point is whether it has improved enough to satisfy Congress'' wrongly suggests an upbeat picture and stubborn lawmakers. Congress established its conditions for certification in 1981, not in 1976 or 1978. It knew that the most violent abuses had ceased but worried about a severe, continuing pattern of rights violations. The International League for Human Rights finds a deteriorating situation in Chile. Arrests, torture, expulsion abroad and prohibition of dissenting expression and union activity continue at distressing levels, while numerous abuses have become institutionalized in the law. Under the new Constitution, General Pinochet can expel citizens without recourse to the courts. Secret police powers remain unchallenged. After the Chilean Supreme Court decided to uphold the conviction of several human-rights activists (while reducing their sentences), league trial observer and former Watergate attorney Sam Dash wrote: ''What happened in this case clearly signals secret police that they have nothing to fear from the judiciary if they wish to use torture to obtain confessions.... The judges ... seemed more willing to follow the desires of the military government than the rule of law.'' The commission studying the problem of the exiles (already disbanded) did produce movement: It recommended the return of some 125 (of an estimated 10,000) exiles. A few of them were dead; some never asked to return. Meanwhile, such distinguished individuals as Jaime Castillo, former Minister of Justice in the Frei Government, remain abroad. FELICE D. GAER, Executive Director, International League for Human Rights New York, Jan. 3, 1983

1363-> PINTER'S 'BETRAYAL,' DIRECTED BY DAVID JONES
Harold Pinter, the justifiably celebrated English playwright, has done a lot of film work, sometimes adapting his own plays (''The Caretaker,'' ''The Birthday Party'') and sometimes adapting the works of others (''The Servant,'' ''Accident,'' ''The French Lieutenant's Woman,'' among others). However, nothing he has written for the stage has ever been as simply and grandly realized on the screen as his ''Betrayal,'' adapted by him and directed by David Jones in a way that manages to find the cinema equivalents to what we call - rather lamely, I'm afraid - Pinteresque theater. Its extraordinary stars are Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley (in a role that is about as far as he will ever get from ''Gandhi''), and Patricia Hodge, a wonderful English actress, new to films, whose face seems to have been designed for the close-up that reveals secrets reluctantly. Among other things, ''Betrayal'' is a mystery story. It should also be pointed out that it was brought to the screen by the veteran Hollywood producer Sam Spiegel, more often identified with epics such as ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and ''Nicholas and Alexandra.'' Despite its antecedents, ''Betrayal'' is no filmed play. Though I didn't see the stage production when it was done on Broadway in 1980, this ''Betrayal'' is a riveting film that proceeds through the interlocking love lives of three special friends. They are Robert (Mr. Kingsley) and Emma (Miss Hodge), who are husband and wife, and Jerry (Mr. Irons), who was Robert's best man as well as his best friend since their college days. For seven of the nine years covered in the film, Jerry and Emma have been lovers. Much has been made of the fact that ''Betrayal'' moves backward in time, beginning with a brief, infinitely sad reunion of Jerry and Emma two years after their affair has ended, and winding up nine years earlier, on the night of a drunken party during which Jerry, more or less under the nose of Robert, first declares his love for his best friend's wife. Though the film moves backward through time, it doesn't have the lugubrious manner of an extended flashback. It moves forward from a sense of lovelessness and loss to discover, at the film's end, the initial ecstasy, which, knowing what we do, is all the more haunting. I can't think of another recent film that is simultaneously so funny, so moving and so rigorously unsentimental. The writing is superb, and so quintessentially Pinter that it sometimes comes close to sounding like parody, though, in the entire screenplay, there's not one predictable line or gesture, the sort of thing that would expose the fake or the merely hackneyed. This is pure Pinter well served by collaborators. The most visible of these are the three stars whose work is so closely integrated that it has the effect of a single, three-part performance. Mr. Irons's Jerry, a literary agent, is probably the most reckless and wrongly self-assured of the three friends. Mr. Kingsley's Robert, a book publisher, is the most profoundly sensitive and, eventually, most untrustworthy, and Miss Hodge's Emma the bravest. The film is also full of vivid off-screen characters, including Judith, Jerry's wife, who has a full-time career as a doctor; an author named Casey who, at the beginning of the film, is writing tired if successful novels and, at the end is being talked about as the year's latest literary discovery, plus children of various ages, one of whom is the subject of one of the most moving monologues Mr. Pinter has ever written. Mr. Jones, primarily a theater director and, for two years the artistic director of the repertory company of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, has not only obtained remarkable performances from all of the actors, but he has also found a look and a manner that best suits the Pinter text. Everything in the movie - outside locations, interior sets, costumes, even the weather - looks realistic because it actually is, but, through some process of selection that I'm not sure I understand, it also suggests some other, more intense reality, which is the heart of Pinter theater. Each aspect of the film is loaded with meanings and associations that creep up on you during the performance - even the title. At first ''Betrayal'' appears to be that of Emma and Jerry of Robert. However, as we slide back through time, Mr. Pinter reveals an entire series of deceptions, some of which are all the more heartless for being profitless and without motive. The pointless lie leaves the deepest wound. ''Betrayal'' opens today at the Cinema 2, where, I hope, it will stay a long time and not be rushed into mass distribution. It should be allowed to take its time and, of course, ours. The Cast BETRAYAL, directed by David Jones; screenplay by Harold Pinter; director of photography, Mike Fash; edited by John Bloom; music by Dominic Muldowney; produced by Sam Spiegel; released by 20th Century-Fox International Classics.

1364-> PRESS NOTES; FICTION PIECES TO BE OFFERED TO 10 PAPERS
The columns of daily newspapers were once a fertile area for aspiring writers of fiction. The National Endowment for the Arts is about to spend $120,000 to see if they could be again. A panel of judges from PEN, a national association whose acronym represents ''Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists,'' will select 108 short stories, and the endowment will distribute them, free, at the rate of eight a month to 10 newspapers around the country. The newspapers will be selected next month. An author whose story is accepted by the judges will get $500 from the endowment and $50 more each time a newspaper prints it. In the 19th century and for the first half of this century, newspapers actively sought out writers like Dickens, whose serialized novels were reliable circulation builders. Now newspapers try to satisfy readers' appetites for good writing by encouraging staff members to stretch out stylistically. Some also have columnists who from time to time wander the border between fact and fiction. The endowment project addresses two of the problems that contributed to squeezing fiction out of the dailies: the difficulty of wading through hundreds of manuscripts and the cost of commissioning a work for a single publication. But the third constraint, limited space, continues. Judith Hanes, the editor of the Sunday magazine for one potential participant, The Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star in Norfolk, said seasonal variations in the size of the magazine might keep the newspaper from being able to publish the minimum of two stories a month required by the endowment. Like other editors, she said she was not worried that taking the stories from the publicly financed endowment would set a bad precedent. ''I don't imagine there will be any Government intrusion on the content of the stories,'' she said. Janet Cooke Writing Again Janet Cooke, the former Washington Post reporter whose article about a fictitious 8-year-old heroin addict won a Pulitzer Prize that the newspaper later returned, has had an article published, her first since May 1981 when her hoax was revealed and she was forced to resign. Miss Cooke's article, ''Searching for Someone Special,'' is in the February issue of The Washingtonian magazine. It describes some of the ways single people in Washington meet through dating services and clubs. ''We'll call her Samantha,'' the article begins, introducing the first of four interviews with pseudonymous people. John A. Limpert, the editor of the magazine, said he had made no effort to verify whether the four subjects existed. ''The anonymity didn't bother us,'' he said. ''We saw the piece more as an entertainment.'' ''I can tell you that they do exist,'' said Audrey Wolf, Miss Cooke's agent, who added that, after the trauma of two years ago, ''I don't think she'd ever do that again.'' She declined to make Miss Cooke available for an interview. 2 News Groups Make Cuts Changes in ownership at two large news organizations are being followed by some belt-tightening. The Morris Communications Corporation, a relatively small group that owns newspapers in Georgia, Texas, Alaska, South Carolina and Florida, spent more than $210 million in November to buy Jacksonville's two dailies, The Florida Times-Union and The Jacksonville Journal. Industry sources said the purchase price was 50 percent more than the next highest bidder, Gannett Newspapers. Five days before Christmas, the new owner, William S. Morris 3d, dismissed Jacksonville's 10 top executives, including the editor, Robert P. Clark, who had been brought in three years earlier from Louisville. Since then, a dozen more newsroom staff members have quit. As part of a $3 million economy move, the company that took over United Press International last summer, Media News, has started to dismiss more than 100 nonunion managers and secretaries. Some of the employees with 20 or 30 years at the news service say they have been offered 13 weeks of severance pay, spread out over 20 weeks, which they said was less than a fourth of what union workers with comparable seniority would get. A spokesman for U.P.I., Elaine Clisham, declined to discuss the details of the severance terms. Joint Agreement Upheld A 1970 Federal law that permits a financially failing newspaper to combine its business operations with a successful competitor survived one challenge last week. In a ruling late Thursday, Federal District Judge Jesse Curtis dismissed a lawsuit by the city of Honolulu against the joint operation agreement between the city's two dailies. He said evidence in a trial last summer overwhelmingly sustained the newspapers' contention that The Honolulu Advertiser could not have survived if it had not merged its commerical functions with The Star-Bulletin in 1962. A second, more definitive ruling on the law, known as the Newspaper Preservation Act, is expected soon from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The court heard arguments in December about a proposed joint operation between The Seattle Times and The Post-Intelligencer. A group of Post-Intelligencer employees and advertisers and suburban publishers are contending that the law's special antitrust exemption should not be granted when buyers are available to operate the newspaper independently of The Times.

1367-> FIRST JERSEY IS ACCUSED BY S.E.C. ON GEOSEARCH
The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed suit against First Jersey Securities Inc., its chairman and founder, Robert E. Brennan, and a senior executive, charging that they illegally manipulated the securities of a company that First Jersey actively traded in, taking in more than $3 million in profits. The complaint, filed late Friday, charges that First Jersey, Mr. Brennan and Robert Beckson, a broker, artificially inflated the prices of shares of Geosearch Inc., a small New York concern whose principal activity consisted of preparing filings related to oil and gas leases offered by the Department of the Interior. The 11-page complaint, filed in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, in Manhattan, came a few hours after a three-member panel of judges in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia rejected a motion by First Jersey and Mr. Brennan to prevent the S.E.C. from issuing the complaint. Friday's action was the latest in a series of recent complaints by the S.E.C. against First Jersey. Since it was founded by Mr. Brennan in 1974, First Jersey has become one of the nation's fastest growing brokerage firms, with an estimated 160,000 customers, 25 offices and a sales force of 500. Missing Documents But in 1979, the S.E.C. charged the firm with defrauding customers by manipulating stock prices in several companies between 1975 and 1978. In an unusual turn in the lenghty legal fight, it was discovered that 220,000 pages of company records were missing from a commission hearing room in a Federal building in New York City and the firm sued to block any further action until the documents could be found. The court's action in Philadelphia on Friday removed a stay issued last month by a Federal District Court that had prevented the agency from moving forward against First Jersey. The complaint covers a series of transactions between January and September 1980, during which First Jersey purchased more than 1.6 million shares of Geosearch. While First Jersey was selling the stock to its retail customers, the complaint charges, the firm was simultaneously bidding to buy shares in the over-the-counter market. In its suit, the S.E.C. requested preliminary and permanent injunctions against First Jersey to enjoin it from violating various provisions of the securities laws that make it illegal for a company to bid or purchase securities while it is participating in a distribution of that security. First Jersey has vigorously denied the S.E.C.'s allegations. Attempts to reach company officials for further comment were unsuccessful.

1369-> DEEPER MILITARY CUTS SOUGHT
Two Republican Senators said today that President Reagan must dig still deeper into military spending for 1984 to reduce projected budget deficits of $200 billion or more a year. Despite indications from Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger that the Administration is prepared to cut $8 billion from military spending in the pending 1984 budget, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said, ''I am not satisfied.'' Similarly, Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, said, ''We can do better on that side.'' Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, appeared on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' Senator Dole, chairman of the Finance Committee, was interviewed on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' Would Cut Strategic Arms Both said Mr. Reagan, before formally proposing his budget to Congress at the end of this month, should reduce or delay spending on strategic weapons. Last week Administration officials indicated that cost-of-living increases of 7.6 percent in military pay would be dropped. Senators Dole and Domenici said that was far from enough. ''I am not sure it is a healthy approach,'' Senator Domenici said. He said that even with the reduction already agreed to, the Pentagon's $35 billion in spending authority is above the 1983 rate. The burden of proof is on Secretary Weinberger to persuade Congress that such an increase is vital, he said, Effect on Recovery Seen Both Senators said planned spending for strategic weapons would inevitably increase Federal deficits, projected at $300 billion in 1985 and later. That, Senator Domenici said, would probably kill projected economic recovery.

1370-> ATOM TRIAL: NEW DOUBTS; News Analysis
The out-of-court settlement that brought an abrupt end to the trial over responsibility for the Three Mile Island nuclear accident left many questions unanswered, especially the question of guilt. Until the $37 million settlement was announced Jan. 24, teams of lawyers for the utility operating the reactor and the manufacturer that built it traded blame for the 1979 accident for almost three months in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. The battle ended, it is generally agreed, in a draw. The General Public Utilities Corporation, which operates the nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., sued the manufacturer of the two reactors there, the Babcock & Wilcox Company, for $4 billion. The utility said the company had not provided key safety information. Babcox & Wilcox said the utility had all the information it needed but had operated the reactors ineptly. Closely Watched Trial There were earlier investigations into what happened in the March 1979 accident, during which vital cooling water escaped from the reactor core. But the trial was watched closely by many who hoped it would finally determine who was at fault in the worst accident in the history of commercial nuclear power. Those hopes have been ended, at least for now, because a key part of the agreement is ''that neither party has established that the other was the cause of the accident.'' Although there was no indication at the trial that the two sides were just going through the motions, some people who are knowledgeable about the nuclear power industry have been suggested that the court case was ended because it was giving the industry a black eye. ''If the trial had run its course and everything had come out,'' said Robert Pollard, a former nuclear safety engineer with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ''it would have destroyed what remaining shred of confidence the public had in the commission and the nuclear industry.'' Mr. Pollard, now with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a public interest group, asserted: ''I wouldn't be surprised if someone from the N.R.C. whispered in their ears and said, 'You guys keep it up and you're going to be in more trouble than $4 billion.' '' Terms of Settlement The terms of the settlement call for Babcox & Wilcox to pay $37 million in rebates on services General Public Utilities is expected to order over the next 10 years as it cleans up Three Mile Island. Both sides said they were pleased with the settlement. The utility pointed to the $37 million. The manufacturer pointed to the work it was going to get, on which it expected to make a profit even after the rebates. Peter Bradford, an N.R.C. commissioner from 1977 until last year, asserted the trial and the settlement might have been mainly a show. Mr. Bradford, a lawyer who is chairman of the Maine Public Utilities Commission, contended the utility had to go ahead with the trial to prove it was earnestly pursuing every source, especially within the nuclear industry, to raise the $1 billion needed to clean up after the accident that crippled one of the reactors. The utility had met some resistance to its efforts to pass the costs on to consumers and taxpayers, and Mr. Bradford argued that without showing that it was going after funds from within the industry, the plant's owner could never persuade regulatory commissions to pass more costs on. Fears of a Long Trial Mr. Bradford agreed with Mr. Pollard that a long, detailed trial might have destroyed public confidence in the entire nuclear industry, in which both parties have a strong stake. ''I can't imagine the nuclear industry was other than horrified by the two fighting each other during the trial,'' Mr. Bradford said. Although the two sides had exchanged sharp charges of gross mismanagement, the settlement papered over much of that. In a joint statement, the utility and the manufacturer said they had a need for continuing close relations in the future cleanup and operation of the plant. And a statement accompanying the settlement said that ''it would be counterproductive to incur the substantial costs of further litigation.'' But the trial still provided insights into shortcomings by both the manufacturer and the utility that were not available before they became adversaries in the courtroom. Mistakes by Both Parties There were control room operators who said they never realized a faulty relief valve was draining away the cooling water because they were relying on a misleading indicator light that had been installed by the utility. There was a safety engineer for the manufacturer who testified that if his warnings about cooling levels had been sent out there would have been no accident. Mr. Bradford said there were also questions ''about the adequacy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's relatively bland investigation'' of the incident. He asserted the commission investigators were not equipped to take on a job with as many implications as the Three Mile Island accident. ''They are not trained to get to the bottom of matters with extensive criminal and civil liability,'' he maintained. ''The N.R.C. investigator's primary job is to keep the plant running. The keepthe-plant-running school of investigation doesn't really get to the bottom of things.'' No Comment From N.R.C. The nuclear regulatory agency has declined to comment on the trial. Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the commission, said the staff was studying the trial's transcript and would report to the commissioners. The commission is the defendant in another $4 billion lawsuit filed by the utility, which is charging that the commission, like Babcock & Wilcox, failed to issue a warning before the accident after a similar but much less severe one occurred at another reactor. ''The utility is walking a tightrope on the N.R.C. suit,'' Mr. Bradford said, ''because what the industry wants is less regulation by the commission, not more.'' Moreover, he said, if a trial showed the commission to be ineffective, its licensing standards could be questioned to the point where nuclear plants all over the country could face shutdowns by states concerned about the safety of the plants. Pressure on Utility But, Mr. Bradford said, General Public Utilities is under pressure to go ahead with the second suit to show its diligence in finding cleanup money. ''G.P.U. could litigate, but not too hard,'' Mr. Bradford speculated, ''and lose the N.R.C. case and then turn to the public utilities commissions and say we tried, now we need more from ratepayers.'' The utility says it has had a longstanding policy of attempting to pass on the cost of the cleanup to as many people as possible. It denied that it was just going through the motions of suing the manufacturer and the commission. ''We have maintained that a broad-based sharing of this cost is best, best for everyone,'' said Joseph M. Benish, a spokesman for the utility, ''because the benefits in lessons learned from the accident extend beyond G.P.U.'' So far, however, it has had trouble getting people other than the utility's stockholders to take on any part of the cleanup bill.

1371-> FREE RIDING MAY CEASE FOR 60,000 PUPILS IN CITY
More than 60,000 students who ride to school free will lose that privilege on Feb. 1 if the Board of Education adopts a budget-cutting proposal tomorrow. Parents have strongly protested the proposed transportation cuts. The Koch administration, in its latest four-year fiscal plan, argues that the needed savings could be largely achieved through cuts in the school system's administrative staff. The transportation changes, which would affect children in both public and parochial schools, are part of a package intended to close a $37 million deficit in the school budget. The plan, which would produce estimated savings of $8.8 million a year, was submitted to the board earlier this month by Frank J. Macchiarola, the Schools Chancellor, who has since announced his resignation to take a private job. Harm to Children Feared Several parents at a board meeting last Wednesday complained that many schools were not near public transit. Others expressed concern that their children would be exposed to crime and bitter weather. One Queens woman said that for her two children, ''yellow bus service isn't only a comfort or a convenience, it's a barrier against crime.'' From kindergarten through the 12th grade, some 90,000 pupils ride private yellow buses free between school and home. Of these, 43,021 through the sixth grade would lose their free rides, according to Gregory Kaladjian, director of the board's Bureau of Pupil Transportation. In addition, he said, 17,450 pupils through the sixth grade would lose their free rides on the city's mass transit system. They are among the 350,000 through 12th grade who now ride free or at reduced fares. Walking Distances Increased The proposed changes would require pupils through the second grade to live at least a mile from school to qualify for a free ride on private or mass transit. Such pupils are now eligible if they live half a mile from school. For pupils in Grades 3 through 6, the eligibility requirement would be raised from one mile to a mile and a half. Of those who would be affected, 6,047 live in Manhattan, 9,602 in the Bronx, 15,498 in Brooklyn, 19,983 in Queens and 9,341 on Staten Island. They represent 14 percent of the 440,000 pupils who now ride either free or at less than full fare. Sixty-eight percent of all children who qualify for transit assistance go to public schools and 32 percent to parochial schools. Pupils in Grades 7 through 12 would not be affected by the proposed changes because all live at least a mile and a half from school, said Robert Terte, a spokesman for the board. 90% of Cost Reimbursed The state reimburses the city for 90 percent of the transportation costs of pupils who have to travel a mile and a half or more to get to school. Mr. Terte said the Board of Education was seeking an agreement from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide half-fare privileges to the 60,471 younger students who would be forced off the private buses or denied free mass-transit rides. The M.T.A. is considering the request.If the board adopts the proposed changes, more than 240 of the 803 private buses that now provide free rides would be eliminated, Mr. Kaladjian said. He said the reductions would be permitted under a four-year contract, now in its final year, that 11 private bus companies have with the Board of Education. The $37 million deficit the board seeks to close grew out of a dispute between the city and the state over aid for handicapped students. The state contends the city overestimated the number of handicapped pupils it was serving. The board countered that it had increased ''mainstreaming,'' or placement of disabled children in regular classes, and, as a result, fewer handicapped pupils spent all day in classes with only other disabled pupils. Aid is based on the numbers enrolled in programs last year.

1372-> Israeli Government Approves New West Bank Settlements
The Government today approved the establishment of four new settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a spokesman for the Ministerial Committee on Settlements said. The sites are to the south of the heavily Arab-populated area of Hebron, said Shmuel Levine, a spokesman for Prof. Yuval Neeman, the acting chairman of the Government committee. Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Government has repeatedly rejected a request by President Reagan that it ''freeze'' settlement activity in the West Bank pending negotiations over future sovereignty in the area, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967. More than 100 Jewish settlements have been built in the territory.

1373-> A GREAT NOVEL'S JOURNEY TO FILM
It is a poignant irony that Werner Rainer Fassbinder's ''Berlin Alexanderplatz,'' which has been acclaimed by some critics as a masterwork, is the tale of a man who struggles to be honest and upright - a lusty struggle that brings him women, friendship, vitality - but who finally succumbs, first to an earthly satan and then to the banality of a petty job polishing rich men's limousines. Throughout his short, frenzied and astonishingly prolific life, the Wunderkind of the postwar German film was mesmerized by the figure of Franz Biberkopf, the proletarian protagonist of Alfred D"oblin's ''Berlin Alexanderplatz,'' a novel that enjoys a place in modern German letters akin to Joyce's ''Ulysses.'' Beginning with the director's earliest work, Biberkopf is a Fassbinder leitmotif. A 1969 film entitled ''Love is Colder Than Death'' is a cameo ''Berlin Alexanderplatz,'' in which Fassbinder himself plays an ex-convict named Franz who resists the efforts of the syndicate to involve him again in crime. Explicitly or otherwise, this theme of life and love as a power struggle runs through his films, culminating in the 15 1/2 hour ''Alexanderplatz,'' which first appeared on West German television in serial form in 1980. It will have its New York theater premiere in five installments at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema starting Wednesday Aug. 10 and ending Sept. 6. A year ago, Fassbinder's Biberkopf- like existence ended, too, in a banality: a bad, and clearly accidental, drug overdose. He was 36. ''Der Biberkopf,'' Fassbinder insisted more than once, ''das bin ich'' (''I am Biberkopf''). In this, the young filmmaker joined a respectable pantheon of German artists that has been powerfully swayed by D"oblin's 1929 novel. Bertolt Brecht said he ''profited enormously'' from D"oblin; Arthur Koestler said that the Berlin physician-turned-writer had taught him more than Tolstoy or Flaubert; G"unter Grass asked that in his case Mann, Brecht and Kafka should be put ''respectfully aside'' to make way for D"oblin. ''I am descended from that D"oblin,'' wrote Mr. Grass, ''who saw history as an absurd process.'' Fassbinder's link-up with D"oblin was felicitous. The novel itself is a cinematic rush of raucous street life, pubs, cabarets, jumbled with newspaper headlines, extracts from bureaucratic edicts, weather forecasts and the lyrics of popular songs. D"oblin's tone of voice is also Fassbinder's: mordant, maliciously funny and skeptical of party political engagement. Franz Biberkopf drifts easily from hawking copies of the Nazi newspaper, the V"olkischer Beobachter, to an underworld robbery, which costs him his right arm. Not that the Jewish-born D"oblin was apolitical. The day after the Reichstag was burned, he fled Germany, ultimately joining the distinguished colony of German exiles employed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Hollywood. At the end of the war, he returned to Germany as a reeducation officer in the French occupation zone, but found his homeland ''spiritually starved and hardly aware of it.'' He died in 1957, a convert to Roman Catholicism, never having won the Nobel Prize for Literature that many of his peers felt he deserved. Fassbinder had toyed with various forms for making his ''Alexanderplatz.'' (A 1931 version by Phil Jutzi is a German social-realist classic.) He pondered doing a long but condensed film, and even thought of shooting it simultaneously with two different casts, a German and an ''international'' one that could make the project a hit abroad. ''He got as far as drawing up lists for the two casts,'' recalls Harry Baer, who was one of Fassbinder's closest collaborators. But only television could come up with a big enough budget - $6.5 million - and so Fassbinder went the television route. He knew the novel so well that he had daubed his working copy with magic-marker colors to put D"oblin's nonsequential plot into chronological order. ''He had read it 14 or 15 times,'' says Juliane Lorenz, a film editor who lived with Fassbinder during the last three years of his life. ''He wrote the screenplay in three months. It was crazy. He had it all in his mind. For Rainer it was always a movie in 14 parts. For others it was a TV series.'' To play Biberkopf, Fassbinder picked G"unter Lamprecht, an actor who was born on Alexanderplatz in Berlin on Jan. 21, 1930. At first the strong-willed Mr. Lamprecht thought the novel was impossible to translate into film. ''I thought it was too hard,'' he recalled, over a cup of coffee in Cologne. But, after reading Fassbinder's screenplay, he changed his mind. ''I said, 'Let's do it, it's my beer.' '' Mr. Lamprecht, who put on 55 pounds to round himself into the personage of the beefy transport worker, clashed at the outset of the shooting with Fassbinder, a Bavarian, over nuances of the Berlin dialect that he felt belonged in the script. Mr. Lamprecht, the Berliner, prevailed. The 11 months of shooting went smoothly and, as usual, the fast, sure- handed Fassbinder finished ahead of schedule, rarely filming more than one take of a scene once he had it in his mind. ''He was the motor, he was the energy,'' said Peter M"arthesheimer, a producer and script- writer who worked on the film. ''If he had wanted to make a 500-hour film in 15 parts, he could have done it.'' Though Biberkopf had inspired, and haunted, Fassbinder for years, Mr. Lamprecht says they never talked about the director's conception of the man - a passionate, occasionally violent but ultimately innocent and gullible figure. ''I don't know what Rainer's interpretation was,'' confessed the actor. ''I must have just met it.'' But Fassbinder clearly saw Biberkopf's identity entwined with that of his stammering, satantic gangster friend Reinhold, played by Gottfried John. Fassbinder once wrote that together Biberkopf and Reinhold had ''nothing more or less than a pure love, not endangered by anything in society.'' As the film unfolds, Fassbinder's sympathy arguably tilts toward the evil Reinhold, and in an outrageous, allegorical epilogue - replete with nightmarish New Testament settings that turned the German Roman Catholic church against the film - Biberkopf capitulates to the gangster in a boxing ring, kissing him on the mouth. ''Somehow Rainer preferred Reinhold more,'' said Juliane Lorenz, ''because he is more anarchistic, because he could be evil without having a bad conscience. Biberkopf is really someone who fits into a social system.'' The first West German critics, who saw ''Alexanderplatz'' here in Munich in a prolonged sitting, praised it as a masterpiece. Edgy, Fassbinder, who was filming ''Lili Marleen,'' dropped by to chat with them and to glean their impressions. But, as serialization began on television, the tone of criticism changed completely. The right-wing Springer press led the attack, calling the series ''an orgy of violence, perversion and blasphemy'' whose ''enervating pissoir atmosphere'' and ''sleazy sex'' made it ''the most expensive and catastrophic failure'' in the history of West German television. Other more serious critics complained that Fassbinder's manneristic, Rembrandtesque use of light - the highlighting of faces and half- faces in darkened rooms - made ''Alexanderplatz'' simply difficult to see. Some D"oblin fans maintained that Fassbinder had drained the novel of its densely Berlinerisch atmosphere. Fassbinder confessed that ''through television a bit was lost, that is clear,'' acknowledging that, through no fault of their own, TV viewers were accustomed to a brighter, sunnier esthetic. Under a barrage of complaints from outraged parents, West Germany's first channel bumped ''Alexanderplatz'' from its prime-time 8:15 P.M. slot to 9:30 P.M., when German children are supposed to be asleep. The number of viewers plummeted as the 14-part series was shown, but passions ran high among stodgy West Germans. Mr. Lamprecht recounts that his 84-year-old mother bashed an equally elderly lady friend over the head with her umbrella after being told her actor son was ''a pig.'' Fassbinder was briefly accorded police protection because of anonymous threats. ''I think the readers of the Bild Zeitung recognized themselves in Biberkopf,'' said Harry Baer, speaking of the mass-circulation Springer tabloid. ''He is the good guy and the bad guy in the same person, and they wanted him only to be the good guy.'' But, says Mr. Baer, Fassbinder was not overly troubled by the popular criticism. ''He thought he had made a film, not a series. He knew that for television each segment should have been autonmous. But he didn't make it that way.'' It will be a further irony of Fassbinder's posthumous appreciation if the tardy arrival of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' in the United States now reconfirms the film's standing as his masterwork, forcing West Germans to reconsider it anew. For in his homeland it is not only the Springer press critics who have their doubts about Fassbinder. He still sits uneasily with the grudging barons of West German culture. ''The Germans only recognized he was a genius when America said he was a genius,'' said Mr. M"arthesheimer, the producer. ''The U.S.A. - and France - made him in the first place.'' Death snapped off a new and intriguing phase in Fassbinder's evolution, a deeply personal preoccupation with German history, which would have been an enrichment for a nation that still has not come to grips with its own past and whose youth at times seem to live in a willful state of antihistorical amnesia. His preoccupation was already foreshadowed in ''Lola,'' ''Lili Marleen,'' and, of course, ''Alexanderplatz.'' On June 10, 1982, Fassbinder had been full of excitement and plans. He had just spoken to Jane Fonda about playing the lead role in a film about Rosa Luxemburg. ''He was one of the few who wanted to make our German history and his history,'' said Juliane Lorenz, evoking his vision. ''For him, German history was not a burden. He was a patriot. It is ridiculous to say. He was a Bavarian, too. He loved Bavarian beer, Bavarian pretzels and Bavarian football. He never spoke of himself as an intellectual. He felt himself as a thinking worker.'' So alive with ideas was Fassbinder that when she saw him sprawled on the bed, she spoke to him for a half an hour before realizing he was dead.

1374-> OPERA: MOZART AND PURCELL
The hapless Opera Ensemble of New York unveiled John J.D. Sheehan's new production of Mozart's ''Bastien and Bastienne'' and Henry Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' during the Feb. 11 storm. But those who fought their way through the snow to the Lillie Blake School Theater were rewarded by an uneven but enjoyable production, which will run through next Sunday at the Lillie Blake School Theater, at 45 East 81st Street. ''Bastien and Bastienne,'' a thoroughly charming singspiel, dates from Mozart's 12th year. Within the course of its numerous duets and trios, the genesis of the great ensembles in ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and ''Don Giovanni'' can be traced. Opera Ensemble's performance began haltingly but soon picked up momentum under the firm yet flexible control of the music director, Ruth Bierhoff. Maureen Flynn, who played Bastienne, has a sweet voice and easy charm; despite an occasional tendency to blast high notes, she made a fresh and appealing heroine. Her Bastien, Frank Kelley, is a convincing actor with a small but elegant tenor voice, and Charles Samuel Brown was well cast as the earthy and sophisticated Colas. ''Dido and Aeneas'' was a more elaborate production, and not so well cast. Rebecca Mercer-White's Dido was sympathetic, but she often swallowed her words, and her voice does not yet have the weight and maturity required for the role of the doomed queen. Stephen Marquart, as Aeneas, showed off a heroic tenor voice to good effect but has the unfortunate tendency to bluster. Although some of the secondary characters were ill-chosen, the chorus was excellent: every word perfectly clear, its singing centered and strong. The eccentric staging featured some scurrying characters clad in black and red, miming a sarcastic sexual commentary on the action. Their shenanigans were out of place in this high tragedy. Tim Page

1375-> A BIG DAY FOR A BIG, FESTIVE PICNIC
It looked like the biggest picnic ever thrown in America. The hours before Super Bowl XVII were festive, noisy and colorful, under a bright blue sky and with the San Gabriel Mountains as a backdrop. The Rose Bowl is in an open area surrounded by hundreds of acres of park-like grounds, so outdoors-oriented Californians, and the thousands of visitors, strolled on the outside or worked hard at playing. There were Frisbee games and softball catches, alfresco dining and exhortations by religious groups. It was a huge tailgate party without tailgates. The police arrested several people, including a group of young men hauled off on pocket-picking charges. People walked and munched on $1.25 churros, described as Mexican doughnuts, or on nachos, corn chips covered with cheese and dotted with a fiery pepper. The field, a lush green, has been pampered since Jan.1 by George Toma, who is on loan to the league from Kansas City, where he is the groundskeeper for Arrowhead Stadium. If there is such a title, Toma is the Official Groundskeeper of Super Bowl XVII. Despite the recent heavy rains, the field looked perfect, except for some light spots in one of the end zones. When there hasn't been rain and the grass is not soft, thousands of cars are normally parked at an adjacent golf course. But according to Lieut. Bob Strosser of the Pasadena police, the cars would have torn up the course. So the police rerouted the cars. For security and emergency services, 109 local police officers were augmented by 58 members of the California Highway Patrol. There also were 400 private security guards, 35 paramedics, and five firemen. The Rose Bowl does not have a television screen for fans, but instant replay has become a fact of life even for fans at games in recent years. So the league signed a deal with Diamond Vision to bring a giant portable screen to the saucer-shaped arena. Diamond Vision was not named because it is a creation for baseball. It was developed by Mitsubishi Industries of Japan - whose symbol is three diamonds. Fans in the stadium saw a specially prepared three-hour pregame show on the screen, which measures 20 feet by 30 feet. Pressed for funds, and symbolic of the toll the strike took, the National Football League Players Association sent only two officials to the sport's biggest week. In past years, the association was the host to a cocktail party. Ed Garvey, the executive director, was not among those present, nor were player representatives. Frank Woschitz, the union's director of public relations, explained that union funds had been curtailed. ''Anyway, the league didn't even throw its annual party this year,'' he said, ''so we decided not to have one either.'' He was joined by his assistant, Jay Benoit. The league, however, appeared to have some money left over. The teams each received the equivalent of 80 first-class round-trip fares between their cities and Los Angeles. Also, the winning team received $1,248,000 to cover its other expenses, but not including salaries. The losing team received $924,000. But these awards were just for the teams. The players shared in a separate pool, which doubles their playoff money as a result of the recent collective bargaining agreement. Each performer on the winning team was to get $36,000, for a total playoff package of $70,000. The losing players each earned $18,000, or a total of $52,000 for the four playoff games. In addition, the league pays up to $2,400 for each Super Bowl ring. It allows the winning team to buy 80 rings, and the club may pay as much as it wants for the rings, making up the difference itself. Even the losers are allowed to have jewelry at league expense. The league will pay a maximum of $1,200 each for 80 rings or watches or any other adornments the team selects. Perhaps the most American party took place under a candy-striped tent, where more than 800 people in red jackets enjoyed a barbecue. A Dixieland band played, its performers wearing straw boaters. There was fried chicken and beer. The sponsor? Nissan Motor Company of Japan.

1376-> West German G.N.P.
The West German gross national product will grow next year by a maximum of 2 percent in real terms and probably less, the Rhine-Westphalia Economic Research Institute said today. The institute, one of West Germany's five leading economic research bodies, forecast in a report that unemployment next year would average around 2.5 million. In July the number of jobless rose to 2.2 million, from 2.1 million in June. The Economics Ministry last month forecast real G.N.P. growth of 2.5 percent in 1984.

1377-> World Airways Loss Narrows
World Airways said today that its second-quarter loss narrowed to $9.5 million from $15.5 million the year before. Operating revenue fell 16 percent, to $62.6 million from $74.2 million, and operating expenses were cut 19 percent, to $63.6 million from $78.5 million. For the first half, the loss narrowed to $25.3 million from $31.2 million in the 1982 period. Brian Cooke, the airline's president, said the narrower losses reflect the company's efforts to cut costs and revamp its routes. ''We anticipate further improvement in results during the second half,''

1378-> 8 NEWSMEN IN PERU, MISTAKEN FOR REBELS, ARE SLAIN IN AMBUSH
Eight Peruvian journalists were ambushed and killed by a band of Andean peasants who mistook them for leftist guerrillas, the military command announced today. The command said police and army patrols had unearthed the bodies of all eight journalists who were killed last week in the village of Uchuraccay, about 220 miles southeast of Lima. President Fernando Belaunde Terry called for a minute of silence at his weekly news conference today for the slain journalists. He said the peasants apparently thought they were about to be attacked themselves. The bodies were flown to Ayacucho, 50 miles from Uchuraccay, in air force helicopters. Witnesses said the bodies showed deep cuts to the head and abdomen. The journalists had gone to the region to check reports that peasants had rebelled against leftist Shining Path guerrillas who control much of the area. Peasant farmers in the region reportedly killed seven guerrillas last week with clubs and machetes when the rebels tried to raid their village. The military said in a communique that the peasants apparently believed the reporters were rebels returning to avenge the deaths of their comrades. Though they deplored the killings, authorities said the attack indicated a popular rejection of the guerrillas. ''It is probable the community thought it was going to be attacked, and it reacted in form of rejection,'' said President Belaunde, who put nine provinces under military control in December in a campaign to wipe out the Shining Path guerrillas. He called the incident a ''tragic misunderstanding.'' In sports stadiums across Peru, one-minute silent homages were held for the slain journalists. One of those killed, Jorge Luis Mendivil, a photographer for the daily Observador, had joked with colleagues about the chances of dying before he left on the trip. He gave a colleague a photograph of himself. The colleague said Mr. Mendevil had told him, ''This is for you to publish on your front page if I die.'' Search Started Thursday When the eight journalists failed to return to Ayacucho last Thursday, two air force helicopters and several police patrols began searching for them. On Saturday the peasants turned over the bodies of Mr. Mendivil and Pedro Sanchez Gavidia, a reporter for Diario de Marka. Also in the group were Jorge Sedano of La Republica, Amador Garcia Yanqui of Oiga magazine, Oscar Willy Retto of El Observador, Eduardo de la Pinela of Diario de Marka and two reporters from Ayacucho, Felix Gavilan and Antonio Ifantes.

1379-> NEW JERSEY JOURNAL
SPRUCING up the state's image has been one of Governor Kean's pet themes. For starters, his administration junked ''New Jersey's Got It,'' the slogan trumpeted by Brendan T. Byrne's administration. ''Too many negative connotations,'' said Victoria Schmidt, director of the state's Division of Travel and Tourism. '' 'New Jersey's Got It' has had it. It had a dual meaning.'' The slogan, it turns out, generated hundreds of complaints from residents about all of the state's renowned ills: mosquitoes, swamps, air pollution, crooked politicians and the industrial potpourri along the northern end of the turnpike. For some months now, Mrs. Schmidt says, the Kean administration has been trying to come up with a new slogan that conjures up only positive thoughts and images. Simpler said than done. Bozell & Jacobs of Union, an international advertising agency, was hired to find a new slogan. It suggested two: ''New Jersey And You: Perfect Together,'' and ''New Jersey Will Win Your Heart Away.'' Neither was very inspiring to Bill Watson, a 32-year-old reporter who heads the Cape May bureau of The Atlantic City Press. In his weekly column a month ago, he wrote off the two proposals as ''pretty pathetic'' and appealed to readers to send in some ideas. Slogans poured in from around the state. Among them: ''Follow Your Dream in New Jersey,'' ''New Jersey, Come Play in Our Garden,'' ''New Jersey for Shore,'' ''New Jersey: Shore Enough,'' ''New Jersey - A Lovely Surprise,'' ''Cream of the Crop - New Jersey'' and ''New Jersey: A Delightful State of Affairs.'' Mr. Watson's favorite was sent in by Mary Boyce of the Cape May County community of Del Haven. It contained only the word ENJOY, with the silhouette of a heart drawn around the letters NJ. Two Republican state legislators, Senator James R. Hurley of Millville and Assemblyman Guy F. Muziani of North Wildwood, brought Mr. Watson's write-in campaign to the Governor's attention. Two weeks ago, he was invited to bring all the suggested slogans to Mr. Kean's office. Mr. Watson presented 193 in all, and put in a plug for Mrs. Boyce's heartfelt ENJOY. ''The Governor said he really liked it,'' Mr. Watson said. State officials say they are grateful for all the suggestions, but they also have been taken slightly aback. Bozell & Jacobs, after all, holds the state contract to come up with the slogan and mold a spring and summer advertising campaign around it. What's to become of all the suggestions? Mrs. Schmidt's staff and Bozell & Jacobs will select the best from them, and then spend the rest of February sampling public opinion on those choices. Mrs. Boyce's offering will be among those gauged in this ''test-marketing,'' as the opinion-gathering campaign is called. As for Bozell & Jacobs's two early entries, Mrs. Schmidt says: ''More than likely, they'll be included, but I can't say for sure yet.'' Every day, at just about sundown, the starlings come home to roost in downtown Dover. ''They look like a swarm of bees,'' said Donald Costanzo, the Morris County community's Health Officer. ''There's hundreds of them, maybe a couple thousand.'' Needless to say, merchants, shoppers and residents hate the sound and sight of the screeching, swirling birds as they settle in for the night in the architectural nooks and crannies atop the 19th-century buildings in the commercial district. There is also concern that their droppings will create a health hazard and corrode the metal ornamentation on the buildings. Mr. Costanzo's task is to get rid of the starlings. For now, he is stumped. Shortly after Christmas, he blared some bird distress calls over loudspeakers that had been used to amplify carols over the holidays. ''The sounds were eerie and futuristic,'' Mr. Costanzo recalled. ''They agitated the birds, but they just flew around the corner. They didn't leave.'' After this first attack failed, people started sending in suggestions for new campaigns. One was to dive-bomb the birds with radio-controlled model planes. Mr. Costanzo dismissed that, saying: ''All we have to do is have one of these planes go out of control and fly into somebody.'' Spreading poisoned grain around was another idea. That was rejected for fear that other birds would eat it and die. Spraying the starlings with high-pressure water hoses was another notion. It, too, was rejected. The water could break windows and flood buildings. ''Somebody said we should hire a falconer,'' Mr. Costanzo said. ''He would let his falcon dive at them and kill a couple. After a while, the others would get the message and leave. That might be a good idea.'' Mr. Costanzo is also considering stretching strips of steel with closely bunched, four-inch stainless-steel barbs near rooftop nesting areas. But no one has come up yet with a way to pay for this. ''There are no easy solutions,'' he said. ''These starlings are clever and determined. There's so many of them that it's easy for us to just give up.'' The year 1982 was a banner one for Waterloo Village in Stanhope. The historical restoration and cultural center attracted 104,818 guests, about 30 percent above its 1981 attendance. ''That's really quite impressive to us, when you consider that most operations with some parallel to ours were down in attendance,'' said David Zenker, executive director of the Waterloo Foundation for the Arts, the nonprofit corporation that operates the village. ''What excites us the most is that we're not in an urban center. People had to travel some distance to get here.'' The growing popularity of the Sussex County ''village'' has generated considerable enthusiasm among foundation officials and sparked a major $65 million expansion program to broaden its attractions. Waterloo Village was conceived nearly 25 years ago on the 440-acre site of a pre-Revolutionary War forge. The idea was to recreate the social history and economic life style prevalant from 1750 to 1850. Buildings were renovated to reflect the period and its day-to-day chores, such as broom-making, pottery-making, glass blowing, weaving and other such crafts. Recently, the village's role has been broadened. Major summertime offerings now include dance and a variety of music, including opera, orchestral, bluegrass, jazz and country and western. ''We're becoming more than just an historic site,'' Mr. Zenker said. ''We're becoming a major cultural center for the metropolitan area. We want to become a blend of historic Williamsburg and Tanglewood.'' In hopes of creating a summer home for a major symphony or opera, Waterloo Village plans to build a $20 million amphitheater, starting next year. It would have 4,000 enclosed seats and lawn seating for 5,000 more. Also on the drawing boards are the construction of a $30 million conference center and $5 million in additional historic displays, including restoration of the old forge and repair of the locks on the nearby Morris Canal, once the major economic and transportation artery of North Jersey. Ever since she was in first grade, 11-year-old Ruth Chang has dutifully practiced her spelling with her mother, Helen, a teacher, at their home in Princeton Junction. The words she is drilled on are not all the ordinary ones facing schoolchildren. ''My mother has a list of words starting from third grade, and it goes up to the college level,'' Ruth said. ''She has about 120 words for each grade level. Sometimes I miss some, but I get a lot of them.'' Ruth's five years of hard work paid off in Trenton last month, when she won a statewide spelling bee held in conjunction with New Jersey's Farmers Week. She defeated 22 other children from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades, and her prizes were a $50 savings bond, a plaque and a plaque for her school, Dutch Neck School in Princeton Junction. Ruth got off to a rocky start in the bee. During the warm-up period, she misspelled subsidy. But once competition started, she did fine, spelling, among other words, cuisine and procreate. Ruth won the championship when two other finalists eliminated themselves with mistakes. The third-place finisher, Mike Thornton, an eighth-grader from Gillette, misspelled receptacle, and the second-place finisher, April Swieconek, an eighth-grader from Holland Township, could not spell hawser. Both also won $50 bonds. Ruth's mother is not her only spelling taskmaster. At school, she and all other pupils receive two grades on all written tests and reports, whether in English, science, social studies or history. One mark is for content and concept and the other is for spelling, capitalization, paragraphing, sentence structure and other elements of language arts. ''It's just a matter of requiring quality work,'' said Ruth's teacher, Marilyn Roessler.

1380-> POLL SHOWS LESSENING OF FEAR THAT U.S. MILITARY IS LAGGING
The Reagan Administration has begun a costly program to build more Trident submarines. Page 17. By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT A recent sampling of national public opinion suggests a growing number of Americans no longer fear that the United States is lagging behind the Soviet Union in military prowess and feel the Reagan Administration is spending too much money on sophisticated new weapons systems. In his proposed budget for the 1984 fiscal year, presented last week, President Reagan asked Congress for a 14 percent increase in military spending, and at the same time sought a freeze on spending for domestic programs. The Reagan Administration says the increase is necessary to counter a Soviet advantage in military power. But according to interviews conducted with a wide variety of political and community leaders across the nation, and supported by data in a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, the weight of public opinion favors less rather than more spending on military programs. In large part, the tendency appears to reflect heightened public concern over the state of the national economy, including ballooning Federal budget deficits and the highest levels of unemployment since World War II. ''We have to have a strong defense,'' said Donald J. Canney, the Mayor of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a veteran of the Korean War. ''But given the economic mess we're in, the defense system has to suffer its cuts along with everything else.'' In the public-opinion poll, taken last month, 48 percent of those surveyed said they believed the United States was spending too much on new weapons, compared with 25 percent who said spending levels were about right. Only 11 percent said more money should be spent on new weapons systems. At the same time, there appears to be a growing belief that the military standing of the United States, versus the Soviet Union, has improved. When asked whether the United States was militarily superior, equal in strength or not as strong as the Soviet Union, 32 percent of those surveyed said they felt the United States trailed the Soviet Union, as against 44 percent of those asked the same question a year ago. Nearly half of those surveyed last month said they thought the United States and the Soviet Union were roughly equal in military strength, despite Mr. Reagan's contention that the United States is still trailing. ''In 1980, the guy who used to stand up and demand more money for defense was the same person who demanded a balanced budget,'' said Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democratic of Washington. ''Now that same guy is looking at a $200 billion deficit. Believe me, that has to affect the way he feels about defense spending.'' Mr. Dicks is among several members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, who say that given current levels of unemployment and the looming Federal budget deficits, the Reagan Administration is, in Mr. Dicks's words, ''trying to go too far too fast on defense spending.'' A Change in Concerns ''In 1980, when Mr. Reagan was elected, a lot of people in my district screamed that we had to spend more money on defense,'' said Mr. Dicks, who has traditionally been a strong backer of military spending. Within his Tacoma area district are several military installations, including Fort Lewis, a United States Army training base and McChord Air Force Base and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Nearly one-third of all jobs in the Tacoma area are tied to dollars spent on defense. ''But last fall there was none of that concern,'' Mr. Dicks went on. ''Now people want to stretch out the defense budget.'' Mr. Dicks, along with Representative Joseph P. Addabbo, Democrat of Queens, successfully co-sponsored a resolution in the House of Representatives in December that deleted $988 million in funding for the MX missile. When asked in last month's survey to choose among several alternatives for trimming the budget deficit, including tax increases, elimination of the cut in Federal income taxes scheduled for this summer or reductions in Social Security or spending programs for the poor, 63 percent of those polled - the largest single group - said they would rather reduce proposed military spending. Asked a similar question a year ago, 48 percent said they were willing to accept cuts in military programs. Says Consensus Has Eroded Representative Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, a conservative who represents the Fourth Congressional District in the northeast part of the state, said the consensus for increased military spending that helped elect Mr. Reagan in 1980 had substantially eroded in the last two years. ''There is a perception that throwing money at defense problems in the 1980's works no better than throwing money at social problems in the 1960's and 70's,'' said Mr. Coats, who added that he felt the Reagan Administration could do much more to trim what he called waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon. ''Coupled with unemployment and the growing Federal budget deficit,'' Mr. Coats said, ''that consensus has started to give way. It has changed from support to skepticism.'' Mr. Coats was among 50 Republicans who joined Democrats last December in the House to limit financing for the MX missile. The Reagan Administration opposed the move and lobbied hard to defeat it. ''It was not easy to vote against the President,'' Mr. Coats said. ''Mr. Reagan is very popular in this district. But I feel, and I think most people in the district feel, that we have to do something to stop the blank-check mentality in the Defense Department.'' Mr. Coats's district, like many in the Middle West, has suffered disproportionately as a result of the recession. Unemployment in Fort Wayne, the district's largest city, is more than 13 percent. International Harvester, the farm machinery company that was once the city's largest employer, has laid off more than 5,000 workers in the last two years and closed down its manufacturing operations in the city. Why Haven't They Attacked? ''If we're as far behind as the President says, why haven't the Russians attacked us already?'' said Dick Merren, an officer of Local 57 of the United Auto Workers in Fort Wayne. ''We don't need to buy more weapons. We have to do something about human suffering.'' In the poll, 48 percent of those surveyed said they thought the United States was spending too much on new weapons, as against 25 percent who said current spending levels were about right. In voting to delete the $988 million in funding for the MX, Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr., Democrat of Kentucky, summed up public opinion in his district by saying, ''Right or wrong, the words 'Here come the Russians' don't scare Kentuckians as much as 'Here come the creditors.' '' Public officials and a variety of community, business and labor leaders across the country seem to agree that, in the public mind, the state of the nation's military has taken a back seat to the economy as the dominant issue in setting spending priorities. When asked to choose the most important problem facing the country from among seven issues, 6 percent said it was improving United States military strength. Unemployment, Government spending, inflation and Social Security all were rated more important. Soviet 'Not to Be Trusted' ''Most people still regard the Soviet Union as a threat not to be trusted,'' said Pat Murphy, editor of The Arizona Republic in Phoenix. He said many in Arizona believed the Soviet Union held the upper hand militarily. ''But they also believe defense has not taken its licks along with domestic needs,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''They think the pain has got to be spread around.'' There also appears to be the belief that a nationwide movement among a variety of organizations, including the Roman Catholic Church, to limit the further deployment of nuclear weapons has had an impact on public thinking. Nuclear freeze iniatives were passed last fall by voters in eight states. ''I don't see widespread agreement in the archdiocese for a nuclear freeze,'' said the Rev. William E. McManus, the Bishop of Fort Wayne and nearby South Bend. ''The economy is still the main topic around here. But compared to two years ago, now you hear a lot of people questioning whether we need more weapons or more nuclear bombs.'' Bishop McManus said a statement that he issued expressing concern about the growth of nuclear weapons inventories generated more mail than his decision last year to ban bingo in the archdiocese. 'Fairly New' Feeling Rabbi Balfour Brickner of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in Queens said he believed that a growing number of people felt the United States was not seriously threatened by Moscow. ''I think this is fairly new,'' he said, ''particularly in the last two years as this country has seen that it cannot have both guns and butter at the same time.'' Clyde Hupp, an officer of the Pierce County Central Labor Council in Tacoma, said he thought Americans felt more secure than they did in 1980, when American hostages were still in Iran. ''Since then,'' he said, ''the Soviets have proved in Afghanistan they are not invulnerable. And second, the conflict in Lebanon proved that our weapons and technology, used by Israel, were far superior to the Russian armament used by the Arabs.'' The poll also showed that even among those who say they feel the United States is trailing the Soviet Union in military strength, nearly half said they were still willing to reduced proposed spending on military programs. The poll also showed that fewer people now approved of Mr. Reagan's handling of the Soviet Union than at any time during his Administration. In September 1981, 62 percent of those surveyed said they approved of his dealings with Moscow. Last month, 45 percent said they approved.

1381-> MUSIC VIEW; HOW MUCH DO THE WORDS REALLY MATTER IN OPERA?
Let's be honest about this. I think it should not be denied that there are many people who enjoy going to the opera but cannot bring themselves to care what, exactly, the characters are up to. These blissful folk could enjoy, say, ''Tristan und Isolde'' almost as much if the words were eliminated. After all, the antiword argument runs, once you know even vaguely what the ''Liebestod'' is about, Wagner's orchestral music spells out the real emotional meanings of Isolde's final scene more effectively than any words could. True enough, as far as it goes, but that is an old, impoverished view of opera, now happily losing ground. I suppose there could be a spectator who enjoyed attending tennis matches blindfolded, simply to relish hearing the ball being thwacked back and forth, but that lover of sheer sound might miss a lot, too. How important is it to understand librettos in depth? After all, nobody who cares about opera really contests the old saying, ''Prima la musica, e poi le parole.'' Composers such as Salieri and Strauss have written whole operas that debate the question's nuances, but by definition, the primacy of notes over words is all that distinguishes an opera from a play with incidental music. That settles that, you might say. And yet, apparently sensible people still lock in bitter debate over such issues as whether opera should be given in the original language or in translation. Why? Well, partly because for the completely educated operagoer, the music and the original words eventually become so fused that they seem aspects of one unsplittable whole. This fine-tuned sort of listener is appalled by translations, stoutly insisting that when Riccardo's ''E scherzo od e follia'' comes out as ''It's a joke or it's a folly,'' the Verdi music itself has been distorted. Even in those instances where composers have used the same music for texts in two languages, the argument cannot be dismissed: Verdi's original French version of ''Don Carlo'' had to be revised extensively when he turned it into an Italian opera. Nevertheless, while granting that the antitranslation camp may be right in the abstract, an increasing number of operagoers seem to want to follow the ins and outs of the action in greater detail and subtlety than is usually possible in a language not their own. It is entirely possible, for instance, for a visitor to Italy to get along in the metalanguage known as ''opera Italian.'' The waiter will respond, though perhaps quizzically, if you tell him, ''Prima la zuppa, e poi le pesce,'' or if you mutter ''Maledetta!'' when he spills the zuppa down your neck. But opera Italian only goes so far, even in the opera house. For those whom the opera bug bites, merely getting the drift is no longer enough. Nor, it must be said, is advance study of the libretto, unless you happen to be gifted with total verbal and musical recall. And not every opera lover spends his evenings browsing through librettos, let alone memorizing them. On any night at the Metropolitan or the New York City Opera you will see half the people in the audience hurriedly trying to digest the synopsis while the lights are going down. No matter that it is only one more go-around with Mimi, Rodolfo and the other single swingers down at the Cafe Momus, many if not most operagoers somehow find the plot's subtleties difficult to keep in mind. Even if the operagoer is a multilinguist, he probably is more at home in one of his languages than the others. That is why I have been in favor for many years of the double repertory, with certain operas given alternately in the original and in English, as has been done at the City Opera for years and at the Seattle Opera lately in its German-English productions of Wagner's ''Ring.'' No matter how conscientiously the libretto has been studied or how well-worn the opera, almost any operagoer will find the original version taking on new shades of meaning after exposure to a performance in a good native-tongue translation. Fresh and complex relationships among familiar characters may be uncovered, not only by the listeners but by young singers, who often have worked so hard and so long at getting the notes right that they have not had time to think much about the words. Other than the double repertory, which can be unwieldy and expensive, isn't there any other effective way to put the average audience in touch with an opera's nuances? Perhaps we are seeing it already in the better productions of television operas. I have talked to or heard from many people who watched the Bayreuth ''Das Rheingold'' the other dvening and were amazed to discover themselves becoming actually interested in the dialogues among Wagner's giants and dwarfs and river maidens. This change of focus certainly owed something to the notorious quirkiness of Patrice Chereau's production, but a major factor was the shrewd subtitling, which actually made Wagner's dogtrotting verses seem psychologically penetrating. In fact, thanks to those subtitles, I doubt that any non-German audience has ever been put in closer touch with the ''Rheingold'' story. Speaking of televised opera, I have been impressed with the Metropolitan Opera's overall improvement in this hybrid genre, and especially with its handling of the subtitles provided by Sonya Friedman. The recent ''Idomeneo'' performance was state-of-the-art in this respect. The subtitle line spelled out the Italian libretto in detail when necessary but vanished when the words and phrases turned repetitious. It was like a good friend in an emergency: there to lean on when needed, but otherwise discreetly out of the way. Even for those who understand Italian like a native, of course, the sounds emitted at most opera performances can be mystifying at times. The presence of the English was particularly telling in the touching scenes with Idomeneo (Luciano Pavarotti) and his son Idamante (Frederica von Stade), when the emotional byplay was being carried on at many levels. The subtitles worked to similar effect in the exit scene of Elettra (Hildegard Behrens), which she strung out to dangerous lengths by singing not only her final aria (''D'Oreste, d'Aiace'') but the fiery recitative (''Oh smania! oh furie!'') that Mozart substituted in a later version. Knowing in detail why Elettra was acting like a madwoman at this point kept the extended scene from seeming no more than a soprano's vocal showpiece. Opera on television will probably always be a little disorienting for anyone who regularly attends life-size performances. The cameras choose what you can watch and the microphones decide, to a great extent, how you will listen. When a production is terribly complex, television must simplify it or resort to continual panning and zooming to give any sense of visual proportion. I have often been annoyed, too, at being brought in close to examine a soprano's uvula while she strains for a high note or at being yanked to the rear of the house to admire a long shot of the scenery just as I was getting interested in a tight shot of the chorus. All of these problems and many others, however, were minimized in the Metropolitan's ''Idomeneo'' and I attribute that in some measure to the crafty use of subtitles. I am sure it occurred to many viewers to wonder whether some such system of subtitling or instantaneous translation might work in the opera house, if only for special occasions such as the introduction of a rare work. In fact, there is a fascinating history of such experiments, including performances in Japan in which a running synopsis has been carried on screens at either side of the stage. The most recent effort at audience enlightenment took place in Toronto, where the Canadian Opera Company this season presented Richard Strauss's ''Elektra'' in German with English ''surtitles,'' so called because the words of Hugo von Hoffmannsthal's libretto were projected on a screen above the proscenium, using a system worked out by the same Sonya Friedman who does the Metropolitan's subtitling. If the idea works, the Toronto company says, the ''surtitle'' idea will be used in future productions. Lift up thine eyes, O opera lovers. Help for the befuddled may be near.

1382-> POLL FINDS PUBLIC IS CONFUSED ON EVACUATION PLAN
IT was after last year's mock emergency at the Indian Point 3 nuclear plant, Lieut. Gov. Alfred B. DelBello recalled last week, that Daniel P. Guido, the county's Public Safety Commissioner, ''said he thought there would be a spontaneous response in the event of an emergency'' at the Indian Point nuclear plants. A ''spontaneous response,'' with residents of the 10-mile zone around the plants in Buchanan acting on their own, could lead to confusion, at best, according to local officials. Last week, a poll of Westchester residents indicated that such a situation probably would occur in the event of an emergency. Conducted for the Board of Legislators by Roger Seasonwein Associates of New Rochelle, the poll found that 47 percent of those questioned remembered receiving a booklet describing how to respond and 89 percent knew that a siren meant that radiation had been released and an emergency had occurred. But only 31 percent knew that predesignated automobile routes had been established, while 41 percent of those questioned, once informed that such routes existed, said they would use them. A total of 56 percent would leave the best way they could and another 3 percent said they did not know what they would do. The ''don't know'' category soared to 92 percent when residents were asked if they knew which reception center their child would be taken to and 86 percent still answered ''don't know'' when they were asked, after an explanation was offered, whether they would leave the child or retrieve him or her directly. Mr. Seasonwein, who conducted the poll for free, said he interpreted the extraordinary level of ''don't know'' responses in those questions as noncompliance. ''As I read the data,'' he said, ''you have a feasible evacuation plan if people are told to stay indoors, but not if they were told to evacuate -then you simply have chaos.'' The seemingly high levels of confusion and noncompliance came as no surprise to officials responsible for the emergency plan. Mr. DelBello, a former County Executive who now has a statewide role in nuclear-emergency preparedness, said, ''The poll is right in line with what we thought. ''We never said the emergency-response plan was impossible, but that the way they were doing it was inadequate For an emergency plan to work, every individual has to know what to do when the sirens go off - and we have to know how to deal with an evacuation.'' Marianne Jackson, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which reviews such emergency plans, said, ''The whole area of public education was identified as a problem in last year's exercise,'' a reference to the drill on March 3, when a simulated release of radioactivity was reported at the No. 3 plant, operated by the Power Authority of the State of New York. The public was not tested, although sirens went off - in some cases - and test messages were broadcast over WABC and local radio stations. That will most likely be the case for the next test, scheduled for March 9. The mock emergency then will be at the No. 2 plant, operated by the Consolidated Edison Company. But if the public is to play a passive role in the March 9 test, it should nevertheless be better informed, according to officials preparing for it, who say they have been working on improvements for some time. New booklets explaining what to do are being drawn up by Con Edison and Pasny, to be redistributed ''to all utility customers within the emergency zone,'' according to Dan Walden, a Con Edison spokesman, ''and hand-delivered to those with master meters,'' generally apartment dwellers. He said it was the distribution system used last time ''and as far as we know it was adequate.'' The booklet, according to county officials, is being redesigned to appear more compelling and less like the typical literature received by utility customers with their electric bills. One official said the cover would contain drawings depicting the procedures to be followed when the sirens sound. Miss Jackson said the new test would include a ''rumor-control center,'' where information reported by news organizations or picked up by emergency workers is fed back into the system for possible correction and redistribution. She said that the information disseminated in the days and weeks before the test also would be increased. The Seasonwein poll was begun last summer, according to John E. Hand, a Republican legislator from Yorktown Heights who is the new chairman of the Board's Legislation Committee. ''We sent requests to three polling companies, and I think one of them indicated it would cost $10,000, but Seasonwein said they'd do it gratis.'' Mr. Seasonwein said that 100 residents were polled within the 10-mile zone and 400 throughout the remainder of Westchester. The results, according to Mr. Hand, were surprisingly similar. For example, 45 percent inside the zone thought the plants were basically safe and 47 percent thought they were unsafe; outside the zone the figures were 45 percent safe and 41 percent unsafe, the rest in both areas saying they did not know. A meltdown rather than an explosion was seen as the greater risk both within the zone (69 percent) and in the rest of the county (62 percent). A relatively small number - 18 percent inside the zone and 16 percent outside -thought it ''could explode''; the rest were unsure. The pollsters, using telephones, asked residents: ''Do you favor allowing the nuclear-power plants at Indian Point to operate, or do you think they should be shut down?'' The answers, before arguments were given on both sides, were 44 percent to keep operating and 45 percent to shut down from respondents inside the zone while the respective figures were 50 percent in favor and 34 percent against outside the zone. Figures did not seem to change much except to reduce the number of ''don't knows'' after arguments on both sides were provided. Those inside the zone split evenly, with 46.5 percent on each side, while those outside were 53 percent in favor and 39 percent opposed. The arguments, Mr. Seasonwine said, were formulated by advocates of each side. The 44-question poll, conducted the first week of December, indicated that those who supported the plants were influenced by eonomic factors or, as Mr. Seasonwein put it, ''People in Westchester accept the presence of nuclear plants because they are willing to trade off what are perceived to be health risks for economic benefits.'' Asked if closing the plants would mean a rise in the county's electric rates, 77 percent of those inside the zone answered yes, as did 65 percent outside. Twenty-six to 27 percent thought rates would rise 20 percent and 17 to 19 percent said rates would increase 10 percent. Nearly half, or 49 percent of those polled, said they thought it was a ''strong argument'' that the two nuclear plants operating at Indian Point were providing a ''significant amount of power needed by New Yorkers for jobs, schools'' and government agencies, while 38 percent said that that was a ''weak argument.'' A majority rejected oil savings as a factor, with 30 percent saying it was a strong argument and 46 percent describing it as weak. They were not impressed that malfunctions had ''never led to a significant release of radiation beyond the plant boundary'' and were only slightly favorably inclined to learn that the plants were designed to prevent large radioactive releases. Most respondents both inside and outside the zone rejected, by heavy margins, the following arguments in favor of closing the plants: that energy requirements have declined, that the plants do almost nothing to reduce the use of foreign oil and that lack of injuries is just luck. But there was heavy support, both inside and outside the zone, for these arguments in favor of closing: that scientists have not solved the problem of how to safely store or dispose of radioactive waste, with Westchester having accumulated a stockpile of it and that evacuation would be impossible in the county, the most populated area of any nuclear plant in the country.

1383-> WEAK CASE FOR CURBING BANKRUPTCY RELIEF
To the Editor: The credit industry's claim that the new General Accounting Office study supports its drive to limit the availability of bankruptcy relief is unfounded. As indicated in Tamar Lewin's Aug. 9 article, ''Lively Debate on Bankruptcy,'' some debtors who filed for ''straight'' Chapter 7 discharges had income, asset and debt levels similar to debtors who filed Chapter 13 repayment plans. But this tells only half of the story. The G.A.O. had no access to data on the living expenses, family sizes and other personal circumstances of Chapter 7 debtors. Therefore, no conclusions were or could be drawn as to whether any number of these debtors had funds available to pay their debts. The only ''study'' to consider whether people are discharging debts that they can actually repay was funded by the credit industry and assumed that debtors would live at the poverty level for three to five years. Thus, the creditors' case remains unsubstantiated. The legislation the credit industry is now pushing in Congress, H.R. 1800, would not be limited in application to the occasional instances of clear abuse, which the industry is quick to publicize; it would jeopardize the availability of relief to all debtors, including the large group of working poor. The industry is unwilling to go along with more modest changes that would target only upper- and middle-income debtors. Moreover, H.R. 1800 would rescind many additional reforms enacted in 1978, thereby encouraging a return to creditor abuses directed toward the least sophisticated debtor. For example, the bill would eliminate the requirement that the court approve any agreement a debtor makes to repay a debt that otherwise would be discharged. Before 1979, such agreements effectively denied many debtors the ''fresh start'' that is the purpose of Chapter 7 relief. The credit industry bill goes far beyond the scope of any ''study'' the industry relies on for support. Instead, the industry is using the results of the bad economy as an excuse for getting amendments that Congress has wisely rejected in the past. LOUISE S. GREENFIELD, Staff Attorney, Congress Watch, Washington, Aug. 10, 1983

1384-> WHAT'S NEW IN THE BUSINESS OF LAW; GROWING FAST AT FINLEY KUMBLE
The fastest-growing law firm in the country is Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg & Casey, a New York-based firm that was organized in 1968 and now has about 270 lawyers. Since 1979, Finley Kumble has expanded 296 percent - almost eight times the national average for the period. Most of that growth has come through mergers with other firms and by hiring away big-name partners. In 1981, it engineered one of the largest law firm mergers ever, when it took in 44 lawyers from the Washington, D.C., firm of Danzansky, Dickey, Tydings, Quint & Gordon, including such political heavyweights as former Senator Joseph Tydings of Maryland and former Congressman Frank Ikard of Texas. Finley Kumble's New York office has its own political honcho: Robert Wagner, the former Mayor of New York City. Finley Kumble's rapid expansion has brought its own problems, though. The firm opened a branch in Miami in 1975, but the two partners in charge of the office left the firm three years later. In 1979, Finley Kumble hired three partners and six associates away from Miami's Fein, Jacobson, Block & Colan - but they, too, left Finley Kumble last year, leaving only two lawyers in the Miami branch. Finley Kumble is a young firm, not only because it was founded a mere 15 years ago, but because of the average age of its partners. Several young lawyers have been promoted to partner after only five years as associate - depending on the firm, it usually takes six to eight years - and last year the firm's youngest partner, Seth Zachary, was 29. Although Wachtell Lipton, whose partners average 38 years of age, has the youngest average among the New York firms listed, Finley Kumble, whose partners average 42, comes in second, tied with Skadden Arps and Hughes, Hubbard & Reed. At the other end of the spectrum are Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts and Whitman & Ransom, where the average age of the partners is 51. They are followed by Phillips Nizer and Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, where the average is 50. The average age of partners nationwide at firms listed was 44.

1385-> MUSIC NOTES; FINISHING ANOTHER SCHUBERT SYMPHONY
The word ''unfinished'' is generally used to define just one Schubert Symphony -the ''Unfinished'' Symphony No. 8, of course. But there is another Schubert unfinished symphony - No. 7 in E, which the composer sketched in orchestral score in 1821 and never got around to completing. In fact, after Schubert's death the manuscript passed from the hands of his brother to Mendelssohn, who contemplated completing it. He never did, but after his death, his brother Paul passed it on to Sir George Grove, editor of the first edition of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, who wrote glowingly of the work's ''mature breadth of conception.'' J.F. Barnett, an English composer and conductor, tried a completion in 1883 and a half-century later, Felix Weingartner tried again, in a version that has been often performed, and even recorded. But, according to the New Grove Dictionary, ''neither attempt is convincing.'' In any case, in 1977, the British musicologist and composer Brian Newbould set out to compose a Schubertian version of this unfinished symphony in honor of the 150th anniversary of Schubert's death. That new Schubert symphony is being given its American premiere by the Youth Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Alan Miller in Carnegie Hall next Sunday at 3 P.M. ''I wanted to finish it as if Schubert himself had returned to the sketches,'' explained Mr. Newbould, speaking from Hull, England, where he is head of the department of music at the University of Hull. ''The symphony is sketched on orchestral paper and every note is assigned to an instrument,' Mr. Newbould said. ''Most of the score consists of one line.'' The symphony was scored by Schubert for double woodwinds, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani and strings and lasts about 40 minutes. Andrew Porter, who heard the first professional performance of the Newbould version by the BBC Symphony in 1978, brought it to the attention of Mr. Miller, the new 21-year-old music director and conductor of the Youth Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Porter had said that this version, more ''Schubertian'' than earlier ones, was ''deserving'' of a place in the repertory. Juilliard has a microfilm copy of Schubert's original manuscript, which is in Britain, and Mr. Miller studied both the composer's sketches and Mr. Newbould's version. ''What I found,'' Mr. Miller said, ''was that it really was a sleuthing job more than a composing job. Not until working with the manuscript did I understand how beautifully Newbould had done it.'' The opening 110 measures are complete, beginning with a ''beautiful and dark'' Adagio. ''It is really possible to consider it a Schubertian work because it is so complete structurally,'' Mr Miller said. And according to him, Mr. Newbould was scrupulous about not intruding on the work, as Weingartner did with his Wagnerian sonorities and harmonies. ''The second movement,'' Mr. Miller said, ''is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard. It is mostly Schubert, though unfortunately, Schubert didn't harmonize the opening theme. Newbould has completed it so it really helps you understand Schubert and his development.'' Spoleto Offerings The Spoleto Festival U.S.A., which will take place in Charleston, S.C., from May 20 through June 5, will feature the American opera debut of the filmmaker Ken Russell, directing Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.'' Also featured at the festival will be Samuel Barber's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' directed by Gian Carlo Menotti, the festival's founder and artistic director. Mr. Russell, an Englishman, is best known for his 1970 film ''Women in Love,'' but he has also made films loosely based upon the lives and music of major composers, such as ''Mahler,'' ''Lisztomania'' and ''The Music Lovers'' based on Tchaikovsky. Mr. Russell plans to change the time of the action of Butterfly from the late 19th century to the beginning of World War II, retaining the locale of Nagasaki, Japan. Catherine Lamy will sing the title role. Barber's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' was the opening opera of the new Metropolitan Opera House in 1966, directed by its librettist, Franco Zeffirelli. The composer revised the work in 1975, when it was directed by Mr. Menotti at Juilliard; that version will also be presented in Charleston. Esther Hinds will sing Cleopatra and Jeffrey Wells will sing Anthony. Other music events at the festival will be concerts by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, chamber music recitals, a recital by the soprano Elisabeth Soderstrom and concerts by the Westminister Choir. HEMIDEMISEMIQUAVERS: Five new opera productions will be presented by the Santa Fe Opera, which opens its 27th season on July 1 to run through Aug. 27. Under the general direction of John Crosby, the company will offer Offenbach's ''Orpheus in the Underworld,'' Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale,'' Strauss' ''Arabella,'' Britten's ''Turn of the Screw'' and the American premiere of Raymond Leppard's realization of Cavalli's ''Orione,'' sung in English. The performing version of ''L'Orione'' is based on a manuscript in Mr. Leppard's private collection. It will be directed by Peter Wood, and the cast will include Neil Rosenshein in the title role....Richard Adler's ''Wilderness Suite'' will be performed Friday by the Utah Symphony in Salt Lake City....Six songs of Debussy have been published for the first time in a collection issued by Editions Salabert in France. The songs, all composed between 1880 and 1884, have been edited by Arthur Hoeree from the original manuscripts at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. They are settings of poems by Paul Bourget and Theophile Gautier.

1387-> NEW ROCHELLE'S LONG BLACK HISTORY
NEW ROCHELLE ONE of the country's first communities of free blacks existed in New Rochelle before the Revolutionary War. Black residents fought in both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. A house on Long Island Sound with secret tunnels and attic passages is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. And in 1698, of a population of a few hundred, 14 percent was black, while today, of 73,000 people in the city, the figure is about 18 percent black. These facts and many others about three centuries of black history in the city will be revealed throughout March in three celebratory events sponsored by the New Rochelle Council on the Arts, bringing together actors, singers and dancers, historians and film makers ''to explore the city's black experience.'' There will be ''A Weekend of Black Artists in Performance'' at the New Rochelle High School on March 5 and 6; an exhibition from March 1 through 31 at the library entitled ''Three Hundred Years - Blacks and New Rochelle (Glimpses of History),'' and a lecture series at the College of New Rochelle on March 13 and 16. More than three years of research by members of the arts council and a number of historians - the celebrations' organizers say - have gone into the production of the events. Among points uncovered in this study were early examples of cooperation between blacks and whites. For instance, although slavery was not officially abolished in the state until 1827, the strong Quaker and Abolitionist spirit of the community led to the freeing of New Rochelle's slaves during Colonial and Revolutionary times. The efforts behind the research were summed up by R. Harcourt Dodds, a resident, an executive with Champion International and a member of the arts council, who said: ''We have proven to ourselves that there is a real black history in New Rochelle. Our studies have not only moved the city and the arts council closer to the black community, but we have succeeded in helping both whites and blacks in our area to get to know one another and their histories better. This is a bridge on which we intend to build.'' Indeed, the arts council said it would use the black celebrations to begin a series of observances on the Irish, Germans, Italians, Jews, Central Americans, American Indians and Asians. The dates are yet to be announced. At the library, downtown on North Avenue, the monthlong exhibition will bring history to life, according to Thea Eichler, program chairman of the arts council. Beginning with Colonial days and moving to the present, illustrations, photographs, drawings, cartoons, maps, documents and letters will depict New Rochelle's history. Photographs of the house suspected of having been an Underground Railroad station will be on view, although the house, which is occupied, will not be open to tours. Population studieswill trace the community's blacks, showing how slaves were freed, how blacks took up work in the Quaker mills and how they have become fully represented in all aspects of the city's society. Documents will also tell about Thomas Paine, perhaps the city's most renown historical figure, and his writing of America's first antislavery pamphlet and about Lincoln School, which in 1961 was the first school in the country to be torn down to eliminate a segregated site. A major portion of the exhibition will be devoted to black participation in the Civil War, fighting for both the Confederacy and the Union. This section consists of 50 black-and-white photographs lent by William Gladstone, a historian from Connecticut, and Major J. C. Packer of West Point, who are among the celebrations' organizers. Another photographic exhibit, lent by Theresa V. Smith of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, will consist of 11 panels of montages entitled ''Black Experience.'' The montages are made of photographs, drawings and clippings that were going to be thrown away by the museum as it converted its files to microfiche. Black leaders in all fields of politics, the arts, government and sports are depicted. The two-day festival at the high school, at North Avenue and Eastchester Road, will include black music, dance and theater groups, most of which have not performed in the county before. The performances include the Boys Choir of Harlem; the Tenth World Theater Company's presentation of ''God's Gift,'' which comes to New Rochelle from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington; the Jelon Vieira Dance group of Brazil, which will perform a blend of martial arts and ballet, and Men of Ibos, independent black opera singers. Five films created by black film makers, some of whom lived in New Rochelle, will also be shown at the high school on March 5 and 6. The films will be ''Black Face, White Face'' by the late Stanley Greene; ''Capoeiras of Bahia,'' about a dance group that will perform at the festival; ''The Black Indians of New Orleans'' by Maurice Martinez of New Rochelle; ''Syvilla Fort,'' about a black dancer, and ''Clarence and Angel,'' a feature-length film. Also at the high-school festival, Joe Nash, a black-dance historian, will give a lecture and present slides, and Mr. Gladstone and Major Packer will discuss the role of blacks in the Civil War. At the College of New Rochelle, the lecture topics will include ''Black Photography: Is There a Black Esthetic?'' at 3 P.M. on March 13, and ''Afro-American Popular Culture (From the Saturday Night Stomp to the Sunday Morning Services),'' discussed by Quincy Troupe, editor of American Rag Magazine, at 7:30 P.M. on March 16. Mrs. Eichler stressed that although February is Black History Month, she and the celebrations' other organizers have made a point of choosing March for New Rochelle because of the city's nowestablished special place in black history. ''New Rochelle has always been the home of outstanding black Americans, and our black population can be traced as far back as the Huguenots,'' she said. ''The impetus for this exhibition was to gain a glimpse of what life was like for these residents throughout the centuries. Throughout the exhibit, we have documented the reactions in a very small town of events that had a national scope. We have been able to see a glimmmer of the impact that many national events had on our residents.'' Other organizers of the festival include Tom Pinkney, director of the Spectrum Gallery of New Rochelle; the Rev. Vernon Shannon of St. Catherine's A.M.E. Zion Church; Dr. James Gaddy, principal of the high school; Julia Hotton, curator of fine arts at the Schomburg Center; Deborah Thomas, curator of photography at the Schomburg Center; Yvonne Jones of the county's division of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, and Marion Forstall, who compiled many oral histories of black residents of New Rochelle. The exhibition was designed by Joseph Dolice and special historic research was undertaken by Vivienne Ratner and photography, by Shirley Zeiberg. For further information, call 632-3990.

1388-> WHAT'S NEW IN THE BUSINESS OF LAW; STAYING POWER
At least according to the statistics, Brown, Wood, Ivey, Mitchell & Petty would seem to be the most pleasant major law firm in New York. Although firms in some smaller cities have almost no turnover, Brown Wood - whose clients include E.F. Hutton, Kidder Peabody and Merrill Lynch - has the lowest turnover of the New York firms profiled, with only 3 percent of its young lawyers leaving in 1981-82. Turnover is said to be highest at Coudert Brothers and Davis Polk & Wardwell, each of which lost one-quarter of its salaried associates in 1981-82. The average turnover nationwide is 12 percent. Brown Wood also is one of the places where the partnership is expanding fast enough to accommodate the young lawyers. The firm's ''Recent Opportunity Index,'' - the guide's measure of how fast the partnership expanded over the last three years - is .9, second only to Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg & Casey, the fastestgrowing law firm in the country, which has a ''Recent Opportunity Index'' of 1.96 - meaning that about two-thirds of the firm's partners were named within the last three years. (The three New York firms with the lowest opportunity index are Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, at .11; Parker Chapin Fattau & Klimpl, at .14 and White & Case, at .16.) Nationwide, the average opportunity index is .37.

1389-> SWITCH AT THE I.C.C.
To the Editor: When I was director of enforcement of the Interstate Commerce Commission (1967-1976), I authorized the imposition of hundreds of fines and forfeitures for the giving of bribes and rebates by railroads and trucking companies and for their acceptance by large shippers. Why? Because they were and they are violations of Federal law. Recently I read with astonishment that at least one of the commissioners believes bribes are discounts, merely a reflection of the free market in operation, and thus should be subject to no restraint (news story Dec. 19). Since 1887, equal treatment of all shippers and travelers has been a guiding principle in the law of the land - an idea that has been followed in innumerable other regulatory statutes, Federal and state. A special preference for no one - a prejudice against no one under similar circumstances - was the guiding principle. It was an eminently sound idea. But to this commissioner, charged with upholding Federal law, the idea is out of date. Why should not appointees to our regulatory agencies be called to account when they announce they are out of sympathy with the aims of the legislation their agency is supposed to enforce? At their confirmation hearings, they are sworn to implement the law as it is written, not as they might prefer it to be rewritten. If they immediately subvert that law, have they not violated their oath? Should not the Congress have the power to charge them with perjury - or at least, un-confirm them? B. A. GOULD, Silver Spring, Md., Jan. 4, 1983

1390-> WHAT'S NEW IN THE BUSINESS OF LAW; HOW TO FIND A RICH (OR RANKLED) LAWYER
Two years ago, when The American Lawyer Guide to Law Firms appeared, it was hailed as a major breakthrough, the first systematic look beyond the secrecy that shrouds the nation's major law firms. In March, a much-expanded second edition - now known as The American Lawyer Guide to Leading Law Firms - is coming out, and it contains some advances of its own. Probably the most important addition to what has now become a twovolume, $475 opus, is the new index of clients, which makes it possible to look up many of America's major corporations and find out which law firms are doing significant work for them. Although the index is far from comprehensive, being derived solely from the key client listings that accompany each law firm profile, it should provide at least a starting point for those who wish to know which companies are tied to which law firms. The new guide covers 232 law firms in 20 cities, listing the following for each: * The chairman, managing partner, hiring partner, administrator, librarian, and so on; * size (as of June 1, 1982), growth since 1979, number of new associates hired in 1981, and the key law schools from which they were recruited; * partner-associate ratio, turnover, starting salary, billing rates, average age of partners, usual experience required before partnership, and something the guide calls its ''Recent Opportunity Index,'' which is the percentage of the partnership made up of partners admitted in the last three years. (Unfortunately, the ''Recent Opportunity Index'' is a measure of how fast the partnership is expanding. For most young lawyers, the more important question is how hard it is to make partner, which could be measured by comparing the number of eligible lawyers with the number made partner in a given year.) These listings are followed by descriptions of the firm's structure, governance, history, training and assignment methods, key clients and the chief lawyer who handles each. By far the most interesting section, though, is the collection of miscellaneous notes that rounds out each firm's profile, complete with news of important cases, prominent lawyers, and, occasionally, assessments like the following: ''Sullivan & Cromwell combines a crew of tough litigators with an exceptional general corporate department which includes a first-rate mergers and acquisitions team. The firm also has a reputation for lean staffing of client matters.''

1391-> PERSONAL FINANCE; HEALTH PLANS AND MATERNITY BENEFITS
MARY is a sales manager in a large company. Her husband Joe recently had his appendix removed and the c ompany's health insurance plan paid all $2,000 of his medical costs.T im works with Mary, and his wife recently had a baby. The health p lan paid only $500 of the couple's $2,000 maternity bill. Does the health insurance plan constitute illegal sex discrimination against male employees such as Tim, by making them absorb more of their wives' maternity costs than female employees must absorb of their husbands' medical costs? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission thinks so, and some time this spring the United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue. The case before the Court involves the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, a unit of Tenneco Inc., and was initiated by a male employee who received a $500 reimbursement for the $1,000 hospital bill incurred when his wife gave birth in 1979. The case springs from the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a 1978 Federal law that forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of pregnancy and childbirth. In interpreting the law, the E.E.O.C. issued guidelines in 1979 requiring companies to cover medical expenses - including pregnancy - for workers' wives to the same extent that they cover medical expenses for workers' husbands. The commission contended that failure to provide equal coverage for spouses of both sexes constituted illegal discrimination against men; in effect, it argued, some male employees were not as well compensated because they received a smaller compensation package than their female counterparts. Critics said that if the Supreme Court upholds the E.E.O.C., there will probably be a detrimental impact on other fringe benefits available to employees of both sexes. They noted that employers do not have unlimited amounts of money to spend on employee benefits, which include such items as life and disability insurance as well as health insurance, and that extra maternity coverage carries a significant price tag. ''If a company has to provide additional benefits, it's not just gratis,'' said Andrew M. Kramer, an attorney representing Newport News and a partner in the Washington office of Seyferth Shaw Fairweather & Geraldson, a Chicago law firm. ''There's got to be a trade-off someplace else, with other benefits.'' Upholding the E.E.O.C. might accelerate ''cafeteria programs,'' in which employees choose from a ''menu'' of benefits that best suit their needs, said Judith F. Mazo, vice president and director of research with Martin E. Segal & Company, an actuarial consulting company in New York. Female workers, single male workers and male employees whose wives are past childbearing age might opt for benefit packages that contained extra vacation days instead of ones that provide full maternity benefits. Experts differ as to how many companies might be affected by the Supreme Court decision. ''We searched our data base of 300 large companies and couldn't find a single instance'' where an employer had a plan that provided less liberal benefits for wives of male employees than for husbands of female employees, said James H. Brennan Jr., a vice president with the employee benefits consulting firm of Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, of New York. Lloyd S. Kaye of William M. Mercer Inc., a large New York consulting company, said, ''Only two of our clients would be affected, and that's out of a couple of hundred.'' But Stephen A. Bokat, a Washington lawyer who filed the first court suit challenging the E.E.O.C. guidelines, disagreed. ''Hard numbers just don't seem to exist, but I believe a substantial number of companies would be affected,'' said Mr. Bokat, director of litigation for the National Chamber Litigation Center, an affiliate of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The suit was filed by the Kansas Association of Commerce and Industry, which represents about 2,500 smaller employers, of which 30 to 40 percent are not in compliance with the E.E.O.C. guidelines, he said. A decision on that suit is still pending in Federal District Court in Topeka. THE Supreme Court agreed to hear the Newport News case to resolve conflicting decisions by United States Courts of Appeals. There are perhaps eight similar cases pending, involving such employers as the Emerson Electric Company of St. Louis, the Joslyn Manufacturing and Supply Company of Chicago and the Los Angeles Board of Education. There is also a difference of opinion about how costly a decision upholding the E.E.O.C. would be. ''The financial impact nationwide could be extremely large,'' said Mr. Bokat. ''It could easily mount to the tens of millions of dollars. One company alone has estimated it would cost an extra half million a year.'' Charles Hopkins, chairman of the National Railway Labor Conference, said it could swell costs of the health insurance program covering the 400,000 employees of the nation's railroads ''on the order of $4 million a year.'' But employee benefits consultants dismiss those figures as exaggerated. A few years ago, for example, Martin E. Segal & Company conducted a study for a national, multi-employer health plan that covers 45,000 workers represented by a major international union to determine the cost of complying with the E.E.O.C guidelines. It found that improving maternity benefits for spouses would cost anywhere from $10 to $51 per employee annually, or a cost increase ranging from less than 1 percent to just over 5 percent, depending upon the particular type of health plan offered. ''I don't think the money involved is very significant,'' observed John C. Hickey, a partner in Kwasha Lipton, a Fort Lee, N.J., benefits consulting firm. ''It's more of a philosophical issue than a monetary one.'' In any case, the Newport News suit may have simply opened a Pandora's box of other problems stemming from the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Lawsuits have already been filed on such issues as whether state laws providing liberal disability leaves for pregnant employees are preempted by less generous Federal laws and whether male employees can take paid paternity leave to the same extent that female employees are entitled to maternity leave. The issue of paternity leave is ''in some ways the converse of the Newport News situation,'' said Miss Mazo of Martin E. Segal & Company. ''Even though the male is not in the hospital delivering a baby, the question is his right to paid leave and protection against the loss of seniority so he can participate in a family medical event.''

1392-> Birdsong Troubled By Talk of Trade
It has taken more than a year for Otis Birdsong to feel at home as a Net. After a knee injury, long delays on his new home, and the unsuccessful experiment of playing alongside Ray Williams, he has just begun to be at ease. Recently, he learned that he and his wife, Candace, were to become parents. He had his home and soon he would also have a family. Nothing that happened on the court could apparently shake that world. But word came out this week that Birdsong might be part of a fourteam transaction that could send him away from the Nets. After scoring 8 points in the first period of the 120-109 loss in San Antonio on Saturday night, Birdsong hit only two baskets for a total of 12 points, well below his 18-point average for the eight previous games. 'A Funny Feeling' ''It's a funny feeling,'' he said. ''Before the game, you sit and get ready to give your all because it's your job. Then you try to go and play hard for the team you're with right now. But you can do your best to try to help the team win, then be gone tomorrow.'' According to officials of the Nets, Houston, Utah and Denver, the deal was at this stage: The Nets would send Birdsong and the center Mike Gminski to the Nuggets, who would send Dave Robisch and Rich Kelley, both centers, to the Jazz. Utah would send the forward Adrian Dantley, who is out for the remainder of the year with an injured wrist, to the Rockets. The Nets would receive Caldwell Jones from Houston and the guard Bill Hanzlik from the Nuggets. According to The Associated Press, however, Frank Layden, the Utah coach, said yesterday that the Jazz had backed out of the deal because ''the offer was not enough for us.'' The deadline for transactions in the league is Feb. 15. Coach Larry Brown did not deny that the Nets had been speaking to various teams, but he had little faith that the deal would be made. ''People keep talking to me about four teams,'' he said, ''when it's hard enough to get two teams to agree on anything.'' Brown Denies Pressure He also denied that he was attempting to shake up the Nets, who, despite two losses in a three-game swing through Texas last week, had still won 15 of their last 19 games and had the fifth-best record in the league, 28-17. ''We're always looking to help the team,'' he said. ''It's close to the deadline and everybody's on the phone. If someone offers you a great player, then you can't help but explore the possibilities. But I haven't seen anyone offering any great players to us.'' Another possible transaction discussed by the Nets involved Golden State, which made overtures toward Mickey Johnson and Eric (Sleepy) Floyd. And with Seattle continuing its skid with a humiliating defeat in Cleveland, the SuperSonics, who lost a deal with the Knicks when Truck Robinson refused to waive his no-trade clause, should soon enter the bidding for Johnson. Differences With Coach Johnson, a veteran of nine seasons, is playing for his fourth team. He and Brown have had differences since he joined the team seven games into the season. He is taking all the talk in stride, saying: ''I'd hate to help build us into one of the top teams in the league and then get shuttled out. But if everybody's not happy, then it's out of my hands. I'll wish them luck.'' Brown said he did not believe the discussions should affect his team's performance. He said the Nets were ''outhustled'' by the Spurs, who gained their third consecutive victory. ''In Houston we got outhustled, and there weren't any rumors before that game,'' he said. ''We heard rumors in Dallas, but we didn't play listless there. If a guy does say he's affected, then I don't know what kind of competitor he is.'' But the Nets say they are affected. ''There's no question about it,'' said Foots Walker, the captain. ''Everybody's kind of familiar with what's going on, but there's no sense getting riled up when something might not happen.'' It is not easy to think about it, said Birdsong. ''You don't think about it during the game,'' he said. ''But afterwards, it's hard not to feel ii in the back of your mind.''

1396-> PARASITE DEPLETING OYSTERS OF CHESAPEAKE BAY
A gloom as thick as the dark clouds lowering overhead has settled over the watermen of the Chesapeake Bay. A hardy breed of men who brave the bite of the bay's treacherous winds to poke and scrape its muddy bottom, they now find their livelihood threatened by an enemy they cannot see. A microscopic parasite that they call MSX is killing oysters of the Chesapeake, oysters that have been harvested in quantities that in good years have provided nearly half the nation's supply. Now weather-toughened men like Mark Cummings, Clifford Wilson and his son Robert, bundled in heavy clothing and weighed down with thick boots, risk the bay's sudden squalls and icy waters for catches that are less than half the size of those of recent years. The MSX was originally designated ''multiple spheres of X'' because no one knew exactly what it was, but it has since been identified as a protozoan parasite, now known as Haplosporidium nelsoni. The parasite has sharply cut into one of the bay area's major industries. Only three years ago the bay was producing about 3.5 million bushels of oysters a year, pumping about $70 million a year into Maryland's economy and bringing about $20 million into Virginia. Less than half of that is being harvested this season, which began Sept. 15 and ends April 1, industry experts say. The parasite problem has become so severe that some local packers are shipping in oysters from the Gulf of Mexico to fill their orders, and many others have been forced by that and other problems to close their doors. Next year could bring worse problems, said Dr. George Krantz, a professor at the University of Maryland who is one of the area's top marine biologists. As he stood here at the mouth of the broad Choptank River, he pointed toward distant waters where he had found oyster mortality above 65 percent. ''This is a lethal situation'' for some oyster areas, he said. ''Within three years, it can destroy an entire population.'' The parasite has compounded the effects of economic conditions that have reduced demand for oysters and increased competition from the Gulf of Mexico, where growing numbers of oysters are privately cultivated. There is also another threat, experts say, from watermen themselves. More than 5,000 watermen have been harvesting oysters at a pace that threatens to deplete the oyster beds, according to Dr. Krantz. The new efficiency with which oysters are being harvested has alarmed even some of the watermen. Divers Gather Choicest Oysters The threat comes from divers who wade the muddy bottom in rubber suits, attached by long hoses to air compressors on their boats. The divers load the choicest oysters into wire baskets for a partner to pull to the surface and unload. Paradoxically, the parasite blight has been fostered by conditions the watermen welcomed two years ago: high salinity in the bay water brought on by drought and a reduced flow of fresh water from a vast East Coast watershed into the broad, 200-mile-long bay. High salinity promotes both reproduction and rapid growth of oysters. But it also creates an environment that is congenial to the MSX, which first appeared in the Delaware Bay in the 1950's and in the lower Chesapeake in the 1960's, devastating oyster beds. Later, a hurricane flooded the area with fresh water and appeared to have ended the problem, but Dr. Krantz said, ''It was there all the time, waiting to break out when conditions were right.'' The parasite has also been detected along the New Jersey Shore, Dr. Krantz said, and in an isolated spot in Wellfleet Harbor, Mass., where some bay oysters have been transplanted. None have been detected in oystering areas of Long Island, he said. Parasite Enters New Areas This year, with high salinity continuing despite the more normal rainfall of the last year, the parasite has moved up the bay into areas never touched before, and areas of high mortality have been found near the mouths of most major Maryland rivers, areas that are among the most productive of high-quality oysters, as far north as the Bay Bridge. The spread has been uneven. Below the Virginia line where the blight first entered the bay some oysters appear to have developed resistance. And oyster beds in less saline creeks appear to have been untouched, but those are also areas of slower oyster growth. Maryland has been seeding some of those immune areas with spat, the oyster spawn, but at a less rapid pace than mature oysters are being killed or harvested. Other Reasons for Problem Some marine biologists, like Donald Baugh of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental group, and Peter Jensen, director of Maryland's Tidal Fisheries Administration, say the parasite problem has combined with others, including excessive nutrients running off from farmers' fields and sewage plants. The nutrients promote growth of bay plants that then die, absorbing oxygen and reducing the amount of oxygen available for the oysters and other aquatic life. ''This is the worst time I have ever seen,'' said Mark Cummings as he piloted the Lady Brandi, his broad, flat-bottomed boat, toward an oyster bed at the mouth of Harris Creek, a wide stream flowing into the Choptank. Mr. Cummings is a tonger, one of the largest groups of watermen. It is a trade he has practiced for 12 of his 28 years. ''See, that's what they do,'' he said as he stood beside a long flat tray spanning the boat from gunwale to gunwale where his partner, Wendell Ladnum, had deposited a craggy, dripping heap of greenish-gray oysters. Mr. Cummings displayed some gaping empty shells as his partner stood on a gunwale and prodded the bottom with his tongs, long, scissored wooden poles tipped with clawtoothed baskets. The shells open when the parasite, which is said to be harmless to humans, has killed the oyster. The MSX, consisting of circular cells that cluster inside a spherical membrane, has been hard to detect because it is similar in appearance to the oyster itself, according to Dr. Krantz. The clusters enter through the gills and destroy the gills and digestive tract, he explained. From each tong load deposited on his tray, Mr. Cummings gathered about a half-dozen live oysters above the legal limit of three inches and pushed the smaller oysters along with still other empty shells back into the water. After a day of tonging, the partners had 15 bushels of oysters, which they brought in and sold. They were paid $6 a bushel, or a total of $90, which they shared equally after subtracting operating expenses. 'Work Longer and Get Less' ''Three years ago we could get our legal limit of 25 bushels a man and be home by 10 or 11 o'clock,'' said Mr. Cummings. ''Now we work longer and get less.'' ''The divers are really hurting us, too,'' he said. ''The MSX has forced them out of the deep water up onto the shoals with us, and they are getting the big ones we were getting before.'' There is little demand for the small oysters, a ''standard'' grade, which are brought up in greatest numbers by the tongers. Meanwhile, the larger ''selects'' that are brought in by the divers and by operators of skipjacks, old sailing vessels that dredge in deeper water, bring prices of $9 and $10 a bushel. Until about three years ago, divers were a rarity in the bay. Now, as their numbers have grown, so, too, has resentment among the tongers. About 800 divers are now operating in the bay's Maryland waters. At dawn the day after Mr. Cummings and Mr. Ladnum pulled in with their skimpy catch, Clifford Wilson cast off with Richard Koczorowski, a young man who would spend the day diving in the Choptank's Muddy Cove. 'It's Bad for Us, Too' As he piloted the Miss Brenda over waters that were dead calm under leaden skies, Mr. Wilson had an answer for the attackers. ''When times are bad for everybody they need somebody to blame,'' he said. ''I've been in this business for 37 years, and I've never seen it as bad. It's bad for us, too.'' The boat approached Muddy Cove, and the diver began pulling on his rubber suit over layers of thermal underwear, sweaters and trousers. Soon the young man was sending up basket after basket to Mr. Wilson's sorting tray. But they contained fewer live oysters than gaping shells. After nearly three hours, Mr. Wilson looked down at their catch, a small heap on the plywood deck. There were about seven or eight bushels, he said. ''If all those oysters had been good, we would have 20 bushels by now,'' he said, adding with a shake of his head: ''That's bad, you know.'' But it was better than the day spent by his son, Robert Wilson, a skipjack captain, and other sailing captains and crews. They gathered two hours before daybreak prepared to sail their old vessels, dragging long-toothed dredges back and forth across oyster beds. But no wind came to fill their canvases and they soon drifted away. Where once there were hundreds of skipjacks, only 26 now dredge Maryland waters, and those are now harvesting little more than half the 100 to 150 bushels a day they were getting last year, said Robert Wilson. As he waited, Wade Murphy, another skipjack captain summed up the problem. ''The oysters are scarce as hell, the market's not too good and the weather's bad.'' Now Dr. Krantz is advising watermen that they would be wise to find something else to do next year. ''There are too many of them there,'' he said. ''This resource will not yield as much next year.''

1398-> READING AND WRITING; THE COST OF BEING EARNEST
A few weeks ago, it fell to me to review a television adaptation of Nathanael West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts.'' It was an earnestly conceived production, strong on its own terms, but, perhaps unfairly, I could not help thinking about it on the book's terms. It's that sort of book. What must have struck anyone acquainted with West's novel was the entire absence of his humor in the television show - and, it follows unfailingly, the absence of his special sort of seriousness. The play offered a straight version of the story of Lonelyhearts, the young male agony columnist who is plunged into the miseries of those who write to him for advice or sympathy or just to have someone to write to. Like the book, the play is grim - but the book, unlike the play, is very funny, in a wrenching way. Perhaps the most memorable of the letters that make up the stunning opening pages and pull the reader instantly into West's shadowed world comes from a 16-year-old girl with a special problem. She writes: ''When I was a little girl, it was not so bad because I got used to the kids on the block makeing fun of me, but now I would like to have boy friends like the other girls and go out on Saturday nites, but no boy will take me because I was born without a nose - although I am a good dancer and have a nice shape and my father buys me pretty clothes.'' The reader who doesn't laugh at this, even as the heart weeps, is not on West's wavelength. The pathos is rubbed in by the punchline, the abrupt switch from the horror of the condition to girlish vanities. That kind of friction between thoughts or emotions that don't quite belong with each other often ignites laughter, and West was a master of the technique. Why couldn't the television adapters even attempt to catch his spirit? Why should they have found it necessary to tame West by extracting his humor, like therapists trying to make their peculiar patient more acceptable to society? I think they were inhibited by an earnestness that goes along with adult education, sex education, educational television and other endeavors designed to edify. But art is not an exercise in edification. Much art has a way of being at once more frivolous and more serious, a connection that earnest folk find difficult to make. For one thing, earnest people do not crack jokes about serious matters like someone's handicaps. The right way to treat a young girl without a nose, as they see it, is, well, to treat her. Do a play about a nose transplant. In West's vision, a happy ending (not that he was one for happy endings) would probably be for her to hook up with a boy without a chin and produce children without eyebrows. Black humor, if you will, or a sick joke, but defi- nitely not earnest. Now, there is a lot to be said in favor of earnestness. The earnest are uneasy with jokes made at the expense of victims. They know that the proper attitude toward victims is sympathy and good works. You will not find earnest people referring to a deformed man as Crookback. When it comes to humor, they are likely to laugh more readily at Tom Sawyer than at Huckleberry Finn. They prefer humor that goes down like yogurt. The gift or burden of earnestness has nothing to do with intelligence or knowledge or taste; the earnest possess or lack those attributes in rough proportion to the rest of the population. Earnest people generally make useful neighbors. A touch predictable perhaps, and wearing in long stretches, but helpful and full of information about things like termites and dry rot. They study Consumer Reports and can be counted on to lend a hand when the car conks out. Although your earnest neighbor may not be a lively conversationalist, he will probably not be an offensive or disquieting one either - no ethnic or racial gags. The earnest person, often a self-improver, stands at the shoreline of art, casting a net that does not extend very far in the direction of irony, ambiguity, irreverence, misanthropy. He fishes for rightthinking messages. He can haul in Arthur Miller and James Michener without strain, and might manage to snare superior species, like Balzac or Tolstoy or Jane Austen, whose works can be read as being in favor of the right things or at least against the wrong ones. He will probably find Ibsen meatier than Chekhov. But a fish like Dostoyevsky is likely to prove elusive, and far out of reach are queer creatures like Kafka, Celine, Beckett and Nathanael West. They promise indigestion to those who like to come away from a meal of art with a good taste in the mouth, new information in the brain, an inner glow. To return to West, his humor is of course not at the expense of the victim. It is a horselaugh at a world that is too ugly and too bitter to be dealt with in any other way. West would scorn as just another joke the notion that by correcting an individual's deformity one is addressing the woes of the world. Now I am earnest enough to believe that, on this point, the earnest people are right. Give that girl a nose! The difficulty for the earnest reader lies in separating good works from works of art. A reluctance to give offense is a civic virtue; it makes existence in society possible, even pleasant. But it has nothing to do with literature. If a book does not offend or irritate or disturb, if it caresses our sense of propriety and coddles our opinions, attitudes, values, that's no laughing matter.

1400-> Market Place; The Search For Recovery
THE stock market spent last week searching for signs of an economic recovery. A close reading of the tea leaves proved inconclusive, but equity prices forged ahead anyway. This activity was fed more by hope than reality. The longer it takes for signs of recovery to materialize, the more vulnerable to a setback the market becomes. But optimism outweighed worry on Wall Street last week. Posting new highs were such indicators as the New York Stock Exchange's composite index, the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter issues and the Dow Jones transportation average. The uplift in the transportation average reflected hopes that its components - railroads, airlines and trucks -would move the merchandise and the people once a business recovery took hold. Perhaps an even better barometer of hope was a particular string of zeroes. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday not a single issue on the Big Board - common shares, preferred shares or warrants - set a 52-week low. On Monday the Dow industrials closed at a record of 1,092.35, responding to declines in some interest rates. The Dow finished the week at 1,080.85 for a net gain of 4.78 points. On Wednesday it briefly touched the 1,100 level for the first time. Pension funds and other large institutions continued to dominate the market with large-block trades. Their continuing buy list, as monitored by Salomon Brothers, included such basic-industry, commodity-oriented stocks as Dow Chemical, Georgia-Pacific and Union Carbide. But the revolving door of group favorites indicated the jumpy nature of big-money investors. Steel issues, for example, declined slightly during the week. The week before, by contrast, Salomon Brothers reported a 9.6 percent jump in steel stock prices. The plight of money managers still holding onto an unseemly amount of cash was underscored by one pension-fund professional who recently poured several hundred millions of dollars into basic-industry issues, particularly paper and chemicals. He was caught in the performance game. Like virtually all pensionfund managers, his portfolio is measured every quarter. The bet he is now making is that laggard groups will perform well, at least for the next few months. If that happens, he can take his money and run - and please some clients in the process. But this is a dangerous game. And it is getting even trickier. Some brokerage executives confide that a few Wall Street boutiques are now having their market performance measured on a monthly basis. If that becomes a trend, it will mean even more frenzied trading, more market confusion and an even faster spinning door for group rotation. There exists a popular notion among investors that the way to make money in a new year is to buy the depressed stocks of the old year - the famous rebound theory. But it often works only for a relatively short period. Some voices are sounding warnings on the theory, especially for cyclical stocks that lately have produced price gains. ''While these areas do appear to offer further trading opportunities,'' said Alan R. Shaw of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, ''we question whether cyclical bull trends have begun for areas such as chemicals, papers, steels and oils.'' In support of his thesis, the analyst pointed out that among the market's better-acting groups in 1981 were restaurants, mobile homes, home furnishings, foods, retail stores and publishing. These sectors, he said, also did well in 1982. In 1981 the retreating groups included fertilizers, oil well equipment, agricultural machinery, international oils, domestic oils and natural gas pipelines. This also proved true in 1982, Mr. Shaw added. Admittedly, there were some 1982 winners that came directly off the 1981 loser list - home building, savings and loan institutions and auto manufacturing, for example. ''But to say that the turn of a year has any magical qualities is foolish,'' Mr. Shaw concluded. He still prefers consumer-goods stocks, which performed well last year, to capital-goods issues. One reason depressed stocks often rebound in the early weeks of a new year is that they had been hammered down by tax-loss selling in the preceding year. Fred Fraenkel, investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities, also cites the inherent pitfalls of loading up on the laggard stocks. ''We can't join the party,'' he said. ''We have to call them the way we see them, and we can't see a fundamental case for the newly popular cyclicals.'' Here again, recovery is the essential problem. It will take time, many months perhaps, for profits to perk up at many basic-industry companies.

1401-> WHAT'S DOING IN SARASOTA
Sarasota, a medium-sized city with 50,000 year-round residents, lies about midway along the Gulf Coast of Florida, about 45 miles south of Tampa. The city has the standard attractions of other Florida winter resorts mostly balmy days in the 60's and 70's, fine beaches, excellent fishing and boating, golf, tennis, smart shops, an abundance of moderate to luxurious lodgings and restaurants - but in addition it boasts of being the cultural capital of Florida. The boast is not without foundation, for the activity in the arts throughout the year is impressive for a town of its size. Sarasota has a major art museum and scores of private galleries, one of the country's great mansions open to the public, a 10-month season of concerts, ballets and musical shows, opera and repertory drama in an 18th-century theater, two active Off-Broadway theaters, a circus museum, two science museums, two botanical gardens and two big nature preserves. How It All Began The man most responsible for this cultural heritage was John North Ringling, an immigrant harness-maker's son of meager education, who became the rich and famous circus impresario. In the 1920's he settled on Sarasota as the winter headquarters of his Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and in 1925, on 38 acres facing Sarasota Bay, he built a 30-room residence in the style of a Venetian palace. Adjoining this, he erected a Renaissance-type villa to exhibit his collection of Baroque paintings and sculpture. When he died in 1936, Mr. Ringling left it all to the State of Florida. The Ringling Gift The state has doubled the acreage of the Ringling gift in the last 30 years, and the 68 acres of landscaped grounds two miles north of town on U.S. 41 in the bustling airport area now encompass a circus museum and the Asolo Theater, an original Italian playhouse of 1798, as well as an art museum and the Ringling residence. The Museum of Art, with 23 galleries, contains 1,000 paintings, among them a large number of works by Rubens, and some 500 sculptures. The Ringling residence, called Ca'd'zan (House of John in Venetian dialect), is a two-story mansion described as a ''melange of the Doge's Palace in Venice and Madison Square Garden.'' The Museum of the Circus was built and furnished by the state 12 years after Ringling's death. Among the circus memorabilia are old-time wooden circus wagons, including an 1878 bandwagon that was drawn by 40 horses. The restaurant alongside, built to resemble a circus tent and staffed by waitresses dressed like clowns, is recommended for lunch. Excellent hot and cold sandwiches with salad are $3.95; beer and wine are available. The Ringling facilities are open Monday to Friday from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M., Saturday 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. One ticket at $4.50 for adults and $2 for children admits to all the museums. On the Ringling grounds, the eighth annual Medieval Fair will be staged from March 10 to 13. Hundreds of strolling troubadours, musicians, jesters, jugglers, acrobats, dancers in period costumes will perform. Tickets to the fair and all museum buildings will be $5. Civic Center The Civic Center complex, the other bulwark of culture in Sarasota, is located in a 28-acre park extending from U.S. 41 to the bay in the heart of Sarasota. The major unit is the city-owned Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, seating almost 2,000 spectators, where close to 300 concerts, ballets and Broadway plays are presented each season. Lana Turner will star in the mystery comedy, ''Murder Among Friends'' next Tuesday and Wednesday, and the Tony Award musical ''Barnum'' will be performed from next Friday through March 13. The Alvin Ailey Dancers will appear on March 28 and 29, and Mexico's Ballet Folklorico on April 1. Tickets are $7.50 to $18.50. Call 813-953-3366 for reservations. The Civic Center also will be the major site of King Neptune's Frolic, a week of parades, marathons and art shows from March 27 to April 3. Not far from the Civic Center, in a 70-year-old building at 1241 North Palm Avenue, is the Florida Studio Theater, Sarasota's equivalent to an Off-Broadway playhouse. In March the productions will include ''Mass Appeal'' and ''A Coupla White Chicks.'' Call 813-355-4096 for dates and ticket prices. The Golden Apple Dinner Theater at 35 North Pineapple Avenue, in downtown Sarasota serves a buffet followed by a musical show daily except Mondays. ''Cabaret'' will be performed through March 6, ''Carousel'' from March 8 to April 17, and ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' from April 19 to May 29. The price is $16.65 Tuesday through Thursday evenings; $17.65 on Friday and Saturday; $12.50 for matinees. For reservations, call 813-366-5454. Special Events During the last two weeks of March and first week of April, the Chicago White Sox will complete their spring training in Payne Park, off U.S. 41, in downtown Sarasota. Call 813-953-3388 for the schedule and ticket prices. The annual six-day Sarasota County Fair will take place in the third week of March, with agricultural and trade exhibits as well as carnival midway games and entertainment. The fairgrounds are at 3000 Ringling Boulevard, a few miles east of the Civic Center. For details on this and other events, call the Sarasota Information Center on U.S. 41 at the entrance to the Civic Center (813-957-1877). Getting There Sarasota is served from New York by Eastern, Pan American, Delta and Air Florida airlines, but Pan Am has the sole nonstop flight and that only once daily in each direction. Inquire for fares, which have been rising since the $99 bargain rates ended in early February. Bus service in Sarasota is poor; a car is essential. The competing car-rental agencies have different rates and change them frequently, so shop around by phone or at the airport. Things to Do The main outdoor activity in Sarasota is, of course, lying in the sun on the beach. Sarasota has 35 miles of silky white sand on its barrier islands between the Gulf of Mexico and the bay, all reached by causeways. The water along the Gulf Coast, chilly all winter, should be warm enough for swimming by March. Almost every tourist lodge has a heated swimming pool anyway. Sarasota claims it introduced golf to America in 1885. There are now 30 courses, including some of championship status, open to visitors. The list, with phone numbers, is given in the free booklet ''Discover Sarasota,'' distributed by the Greater Sarasota Visitor Association, and all tourist houses. For tennis players there are six free public courts in the Civic Center Park, four at Siesta Key public beach, and many private courts at hotels and clubs available to guests. Party boats depart for full- and half-day fishing trips from Marina Jack's in Bayfront Park downtown. Big red snapper, grouper, bonita, and even shark are running. Fees are $15 a half day, $25 all day, $18 for the aged, with equipment and bait included. For reservations, call 813-366-3373. At the marina, Bill O'Leary (813-953-7505) has a fleet of sailboats for rent with rates ranging from $10 an hour to $250 a day. You may hire an instructor or captain at extra charge. For sedentary sailors, the Marina Jack II, a reproduction of a stern-wheel river boat makes lunch and dinner cruises on the placid bay daily. Lunch costs $7.75 to $10, dinner $12.75 to $15.75, depending upon your order. Reservations at 813-366-9255 are recommended. Two-hour cruises from the marina among the bayous and mangrove islands in the bay on the motorized Le Barge are $6 for adults and $3 for children. Call 813-366-6116. Among the city's many popular commercial attractions are the Sarasota Jungle Gardens, with its flamingos, monkeys and alligators, and Bellm's Cars of Yesterday, with almost 200 vintage automobiles on display, both near the Ringling complex. Shopping At St. Armands Circle on St. Armands Key, across a causeway from mainland Sarasota, a hundred smart boutiques and a dozen restaurants are attractively set in low white stucco buildings among tropical landscaping. You can pick up an unset diamond for $13,000 at Simon's, one of nine jewelers, or a $600 cashmere bathrobe at ''A Special Place,'' a store of men's and women's resort clothing. Lilly Pulitzer and Rodier of Paris are among the other shops here. Longboat Key has an attractive promenade called ''Avenue of Flowers,'' with shops ranging from a supermarket and huge drugstore to an art gallery. Where to Eat There are more than 270 places to eat in Sarasota. A favorite of sophisticated diners is the St. Georges at 1258 Palm Avenue (813-365-9397). The cuisine is French, and a specialty is lobster gratin with champagne sauce. Two persons can dine here for under $60 with wine extra. Walt's Fish Market Restaurant at 560 North Washington Boulevard downtown, with a big dining room, a retail fish store and a cooked food counter, is a popular moderate-priced place. From October to May, stone crabs are the seasonal specialty. Five or six claws with potatoes, salad or cole slaw, were $8.99 recently. The telephone number is 813-365-0203. Outside the Cafe l'Europe, an elegant French restaurant on St. Armands Circle, patrons queue up before it opens for lunch at 11 A.M. The restaurant does its own butchering for fresh veal specialties. Typical entrees are about $16.50. The wine card lists vintages of $12 to $500 a bottle. Reservations for dinner, 813-288-4415. On Longboat Key, the restaurant of the Far Horizons Motel at 2401 Gulf of Mexico Drive, features chicken roasted with thyme at $12.75 and a rack of lamb with Proven,cal herbs for two at $35 (813-383-2441). Where to Stay Sarasota has only one big high-rise luxury hotel, the Hyatt Sarasota, on the bay adjoining the Civic Center. It is 10 stories high and has 300 rooms, a marina, a pool, restaurants and convention facilities. Rates run from $79 a day single to $475 for a two-bedroom penthouse (813-366-9000). Between the Civic Center and the airport, U.S. 41 is almost solidly lined with motels whose rates range from about $70 double to as low as $35 a day. On Lido Beach the Sheraton Sandcastle offers 178 rooms, a majority with kitchenettes, in two- to four-storied balconied buildings on 600 feet of Gulf beach. Rates until May run from $70 double to $140 for a suite, less in summer and fall (800-325-3535). New this season is the Longboat Key Club, spread over 1,000 acres of both the Gulf and bay on Longboat. Its Inn on the Beach has 221 housekeeping condominium suites in several 10-story buildings. The club also has two golf courses, 14 tennis courts, three restaurants and a yacht marina and is still expanding. Rates now through April are $125 to $300 double per day (800-237-8821). A cozy motel enclosing a garden with pool right on the Gulf is the Holiday Beach at 4765 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key 33548. Now through April rates range from $49 double to $70 for four in a twobedroom suite (813-383-3704). The Colony Beach and Tennis Resort is a large development of 232 kitchenette apartments surrounding 21 tennis courts on Longboat Beach. There is a pool and restaurant with dancing nightly. Rates until April 11 vary from $125 double to $220 for four people in a two-bedroom suite, but there are package deals for a week or halfweek which include tennis lessons, a rental car and bicycle. Call 800-237-9443 for details.

Getting High on High-Tech Weapons The Pentagon is debating how far the next generation of armaments should depend on highly computerized systems, which are capable of scanning the battlefield and devastating the enemy with precisely targeted missiles. That the debate is taking place at all reflects the Pentagon's reluctance to learn from experience. No one disputes the need for better conventional weapons that, some experts conclude, might permit a delay in wartime decisions to use nuclear arms. But in developing such weapons, it's folly to let high technology become an end in itself. High technology can help or hinder military effectiveness. The Pentagon has repeatedly used it to enhance qualities that are of marginal importance to real combat. It has focused the design of major weapons systems on high-tech means of engaging the enemy at vast distances, at the cost of degrading performance under real combat conditions. Planes and ships, for example, have extremely powerful radars to spot the enemy way off. But the radars, like searchlights in the dark, emblazon the sender's position to the enemy. That's what happened in the Falkland war when Argentina sank the British H.M.S. Sheffield with an Exocet missile. Since there's no reliable means, beyond visual distance, of distinguishing friendly planes from foe, pilots often wait for targets to come into view before firing. But at such close range, cannon or simple heat-seeking missiles are the better weapons. These accounted for almost all the kills made by Israeli pilots during the Lebanon war. The U.S. Air Force's costly new radar missiles contributed little or nothing to the rout of the Syrian Air Force. In land warfare too, great effort has been made to engage the enemy at the greatest distances, even though most combat occurs at much shorter range. The Pentagon loses sight of the factors that count in real battles in other ways. The Navy elects to build nuclear attack submarines instead of diesel-electrics, which are quieter and cost a fourth as much. The Air Force prefers supersonic planes and bombers to aircraft that can fly slowly enough to support ground troops. The Army chose to build the hot-rod M-1 tank instead of doing what the Israelis did: improve the reliable old M-60 so well that it smashed the Syrians' Soviet-supplied T-72's - the tanks that were the M-1's raison d'^etre. Some ''smart'' weapons seem downright dumb. The Army's Copperhead artillery shell is meant to kill tanks by riding along a reflected laser beam. The soldier who aims the laser at the tank can be instantly detected by the night-vision devices standard on Soviet tanks, yet must hold the beam on the tank for 13 seconds, a suicidal task. Tactical flexibility and initiative are what compensate for the American Army's numerical inferiorities in Europe, as against the centralized rigidity of the Soviet command structure. How better to destroy that advantage than by forcing all decisions on a battlefield through central computers? How more certainly to guarantee fiasco than by relying on sensors that are bound to be confused in the chaos of battle and ''smart'' weapons likely to work one- tenth as well as the contractor promises? As shown in Lebanon and the Falklands, wars are won by tactics and training, not complex gadgets. When the internal goals of military bureaucracies make tactics subordinate to technology, high- tech weapons may mean only weaker defense.

1403-> AROUND THE WORLD; U.N. Chief and Andropov Discuss Afghan Situation
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met today with Yuri V. Andropov for talks that included what the Tass press agency called ''ways of normalizing the situation around Afghanistan.'' Tass gave no details of the discussion, which occurred during a visit that Mr. Perez de Cuellar is making here at Mr. Andropov's invitation. Western diplomats read the Tass account as an indication that there had been no breakthrough on Afghanistan. The United Nations has been seeking to mediate at talks in Geneva that have been conducted by Diego Cordovez, a United Nations Under Secretary General. Those efforts have been snagged by a number of obstacles, among them the refusal of the Afghan Government to consider a political accommodation with rebel forces. The Kremlin has backed the Afghan position, saying that Soviet soldiers will be withdrawn only when the rebel threat is ended.

1404-> Flexi-Van Sues Former Chairman
The Flexi-Van Corporation, an international transportation-leasing company, said it had filed suit against its former chairman, David H. Murdock, and other shareholders, charging them with violations of securities law in what it called ''an unlawful plan'' to take control of the company. Flexi-Van directors ousted Mr. Murdock as chairman last week, and said he would not be nominated for re-election to the board. Mr. Murdock controls more than 20 percent of the company's stock. The suit, filed in Federal court in New York, asks that Mr. Murdock, one of the nation's wealthiest and most active investors, and the other defendants be forced to divest themselves of the Flexi-Van shares they currently hold. It also asks the court to enjoin Mr. Murdock from acquiring any more shares or taking any other steps to gain control of the company.

1405-> ALLEN S. RUPLEY, EX-CHAIRMAN OF W.R. GRACE, IS DEAD AT 80
Allen S. Rupley, who rose from the mailroom to become chairman of the board of W.R. Grace & Company, died Saturday at Doctors Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Rupley, who was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., had recently retired after 65 years with Grace. He served as its chairman from 1966 to 1971 and also had been chairman of the Grace Foundation. He remained a member of the board and adviser to the company's present chairman, J. Peter Grace. After joining the company in 1917, he worked at the W.R. Grace & Company Bank and was named an assistant secretary in 1936. He was later transferred to assignments in Chile and Bolivia, and in 1940 was sent to San Francisco to manage the company's activities in Central America and on the Pacific Coast. Held Financial Posts He was named treasurer in 1948 and an executive vice president and chief financial officer in 1955. He was closely involved in Grace's initial investment in the chemical industry, which brought a reorientation of the company's business. Although he was not a college graduate, he received honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees from St. Peter's College and Colby College and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Notre Dame. He was a director of Marine Midland Banks and of the Grace Institute in Manhattan. He was also a member of India House and the Princeton Club of New York. Mr. Rupley is survived by his wife, Juliette; a son, John, of Tucson, Ariz., and a grandson. A memorial service will be held Thursday at 1 P.M. at the Episcopal Church of the Epiphany, York Avenue and 74th Street.

1406-> SENATE REMAINS VIDEO-SHY
WASHINGTON THE Senate, which appeared for a while to be on the verge of tiptoeing into the electronic age, is deadlocked again on the question of whether to televise its proceedings. Until recently, the Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, had hoped he had convinced his fellow senators to approve a one-year test. He still believes he has the votes for passage of the bill, but he also knows that he does not have enough votes to shut off a likely filibuster by opponents. It was four years ago that carefully controlled television coverage of House sessions was first made available to cable and commercial networks. Today, gavel-to-gavel House proceedings are viewed on more than a thousand cable systems. When the House's six remote-controlled cameras perched in the galleries first began recording floor proceedings, there was a bit of grandstanding. Now, no one seems to pay much attention to the cameras. In the beginning, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts pronounced the television experiment ''a total disaster.'' Now, he calls it ''an unqualified success.'' Live television coverage, says the Speaker, ''has relegated the Senate to second place in the evening news.'' No one is more aware of that ''second place'' standing than Senator Baker. ''I don't begrudge the House that recognition or the public attention it has gained,'' he says. ''But it does mean that if we don't get television in the Senate in a decade or less, the House will be the dominant partner in the Congressional branch.'' Such arguments have failed to sway the more tradition-minded senators. There are those who fear that, for one thing, Presidential hopefuls in their midst might try to use the Senate as a ''bully pulpit'' in their campaigns. Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, an early opponent of television in the Senate, used to complain that the presence of cameras would prompt many of his colleagues to get their ''hair fluffed'' and their ''shoes shined.'' Now, he is a convert. Some months ago, he says, he learned ''to my utter surprise and complete disgust'' that senators often go to the office of the official reporters of debate and delete whole sections of their floor remarks before the material is sent to the printers of the Congressional Record. Only by allowing the televising of floor action, he says, can there be a ''permanent, accurate, dependable'' record of Senate proceedings.

1407-> NATION'S EDUCATIONAL OUTLAY LIKELY TO REACH $230 BILLION
Spending for education is expected to reach $230 billion in the new school year, as against $215 billion last year, while enrollment will drop 1 percent, Secretary of Education T. H. Bell said today. He made public an annual Department of Education forecast that said enrollment in the nation's schools and colleges is expected to approach 56.7 million this fall, or 400,000 less than the 57.1 million students enrolled in the fall of 1982. ''Education in the fall of 1983 will be the primary activity of more than 60.2 million Americans,'' Mr. Bell said. ''In a nation with a population of 234 million, more than one of four persons will be a direct participant in the educational process. And that figure rises to nearly 3 of 10 when support staffs of our nation's schools and colleges are included.'' More Than 3 Million Teachers He said nearly 3.3 million people would be employed as classroom teachers and an additional 300,000 would be working as superintendents, principals, supervisors and other member of instructional staffs. Elementary and secondary schools are expected to spend $141 billion in the coming school year, while the spending of colleges and universities is epected to reach $89 billion. Public schools and colleges will spend nearly $184 billion in 1983-84, while privately controlled institutions are expected to disburse more than $46 billion. Of the $230 billion to be spent on education, an estimated 9 percent will come from the Federal Government, 39 percent from state governments, 24 percent from local governments and 28 percent from other sources, such as tuition and fees, endowment earnings and private gifts and grants, Mr. Bell said. Fewer Grade Schoolers Expected Enrollment in elementary schools is expected to decrease from 30.9 million in the fall of 1982 to 30.8 million this fall. Small annual decreases in elementary enrollment have been occurring since 1969, he said, reflecting the continuing decline in the number of children aged 5 to 13. This trend is expected to reverse in the mid-1980's, with modest increases at the end of the decade. A decline from 13.8 million high school students in 1982 to 13.5 million this fall is forecast. High school enrollment reached a peak for recent years in the fall of 1976 and since then has dropped slightly each year, Mr. Bell said. Further reductions in enrollment in the ninth through 12th grades are expected in most of the 1980's. Enrollment in institutions of higher learning reached a high of more than 12.4 million in the fall of 1982; enrollment this fall is expected to be close to that number. The college-age population is expected to decline in the rest of this decade though remaining relatively high because of increased attendance by older students, part-time students, women and minority groups. Slight Drop in High-School Classes The graduating class from public and private high schools in 1984 is expected to total 2.7 million, compared to some 2.8 million in 1983. The peak year for high school graduates was 1977, when 3.16 million people received diplomas. Estimates for the number of earned degrees in the 1983-84 year are: bachelor's degrees, 980,000; master's degrees, 300,000; doctor's degrees, 33,000; and first-professional degrees, 75,000. That represents a high point for bachelor's and first-professional degrees while the number of master's and doctor's degrees is likely to be down slightly from records attained in 1977 and 1973.

1409-> 60-Second Debate; Should Congress veto a Federal Trade Commission rule to require undertakers to itemize prices?
Michael Pertschuk Federal Trade Commissioner: No. Last year, more than two million families faced the painful task of arranging a funeral, many for the first time. Most ended up paying for an elaborate ''package'' funeral. Some families doubtless wanted a full ''traditional'' funeral. But many others were simply presented with no other choice, were provided no price listing of the separate parts of a funeral, and were given no freedom to choose a more simple set of arrangements. Some were simply not told the truth about the law's requirements. The F.T.C. rule introduces some minimal constraints into this awkward and expensive consumer purchase. It would burden no conscientious funeral director. It bars such gross deceptions as representations that embalming is required by law (it usually isn't), that a casket is required for cremation (not true), or that a ''sealed'' casket will preserve the body (unhappily, it won't). Most importantly, it requires consumers to be given an itemized price list before deciding what to buy, and the right to choose the funeral they want. As you read this, every member of Congress is hearing from his or her district's funeral directors. They are politically active; they are by avocation consoling and persuasive; they are generous with their campaign contributions. This year, let the members of Congress be courteous and kind to their funeral directors, but please let them vote their conscience. Marty Russo Democratic Representative, Illinois Yes. Congress should reject the Federal Trade Commission's proposed funeral rule. The commission has not assembled a body of evidence justifying Federal intervention. In this regard, the commission's own comments are instructive. After spending well over $1 million and several years investigating the funeral industry, the following statement appears in the F.T.C.'s final report. ''Even without verification of these statistics, the only fair conclusion which can be drawn from the record evidence is that the number of consumer complaints filed against funeral directors is indeed modest and consumers are generally satisfied.'' This comment can hardly be characterized as a compelling one to accept the need for Federal regulation. I supported the Commission's used car rule and resisted the stripping of the F.T.C.'s jurisdiction over the professions. But before extending its reach over an industry, particularly one already regulated at the state and local level, the agency involved should demonstrate the existence of a nationwide pattern of abuse that requires a corrective response at the national level. The F.T.C. has not proved that such a condition exists. When the F.T.C. proposes a rule based on insufficient evidence, it leaves itself vulnerable to those who would prefer a crippled agency. Such a result would be a tragedy for American consumers.

1410-> BALLET: HAMBURG GIVES NEUMEIER'S 'MATTHEW PASSION'
BACH'S ''Saint Matthew Passion,'' as choreographed by the Hamburg Ballet's artistic director, John Neumeier, is not your everyday dance or musical event. The four-hour and one-time-only performance in New York attracted a capacity house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Sunday afternoon. Mr. Neumeier, an American, first staged his dance version of Bach's great work in a church in Hamburg and then transferred it to the stage. Although the Passion of Christ is his subject matter, as it is Bach's, his staging is a theatrical production, as secular as Bach's own musical masterpiece has become. It is our own secular age, in fact, that was obviously Mr. Neumeier's first hurdle in approaching the score. To pretend he has matched Bach on his own level would be misleading. But he has created a mimed and danced mystery play for our own prosaic age, and there is no question that many in the audience were deeply moved by a staging that was always intense and performed with obvious conviction. Mr. Neumeier personally received a cheering reception, and a basket of flowers brought on stage yielded a banner that said, ''Bravo Neumeier.'' Mr. Neumeier has functioned as a first-rate theatrical director here. His sense of drama never left him and his sensitivity to the emotions expressed in this retelling of Christ's last days was always evident. Despite its length, Mr. Neumeier's production could hardly be called as monumental as its music. In essence, he has given us a very American view, and actually, a very American modern-dance production in macrocosm. Repeatedly one recalled the Bach stagings of the American modern-dance pioneer Doris Humphrey. There was the same use of plaform steps to keep the dancers at several levels, the same allpurpose props rearranged to dramatic point. Instead of Miss Humphrey's boxes, Mr. Neumeier used benches (Miss Humphrey's copioneer and collaborator also once attempted the ''Saint Matthew Passion''). There was also the same formal arrangement of groups into units. And there was the same sense of re-enacted primitive folk ritual that early American modern dance made so emphatically its emblem. If Mr. Neumeier's subconscious esthetic roots surfaced here so sharply, it must also be said that his instincts were right. The very grandeur of Bach's conception had to be complemented not by grandeur but by simplicity. And so Mr. Neumeier's own concept of young men and young women in white, in a plain-garb retelling of the Gospel according to Matthew, strikes the right note. The dancers are anonymous although their roles are recognizable. We know who the disciples are generically, although the text is necessary to know which disciple is which. Mr. Neumeier himself played Christ, a role he does not usually portray, and he did so with fervor. Ivan Liska lent his eye-riveting presence in the double role of Judas and Pilate, an identification Mr. Neumeier did not develop. Most of the action followed the text in a less than literal way. The arias, or digressions, tempted Mr. Neumeier into some pure-dance sections for a group of women on toe, passages that were his weak point. The other dancers were either barefoot or wearing sneakers. This tendency of Mr. Neumeier's to compartmentalize dancers according to idiom and style frequently works, as happened here, against his own strivings toward maximum expressivity. There were high spots and low. It seemed a mistake to turn literal in the scene in which Christ is tortured and to straitjacket him by placing his trouser leg over his head and arm. There were also strange digressions - a man dancing in one toe shoe. By contrast, the lamentation scenes, especially led by Beatrice Cordua and Margaret McLaughlin, were touching, just as the mob hysteria, with phalanxes of dancers streaming down the steps, touched a raw nerve. The music was heard on tape, recorded during a concert in Saint Michael Church in Hamburg. Whatever the personal response to Mr. Neumeier's production, it could only be called admirable.

1411-> SALVADORANS PLAN 2-TRACK CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT REBELS
El Salvador's armed forces, prodded by the Reagan Administration, are planning a major drive to destroy guerrilla base camps and to separate civilians from the guerrillas, according to Salvadoran and United States officials. The officials say the military and civic campaign, along lines similar to the ''rural pacification'' program used by the United States in Vietnam, is tied to a sharp increase in aid that the Administration hopes will be approved by Congress. The operation, they say, will begin with a military sweep through the rich agricultural provinces of San Vicente and Usulutan, where the guerrillas have recently been most active. The military campaign is to be followed by a rigorous economic redevelopment program, assisted by Americans, to prove that ''the army is part of the solution, not part of the problem,'' according to an official close to the planning. Some Officials See Risks The Salvadoran and United States officials said they believed such a campaign offered El Salvador the best chance to regain the upper hand in a military situation that has deteriorated since last October. Some officials, however, said the plan was risky. They said it would be difficult for the armed forces to concentrate on one region without leaving other provinces vulnerable to guerrilla attack. In addition, separating civilians from the insurgents will be difficult and could result in an increase in human rights abuses. Alvaro Magana, El Salvador's provisonal President, said, ''We have come to the conclusion that the best possibility we have for a total recovery of these areas is to have the army stay and guarantee a reasonable climate and at the same time start these programs.'' When It Will Start ''It is very difficult to find a solution to our problems if we continue to fight this war in the way we have fought it in the past,'' he added. The first phase of the campaign, a military sweep and consolidation of the paramilitary forces, will begin in the next couple of months and will take more than a third of the country's 22,400-member army. The State Department's Agency for International Development will give both aid and manpower for the campaign's second phase, the economic redevelopment, which includes providing medical care, rebuilding schools and bridges and creating jobs. ''If it's safe to have people out there we would do it,'' Deane R. Hinton, the United States Ambassador, said. ''A.I.D.'s had people all over the country, but what's new is that somebody would live out there regularly.'' The Salvadoran and United States officials said the strategy of combined military and civic action was similar to the pacification program in Vietnam that tried to care for war victims, promote economic development and eliminate the Vietcong underground organization. But the officials said the program had been tailored to the situation in El Salvador. ''I don't know much about Vietnam,'' Mr. Hinton said. ''But it seems to me that the doctrine or philosophy of how you deal with these insurgencies is applicable with some variations elsewhere. The proper question is, 'Did the basic concept make sense?' '' U.S. Aid Called Crucial The total of $136.3 million in proposed military aid for this fiscal year and $227.1 million in economic aid is viewed as crucial to the operation. President Reagan proposed the aid package in a speech Thursday, saying the nations of Central American are facing ''the gravest crisis in their history.'' The United States is pushing for early elections and for the major military-civic campaign to stabilize the country before the Presidential elections in the United States, according to an American official here. The Reagan Administration, he said, is ''going for broke'' in El Salvador. Salvadoran and United States officials said the idea for the basic campaign was developed separately by three groups. The State Department wrote one plan, the embassy made suggestions of its own and, in a class directed by American military advisers last year, a group of majors in the Salvadoran Army developed their own program. The big push for the campaign began last October. 'Pick Something and Do It Right' ''The basic concept is pretty simple,'' Mr. Hinton said. ''You can't do everything so pick something and do it right.'' Already, according to Mr. Magana, some privates and corporals are being trained to evaluate the needs of the civilian population as they accompany the army during the military sweep. The recently named Salvadoran National Commission for Regional Restoration will be in charge of coordinating the civilian programs, along with A.I.D. A commander for the entire operation will be appointed shortly, according to Mr. Magana. A critical aspect of the program that has not been fully worked out involves the country's civil defense forces, which will eventually be responsible for the region's security. In the past, civil defense forces, who are appointed by local commanders, have been involved in many cases of desertion and human rights abuses. United States officials want the civilian population to choose the civil defense force, but the Salvadorans resist this. One United States official said that there were 2,000 civil defense troops in San Vicente and Usulutan and that these would have to be increased considerably to secure the region. Guerrilla Strongholds Usulutan and San Vicente, which have 13 percent of the country's population, were chosen because of their agricultural importance. In addition, two bridges across the Rio Lempa between the two provinces link eastern El Salvador to the country's heartland. Moreover, the southern part of Usulutan and the northern region of San Vicente are strongholds for the guerrillas. Their bases in those areas are used by patrols that disrupt traffic on the nation's two main highways and destroy crops. In addition, they are used to pass supplies arriving on the Pacific coast to northern El Salvador. ''The assumptions are that the guerrillas are out to destroy the economy,'' said one military official, ''and to separate the east from the west. ''What do you do?'' he asked. ''I don't believe there is a purely military solution. You have got to do things: land reform, economic reform, civic action. You have got to kill guerrillas, destroy their will and take some of their dedication.'' A major obstacle, according to a Western political analyst, is how to separate the guerrillas from the civilian population. Many parts of southern Usulutan, for example, have been guerrilla-controlled for more than a year, and the leftists have become an ingrained part of the local economy. Asked how how the separation would be effected, one official said it would be a case of ''you are either with us or against us.'' He said a weakness of the campaign was that following this doctrine without violating human rights was difficult. In addition, he added, as long as the army is concentrating on San Vicente and Usulutan, the guerrillas could strike elsewhere.

1414-> MOUNTING DEFICIT ENDANGERS CONNECTICUT PRISON INDUSTRY
The Connecticut Correction Department's prison industries fund is in a ''dangerous situation'' because of mounting deficits, including an $800,000 shortfall last year, state auditors have reported. The auditors urged that the program be restructured financially because it showed little prospect of becoming solvent under its present form. The audit also uncovered two cases in which prisoners were used to perform work illegally for the personal benefit of government officials. One of the officials, Raymond Lopes, a deputy correction commissioner, has been disciplined as a result. The auditors also said the department should stop selling agricultural products to farmers because the law establishing the prison industries program requires that all products be sold to government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Fund's Deficit Is Increasing The program is supposed to be a revolving fund from which state tax funds are withdrawn to pay for operations, but are repaid when sales are made. The program, however, is not paying its own way, as was intended. The fund, which operates such industries as furniture making and farming at the state prisons in Somers, Enfield, Cheshire and Niantic, recorded a deficit of $645,547 in 1980, $553,405 in 1981 and $810,126 in 1982, according to the audit. The deficit has mounted despite an increase in sales from $2.1 million in 1980 to $2.8 million in 1982. The fund ''cannot continue to operate as it presently does'' because of the deficits, the auditors, Leo Donohue and Henry Becker, said in their written report. ''It is apparent that sales are not meeting expenses, and there does not seem to be a reversal of this trend in sight,'' the auditors said. ''It appears that the main concern is that of keeping the inmates working and not of making a financial profit.'' Auditors Propose Changes The auditors' recommendation said, ''Supportive funding, economy of operations or increased sales prices, or combinations thereof, are needed to improve the fund's condition.'' They also said the billing operation was sloppy. The auditors found that 16 of the 46 customers they had contacted reported the Correction Department records showed incorrect balances on their accounts. The Correction Commissioner, John R. Manson, said he believed that the fund could not become self-supporting unless salaries of at least some of the shop supervisors who oversee prisoners' work were paid from the state's general fund instead of from the industries fund. ''That is what other states are doing and that is what we have asked the Office of Policy and Management to do for six years now,'' he said. ''It's a tough nut to crack.'' Mr. Manson said he took ''corrective'' action against Mr. Lopes after learning that the deputy commissioner had two chairs repaired at the upholstery shop in the maximum-security Somers State Prison. But Mr. Manson, saying it was a personnel matter, declined to say what action he had taken. Mr. Lopes insisted he did not know in advance that the work was to be done in a prison shop, Mr. Manson said.

1415-> PERSPECTIVES; INVESTMENTS IN JAMAICA'S HOUSING
''Everything is 15 years behind,'' Morton Pickman, who owns four apartment houses in Jamaica, Queens, said in a tone of regret. Anyone who owns property in downtown Jamaica must wish that the ambitious redevelopment effort under way there had started sooner and been finished 10 or 15 years ago - in time perhaps to soften or offset the effects of the downturn in the 1970's. Fortunately for Jamaica, Ray Rothschild and Michael Partridge have not timed their investments in housing to the pace of public development. The two men represent what boosters in the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation hope is the vanguard of private investors who will ultimately be lured to Jamaica by the improvements in transit and education and a big growth in public employment. All this should stimulate private-sector development and more jobs. And that should further invigorate central Jamaica's substantial multifamily housing stock. Mr. Rothschild and Mr. Partridge are already engaged in buying and improving apartments there. A dozen years ago they might have been described as a ''new breed'' of landlord in the city - newcomers willing to put capital into improving buildings in an older, racially mixed urban neighborhood. Actually, they are closer to an old breed. Mr. Rothschild has systematically expanded a portfolio of properties in an area where purchase price relative to long-term prospects for appreciation looked favorable. He explained in an interview the attitudes, objectives and experiences of an entrepreneur at work in an integrated area of the city with a growing middle-income population of Caribbean and American blacks and Hispanics and Asians. ''I'm not so much concerned about immediate cash flow,'' he said. ''We can afford to 'carry' a building with a negative cash flow.'' Compared with Elizabeth, N.J., and Harlem, where he also has owned property, ''I thought the opportunity was better,'' he said. He began in 1975 with the purchase of a 34-unit four-story walk-up at 8818 150th Street. Each investment has been larger than the one before, until he now owns five properties with a total of 329 apartments. The largest purchase was the most recent -the 112-unit building at 9036 149th Street, acquired in 1981. His 31-year-old son, Alan, works with him in supervising construction work and managing the buildings. As for Mr. Partridge, he began in 1976 and has gradually acquired and rehabilitated six buildings with 450 apartments. His next project is a 54-unit building at 166-05 89th Avenue. Mr. Partridge, 42, was a real-estate manager and broker elsewhere in Queens before he started investing in Jamaica. Mr. Rothschild, an accountant by training who also runs a small chemical company in New Jersey, began a second career in housing by answering a newspaper advertisement from an owner looking for a purchaser of a half interest in a 65-unit apartment house in Harlem. Later, encouraged by his son's interest, he expanded his activities. He doesn't believe in absentee ownership. Though their offices are in East Brunswick, N.J., the younger Mr. Rothschild is at the properties four days a week. They do their own management. As with many older buildings, there are structural and repair problems. Historically, the better the building the slower the turnover and hence the slower the pace of pick-up in the rent roll. Many buildings have a large population of elderly whites whose rents are low but who may be paying a high percentage of their income in rent. Vacancies were already at an unacceptable 20 percent when the Rothschilds acquired their first property, on 150th Street. The tenancy was 30 percent white and the rest black and Hispanic. The Rothschilds went to work. They put in new plumbing, new bathrooms, new kitchen fixtures, new mailboxes, storm windows and a new roof. ''When we bought it, the highest rent for a one-bedroom apartment was $180,'' Mr. Rothschild said. ''We were proud as a king when we got $220.'' Now a vacant apartment is worth about $330 a month. Apartments that tend to turn over have done so with sufficient frequency to allow owners to get market rent despite rent stabilization's limits on what can be charged in vacant apartments. ON a visit to another of his buildings, Mr. Rothschild greeted a y oung white tenant with an infant in her arms. She was the daughter o f an elderly rent-controlled tenant who had passed the low-rent a partment on to her. New minority tenants tend to pay higher rents and often have higher incomes. Among the Rothschilds' minority tenants are a credit analyst at Citibank, an airlines officer, a member of the Liberian Mission to the United Nations, a sales manager for a chemical company, an electrician, cabdrivers, security personnel and many nurses from Mary Immaculate Hospital, a major Jamaica employer. In another Rothschild property - 89-11 153d Street, with 91 apartments and 18 ''empties'' at the time of purchase - about 70 percent of the occupants were retired whites at the time of purchase. Many had incomes close to the poverty line. After rehabilitation, the incoming minority tenants typically have incomes of $25,000 to $35,000 a year, Mr. Rothschild estimated. A vacant one-bedroom apartment, if it had been rent-controlled, rents for about $440 a month. A two-bedroom rents for about $550. These are solid, six-story masonry buildings, usually with spacious rooms and kitchens. With new heating systems the cost of fuel can often be cut by 30 percent, Mr. Rothschild said. The sharp rise in fuel prices starting in 1973 was a blow from which many older buildings never recovered, despite belated city efforts to ''pass along'' fuel increases to tenants. Now that fuel prices are declining, the phasing out of the passalong sometimes gives rent-controlled tenants a net reduction in rent despite regular increases built into the ''maximum base rent'' system. The Rothschilds emphasize security and strong management. Tenants are issued special door keys - one to each family member over the age of 12 - that cannot be duplicated by a locksmith. And each occupant's name and age is listed on the lease, a method of discouraging excess occupancy. New tenants are not permitted to keep dogs. Like all active landlords, the Rothschilds are concerned with prompt rent collection. It is a problem with 5 percent of their tenants, they say. This means that Alan Rothschild, who works full time at management, must spend 20 to 30 hours a month in court, he said. Meanwhile, the major development projects move forward. A subway extension that started in 1972 is expected to be partially in operation in 1985 and fully in 1986. The main academic building for York College is a year or two from completion. And the Federal Government is expected to break ground within months on a $93 million Social Security Administration building, which will employ 3,000 people year round. As the housing market has improved, owners of long standing have become encouraged to see greater potential value in their own buildings. Asked whether he might try to convert any of his Jamaica properties to a cooperative, a popular technique elsewhere in Queens, Mr. Pickman said: ''I think about it. There may be a possibility.''

1416-> GARDENING; HARDIER CAMELLIAS FOR COOLER CLIMES
TWO new hardy camellias bred from fall-blooming species may extend the cultural range of this handsome evergreen beyond the Mason-Dixon line. Although the new camellias, named Frost Prince and Frost Princess, are not yet available to the public, cuttings and scions have been released to plant breeders and nurserymen by the United States National Arboretum in Washington. Home gardeners may soon be able to buy the new plants. Most camellia fanciers favor the spring-flowering species because the flowers are larger and more impressive. The new camellias' flowers are GARDENING about three inches wide and deep pink. They were bred by Dr. William C. Ackerman, research horticulturist at the arboretum. According to Dr. Ackerman both camellias showed little or no damage despite severe winters with temperatures as low as -4 degrees. In spite of this breakthrough, northeastern gardeners persist in trying to grow the more traditional spring-flowering camellias. Martin D. Bernstein, an amateur gardener in the Bronx, has been growing camellias for about 10 years and has kept data on at least 45 different cultivars. Despite some failures he remains undaunted about growing these plants up North and tries and tries again. ''The winter of 1981-82 was very severe and I lost seven out of 32 cultivars,'' he said. This past winter was much kinder, and more of Mr. Bernstein's plants came through. The normal camellia-blooming season for Mr. Bernstein's plants ranges from mid-April into early May. Here are some other tips from Mr. Bernstein: Choose camellias known to be cold-hardy, that is the late-blooming species that keep their buds tight until the late spring frosts pass. Do not uncover camellias until you are certain there will be no more weather below 20 degrees. Site is also important according to Mr. Bernstein. ''My feeling and experience has been the sunnier the better for the camellias,'' he said. The camellias must also have some shelter, either a corner protected on two sides or a building wall, out of direct wind. Mr. Bernstein has evolved an elaborate cover-up for his plants, consisting of a plastic wrap supported by tent grommets kept as close to the plants as possible. This cylinder is filled with leaves but is left open on top. Larger plants up to four feet in spread he covers with burlap, lightly tucked in so the plants have ventilation. A handsome new book, ''Colour Dictionary of Camellias'' by Stirling Macoboy, deals with almost 2,000 species and cultivars.

1417-> PERSONAL FINANCE; HANDLING ELEVENTH-HOUR TAX SNAGS
WITH the deadline for filing tax returns just a month away, most p eople are scurrying to tie up loose ends so they can get their r eturns in on time. While most of the paperwork involves r ecapitulating (or embroidering upon) the details of one's financial l ife during 1982, there is still time for one perfectly legal m aneuver that can save self-employed people who failed to set up a K eogh retirement plan by year-end a bundle on their taxes. Below are d etails on how Simplified Employee Pension plans work, as well as a dvice on how to handle some other knotty tax problems -such as lost W 2 forms and other financial records -that often pop up at the last m inute. S.E.P.'S AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR KEOGHS. You're self-employed, and business was going like gangbusters in December, so you neglected to set up a Keogh plan. Now you've lost out on a golden opportunity to claim a deduction of as much as 15 percent of your net income, up to a maximum of $15,000, for your contribution to the tax-deferred retirement account, right? Wrong. You still have a chance to set up a Simplified Employee Pension plan, or S.E.P. Under the law, a Keogh plan must be established by the end of the year for which a deduction is being claimed, even though contributions to the plan can be made until the due date for filing the return, normally April 15 of the following year. But an S.E.P. is like a giant Individual Retirement Account, and follows the same timing rules that govern I.R.A. contributions. This means that taxpayers have until April 15 both to establish and finance an S.E.P. S.E.P.'s, created to encourage small employers to establish pension plans for workers, are generally viewed as something to be used by businesses with several employees, although accountants have criticized their administrative burdens as being too onerous. But S.E.P.'s can also be used by sole proprietors with no employees other than themselves. In fact, ''that's the perfect application,'' says Edward Mendlowitz, a partner in the New York City accounting firm of Siegel & Mendlowitz. Furthermore, notes Harold Danker of the Washington office of Coopers & Lybrand, a large accounting firm, self-employed persons can claim a deduction for contributions to both an S.E.P. and an I.R.A. This means that their 1982 deductions for contributions to their personal retirement accounts could come to as much as $15,000 for the S.E.P. and another $2,000 for the I.R.A. But an S.E.P. is not an unalloyed benefit, particularly if your business has several employees. One reason is that the plan must not be restricted to only high-paid employees and must cover certain employees who worked for you during three of the five preceding years. ''There's a whole bunch of nonsense you have to put up with,'' says Mr. Danker, who notes that Keogh plans are a much more attractive and flexible retirement vehicle, particularly beginning in 1984, when the contribution limits will rise significantly. Probably the best idea, he says, is to set up an S.E.P. for 1982 and then ''junk it and do something better later on.'' NOT ENOUGH TIME TO FILE. You haven't started hunkering down with your 1040 yet, and now you realize it's going to take you at least a month to finish the job. Don't worry: Fill out Form 4868. You'll automatically get an extra four months to hand in your return, no questions asked. Previously, taxpayers received only a two-month automatic extension by sending in the form. But this year, the Internal Revenue Service extended the deadline by another two months to, among other things, spread its workload. If you find that the new grace period still is not enough, you may be able to qualify for an additional two-month extension by filling out Form 2688. But this extension is not automatic and you must demonstrate ''undue hardship'' - for example, serious illness - to qualify. But that may be tougher in theory than in practice. One New York accounting firm, for example, which says that more than onethird of its clients routinely get extra extensions, has preprinted notices that it sends to the I.R.S., claiming that the firm was ''too busy'' to prepare its clients' returns in timely fashion. In any case, Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the I.R.S., notes that the forms grant people an ''extension of time to file, not an extension of time to pay.'' You should pay the full amount of any tax you estimate you owe at the time you file the form. If you pay less than the full amount of the tax, you will be charged interest (16 percent a year, compounded daily) on the unpaid amount. One consolation: The interest is deductible. The bad news is that you will also be charged a nondeductible late-payment penalty of onehalf of 1 percent a month on the balance owed, if you fail to pay at least 90 percent of the tax finally due. A MISSING W2 FORM. What should you do if you can't file because you never received a W2 form from your employer? Fill out Form 4852, and try to reconstruct your 1982 earnings and taxes withheld, perhaps by multiplying a weekly paystub by 52. NO MONEY TO PAY YOUR TAX. What is the best course of action if you don't have the money to pay your entire tax bill at the time you file your return, or when you request an extension? First, do not keep your financial difficulties to yourself, advises Mr. Fadely of the I.R.S. ''If it's a temporary problem, pay what you can and attach a statement saying that you'll send the rest when you can - say in another couple of weeks,'' he suggests. If your financial hardships are severe, and there's no prospect of your being able to pay your tax bill in the near future, you might be able to qualify for an installment agreement. This allows you to pay off your tax liability gradually, over a period of time, depending on the deal you strike with the Government. The I.R.S. used to routinely grant this special treatment to firsttime tax delinquents as well as certain other taxpayers, until the General Accounting Office criticized it for being too lax. Now, says Mr. Fadely, this arrangement is available on a case-by-case basis ''based on your ability not to pay.'' The I.R.S. will first look at your income, savings and ability to liquidate any assets before it will consider granting an installment agreement. Even if you qualify for an extended payment arrangement, you will still be liable for interest on the unpaid amount and may also be subject to a penalty of one-half of 1 percent for failure to pay your tax on time. Occasionally, however, the I.R.S. will waive the penalty in special ''hardship'' situations, where you can show reasonable cause for your failure to pay, such as a casualty that destroys your house, or serious illness in the family. But the actual decision is left to the discretion of the local I.R.S. office that processes your return,

1418-> FLORENCE KNOLL: FORM, NOT FASHION
''YES, it was an exciting time,'' said Florence Knoll. ''But it was mostly hard work. We had to battle the prejudice against contemporary design.'' It is now hard to remember a time when modernism was not the design norm in the United States for commercial interiors. But Florence Knoll of Knoll Associates was one of a small group of designers in what she calls the ''architectural furniture world'' who made modernism practicable. After the World War II and through the 1950's, she was the central design force at Knoll when the company itself emerged as a central force innovating interiors and furniture. Tonight, at an awards dinner at the American Museum of Natural History, Florence Knoll Bassett is to receive one of the Rhode Island School of Design's annual Athena awards, for creativity and excellence in the world of art and design. Also receiving awards will be the architect Philip Johnson and Geraldine Stutz, president of Henri Bendel. A corporate Athena award will be given to the International Business Machines Corporation. Although the revolution in modern architecture may have begun decades earlier, it was not until 1946, when Florence Schust and her future husband, Hans Knoll, formed New York's Knoll Associates, that modern architecture in the United States started to become a furnished reality. Previously, chairs, tables and fabrics suitable for modern interiors simply did not exist on a dependable commercial basis in significant, reasonably priced quantity. Knoll was one of the very few companies, along with Herman Miller Inc. of Zeeland, Mich., to recognize, anticipate and, to a certain extent, create the need for modern furniture by aggressively promoting contemporary interiors. For 20 years, until Mrs. Knoll's retirement in 1960 as president and her final withdrawal from the company in 1965, she was the ''eye'' of Knoll. In addition to her interior designs, she had the power to approve everything about Knoll that would be seen by the public - from furniture to stationery to advertisements. She waged the battle for contemporary design from two positions within the company - as head of the interior design division called the Planning Unit and as an in-house consultant to other designers. Her husband handled the firm's business affairs until his death in 1955. Reached last weekend on a skiing vacation in New Hampshire, Mrs. Knoll said, ''Everything I did was based on my architectural training.'' Born in Michigan, she trained as an architect and designer at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and then at the Architectural Association in London and the Illinois Institute of Technology, where she studied with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. She started her professional career working with the architectural firms of Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Boston and then for Wallace Harrison in New York. ''Being a woman, I was given interiors,'' she said. Unlike a decorator, however, she used an architectural approach in designing interiors, integrating lighting, ducts and outlets, as well as furniture, colors and fabrics, into what became a total design. At Cranbrook, according to Mrs. Knoll, ''everybody was interested in everything, from weaving, pottery, architecture and city planning to furniture.'' For Knoll she conceived total-design showrooms that integrated various disciplines. The showrooms were not only marketing stages for the firm's line of chairs -among them, Mies's Barcelona chair - but also spaces intended to win over clients to contemporary design. Mrs. Knoll's Planning Unit pioneered studies to determine how work procedures affect office furniture and layouts. ''I was never really a furniture designer,'' she said, ''but designed furniture to fill in the gaps when no other suitable furniture was available.'' Some of these ''background'' pieces have become prototypes of furniture still in production by Knoll - pieces usually designed in modular ''architectural'' parts that could be efficiently stored until assembly. Mrs. Knoll's Planning Unit had many major interiors to its design credit, including the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company in Bloomfield, Conn. But since the completion of the interiors for the CBS headquarters in New York in 1965, she has lived primarily in Florida, where she has continued to be active as a designer. In 1958, she married Harry Hood Bassett, a Florida banker. Currently she is working with two interior design firms on the interiors of a 52-story office building in Miami for the Southeast Bank Corporation. Mrs. Knoll remains quite outspoken in her opinions about furniture and architectural design. ''We're due for a change,'' she said, ''but I think today's furniture designs and architectural styles are only interim solutions for things to come. Naturally, there is always a continuation of the better designs of the past - at Knoll the actual basic furniture is still there.'' Mrs. Knoll, one of the great exponents of modernism, is skeptical about post-modernism, which, she said, ''caricaturizes the past without complementing it.'' Her criticisms of post-modernism reveal the criteria by which she designed her interiors and judged the designs that became Knoll furniture. ''Post-modernism is Potemkin architecture,'' she said, ''false facades built so Catherine the Great couldn't see the reality behind.'' Recent avant-garde furniture design, with its emphasis on form, ''is not based on principle but on design fashion,'' she added. ''Some of the pieces designed today, with their lavish use of such expensive materials as marble, make the cost of production high and unrealistic for mass production.'' And, she asked, ''Have you ever sat in a Michael Graves chair? There's no thought about pitch and comfort and little relationship to industrical production - it's really arts-and-crafts design. We worked months, sometimes years, on the comfort of a chair - the arm heights, the pitch.'' Mrs. Knoll added that sometimes a chair designer also devised the system of production for the chair. Mrs. Knoll predicted that new furniture would evolve not from style but from new materials, architectural requirements, living and working habits and new equipment such as the computer.

1419-> LONG ISLANDERS; IN WHATEVER FORM, THEATER'S THE THING
''I think I've been one of the luckiest humans alive,'' said Arthur Whitelaw. ''Everything I've dreamt I'd do, I did.'' And when Mr. Whitelaw, who grew up in Roslyn, turns 43 tomorrow, there will be a lot for him to look back on. The the dreams he realized - and is still realizing - are concerned with show business. Mr. Whitelaw has been interested in theater since his childhood. ''I knew I was going to go into it in some form or other when I was 5 years old,'' he said. As a matter of fact, he has been in it in many forms: radio, television, movies, the stage. At 13, pretending to be older, he got a job as an apprentice at the Sea Cliff Theater, where he worked for three years and met such stars as Basil Rathbone, Billie Burke, Dolores Del Rio and Donald Cook. At 16 he had a radio program on WKIT in Westbury. After graduating from Roslyn High School in 1957, he studied theater at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., but dropped out to study acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He had already obtained roles on radio and television. ''I didn't know quite what I wanted to do,'' he said. Next he opened his own summer theater, the Marymead Playhouse in Smithtown, and he helped found the Mineola Playhouse. He worked as a Broadway press agent, and finally he decided to be a producer. In his first outing, Mr. Whitelaw presented ''Best Foot Forward,'' which marked the stage debut of Liza Minnelli, Christopher Walken and David Hartman. To make a long story short, yes, there have been some flops. But Mr. Whitelaw, whose Hollywood tenure included production work on the ''Planet of the Apes'' series, is also the man helped give the theater ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' (which once had 13 companies simultaneously playing the United States and seven more overseas); ''Butterflies Are Free'' and ''Strider.'' This season, he has been represented on Broadway at the Lamb's Theater as the director and a co-writer of ''Snoopy,'' another musical derived from the popular ''Peanuts'' comic strip. And he has devoted a good deal of time in the last three years to developing theater properties for the cable television service Home Box Office, among them a production of Terence Rattigan's ''Separate Tables,'' with Alan Bates, Julie Christie, Claire Bloom and Irene Worth, that is scheduled for broadcast March 14. ''I'm very proud of the work we've done for H.B.O.,'' said Mr. Whitelaw, comparing production for cable television with production for the theater. ''They're there forever,'' he said of works for television, ''unlike the theater, where once a work is finished and the curtain comes down and the scenery is carted off to New Jersey to be burned, all you have is memories.'' ''I'm interested in entertainment in all forms,'' Mr. Whitelaw said. It is an interest that was stimulated by his parents, Fred Neitlich and the former Lee Whitelaw. A native of New York, where he now lives as a bachelor, he was 3 when his parents began taking him to the theater in Brooklyn, where they then lived. He was given piano lessons and dancing lessons, and he remembers giving a recital at the Brooklyn Academy of Music at the age of 5. ''I remember my mother and father taking me there and walking backstage and looking back up at contraptions and flies,'' he said, ''and the feeling came over me that that was the world I was going to live in.''

1420-> Dr. Knobler Wed To an Economist
Dr. Joanna Knobler, a psychiatrist on the teaching staff of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was married yesterday to Ira Kawaller, director of the New York office of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Cantor Ellen Math of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue performed the ceremony in the Rainbow Grill. The bride, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred E. Knobler of New York, graduated from Radcliffe College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. Her father is president of the Pilgrim Glass Corporation in Ceredo, W.Va., manufacturer of handblown glass. Her mother, Selma Knobler, teaches early childhood education at the Bank Street College of Education. The bridegroom, formerly an economist with the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Connecticut and received his doctorate in economics from Purdue University. His previous marriage ended in divorce. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Kawaller, reside in Woodbury, Conn. His father, who is retired, was general manager of the Fireproofing Products Division of the Carboline Company, a subsidiary of the Sun Company in St. Louis.

1421-> PRACTICAL TRAVELER: GETTING INTO TOWN FROM THE AIRPORT
W hen Air France introduced its Caravelle jet service from Paris to London Airport 24 years ago it could boast that the flight from capital to capital took less time than the journey from the airport to central London. The same is true today, if you take a taxi in the rush hour. But by taking advantage of the latest extension of the London Underground (subway), the trip can be completed in about 40 minutes, and in relative comfort. (The city-to-city flight takes around 50 minutes.) The transfer from airport to downtown, especially overseas, often seems puzzling. Many passengers find the convenience of settling back into a taxi at the end of a tiring flight difficult to resist, especially if they are carrying heavy luggage. But passengers who are traveling light (and do not intend to rent a car) can usually save money, if not time, by making use of the other options for getting into town, and back to the airport. The options can also be the answer to long lines for taxis. Another advantage - for the vacationer at least - is that by taking the bus or train that local people ride they are plunged immediately into the daily life of the country. Following are examples of the options at some major foreign airports. London At Heathrow, if your luggage is not too bulky, the best bet is to take the London Underground from Heathrow Central station, which can be done without having to go outside. Take a cart at the luggage carrousel for your bags, walk down a ramp and through a couple of tunnels straight to the Underground ticket office. If you have the correct change you can buy your ticket from one of the machines and avoid a line. The cost varies according to destination but to Piccadilly it is 2.20 or roughly $3.50. Luggage carts are left at the top of the escalator leading to the train platform. Trains are clean and frequent, but they fill up with shoppers and commuters at the 18 stops to Piccadilly, so it is best to keep your luggage close at hand and out of the way of other passengers. It will take about 35 minutes to get to Piccadilly. The London Transport (double decker) express bus leaves each of the airport's terminals at 20-minute intervals between 6:40 A.M. and 8:40 P.M. It costs $3.20, half price for children, and drops off passengers at Victoria or Paddington train stations. The ride takes about 45 minutes - longer during rush hours. Another bus, the Green Line, leaves the Central Bus Station at the airport every half hour until 7:30 P.M., and then on the half hour at 8:30, 9:30 and 10:30. It costs about $2.40, children half price, and makes several stops on the way to Victoria, so it's slower. Figure an hour and a quarter. Taxi: the fare will be about $22.40, plus a 10 percent tip. At Gatwick Airport, about 30 miles south of London, the thing to do is to walk into the adjacent British Rail train station. Departures for London's Victoria are every 15 minutes until midnight and once an hour after that. There are a few stops en route and the journey takes about 45 minutes. The cost is $5, with children under 14 half price. There's also an express bus to Victoria that runs every half hour from 6:30 A.M. until 8 P.M., and then on the hour at 9, 10 and 11. Fare: $3.20, children half price. Paris Depending on their airline, passengers from New York arrive at either Charles de Gaulle Airport or Orly. At De Gaulle, the Air France coaches (available to all passengers) run every 5 to 15 minutes, depending on time of day, into the Porte-Maillot Terminal near the Place de l'Etoile for $3.75. The ride takes about 25 minutes normally but can stretch to 40 minutes in rush hour. For De Gaulle passengers wishing to take a train into the Gare du Nord, with its easy access to the Metro, there is a free shuttle bus every five minutes to the Roissy train station, a five-minute ride. Nonstop trains into Paris leave every 15 minutes until 11:30 P.M.; the ride takes about 30 minutes and costs $2.60. Taxi: from $12 to $21, depending on destination and time of day. From Orly, Air France buses leave every 15 minutes, and the ride to the Invalides takes from 20 to 40 minutes depending on traffic. The fare is $3.20. Unlike the shuttle at De Gaulle, the bus connecting Orly to the Orly rail station, a mile away, is not free. You pay $3.20 for the bus and train journey as you board the bus. Trains leave every 15 minutes, from 5:30 A.M. to 9 P.M., every 30 minutes from 9 to 11 P.M. Destinations include the Quai d'Orsay, Saint-Michel and Austerlitz stations from each of which you can make Metro connections. The ride takes about 40 minutes. Taxi: about the same as from De Gaulle - $12 to $21. Rome The Fiumicino airport is 25 miles outside the city and a taxi will cost around $28. A far better proposition is the blue airport bus that leaves every 15 minutes or so and runs nonstop to the central Termini station, a ride of about 45 minutes. Buy your ticket ($2.50) at the booth inside the airport terminal; the buses are just outside. (The planned extension of the city subway to the airport may be completed in 1984.) Frankfurt The bus that used to serve the airport has been replaced by a new train that starts from underneath the airport terminal and continues at ground level to the city's central train station six miles away. The actual riding time is about 15 minutes. Passengers buy their $2 tickets from a vending machine and need exact change. The trains, clean and comfortable, and with roomy luggage racks, leave every 15 minutes. A Mercedes taxi will make the trip in 20 minutes for about $9 plus 10 percent tip. Dublin Only passengers on Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, fly directly to the Dublin airport. Other airlines put down at Shannon, which is 138 miles southwest of the capital, and their passengers must change to a local Aer Lingus flight to complete the journey by air. At the Dublin airport coaches leave every 20 minutes for the Busarus bus station on Store Street in the city. The 35-minute ride costs about $2.55, children half price; you pay on the bus. A taxi ride into midtown will cost around $9.80 plus 10 percent tip. To get from Shannon to the Dublin airport by rail, take a local bus to the station at nearby Limerick and board the Dublin train. The buses leave for Limerick about every 20 minutes, and the fare is $2.55; there are five trains a day, from 8:44 A.M. to 6:50 P.M. The train takes about two hours. Fare: $21, children half price. Mexico City The subway connection from the airport to downtown should be in operation within a year. In the meantime one has the choice of a 44-passenger coach for $2 or a six-seater station wagon called a Setta for $3. The buses run every 15 minutes at peak times and in other periods every half hour or once an hour until midnight; Settas are almost always available. Both the buses and Settas drop off at the major city hotels, and most trips take 25 to 40 minutes. Taxis charge about $5, plus a 10 to 15 percent tip, and can usually get downtown in 20 minutes. Tokyo From the Narita airport, which is 42 miles from downtown, the taxi ride - at $60 - is scarcely an advantage. The limousine bus service, which can be picked up at three airport stops, gets to the City Air Terminal in about 70 minutes, the same time most taxis take; recently the service was expanded to include most major downtown hotels. Fares: $9.60 to the air terminal or the Palace or Ginza Tokyu Hotels, $10.40 to the New Otani or the Tokyo Prince. Tickets are purchased at counters outside the airport customs area; departures are every 5 to 10 minutes. Narita also has a train station with nonstop service on the Keisei line to Tokyo's Ueno station, but you must take a three-minute shuttle bus ride (40 cents) to the station, then walk down a flight of steps. The Skyliner, as the train is called, leaves every 30 minutes and gets into town in an hour. Fare: $6.

1426-> Silky, in Space
For a generation, space travel has conjured up images of strength: rumbling roars, dazzling flashes, hissing clouds ... words like thrust and throw-weight, warp drive and surge power. The whole enterprise is sometimes called the conquest of space. Yet maybe that's all misguided. Maybe in the end those energetic images will turn out as wrong as most conceptions of the future. Now there's reason to think less about rocketry and more about romance - the romance of sail. As The Times reported the other day, space has its own source of energy - sunlight, which moves in a ''wind'' of photons. Engineers dream of catching that wind. A private World Space Foundation wants to send long solar sailboats a thousand miles out to test the idea. Here's a toast to their dream, whether or not it proves efficient. Sailing through space. What an immensely pleasing thought. The present world of predictable orbits means power and precision. The prospective world of space clippers implies tacking instead of tracking, silky serendipity, adventure. Being an astronaut is an honored, arduous calling. Yet compared with sailor in space it sounds a little like boy scout. Who knows what mermaids or Flying Dutchmen or Northwest Passages lie ahead on voyages of discovery that will be measured not in months but light years? The other day a Frenchman named Philippe Jeantot landed in Newport, winner of the first round-the-world solo sailboat race. It took five months. We can't help imagining a day when some other skipper, probably salty, surely grizzled, hauls in his sails after racing around the universe. The sails will be different (three miles wide, aluminum and plastic film) but not the spirit. We suspect he'd say exactly the same thing Mr. Jeantot said when asked if he'd do it again: ''Why not?''

1428-> PANEL APPROVES NICARAGUA AID
The Senate Intelligence Committee tonight endorsed President Reagan's new plan for aiding Nicaraguan rebel forces, but moved to tighten control over the program's funds. The committee agreed by a 13-to-2 vote to release the $19 million that President Reagan had requested for the covert aid, committee sources said, but made clear that the Administration must seek specific authority to spend more money on the Central Intelligence Agency program. One source estimated that the $19 million would be spent in three months and that the committee's action amounted to putting the covert activity on ''a tight leash.'' Another source said the money might last about six months. The committee's position conflicts with that of the House, which voted July 28 to cut off all covert aid to the insurgents, estimated to number between 7,000 and 10,000, who are rebelling against the leftist Nicaraguan Government. Mr. Reagan authorized the covert action in December 1981 with the stated goal of stopping the flow of weapons from Nicaragua's Sandinista Government to anti-Government rebels in El Salvador. This week, in a new Presidential finding authorizing continuation of the covert action, Mr. Reagan said the goal was putting pressure on Nicaragua into ending support for revolutionary movements throughout Central America. The committee sources said the new finding appeared to satisfy most members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but might not soften the opposition to the action from the Democratic majority of the House Intelligence Committee. Some Democrats have said the covert action is aimed at overthrowing the Nicaraguan Government, not at ending the arms flow from Nicaragua. Mr. Reagan has denied that the goal is to oust the Sandinistas, but the rebels have publicly declared that is their intent. One Congressional informant said the Senate committee was ''shortening the leash on the program'' by preventing the President from drawing from an intelligence contingency fund to pay for the Nicaraguan action. He added that the administration may have made a serious mistake when it requested only $19 million for the program in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Other informants have said the Nicaraguan covert action exceeded its 1983 budget of $19 million in March, only halfway through the federal fiscal year. Mr. Reagan has been drawing from the contingency fund to pay for the program since then, they said.

1429-> Rate Level On Money Accounts
Interest rates on bank money market deposit accounts are showing signs of stabilizing after six weeks of decline, The Bank Rate Monitor said yesterday. The Monitor's nationwide average, based on a weekly survey of 50 large institutions in the five largest markets in the United States, declined only 0.01 percentage point, to 8.12 percent, in the week ended yesterday. In the previous week, the average rate was 8.13 percent, and the week before it was 8.17 percent. In the New York area, however, the average rate rose 0.01 percentage point from the previous week's level, to 8.45 percent, according to The Monitor. Two weeks ago the New York average, based on a survey of 10 selected New York banks and savings institutions, was 8.54 percent. The rate stabilization came one week after the money market mutual funds, which compete directly with the bank money market accounts, reported their smallest decline in asset levels since mid-December. It was at that time that banks were permitted to open their accounts, which carry market interest rates without ceilings. Last week Donoghue's Money Fund Report said that the mutual funds offered an average interest rate of 7.86 percent. The average interest rate on bank money market accounts in New York was still the highest in the country yesterday, The Bank Rate Monitor said. Los Angeles ranked second, with an average rate of 8.12 percent, followed by Chicago, at 8.11 percent. ''Super NOW'' accounts remained below the 7 percent interest mark, at 6.97 percent nationwide, down 0.01 percentage point. In New York, the Super NOW accounts brought an average rate of 7.03 percent, down from 7.04 percent last week.

I.T.T.'s Net Fell 17.5% in Quarter By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS The International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, citing the impact of foreign currency translations and of a divestiture last year, reported yesterday that first-quarter net income dropped 17.5 percent, while revenues fell 11.9 percent. I.T.T., a diversified conglomerate whose core business is telecommunications, said that net income in the first quarter fell to $134.3 million, or 90 cents a share, from $162.7 million, or $1.10 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues declined to $4.9 billion, from $5.4 billion. The company said part of the net income decrease reflected the 1982 quarter's after-tax gain of $28 million, or 19 cents a share, from the sale of a 10 percent interest in Standard Telephones and Cables P.L.C., an associate company in Britain. The effect of foreign exchange translations in the latest quarter was also reflected in the net income decline, the company said. Those translations increased net income by $4.1 million, or 3 cents a share in the latest quarter, the company said, compared with an increase of $10.7 million, or 7 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. The results were disclosed at I.T.T.'s 63d annual meeting at the Barbican Center in London, the first time that a major American corporation has held its annual shareholders' meeting outside North America. ''Earnings were not what many experts on Wall Street expected,'' said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. The Value Line Investment Survey had estimated that earnings would remain even at $1.10 a share. Excluding the two extraordinary items, however, earnings would have shown a gain of about 3 cents a share. General Foods The General Foods Corporation, a leading producer of packaged foods based in White Plains, announced that net income in its fourth fiscal quarter ended April 2 more than doubled, to $109.9 million, or $2.15 a share, from $52.9 million, or $1.07 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues increased 5.2 percent, to $2.24 billion, from $2.13 billion. For the full year, General Foods said that net income advanced 44.1 percent, to $288.5 million, or $5.73 a share, from $200.2 million, or $4.05 a share, in the year earlier. Revenues dipped 1 percent, to $8.33 billion, from $8.41 billion. Results for both the latest fiscal quarter and fiscal year were after special charges related to the restructuring, sale or discontinuance of several businesses in the fiscal year 1982. General Foods said that Entenmann's Inc., acquired on Nov. 23, 1982, added sales of about $87 million for the fourth quarter and $123 million for the year, but said that acquisition and the acquisition of several specialty cheese operations announced March 18 had a negligible effect on consolidated earnings after financing costs. Cigna Corporation The Cigna Corporation, a leading insurance and financial services company, announced that operating earnings in the first quarter increased 25.2 percent, to $76.6 million, or $1.01 a share, from $61.2 million, or 79 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues edged up 3.2 percent, to $2.92 billion, from $2.83 billion. ---- Earnings tables, page D22.

1434-> Oil Import Bill May Fall 12%
The United States will reduce its oil import bill by 12 percent this year, saving about $7.5 billion, according to a study released yesterday by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Based on a current average import price of $29 a barrel, and a projected 4 percent decline in imports for the year, the import bill should drop to about $53 billion, from $60.5 billion in 1982, the study said. That would be a smaller decline than last year, when the recession helped reduce the import bill by 21 percent from 1981. Imports of crude oil, including that placed in the Government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, should average 4.8 million barrels a day this year, compared with last year's 5.2 million, the study said. Imports averaged 6 million barrels a day in 1981. Consumption should slip to 15.1 million barrels a day, from 15.25 million last year; that 1 percent decline compares with a 5 percent drop in 1982.

1436-> MAJOR CRIMES DOWN 4% IN 1982
The number of major crimes reported in the United States in 1982 declined 4 percent from 1981, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today. It was the first real decline in reported major crimes since 1977, the agency said. A decrease of less than 1 percent, recorded in 1981, was considered statistically insignificant, said Ann Graham, writer and editor of the bureau's Uniform Crime Reports. She said the statistics were preliminary figures and that the final figures, to be issued in August, might be adjusted up or down. Attorney General William French Smith, who issued the statistics on reported crime, said, ''After sustaining all-time highs in 1980 and 1981, the decline is welcome news.'' The F.B.I. reported that seven of the eight types of major crime monitored by the bureau showed these declines: murder and robbery reports dropped by 7 percent; burglary, 10 percent; forcible rape, 5 percent; larceny, 1 percent; motor vehicle theft, 3 percent, and arson by 12 percent. The only increase was in aggravated assault, which went up by 1 percent. ''With citizens taking an active part, law-enforcement agencies across the country have instituted crime-resistance programs,'' said William H. Webster, Director of the F.B.I. ''This reported decrease indicates that perhaps those efforts are finally having an impact on the crime problem.'' Miss Graham said the figures stemmed from reports filed with the bureau by more than 15,000 law-enforcement agencies covering 98 percent of the nation's population. While the study does not include total crime figures for the entire country, it provides a breakdown for numerous large cities. In New York, the number of crimes monitored by the bureau declined to 696,812 last year from 734,808 in 1981. The number of murders in the city dropped to 1,668 last year from 1,826 in 1981, the number of robberies to 95,944 from 107,475, and forcible rape to 3,547 from 3,862.

Afghan rebel sources said today that Soviet planes supporting a large ground offensive in western Afghanistan had killed hundreds of civilians in bombing raids on a major refugee route to Iran. The assertions coincided with reports from Western diplomatic sources of a Soviet offensive in the western Afghan province of Herat, which reportedly began April 16 and ended in the last few days. Two rebel sources, reached by telephone in the eastern Iranian city of Mashad, said the Soviet bombers struck 35 villages west of Herat, the provincial capital, killing as many as 1,500 civilians and destroying 400 houses.

The Royal Ballet's world premiere of Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Varii Capricci'' at the Met last night ended weeks of feeling ''harassed and full of neurosis,'' the 78-year-old choreographer said yesterday. One of the headaches was coordinating the music, written by Sir William Walton, with the choreographer's vision. ''I wanted a different ending than what the score had,'' Sir Frederick recalled, ''a return to a tune that appeared in the beginning. Then, I asked for three or four last chords, to bring the curtain down. So he did them.'' They were, in fact, the last chords of Sir William, who died MArch 8.

1442-> GULF AIDES DEFER OIL-SLICK PARLEY
Cabinet ministers from eight Persian Gulf nations that are threatened by a vast oil slick decided today to put off the formal opening of a conference on the crisis to allow more time for trying to get Iran and Iraq to suspend hostilities in the area. The opening was put off until Thursday because ''extensive contacts with the parties concerned'' were needed, Kuwait's Health Minister, Abdul Rahman al-Awadi, was quoted as saying. This statement was reported by the Kuwaiti News Agency after the ministers, including representatives of Iraq and Iran, met informally this morning to try to work out an agreement guaranteeing the safety of crews who would have to enter the war zone at the head of the Persian Gulf to cap leaking Iranian offshore wells. Officials at the United Nations reported Tuesday that Iran and Iraq had agreed in principle to cooperate in efforts to cap the wells and clean up the slick. Neither side would apparently agree to a formal cease-fire to allow the work to go forward, but United Nations officials sought to get a cessation of hostilities in the immediate area involved. Iran Balks at Repairs Iran's Ambassador to Kuwait, Ali Shams Ardekani, said today that his Government would not agree to send in teams to make repairs in the absence of guarantees from Iraq. Reports from Baghdad Tuesday said Iraq could not agree to a cease-fire in the war unless it was assured that Iran would not seek to benefit from it militarily. Diego Cordovez, who is Under Secretary General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs, was due here tonight to join in the conference. The conference was called by the regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment, to which all eight Persian Gulf countries, including Iran and Iraq, belong. The organization decided to ask the ministers to attend so that a decision could be made on ending the threat to marine life and industrial installations posed by the slick, which is believed to be spreading at the rate of 10,000 barrels a day. Besides Iraq and Iran, the countries involved are Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. The Iranian ambassador said the Iraqis would have to say they were sorry for the air strikes of March 2 that he blamed for the damage to wells in Iran's Norwuz offshore oilfield at the head of the Gulf. Since then, it is estimated, 250,000 barrels of oil have spread out in a long slick that winds are pushing toward Iran. (Bahrain reported sightings of small parts of the slick less than nine miles from its shoreline, The Associated Press reported. Traces were also reported in Saudi waters.) U.S. Expert Gives Warning In New York, an American oil slick expert warned that if the spill was not cleaned up quickly, Gulf nations could be forced to close their desalination plants. ''If those are forced to close because of contaminated water, that region is going to face a very serious water problem,'' said Richard Golob, executive editor of the weekly Oil Spill Intelligence Report. The slick, condensing into a mass that can float just below the surface, grows denser as evaporation from the intense sun heats the water. Environment experts feared permanent damage to the Gulf's rich fisheries, with the United Arab Emirates already banning fishing and other states running constant checks for contamination.

1444-> PLAYERS; Saucier Switches Controls
The end, and the beginning, took place a week ago at Parker Field in Richmond, Va. The Richmond Braves, the top farm club of the Atlanta Braves and Kevin Saucier's new team, were about to have the first workout since leaving their West Palm Beach, Fla., training camp. At the point of the baseball season when he had not lost a game that counted, when there is normally the most reason for hope, Kevin Saucier felt the most hopeless. The command that Saucier once had over a baseball had vanished, and now he thought that he was losing control over himself. Still, Saucier (pronounced SO-shay) had left his home in Pensacola, Fla., driven a U-Haul to Richmond, unpacked and reported to Parker Field. His equipment was left on the front seat of his car. Johnny Sain, the Richmond pitching coach, spotted Saucier, the left-handed relief pitcher who had struggled all spring to overcome the lost control that cost him a job in Detroit. Saucier remembered hearing Sain say, ''We're going to throw a little bit.'' Then Saucier remembered hearing himself say, ''No, it's not for me anymore.'' That was the end. ''He looked at me like I was a little bit crazy,'' Saucier said yesterday from Pensacola, where he was born and raised, and where at age 26 he has started the rest of his life. He said he was too emotional to speak to Sain, and his wife, Karen, had to call Eddie Haas, the Richmond manager, with the news that her husband had decided not to play baseball any longer. ''I'd rather be broke and be happy,'' he said, and laughed. ''They're not going to back that Brink's truck up to my grave.'' And that is the beginning. Pitchers live the most transient baseball careers. Either they suddenly forget how to throw strikes, as did Saucier and Steve Blass and Randy Jones, or an injury means the end. ''When you're pitching good,'' Saucier said, ''you know there's nobody who can get you. You're on top of the world. It's like I'm on top of the world, and then I'm on the bottom of it all.'' Saucier earned $140,000 as a member of the Tigers last year. He would have been paid $30,000 at Richmond this season, but he was told that a promotion to Atlanta would increase his salary to $100,000, perhaps more. Saucier was around long enough to realize that a relief pitcher as effective as he was in 1981 - when he had a 4-2 record at Detroit, with 13 saves in 38 appearances and an earned run average of 1.65 - can almost name his price. Instead, the Sauciers plan to sell their home and one of the cars, and stay with Karen's parents as Kevin works to start a place where people can eat pizza and drink soda and beer. ''I'll probably call it 'The Dugout','' Saucier said. He envisions a collection of autographs and bats that he hopes his friends in baseball will contribute for Little Leaguers to come and examine. He hopes to have a large-screen television for the area's softball players while they drink their beers and talk about their own games. N ot long ago, he had dreaded going to a ball park, knowing that when he pitched a baseball there was no way to tell where it would go. Saucier had developed control problems last year. He was sent from Detroit to its Class AAA team at Evansville, Ind. When the season ended, he pitched in the instructional league, and seemed to improve. He saw a doctor who helped him develop new methods to relax on the mound. But this spring, when Saucier began to throw batting practice, he was frightened at what happened. ''It's a feeling of being lost,'' he said. ''It's like a secretary trying to type with no fingers. What does she do? She's totally lost. You can't help yourself. You try, you try to relax, and you just can't do it. When you release the ball, you just don't have any idea where it's going to go.'' The worst moment came after he was released by Detroit and picked up by Richmond, when he pitched in an exhibition game between Richmond and Columbus, the Yankee farm club. ''It just came over me,'' Saucier remembered. ''Whacko. I was throwing the ball all over the place. I thought I was going to kill somebody.'' Haas, the manager, went to the mound, and Saucier said he told him, ''Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.'' The pitcher cried after he left. Still, there was a spot for him on the roster. At first, his wife wanted him to continue, until she saw him after the Columbus game. ''She must have thought I looked totally exhausted,'' he said. ''She said, 'I'd rather have you than see you drive yourself crazy trying to throw a little white ball.'' There will be no more baseball, he said, not even in a semipro league. ''I was walking around the house,''

State Bank Rule Change The New York State Banking Department has agreed to ease regulations on how state-chartered banks report past-due foreign loans. It said that banks may apply for permission to wait until loans are 90 days past due, rather than 60 days, before they must be classified as ''nonperforming assets.'' This is in line with Federal policy. New York banks most likely to be affected are the Bankers Trust Company, the Chemical Bank, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the Irving Trust Company. Bankers Trust had formally sought the change, which would be significant for banks with large amounts of past-due loans, primarily to Brazil. A bank may not accrue interest on a nonperforming loan.

1447-> WARSAW SECRET POLICE SAID TO BREAK INTO A CONVENT
Roman Catholic Church sources said today that the security police broke into a convent on Tuesday and beat up workers for a church group helping the families of jailed Solidarity activists. The action, by a group of 15 to 20 men in leather jackets and street clothing, occurred as uniformed policemen were deployed in the surrounding Old Town neighborhood for a mass that developed into a spontaneous demonstration by 8,000 people. Six members of the church aid committee, two of them women, were injured as they were beaten with chair legs, clubs and the handle of a shovel, witnesses said. The four others were young men who had been serving as watchmen and were later driven 15 miles out of town and dropped off in the Kampinoska Forest, northwest of Warsaw. One was said to be hospitalized. The raid came at a complex time in the relations between the authorities and the church as the June visit of Pope John Paul II approaches. Although the church and the Government have been cooperating in preparations for the visit, there has been tension because, among other things, last Sunday's masses became staging grounds for demonstrations called by the underground in which tens of thousands of people clashed with the police in a score of cities. The break-in at the Convent of the Franciscan Sisters, which is attached to St. Martin's Church, came at about 7:30 P.M., the sources said. At the time the area was saturated with police at the end of a mass being celebrated in honor of the democratic constitution of 1791. The crowd was studded with leather-jacketed undercover men who often seized young people and handed them over to the uniformed forces for arrest. A foreign reporter and his interpreter, looking for an escape route in case of a police charge, apparently chanced on the men breaking into convent. ''Get them!'' one of the men shouted, but the two escaped, they later related. Church sources said the intruders broke through a back door to reach the aid office, which distributes food and clothing sent from abroad, as well as money donated in Poland, to jailed activists and their families. The commitee was particularly active during the internments that followed the imposition of martial law in December 1981. ''The nuns tried to defend against them, but they were pushed aside,'' a witness said. As the men broke into the aid office, they threw furniture about and hit the lay workers with chairs and the shovel handle. One of the men carried a two-way radio of the kind issued to the police, witnesses said. ''Of course, they were the police,'' one witness said. ''There were hundreds of uniformed police all around and they took these four men out with them right through the police and drove them away.'' There was no formal reaction from the church. One church source said that a report was being sent to the church hierarchy, now meeting in Czestochowa, and that a formal protest was likely.

1451-> SCOUTING; Breakers' Lament
''Of course we're disappointed,'' said Bob Caporale, the president of the Boston Breakers, when attendance figures announced by the United State Football League showed that the team's home average of 10,507 was by far the lowest in the new 12-team league. ''We're hoping for much better crowds at our remaining games against Philadelphia, Chicago, Tampa Bay and New Jersey. We already have an advance of about 8,000 for Philadelphia on May 29.'' The league figures showed that the average attendance for 66 games was 25,544. The Denver Gold led with 44,107. Caporale attributed ''two bad rainstorms and the toughest sports market in the country'' to the Breakers' poor gate at Boston University's Nickerson Field, which seats 20,535. ''With the Bruins and the Celtics eliminated from the hockey and basketball playoffs, our attendance should rise,'' he said.

1452-> AN ALBANY TOUR: OFF THE BEATEN PATH IN SEARCH OF 'ENDANGERED' LEGISLATION
A group of 17 state assemblymen has introduced the bill to end all bills - or at least some of the less important ones. In the last two-year legislative session, more than 23,000 bills were introduced, but only 1,992 became law. Because many of the others were frivolous, the assemblymen say, they want to limit the number of bills each legislator may introduce. Of course, every legislator has good reasons for his own bills, even the ones with little or no chance of passing. Still, to their colleagues, some of these bills seem a little, well, offbeat: Butterfly vs. Ladybug At the urging of an elementary school class in Guilderland, Assemblyman Michael Hoblock has introduced a bill to confer upon the Karner blue butterfly - known scientifically as the Lycaeides melissa samuelis - the title of official New York State insect. The butterfly, which is on the national list of endangered species, has been sighted in only one place in New York State, the Pine Bush area of Albany and the neighboring communities of Colonie and Guilderland. (It has also been seen in a few other places in the country.) Apparently the butterfly feeds only on certain species of pine trees, found in New York only in the Pine Bush forest area. The butterfly received its name from Karner Road, which cuts through the area. But the Karner blue has a rival. A group of fourth graders at a school in Assemblyman Robert C. Wertz's district wrote him plugging for the ladybug as state insect. Mr. Wertz, a Smithtown, L.I., Republican, obliged and introduced Assembly Bill 561. An aide to Mr. Wertz said the introduction of the bill served a useful purpose: helping the schoolchildren learn about the legislative process. New Plates for Firefighters A bill introduced by State Senator Owen H. Johnson, a Republican of Babylon, L.I., would amend the existing state vehicle and traffic law to allow distinctive license plates for volunteer firefighters. The license plates would be decorated with the symbol of the Maltese cross and the letters ''V.F.'' Ginny Brown, an aide to Mr. Johnson, said these plates would give the firefighters some long-overdue recognition and help their cars to be easily identified at the scene of a fire. One Day of Fireworks Another bill, one that is expected to pass, has an effective lifetime of a single day. It would allow fireworks to be shot off from the Brooklyn Bridge on May 24, 1983, the day of the bridge's centenary celebration. Senator John J. Marchi, a Republican of Staten Island, introduced the bill at the request of New York City. The law now forbids fireworks displays 200 feet from a public highway. The bridge is just such a roadway, and so an exception must be made to permit fireworks as part of the planned gala celebration, according to Jerry McLaughlin, an aide to the Senator. Playing With Numbers Legislators may ''reserve'' bills by requesting a certain number for them, and many legislators infuse the process of introducing a bill with a bit of humor, or even the odd literary allusion. For years, a bill eliminating mandatory retirement in the Assembly has been Assembly Bill 100. Last year, a bill concerning optometry was Assembly Bill 2020. And this year, beside the space for Bill 1984, the legislative index notes ''reserved.'' Inquiries about the sponsor of the bill were met at first with cautious silence, and then Assemblyman Joseph Ferris, a Democrat of Brooklyn, called to claim his number. His staff is preparing a bill that will receive the designation Assembly Bill 1984. It deals, he said, with ''personal privacy.'' Chewing Tobacco Although the sale of chewing tobacco to minors is already against the law, Assemblyman Jose E. Serrano, a Democrat of the Bronx, has introduced a bill to jog merchants' memory. Merchants are now required to post a sign stating that the sale of cigars, cigarettes and tobacco products to minors is forbidden by law. Mr. Serrano's bill would add the words ''chewing and powdered tobacco'' to such signs, and would increase fines for such sales from $50 to $100, with $250 for subsequent offenses. ''What we really want to do is make the public aware,'' said Gene DeSantis, an aide to Mr. Serrano. ''The products are marketed in such a way as to make them seem like candy or healthful products.'' Bill on Bills And so we come to the bill on bills. Assemblyman William E. Bush, a Republican of Camillus, thinks the practice of introducing a bill to appease constituents or make a political statement is getting to be too expensive a luxury. Each bill introduced last year, he said, cost taxpayers about $540, including printing, drafting and staff expenses. In New York State, printing the bills alone cost a total of $1.8 million in the 1981-82 session, and preparing the weekly legislative index that lists bills introduced cost another $1.8 million. The Bill Drafting Commission, which drafts, typesets and proofreads bills, spent $9.3 million over the last two years, Mr. Bush said. Mr. Bush's proposal would restrict the number of bills a legislator could introduce to 35 for an assemblyman and 50 for a senator. The legislator with the lowest number of bills introduced last session was Edward Abramson, a Democrat of Queens, with three. Assemblyman Maurice D. Hinchey Jr., a Democrat of Saugerties, led the legislators with 210. ''These additional bills are not providing any drastic new legislation,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They're really an exercise in public relations.'' Mr. Bush estimated that his bill could cut costs by about 25 percent, or about $3 million. But David Keiper of the Bill Drafting Commission was more skeptical. Over a two-year period, the bill would allow legislators to introduce 16,600 bills, and the Governor and the Rules Committes of both houses also introduce bills - about 2,000 in the last legislative session. ''It would hardly make any difference,'' Mr. Keiper said. And it may be that Mr. Bush's bill falls under the heading of one introduced to make a political point. It has only Republican sponsors in an Assembly controlled by the Democrats, and so far, there is no comparable bill in the Senate, which the Republicans control. This bill, too, seems to have little chance of passing.

1453-> Comsat Planning Stock Split
Directors of the Communications Satellite Corporation have voted to recommend a two-for-one stock split to shareholders at the company's upcoming annual meeting. The Comsat board has also decided to recommend an increase in the number of authorized common shares from 25 million to 40 million. Both decisions, made on Friday, were viewed as efforts by the satellite company to place itself in position to attract additional capital for various diversification projects. According to a spokesman, Scott Chase, Comsat has issued nine million of its currently authorized 25 million shares. Those shares are held by roughly 90,000 stockowners, he added. Comsat's annual meeting has been scheduled for Friday, May 20, and will be open to shareholders of record on March 31. If the stock split is approved, Comsat said it expected that the effective date ''would be on or about June 6, 1983.'' The proposed stock split is also subject to the approval of the Federal Communications Commission. Comsat's stock has been trading in the $70-to-$75 range in recent weeks. Comsat is the designated United States representative and part-owner of Intelsat, the international organization that operates a global satellite system. Comsat has diversified into environmental monitoring and equipment manufacturing and holds a one-third interest in Satellite Business Systems, a concern that constructs and operates high-speed data and telephone networks for corporate customers. Comsat also received the first-ever construction permit last year to build a satellite-to-home TV system.

1454-> PERSONAL INCOME UP 0.8%
Americans' personal income jumped eighttenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest gain since last summer, the Commerce Department reported today. Consumers' spending, up a seasonally adjusted 1 percent, rose even faster in April compared with March. Analysts said the gains in both categories meant companies were likely to continue to increase production and hiring. ''The economic upturn is becoming a cumulative, self-reinforcing process where higher spending leads to higher production and then again to higher spending,'' said Robert G. Dederick, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. ''This is the stuff of which sustained business recoveries are made.'' In this view, the higher spending is expected to encourage businesses to produce more of the goods that consumers are buying. To produce the additional goods, these companies can be expected to hire more employees, thereby raising total worker income that could be spent for even more goods. Nevertheless, most economists have expressed doubt that the unemployment rate, now at 10.1 percent, will fall below 9 percent by the end of the year. 'They're Spending It' Ralph Semprevio, an analyst with Chase Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the latest reports showed Americans ''have got this income strength now, and they're spending it, not just socking it away.'' Mr. Dederick, in a statement distributed by aides, said that the April spending surge showed that ''the groundwork has been laid for still another output advance in the period just ahead.'' The Government reported last Friday that industrial production rose 2.1 percent in April, the largest increase in almost eight years. And national employment was up more than 300,000 in April. Today's report said total personal income rose $20.2 billion over the March level, to an annual rate of $2,679.1 billion, in April. It rose six-tenths of 1 percent in March and one-tenth of 1 percent in February. The April gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent was the most since the nine-tenths of 1 percent of last July. And it appeared to be more than enough to keep income ahead of price increases. Consumer price figures for April will be announced next week. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose at a 1.6 percent annual rate. Biggest Rise Since July Among the report's other details were these: - Disposable, or after-tax, income rose 1 percent, to an annual, seasonally adjusted rate of $2,277 billion, after increasing sixtenths of 1 percent in March. The new gain was also the biggest since last July. - Personal consumption spending, which is nearly everything but interest payments on installment debt, rose to an annual, seasonally adjusted rate of $2,085 billion after rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in March. The April gain was the biggest since last November. - New personal savings reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $130.6 billion, about the same as in March. The national savings rate -new savings as a percentage of disposable income - declined to 5.7 percent from March's 5.8 percent. In April, the report said, American workers' wages and salaries increased $12.8 billion after rising $9.1 billion in March. The new increase included gains of $5.1 billion for manufacturing payrolls and $1.2 billion for Government wages and salaries over March levels. Interest income on investments rose $2 billion, and Government transfer payments, such as Social Security, increased $2.4 billion. The report said April's total income translated into $9,741 for every man, woman and child in the United States, based on a population of 233.8 million.

1455-> SCIENTISTS DETECT NEW ATOMIC PART
An international team of 126 researchers at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva, appears to have detected the last of the three particles that theorists believe transmit the so-called weak force in subatomic reactions. Only one particle of the new type has been observed so far. Known as the Z-zero, it would be the heaviest - more properly, the most massive - ever detected, roughly 100 times the mass of the proton, which forms the nucleus of hydrogen atoms. The observation, made several days ago, was described in a talk Monday at Princeton University by Dr. Carlo Rubbia of Harvard University, a leader of the experimental group. When reached by phone yesterday, Dr. Rubbia termed the observed particle ''a candidate'' and said, ''We would like to see a few more events'' before making any announcement. Nevertheless Dr. Abraham Pais, a theoretical physicist at Rockefeller University who has seen the results, termed them ''just beautiful.'' The finding, he added, ''belongs to the great moments of physics in the 20th century.'' He assigned three-to-one odds that the observed particle is the Z-zero, but added that someone like Dr. Rubbia could not be expected to stake his reputation on one event. Roster Would Be Complete Discovery of the Z-zero (so called because its electric charge is zero) would complete the roster of particles carrying the weak force, which is the force responsible for certain forms of radioactive decay and plays a key role in the reactions generating energy in the core of the sun. The finding would also provide added confirmation for the theory that treats the weak force and electromagnetic force, which binds all atoms and molecules, as manifestations of an overall, unifiing phenomenon known as the ''electroweak'' force. Physicists have long believed that such forces are carried by ''vector'' particles that pass (almost instantaneously) between the transmitter of the force and its recipient. It has been well established, for example, that light waves carry the electromagnetic force. The suspected carriers of the weak force - the W and Z particles - are known as intermediate vector bosons, but until recently had not been observed. In January Dr. Rubbia's group reported detecting W particles of both positive and negative electric charge. Their mass was roughly 80 times that of the proton (or equivalent to an energy of 81 billion electron volts). Particles in 'Fireball' The W and Z particles had been sought for many years, but not until recently had it been possible to generate a sufficiintly powerful ''fireball'' of energy for their production. Such energy bursts are produced at CERN in a giant circular ''racetrack,'' in whose design Dr. Rubbia played a major role. In the ring, a beam of protons is accelerated to 270 billion electron vols and smashed into antiprotons of the same enrgy circling in the opposite direction. Antiprotons are similar to protons but of opposite electric charge.Such collisions produce a fireball of 540 billion electron volts which almost immediately condenses into a multitude of particles. Among them, on rare occasions, are the W particles and, it is now suspected, the Z-zero. While they are extremely short-lived, they decay into particles that make possible their identification. The single Z-zero candidate decayed, as predicted, into an electron and positron (positively charged electron). One hope of the experimenters is that the manner in which the W and Z-zero particles decay will confirm the existence of another elusive particle needed to complete the theoretical roster of quarks. Quarks are the building blocks of such particles as the protons and neutrons, which make up the atomic nucleus. This missing quark is the so-called ''top'' or ''truth'' quark. Evidence for its existence appears to lie embedded in data assembled from the flood of collisions in the CERN machine, Dr. Rubbia said, but ''a few weeks or months'' will be needed for complete analysis.

1458-> SCOUTING; Zaire Revisited
The 10th anniversary of Muhammad Ali's upset of George Foreman, with which Ali regained the world heavyweight boxing title, will be celebrated in Zaire next year. And Don King, the promoter who arranged the fight, says he has been invited back by Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's President, to stage another main event. King said he was more than willing, since ''the 10 years coincides with my career as a promoter'' and the Zaire fight marked his debut in the big time. Back in 1974, King was working for Video Techniques, then the dominant force in closed-circuit television fights. Herbert Muhammad, Ali's manager, had a standing offer of giving any agent 10 percent as a finder's fee. Ali and Foreman had been offered $2.5 million each, but King told Herbert Muhammad he could get $5 million each. Off King went to Zaire, which was looking for publicity, and back he came with $11 million - $10 million for the fighters and $1 million for the promotion. ''I figured I'd get $500,000 from both Ali and Foreman,'' said King. ''But Herbert told me, 'That's too much money for you,' and gave me $150,000. Still, I thought, $150,000 and $500,000, that adds up to $650,000, so I told Herbert O.K. But then I went to George Foreman, and he wanted to knock me out.'' King said he did not get angry. ''It was a good lesson,'' he said. ''Everything's got to be in writing.''

1459-> SCOUTING
Waiting Game Tennis players have assorted rituals on the court that include such things as methodically cleaning lines between points (Guillermo Vilas) and carefully wrapping fresh gauze tape on racquet grips (Vitas Gerulaitis). Then there is Jimmy Connors, the defending United States Open champion, who almost always bounces the ball four times before a serve. Connors's ritual is a common one. Some players bounce the ball more, others less. But no one bounces it more than Mark Dickson, the unseeded Floridian who will play Bill Scanlon in the quarterfinals of the Open today. During his fourth-round victory over John Lloyd on Monday, the 23- year-old Dickson often bounced the ball as many as 24 times before a serve. Players are allowed 30 seconds between points, but waiting to receive Dickson's serve can be unsettling to someone with little patience. ''I think the 30-second rule is a farce,'' said Lloyd, who lost to Dickson in four sets, three of them tiebreakers. ''I think it should be no more than 15 seconds.'' Dickson is aware of his painstaking pace. ''My dad always told me to take my time with my serve,'' he said. ''I guess I stretched it too much.''

1462-> MARTHA MCSTEEN, CAREER OFFICER, MADE ACTING SOCIAL SECURITY HEAD
Margaret M. Heckler, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, today named Martha A. McSteen, a career civil servant, as acting head of the Social Security Administration. Mrs. McSteen, whose title is Acting Commissioner, replaces John A. Svahn, who went to the White House this week to become President Reagan's assistant for domestic policy development. It was not clear how long Mrs. McSteen would serve in the acting role. The Administration is still looking for a permanent Commissioner. The person named to the post would be nominated by President Reagan subject to confirmation by the Senate. The Administration has been trying to recruit an insurance executive or a state government official to serve as permanent Social Security Commissioner since January, when it was announced that Mr. Svahn would become Under Secretary of Health and Human Services. He was holding two jobs when he moved to the White House. An Unfruitful Search But so far the Administration has failed to persuade any of the leading candidates to take the job. If President Reagan is not re-elected in 1984, a new President could appoint a new Commissioner. Mrs. McSteen, 60 years old, has been working for the Social Security agency for 36 years and is currently Regional Commissioner in Dallas. She supervises Social Security operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Mrs. McSteen, who started as a claims representative in Wichita Falls, Tex., will supervise an agency with 83,000 employees and a budget of $196.6 billion for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. The agency's programs pay benefits to more than 50 million people. These programs include old-age retirement and survivors' benefits, disability insurance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, home energy assistance for low-income families and Supplemental Security Income for the aged, blind and disabled. Mrs. Heckler Is Pleased Mrs. Heckler said she was pleased to name a woman to head the Social Security agency because 73 percent of its employees and 54 percent of the beneficiaries were women. The appointment was described by aides to Mrs. Heckler as another in a series of efforts by the Administration to show its commitment to women. They said that Mrs. McSteen was the only woman to head the agency on either an interim or a permanent basis. But it was not immediately clear whether Mrs. McSteen would receive an increase in her salary, now $63,800 a year, to match her additional responsibilities. James M. Brown, a spokesman for the Social Security agency, said, ''She probably will continue to get the same salary as she is now getting.'' Mr. Svahn received $67,200 as Commissioner and an additional $1,200 for performing the jobs of Commissioner and Under Secretary, Mr. Brown said.

Last Friday, while Mr. Domingo was rehearsing at the Metropolitan Opera, he got a frantic phone call from Terence A. McEwen, general director of the San Francisco Opera. It was opening night and Mr. McEwen's Otello had fallen ill. Mr. Domingo hopped on a chartered jet at 5 P.M. At 10:30 P.M. the curtain went up in San Francisco. The opera didn't end till 2 A.M. ''Since Mr. Domingo returned immediately to New York,'' Mrs. Mailliard said, ''San Francisco came here to show its gratitude.''

1464-> MARINE ROLE IN LEBANON: NEW OPTIONS AND RISKS
Military Analysis American and other military sources say the military options of the United States marines and other contingents in the multinational force in Lebanon have increased along with the resources required to carry them out. But, they say, the hazards of individual or collective operations against the Lebanese Druse militias have also grown. The Syrian position, the informants said, appears to be hardening. They noted that the Syrian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Farouk al-Share, had said that Syria would defend its position and continue its help to Lebanese national forces, meaning units arrayed against the Government of President Amin Gemayel. His statement, the sources said, is not to be taken lightly. They cited Israel's high estimate of the Syrian Army and said that military supplies of all kinds were flowing to the anti-Government forces from Syrian depots and that Syrian officers and noncommissioned officers were advising and sometimes directing operations. Palestinian Role In Israel, Gen. Ehud Barak, chief of military intelligence, said at least 1,000 guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization were now fighting side by side with the Druse. Persistent but so far unverifiable reports also are reaching Western intelligence that the Syrians are sending units of the Palestine Liberation Army into the battle. The Palestine Liberation Army, which fought the Israelis in the summer of l972, is regarded as the best armed and trained of any of the P.L.O. units. In addition, political and military experts on the region say, Soviet support for the Syrians and their allies in Lebanon appears unwavering. From a tactical standpoint, the six Harrier jump jets on the United States marines' amphibious assault ship Tarawa are the most important addition to the multinational force. Suitable for Task Unlike the F-14's of the carrier Eisenhower or the Super-Etendards on the French carrier Foch, the Harriers are designed and armed for a ground support role. If it were to become necessary to take out guerrilla gun positions in the Shuf Mountains, the Harriers with their Zuni air-to-surface missiles are suited for the task. From an operational standpoint, military sources said, the Harriers are preferable to the A-6 and A-7 bombers aboard the Eisenhower. These also carry air-to-surface missiles as well as bomb loads of up to 15,000 pounds. Use of the carrier planes, one analyst said, effective though they might be militarily, could pose a danger of extensive damage in Arab villages. The arrival of the battleship New Jersey with its 16-inch and 5-inch guns is due to add further firepower to the American force. The problem before the American commanders on the spot is at what level of hostile operations are these resources to be used. The force is now empowered to use its firepower not only to defend itself but to help other Western forces and the Lebanese Army if a reverse in its operations might endanger the Marines. The American force has been forbidden to launch any ground attacks or to take retaliatory action. The same orders, North Atlantic Treaty Organization sources said, apply to the French, Italian and British contingents in the peacekeeping force, Landing Strip Being Built One of the unknowns in a complex situation appears to be the impact of American and allied firepower on the overall military position of the anti- Government forces. Military analysts said they assumed that missiles and shells could silence hostile mortar and field gun batteries. The question, these sources said, is whether this option would suffice to halt the forces' operations. The Lebanese Army, equipped and trained by the United States, has expended a huge amount of ammunition and gasoline in the last l8 days. To meet its needs and to give the Marines an additional supply artery, engineers are now building an emergency landing strip on the coastal highway outside Byblos, l9 miles south of Beirut. When the strip is completed, authoritative sources said, it will be able to accommodate American C-130 transport aircraft. The strip will be needed if, as most analysts believe, the Druse and their allies intend to mount another attack on the approaches to Beirut.

Ironic Situation Last week, Timothy J.

The award is presented in the name of David A. (Sonny) Werblin, the sports entrepreneur who is currently the chairman of the Madison Square Garden Corporation. In the mid-1970's Werblin was a driving force in the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority which created the Meadowlands Race Track, a competitor that cut heavily into the profits of Yonkers Raceway. ''It is ironic to a degree that this award is named after Sonny,'' said Rooney yesterday. ''He, an old friend of the Rooney family, and the Meadowlands didn't do much for our business, but they did a lot of good for racing.

1472-> SOVIET ASSAILS MOVE BY U.S. AS 'UNDISGUISED BANDITRY'
The Soviet press unleashed a torrent of criticism today against the United States-led invasion of Grenada, branding it an ''act of undisguised banditry and international terrorism'' intended to ''subordinate Grenada to U.S. neocolonialist rule.'' There was no direct statement by late tonight from the Soviet Government, and no reference to the 30 Soviet citizens reportedly confronted on the island by the American force. A United States Embassy spokesman said the Soviet Government had made a ''diplomatic contact'' with the embassy over the invasion but the contents were not disclosed. Throughout the day, the Soviet press agency Tass reported developments on the small Caribbean island with unusual frequency, citing the Grenada radio until it went dead and then using Cuban, Western and Latin American news reports. These accounts were complemented by angry commentaries by Tass analysts. The sharpest of these commentaries declared that the United States had staged a ''direct, unprovoked aggression'' against an independent state, and that ''the whole responsibility for the consequences of this criminal action lies on Washington's Administration and personally on President Reagan.'' Call for Immediate Pullout ''Laying disgrace on U.S. aggressors,'' Tass said, ''peace-loving mankind demands that the interventionist troops of the United States and its puppets be immediately pulled out of Grenada. In an apparently related development, Tass published a stern statement from the Soviet Government accusing the United States of directing a proxy war against Nicaragua with the aim of overthrowing the Managua regime. The statement said Nicaragua was ''threatened with outright invasion by U.S. forces,'' and described American activities as ''a crime against the Nicaraguan people'' and ''a direct threat to the security and sovereignty of all Latin American states.'' The statement made no threat of direct Soviet assistance to Nicaragua, however, and said only that Moscow ''resolutely condemns'' the American actions and ''declares invariable solidarity '' with the Nicaraguan people. Although the Government statement made no mention of Grenada and might have been approved before the invasion there began, Western diplomats believed its publication was linked to the tensions on the island and was intended to fuel international criticism of Washington's policies in Latin America and the Caribbean. Envoy Reports Stiff Resistance Grenada's Ambassador to Moscow, Richard Jacobs, who has been hospitalized since yesterday for leg problems, told reporters he had been in contact with Gen. Hudson Austin, a member of the revolutionary military council that took power after last week's violent coup, and had been told that the Grenadian Army was putting up stiff resistance to the invaders. Mr. Jacobs said that the invading forces had captured Grenada's two airports and the radio station and that a column was moving toward the Prime Minister's offices in the capital, St. George's. The Ambassador described the offices as a ''very strategic position'' one mile from the military headquarters. He said that both sides had suffered heavy casualties. The invading force, he said, ''expected to be greeted like liberators, but the people are fighting them with stones, sticks, cutlasses.'' 'Another Bay of Pigs' ''It will be another Bay of Pigs,'' Mr. Jacobs declared. ''The Americans will be pulverized.'' The entire Grenadian leadership, he said, belongs to the New Jewel Movement, whose internal conflicts led to the clash that brought the deaths of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and several of his colleagues. ''Let me ask you, what happens next?'' Mr. Jacobs asked. ''What are they going to do?'' The intervention, the ambassador said, could bring ''assistance from our neighbors,'' a step he said could lead to a ''terrible war.'' He declined to specify which neighbors he was speaking of, and he denied that there had been any Cuban or Soviet soldiers on the island. The Soviet Government, he said, has ''taken the position that every revolution must protect itself.'' Since the United States and members of the Caribbean Community first held meetings to condemn the takeover in Grenada last week, the Soviet press has issued warnings that Washington was laying plans for an armed intervention. Cuban Statement Published Today, Pravda, the Communist Party paper, took the unusual step of publishing a long statement by the Cuban Government on the events in Grenada, in which Havana denounced the killing of Mr. Bishop but insisted that it had stayed clear of the entire dispute that led to it. In the statement, Cuba urged Grenada to safeguard its ''revolutionary process'' and warned against ''taking any step that would play into the hands of imperialism in realizing its plans.'' Western diplomats viewed the publication of the document as an effort by Moscow to establish that neither the Russians nor the Cubans had had any role in Mr. Bishop's death, and that they viewed the crisis as a serious threat to the survival of the Marxist orientation of the island's Government. Once the invasion was announced, Tass directed its full wrath against Mr. Reagan. The President's assertion that the intervention was necessary to protect lives and restore order, Tass said, ''sounded as blasphemy, as the mockery of common sense, of the Grenadian people who have fallen victim to the armed violence of latter-day Crusaders, and of the whole mankind.

1478-> OPERA: CAST CHANGES IN 'FILLE DU REGIMENT'
REGINA RESNIK and Spiro Malas, who were not in the season's first Metropolitan Opera performance of Donizetti's ''La Fille du Regiment,'' have now joined the cast. Tuesday night, Regina Resnik offered an amusing and deftly characterized portrayal of the Marquise of Berkenfield, a stuffy but ultimately good-hearted dowager. Not only did Miss Resnik deliver several key passages in a startlingly rich low voice, but she proved herself a fair pianist, accompanying Joan Sutherland's Marie in a sparkling singing lesson. Spiro Malas made a fine Sulpice, singing smoothly and delivering his lines with sure comedic timing. He has an easy onstage rapport with Miss Sutherland, and their several duets were infectiously high-spirited.

1481-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; FACING THE DRUG PROBLEM
In a dramatic display of concern over a major problem in their business, the leaders of labor and management in the National Basketball Association recently agreed on a lifetime suspension, with a review after two years, for players caught using drugs. There is a possibility that the new policy is too strict for troubled players who do not have the sense to turn themselves in; it may ignore the redemptive quality of addiction treatment. But the N.B.A.'s action underscores the epidemic nature of drugs in sports - and how that epidemic can affect the image of a professional league. Now labor and management in baseball are holding a series of talks in an attempt to rectify the inconsistency that has marked pro sports' efforts since alcohol and drug abuse first became so visible. It was only three years ago that a doctor connected with pro basketball assured a reporter that players would not take drugs, ''because they have too much pride in their bodies.'' This was after Terry Furlow had died in a car wreck in Cleveland, with traces of cocaine and Valium in his bloodstream. Since then, several players, including John Drew, Michael Ray Richardson and David Thompson, three all-stars, have entered treatment centers. Football had an epidemic last summer, when the commissioner, Pete Rozelle, suspended four players for involvement with drugs. Many other football players have been tarnished in the last year or so, and hockey has also had players suspended. Some sports fans profess to be bored by news accounts about drugs, as bored as they are by accounts about contract negotiations. These fans want to read only about runs, hits and errors, an attitude that hints of a reality-blocking addiction to games. Drugs are a major problem, major news, in public life today. Because of their huge incomes and youthful vulnerability, celebrated athletes are letting themselves in for a plague, called drugs. Baseball has recently seen four players - Willie Wilson, Willie Aikens, Jerry Martin and Vida Blue - all implicated in a drug investigation in Kansas City. Another prominent player, Steve Howe of the Los Angeles Dodgers, went back for his third treatment process in the heat of the pennant race. Baseball's approach has been inconsistent to now, but the Player Relations Committee and the Major League Baseball Players Association have held four meetings on the problem, the latest last Friday in New York. Lee MacPhail, the replacement for Ray Grebey as head of the management committee, and Ken Moffett, who has replaced Marvin Miller as the head of the union, have addressed the question of what to do with troubled athletes. ''We are trying to gauge the impact of the N.B.A. action, which is bilateral, as opposed to the N.F.L. actions, which were unilateral,'' Moffett said. ''We'd like to have something to take to the winter meetings. All we know at this point is that our players do not condone drugs.'' The players' outlook was a major impetus to the pro basketball agreement. In an article written for the Oct. 16 issue of The New York Times, Bob Lanier of the Milwaukee Bucks, the president of the National Basketball Players Association, said that ''we believe that support for the program is overwhelming among the membership.'' Lanier cited three sentiments among the players: that the public should realize that most players ''are not users of drugs''; that healthier players and a better public image will increase television and gate revenue, and that ''we all felt we had a responsibility, as role models, to change the trend'' in a largely black sport that has appeal to ''the kids in the inner cities.'' It was with a sense of urgency that the N.B.A. players agreed to the lifetime suspension, with the review after two years. The program also made provisions for treatment of players who come forth with a problem, with no loss in pay or other penalty. ''I'm as liberal as the next guy,'' said Larry Fleisher, the general counsel of the players association, ''but these guys were mad at being portrayed as junkies. Most of our players didn't even want a two-year review, because it would seem like just a two-year suspension. It's not. It's a lifetime ban. But Bob Lanier wanted the two-year review, so we did it.'' The lifetime ban needs to be examined with some skepticism. If a player who asks for help can go back to work after being treated, presumably within a month or two, should a player who is caught be banned for two years at minimum? In theory, the penalty should scare young players who stand to lose their golden chance if they mess with drugs. But this is assuming a rational mode of thinking, and people who take drugs are doing so to blot out pain, confusion, fear and anger in the first place. Having spent a week at the Meadows in Wickenburg, Ariz., in research on Bob Welch of the Dodgers, I saw the dramatic changes that can happen among addicts who are willing to face themselves and the tangled emotions within their families. Michael Ray Richardson and Steve Howe have suffered relapses, but other players, such as Bob Welch, Darrell Porter and Bernard King, are well on their way to success in their day-by-day recovery. There is some uneasiness that the N.B.A. players and management are putting realistic concerns about their public image ahead of concern for troubled addicts, though Larry Fleisher argues: ''If we didn't have a growing problem, we could think more about the individuals. For some individuals, it could be sad, but do we protect the overwhelming interest or the few?'' Now baseball is taking a seriouslook at the same problem. Ken Moffett of the Major League Baseball Players Association says: ''Two years is a long time. If you're out two years, you're shutting down the operation; that's it. I just don't know yet. But my sense is that we can work together and come up with something. We don't want to get locked into separate proposals. We want to do the right thing, together.'' The baseball officials, like the basketball leaders, know that drugs are dangerous, are illegal and are ruining more lives all the time. Perhaps they will find a penalty that does not effectively end the careers of troubled offenders who don't have the sense to help themselves.

1484-> REPORTING THE NEWS IN A COMMUNIQUE WAR
Most of the news reports about last week's coup in Grenada and yesterday's invasion have relied on Government accounts from Washington and various diplomatic and intelligence sources, sporadic reports on the Grenadian radio station and telephone conversations with island residents. Journalists, many sent recently to Bridgetown, Barbados, 150 miles from Grenada, have been unable to get firsthand confirmation of information on such matters as the extent of casualties in the invasion or the situation of United States students and tourists caught in the upheaval. Virtually all Western reporters were expelled from Grenada more than a week ago, when the Government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was overthrown. No reporters were allowed to accompany the invasion force of United States Marines and troops from half a dozen other Caribbean countries - so the major stories were written by reporters in Washington, based on information given to them by State Department and other Government sources. Supervising editors said they had faced the ''communique war'' situation before - in the war over the Falkland Islands last year, in the fighting between Iran and Iraq, and in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. They said those experiences made them particularly wary of efforts by a government to minimize reports of its casualties and maximize accounts of damage to enemy forces. Journalists Barred In Washington, Michael I. Burch, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, said today that no journalists would be permitted to observe the military operations in Grenada firsthand for ''two or three days.'' Mr. Burch, the top press officer at the Pentagon, said that United States military officials had decided to exclude reporters from the invasion force in an effort to maintain secrecy and because their presence would complicate the force's logistical problems. He added that there was a possibility that the first reporters permitted on the island would not be taken in by military transportation but instead would have to make their way there by commercial transportation, once it began to operate agaiin. Speculation on Misleading ''If there is any misleading, it's on whether the Americans are in danger,'' said Paul Varian, the foreign editor of United Press International. He said U.P.I. had reached some of the United States citizens on Grenada by telephone, and they had reported they were not being harassed by General Hudson Austin's forces. One source of information for the journalists gathered at the Holiday Inn and the Sandy Beach Hotel in Bridgetown has been the broadcasts of Radio Free Grenada, either monitored directly or picked up and rebroadcast by the Bridgetown station, Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation. But some journalists said they were suspicious of the Grenada station, which introduces its broadcasts with slogans such as ''Long live the revolution!'' Those broadcasts warned Grenadians two days ago that an invasion was imminent, also putting journalists on notice. Newsweek magazine took the warnings seriously and its current issue, printed Sunday, includes substantial detail on the possibility of American military action in Grenada. Journalists spoke by telephone with residents of the island, and ham radio operators in Barbados and Miami have spoken with operators on Grenada and passed reports along to journalists. Other News Sources Other sources tapped by the reporters in Bridgetown include embassies, intelligence services, the Caribbean News Agency, a privately owned news service that has proved reliable, and a local newspaper, The Nation. The Nation had one of the last teams of journalists on Grenada. Its reporter smuggled his notes out in his shoes, and the photographer gave Grenadian officials his camera, which was loaded with blank film, but kept several rolls of photographs of events after the coup. Not all of the reporters were expelled. Nate Polowetzky, the foreign editor of the Associated Press news service, said its part-time correspondent, Alister Hughes, also a correspondent for the Caribbean News Agency, had been arrested. Television networks have assembled camera teams at possible jump-off points, but so far have not even been able to fly a plane over Grenada and thus are shut out from the pictures that are a staple of their coverage. ''If you have pictures of the marines going in,'' said Jeremy Lamprecht, director of foreign news for NBC News, ''it helps show the story. It would be nice to see the Soviets and Cubans they say they captured.''

1486-> W.H. AUDEN HONORED
In the end, the most fitting lines of the evening were ones the poet himself had thrown away. W. H. Auden, in a poem called ''In Memory of W. B. Yeats,'' wrote: Time that is intolerant Of the brave and innocent And indifferent in a week To a beautiful physique Worships language and forgives Everyone by whom it lives Pardons cowardice, conceit Lays its honors at their feet. Later in life, he revised the poem to omit those lines, but on Tuesday night they were lovingly recalled by a fellow poet, Mona Van Duyn. They seemed an appropriate epigraph for the occasion, and for the company: 13 eminent poets who gathered at the Guggenheim Museum to honor W. H. Auden and his work, which in their view towers majestically above the forgetful passage of time. The event was part of a weeklong tribute to Auden presented by the New York Institute of the Humanities in cooperation with the Academy of American Poets to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the poet's death at the age of 66. 200 Fail to Gain Entry Tuesday's program, which one audience member described in awed tones as ''a mega-event in the poetry world,'' proved so popular that about 200 people had to be turned away at the door when the museum's 320-seat auditorium was filled to capacity. ''Half the poets in New York are here,'' observed David Rieff, a senior editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, who had come to hear the poets read selected poems by Auden. The poets on the program, whose credentials constituted a virtual encyclopedia of prizes and awards, were John Ashbery, Anthony Hecht, Richard Howard and James Merrill, all Pulitzer Prize-winners; Howard Moss, Marilyn Hacker, May Swenson and Mona Van Duyn, whose honors include National Book Awards; John Hollander, winner of the Bollingen Prize; Derek Walcott and Joseph Brodsky, both MacArthur Fellows; and Amy Clampitt and Alfred Corn. They were joined by Christopher Isherwood, the writer and close friend of Auden, who gave an impromptu reading. The tribute was conceived by Mr. Brodsky, who has strong views on Auden's place in literary history. ''In my view he is the greatest thing to happen in the English language in this century,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''Last year it was his birthday, and nothing happened, so I thought it would be worthwhile to try to mark his absence, to show people how much has been left to us by him. Whoever writes in poetry in English today is influenced by Auden.'' Indeed, even those whose work is not usually associated with Auden spoke of their debt. ''Perhaps because Auden was the first contemporary poet I ever read, he had an indelible influence on me,'' said John Ashbery. ''I had written poetry before I read him, but I don't count it, and when I began to read Auden I began writing seriously.'' Neglect of Auden Seen Several of the assembled poets also wanted to participate in the tribute because they were concerned that Auden has been neglected of late. ''Auden has been something of a forgotten poet, so I'm delighted to see how many people came,'' observed James Merrill, looking around at the throng. The poets took different tones in their readings, according to the material; the moods were varied, ranging from Mr. Brodsky's impassioned delivery of ''Sept. 1, 1939'' to Mr. Merrill's archly humorous reading from ''Letter to Lord Byron.'' Many of the speakers added their own footnotes. Before reading ''River Profile,'' Richard Howard noted that it contained several rather arcane words, and explained that ''frore'' means ''frozen,'' ''penstock'' means ''floodgate,'' ''nauntle'' means ''to lift up,'' and ''ramstam'' means ''headlong.'' ''And of course we all know that 'disembogue'' means 'to emerge,' '' he added with a grin. Miss Van Duyn said she had quoted the missing lines from ''In Memory of W. B. Yeats'' ''because I love them, and because I believe them. We poets are such unsatisfactory human beings that we write in order to be forgiven,'' she said. ''We hope to write well enough that we will be forgiven our 'cowardice and conceit,' as Auden says.'' May Swenson commented, ''W. H. Auden once said, 'Poetry is not magic. In so far as it, or any other of the arts, can be said to have an ulterior purpose, it is by telling the truth, to disenchant and disintoxicate.' And, of course, he said, 'Poetry makes nothing happen.' '' Miss Swenson paused and smiled. ''But I say, if it can make nothing happen, that is magic enough.''

1487-> Museum Show Finery to Lure New Admirers
The small blond boy stared up at the Star of India and a shimmering constellation of sapphires, topazes, emeralds and other rare jewels. ''They look like rocks,'' said the boy, 5-year-old Kris Wagner, wrinkling his nose. ''I like the dinosaurs better. The dinosaurs are bigger. And prettier.'' After delivering himself of that opinion, young Mr. Wagner and his parents, visiting from Bryan, Tex., headed off to find the famed dinosaurs of the American Museum of Natural History. ''I want to see if they look like Fred Flintstone's,'' he said as he left the Hall of Gems. 'Not Just a Dead Museum' A dinosaur may be a child's best friend, but museum officials are hoping that a special exhibit of three jewels opening today will lure a new constituency of adult visitors. ''The museum's image is kids coming to see the dinosaurs, but there's more here than just that,'' said Dr. George E. Harlow, associate curator of minerals and gems. ''We want to attract a broader range of people by showing we are a lively place where things are happening, not just a dead museum.'' The stones in the exhibit are a nearly flawless 15.97-carat ruby, an emerald with a three-century-old carving of an Islamic prayer and an uncut emerald crystal the size of a shot glass. ''These are three of the most fantastic stones we've had a chance to show,'' Dr. Harlow said. ''The ruby is among the finest in the world.'' Gems Lent to Museum Although it is difficult to set a value on such stones, he added, the ruby and the carved emerald are each insured for over $1 million, while the other emerald is insured for ''six figures.'' For security reasons, Allan Caplan, the New York gem dealer and collector who lent the stones to the museum, keeps what little is known about the gems' history a closely held secret. But Dr. Harlow was able to offer some genealogy. The engraved emerald, known as ''the Mogul,'' is about the size of a cigarette lighter and has a prayer on one side and a flower on the other. It is inscribed with the Islamic date 1107 (A.D. 1695) and weighs 218 carats. Traded to the Moguls The emerald was mined in Colombia by Indian slaves at the direction of the Spanish colonists and later traded to the Moguls in Asia. Four holes drilled in the emerald indicate that it was worn on the turban or sleeve of a maharajah, always with the prayer side facing out. The second emerald is a crystal weighing 667 carats, remarkable for its deep green hue and its smooth surface without the bubbles and cracks that mar most stones. The ruby is from Burma, where the finest rubies are mined, and is of the preferred ''pigeon blood'' color that made the Hindus believe that an inextinguishable flame burned in the stone. Because of that pulsing glow, the Hindus thought that a ruby, known in Sanskrit as ratnaraj or ''king of the precious stones,'' could shine through any material and, if cast into water, cause it to boil. No special security precautions are needed for the show, Dr. Harlow said, because the Hall of Gems was made so secure after a major theft in 1964. In that case, a burglar named Jack Murphy, dubbed ''Murph the Surf,'' and several accomplices broke in through a window and stole the Star of India and more than 20 other gems. Some of the jewels were recovered. Theft of Mayan Jade In the other major jewel theft in the museum's history, 25 Mayan jade artifacts were stolen last year from the Hall of Mexico and Central America. Four were found in June by an art dealer in Brussels and were returned three days ago. The rest are still missing. ''Those sort of thefts are impossible in the Hall of Gems now,'' Dr. Harlow said. The hall is in a different building than in 1964, with sophisticated security devices and no windows. ''We even have the air-conditioning wired with alarms,'' Dr. Harlow said. 'Glittering Daydream Trip' Dr. Harlow expects the exhibit to be popular. ''Whether they can afford them or not,'' he said, ''people like to fantasize about fabulous jewels and the princes and queens that might have owned them. It's a glittering daydream trip, people thinking, 'Boy, if I could wear that.' It's part of our society's adornment fixation.'' If yesterday is representative, the new mousetrap is already attracting the adult clientele to the museum, on Central Park West between 77th and 81st Streets. Joan Gallivan of Nashville and a friend, Mary Jo Rauscher of Dallas, came to look at the stones, which they had seen Dr. Harlow display on television. They were disappointed to learn they were a day early, but satisfied themselves by examining some giant topazes. The women left without stopping by the dinosaur hall. ''I did that with the children years ago,'' said Mrs. Rauscher. ''The jewels fascinate me,'' said Mrs. Gallivan. ''They're much prettier than dinosaurs.''

1489-> ART: SIX PAINTERS AT HUDSON MUSEUM
''SIX PAINTERS'' is the title of an exhibition that can be seen at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers through July 17. Organized by Peter Langlykke, the museum's director, it is of painters born between 1939 and 1948 who have found favor with Mr. Langlykke. As he is roughly their contemporary, it can be construed as a generational manifesto. The show has moreover an evangelical note, in that it is specifically about painting and about artists who are preoccupied, above all, with the physicality of paint, rather than with any less directly material concerns. This is art in which the juice runs hot and thick, and it comes with a catalogue in which Mr. Langlykke gives his views not only about the individual painters but about many a more general aspect of the current art scene. (One sentence stayed with this visitor. It reads, '' 'Publish or perish' might be translated for artists as 'Exhibit or expire.' '') The artists in question are Gregory Amenoff, Jake Berthot, Howard Buchwald, Louise Fishman, Harry Kramer and Katherine Porter. They have been given the honors of one of the finer exhibition spaces in the metropolitan area. Both upstairs and downstairs, the modern wing of the Hudson River Museum adds class to almost everything that is lucky enough to be hung in it, and it is particularly favorable to large-scale painting. The ''Six Painters'' of the title have been installed in majestic style, and it is for them to live up to it. Not only the gallery, but also the stunning view across the river to the Palisades, call for a heroic art. Katherine Porter comes nearest to providing it. Some of her pictures are very big (roughly 7 feet by 14 feet), and all have a powerful simplified imagery and an evident energy in the color. Like St. Catherine on her wheel, though not so uncomfortably, Miss Porter is a one-woman fireworks display, and all her big bangs go off on time. Like most fireworks displays, however, she has a limited formal repertory. It is good to know that she wants to address the great problems of the day - ''History, natural things, short wars,'' among others - and that ''what you see is what you come up against in the world.'' But there are limits to the number of times a strand of barbed wire can be put to work as an important motif in the paintings. Nor can her vision of megalopolis be given high marks for originality. There is, in fact, about the individual images in her paintings something of the very heavy hand that was the mark of the Mexican muralists with whom she is said to feel an affinity. But she is a true painter, with qualities of drive, ambition and downrightness that set her apart from most of her colleagues in the show. Where others stick fast in the paint like covered wagons caught in a storm, Miss Porter strides out freely. Another painter for whom a case can be made is Gregory Amenoff, whose work relates to an already ancient and wholly honorable strain in American Modernist painting. There is something of Arthur Dove in the alliance of introspection with motifs from a natural world in turbulence. He may also be a man of wit. How else could he choose ''Under the Influence'' for the title of one of his more hectic images? Some of his smaller works in mixed media on paper come, moreover, as a relief in a show that, in general, breathes all too heavily. Those who lived through the period of ''matter painting,'' when pictures could be weighed as much by the pound as by any other form of estimation, will know where they are with the paintings of Harry Kramer. Mr. Langlykke says of these that they ''droop with the weight of the paint, and exhale its oily, chromatic richness.'' He continues, ''The pictorial elements are gouged out or piled up from the medium, with the residue or additions forming fist-sized mounds over the surface.'' Well, the good news is that, despite all this, the paintings do have a certain quality - above all the ones downstairs, where they can be seen in sequence. Mr. Kramer's hand is by no means so heavy as that of some of his colleagues in the show. The paint quality is not at all disagreeable, and there is something luminous and almost translucent about the finished object that quite contradicts the droop. Perhaps it is with Jake Berthot that the paradox of the show comes out most strongly. Here is an exhibition that is about painting. So why is it that we fall almost with a shout of relief upon a group of very small etchings that are made of barely visible marks on the plate, allied to fragments of handwritten material? What is wrong with almost everything else in the show that these physically quite flimsy objects have a more lasting presence than all that hard labor with the paint? And it really is very curious, in that Mr. Berthot's paintings of an upended oval set in a rectangular field are some of the most dispiriting that this visitor has lately seen. But those etchings, which look as if they had been made on tissue paper by a very intelligent gnat, are another matter altogether. An exceptional presence has somehow passed through them. Whatever its ups and downs, this show is a solid achievement and suggests that the museum is in good hands (and not too timid ones, either). The Hudson River Museum is at 511 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers, and its weekend hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Fridays, noon to 7 P.M. on Saturdays and Sundays. The number for more information is (914) 963-4550. Also of interest this week: Jan Groth (Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street): The Danish artist Jan Groth is known for making very large paintings that just happen to be woven. In other words, his tapestries are not like carpets made to be hung on the wall. They are like paintings in which the blackness of the blacks and the brilliant whiteness of the whites are more intense, more even, more densely resonant than almost anything that we can remember in abstract painting. This is borne out by the current batch of his tapestries (more will be seen before long in a one-man show at the Guggenheim Museum). The black field has a perfect evenness, a regular unaccented beat that would be very difficult to achieve in painting. As for the white lines that streak this way and that, they lock with the black background in a way that has an eager, darting quality, even though we know that it resulted from hard and careful work at the loom. Drawings in the adjacent room make it clear that Mr. Groth does not sit back and wait for the weaver to give his work a power it would not otherwise have. It's all there, miniaturized, on the paper. (Through July 22.) ''Found Objects'' (Marisa del Re Gallery, 41 East 57th Street): The name ''Found Objects'' is freely interpreted in this summer anthology as being as applicable to one of the sculptures that David Smith made in Spoleto, Italy, in 1962 as it is to a delicately confected box by Joseph Cornell. It is used for Betty Parsons's sculpture of painted driftwood, for a crushed-car sculpture by John Chamberlain, for a painting by Arthur Dove that is dedicated to George Gershwin and for an early (1948) piece by Richard Pousette-Dart, in which objects are stuck in every which way, as if in an instrument of primitive magic. There are some interesting historical pieces, too, like Jim Dine's ''Car Crash'' painting of 1959-60. (Through July 30.)

1492-> THE REGION ;
A leader of the state's nursing- home industry was acquitted yesterday of charges that he had conspired to blow up a union trailer during a 1980 strike at a Brooklyn nursing home. The trailer, being used as a strike headquarters, was never bombed. The defendant, Bartholomew J. Lawson, 35 years old, was found not guilty by a State Supreme Court jury in Brooklyn that had deliberated four hours after a three-week trial. Mr. Lawson, president and executive director of the Greater New York Health Care Facilities Association, was also acquitted of conspiracy to commit Medicaid fraud. The charge was based on a charge he had disguised as a reimbursable Medicaid expense a $5,000 payment the authorities said had been made in the bombing plot. After the verdict, Mr. Lawson, of Tuxedo Park, N.Y., spoke of ''two years of total agony'' while being investigated and prosecuted and said, ''I feel great and refortified that the truth finally came out.'' A juror, Kathy Cogliandro, said Mr. Lawson had been ''framed.'' Another, Arthur Schneider, said, ''They ought to get the Attorney General to get evidence before they bring a man up to the grand jury.'' The prosecution was by the office of Edward J. Kuriansky, a deputy state attorney general who is Special Prosecutor for Nursing Homes, Health and Social Services. A spokesman for Mr. Kuriansky, Sonya Hoover, said she would have no comment.

1493-> U.S. SAYS FEED CORN IN TEXAS IS NOT DETERIORATING IN SILOS
The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that nearly 23 million bushels of Government-owned corn that Congress recently agreed to sell to drought-stricken farmers at reduced rates was not spoiling so badly as earlier tests indicated. Richard E. Lyng, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, said tests conducted this month on corn stored in a Plainview, Tex., grain elevator by the Commodity Credit Corporation showed the grain was in stable condition. Earlier this fall, Jim Hightower, the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, sponsored tests he said revealed 53 percent of the corn was of the poorest grade for animal feed and 47 percent was of grade 4, grade 5 and sample grade. The lower grades of 4, 5 and sample relate to broken kernels that do not affect nutritional value for feeding purposes. Grain Legislation Approved Based on the results of Mr. Hightower's tests, the House and Senate last week approved legislation requiring Agriculture Secretary John R. Block to sell the damaged grain to drought- stricken farmers at reduced rates. Mr. Hightower and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, who proposed the legislation, had criticized the Reagan Administration for not making the stored corn available to West Texas farmers hit hard by last summer's drought. President Reagan has not indicated if he will sign the bill. ''This Federal inspection refutes any charges'' that the Administration was allowing the grain to deteriorate in storage instead of selling it to farmers struggling to feed their livestock, Mr. Lyng said, adding, ''Those charges were based on the results of an unofficial, less-sophisticated testing procedure.'' ''It is important to remember that this grain was never intended for human consumption,'' Mr. Lyng said. ''It was livestock feed grain when it went into storage, and the results of our re-examination indicate it is holding its normal condition. This grain is not deteriorating.'' George Strake, the Texas Republican Party chairman, accused Mr. Hightower Wednesday of conducting a ''shoddy'' inspection of the grain. Doug Zabel, a spokesman for Mr. Hightower, said both inspections found more than 10 million bushels in poor grades. ''Those are the grades that would be released to the ranchers,'' he said.

It was a powerful left hook that knocked down his opponent and broke his nose, and would probably have drawn praise if Bob Lanier had been in a boxing ring when he delivered the punch to Bill Laimbeer Tuesday night. But Lanier, the Milwaukee Bucks' center, and Laimbeer, the Detroit Pistons' center, are basketball players, and after investigating the incident officials of the National Basketball Association fined Lanier $5,000. According to the league, Lanier told investigators he had had ''no reason'' to lose his temper and ''no justification for throwing the punch.''

1496-> TENNIS VS. TEST; TESTERS VS. STATISTICS
To the Editor: The rationale of the Educational Testing Service represents a misuse of statistical decision-making. Using the correlation of wrong answers to test possible collaboration is only fully accurate when applied to a sample drawn from the entire population, which contains a wide variety of individuals, but is not valid when those in the sample have many characteristics in common. he students in this instance are friends, classmates and, most importantly, three shared the same tutor. These conditions radically change the probability of the same right answers and even the same choice of wrong answers since they strongly influence the mind set of the students and the way in which they would approach the test questions. A more meaningful statistical test of collaboration would be to compare the answers of these students with the answers of students from the same high school who used the same tutor, in order to control for common characteristics.

1497-> THE TALK OF STOCKHOLM; SWEDES AWAIT 1984: THE LAUGH'S ON BIG BROTHER
A couple of weeks ago, an aerial photograph, the kind that usually reveals missile silos in the Urals, or Soviet-style volleyball courts in Nicaragua, was spread across the centerfold of Expressen, Scandinavia's largest-circulation newspaper. Its focus of attention: the Stockholm neighborhood where Claes Florin, a tax collector, lives. The details had the kind of fuzzed- over edges and indistinct shading that at the end of a briefing officer's pointer can turn a couple of sheds into a terrorist training camp. What the photograph showed were the outlines of a rock garden and a parked car near Mr. Florin's house. Viewed from the air, it was another gray clot on a tundra of suburban sameness. For Expressen's investigators, the garden was actually a secret swimming-pool construction site; the car, the paper revealed, was actually parked next door, for deception's sake, so that no one would associate it with the Florins, or their supposedly camouflaged wealth. It took a paragraph or two for the reader to figure out that the story was a spoof: the newspaper had decided, as its editor, Bo Stromstedt, explained, that it was time Mr. Florin, described as a tax-collecting zealot with a preference for aerial photography, ''finds out how it feels to have his integrity threatened.'' The newspaper often runs its articles on bureaucratic abuses with a macabre little logotype that says, like a Christmas shopping reminder, ''44 days until 1984.'' While they were confined to Swedes, and passed off as a self-critical counterweight to the country's urge to improve the rest of the world, nobody ever got terribly excited here about local comparisons to George Orwell's year of totalitarian oblivion. But all the continuing Sweden-1984 talk has upset the authorities because they see it catching on outside the country. Reporters Boo Bureaucrats The official discomfort is such that the day Expressen needled the tax collector, the Government called in the foreign press corps of about 150 correspondents for a lecture on their supposedly less-than-objective articles about Sweden. The reporters booed the Government's panel of monitors. But the the problem is not going away: more and more influential Swedes are saying things that suggest that bureaucracy as personified by Mr. Florin is winning out over the Swedish sense of fairness and social justice - the authorities, for example, wired the tax agency's computers so that the police checking traffic infractions could hunt for tax evaders at the same time. Now two of the country's best- known and best-selling novelists, Lars Gustafsson and Sven Delblanc, say they are considering leaving Sweden. Talking to a French magazine in apocalyptic terms, Mr. Gustafsson has even described the language of the Social Democrats these days as having an ''aftertaste of timid fascism and vague totalitarianism.'' This brought an open letter to the writer this week, page 1 stuff, from Carl Lidbom, the Swedish Ambassador to France, and a former Social Democratic Cabinet member. As if the problem were all Mr. Gustafsson's doing, the Ambassador accused him of being unpatriotic and cowardly. So much nasty talk, Mr. Lidbom wrote with great official earnestness, was making his job of preserving Sweden's reputation and interests difficult. After all, he said, Lars Gustafsson's life wasn't in danger. A visitor to Stockholm, in truth, does not often confront Orwell's universe. He hears of imagined bits of it from friends - ballots so complicated on voting days that they defeat democracy's simple glories; a woman at an airline ticket counter who insists a customer take a number from a machine in order to be waited on, even though he is the only client in the office; eighth-hand accounts of children who are taken away from their parents because of a contentious or somehow exotic answer to a social worker. But the evidence of a totally regimented society hardly surges through the streets; rather, it seems that Swedes, so comfortable for so long with so much social change and so many of the gadgets of modernity, are disoriented because the range for reworking society has narrowed, and the drive for perfection now creates as many difficulties as benefits. One of the rather mild elements of the Brave New World on public display involves Stockholm's taxi drivers. Since April each of the city's 1,600 cabs has had a mini-teleprinter attached to the dashboard, and the radio cab drivers' assignments pop up at them on a tape, a bit like racetrack results coming out of a tiny news wire. The driver punches a code into his computer corresponding to the sector where he is driving, and, theoretically, at least, he is directed to a customer. No voices, no external contact; clean, silent. Buying the equipment was virtually mandatory, which did not please all the drivers. But the system plainly exasperates the independent types, who once considered that the job had its creative aspects. ''It's passive as hell, now,'' said one driver, who studies law. ''The slips just shoot out at you.'' ''In the old days,'' he went on, ''the aggressive driver could pick off the radio calls while he still had a fare in the cab, and get his next assignment on the move. Now you go from fare to fare - you can't beat the system by leaping ahead - and it costs the good drivers 200 to 300 kronor a day. It's the great leveler.'' Marianne Alopaeus, who has written a book on Sweden that strikes out at the country's habits as if with a machete, thinks that if Sweden reinstated capital punishment the temptation would be to do it for tax fraud. The subject is obsessional, without the faintest element of cliche. Gunnar Myrdal, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, has written that the Swedes have become a nation of cheaters, but tax fiddling is still treated like the greatest of moral outrages, an attempt to work bumps back into the great leveled carpet of national life. The extent of tax sin now includes knowing the tax laws too well, because last week the Social Democratic Minister of Justice, Ove Rainer, was forced to resign because he used them legally, but to his advantage. Mr. Rainer inherited over $200,000 worth of stock in 1981, and to avoid being taxed on 88 percent of it went into debt, borrowing almost $2 million from a bank where he served as a director. Because servicing the new debt was deductible, he was able to write off the money he inherited. People talked about the Rainer affair with a curious mixture of shock and sneaking admiration. Sinking sharply in popularity polls, Prime Minister Olof Palme was required to punish the offender, without acknowledging that his initial appointment was questionable. The solution: immediately naming Mr. Rainer to the Supreme Court. It was a lifetime job as a symbol of Swedish equity, and at a salary better than Mr. Rainer's old one. A lifetime lasted a week; Mr. Rainer abandoned his new appointment under pressure last Friday.

1499-> AROUND THE WORLD; Kenya's Ruling Party Suspends Key Politician
Charles Njonjo, once one of East Africa's most powerful politicians, was suspended today from Kenya's ruling party. The decision, announced after a three-hour meeting of the party's Governing Council, followed his suspension last week by President Daniel arap Moi as Minister of Constitutional Affairs and his subsequent resignation as a legislator and a local party branch chairman. The President has apparently been distrustful of Mr. Njonjo since an attempted coup last August and has been seeking to oust him since April. Mr. Moi said in May that an unnamed Cabinet minister had been plotting with the help of foreign powers to overthrow him.
