425-> THE SCREEN; Walter Huston and Lewis Stone on Opposite Sides of the Fence in a Murky Melodrama.
Truth is stretched too much to be interesting in "Night Court," the current pictorial attraction at the Capitol. This melodrama has the advantages of a clever cast, headed by Walter Huston and Lewis Stone; a script from that veteran playwright Bayard Veiller, and W. S. Van Dyke's direction. But despite all the brains it has borrowed from, it is a forced and suspenseless affair, with one or two particularly tedious sequences.Mr. Huston impersonates a grafting magistrate named Moffett, who is not beyond calling in a couple of "bad boys" to get rid of somebody who thwarts him. The only really happy bit in this production is when he is sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr. Stone has a more fortunate rôle. It is that of Judge Osgood, a high-minded citizen who is proud of New York. But to carry out the scheme of things in this unimaginative, murky story, he is murdered.Mr. Van Dyke was evidently out of his element in tackling this story, which is based on an unproduced play by Mark Hellinger and Charles Beahan. None of the characters appears to do much real thinking and frequently they are apparently afflicted with temporary deafness. The crooked magistrate willingly accepts a bribe from a lawyer to dismiss a case and shortly afterward he sentences a poor girl to the workhouse.Mary Thomas, the wife of a taxi driver named Michael, is a victim of a frame-up gang, one of whom accuses her of trying to extort money from him. Why these men should have picked on such a woman is surprising, for evidently all they hope to do is to have her sent to the workhouse for six months. The magistrate's lawyer friend prevails upon Mary to plead guilty, telling her that it is the quickest way to get out of the difficulty. The magistrate, however, sentences her to the workhouse for six months.When the magistrate hears that Michael has found out something about his nefarious activities he promptly asks to have several of the gang sent out to silence the taxi driver. Michael is "taken for a ride," beaten and put on a steamship. He succeeds in swimming ashore and later that night none other than Moffett gets into his taxicab. One blow from the driver's fist and Moffett is knocked out, which is astonishing considering that Michael is impersonated by Phillips Holmes, who obviously is no physical match for the stalwart Mr. Huston.Then there is the matter of Judge Osgood's murder, and, as Moffett's voice has been recorded on a phonograph record, he is thought to be the slayer. As a matter of fact, Michael had taken Moffett to his apartment and bound and gagged him, with the idea of forcing the magistrate to admit his wrongdoing in sentencing Mary.The wicked may be punished in the end and the good are once again cheery, but this scarcely makes for good entertainment.Mr. Huston and Mr. Stone do as well as they can in the circumstances, as do also Jean Hersholt, Tully Marshall, Anita Page, Noel Francis and John Miljan.On the surrounding program is the stage show "Hell's Belles," with Walter (Dare) Wahl, Cardini, Russell Hicks, the Chester Hale dancers and others.

439-> A Military Force in German.
Another of the military film comedies which seem to be the mainstay of German producers of late reached the screen of the Hindenberg Theatre yesterday. This one is called "Der Stolz der 3. Kompagnie" and it has some amusing moments for persons with a good working knowledge of German. Unlike most similar productions this picture has only a limited musical accompaniment and there is nothing especially striking in the photography.The story details the complications created in a small pre-World War German State through the premature arrival of the young Prince as the guest of honor at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the organization of the regiment garrisoning the town. It so happens that the awkward, but sly, private (Heinz Ruehmann), dubbed "The Pride of the Third Company," by his top sergeant (Herr Kampers) has been entrusted with the task of managing an amateur theatrical performance, in which he plays the part of a Lieutenant. When the Prince (Herr Wohlbrueck) appears incognito he encounters the "Pride" in his stage uniform and, believing him to be a real officer, makes him his orderly for the period of his visit. In this capacity the "private" manages matters so well that he provides the Prince with an appointment with a comely cabaret singer (Trude Berliner), reconciles the daughter (Ilse Korseck) of the commanding officer with her fiancé and has the father of the café waitress (Christl Mardayn), with whom he is in love, named a royal purveyor.Most of the leading players have been seen on the German language screen here before and their work is efficient. The sound reproduction is exceptionally clear. DER STOLZ DER 3. KOMPAGNIE, a comedy in German, with Heinz Ruehmann, Trude Berliner, Fritz Kampers, Ilse Korseck, Walter Steinbeck, Christl Mardayn, Adolf Wohlbrueck, Victor de Kowa, et al.; directed by Fred Sauer; a Deutsches Lichtspiel Syndikat production.

453-> ISLAND OF BALL SHOWS ON SCREEN; " Isle of Paradise" Depicts a Land Where Every Task Seems a Pleasant One. FLOW OF NATIVE MUSIC A Record of Life and Customs of the Balinese Offered as a Charity Benefit at Vanderbilt.
The Island of Bali in the Dutch East Indies, which returned travelers like Paul Morand and Andre Roosevelt have proclaimed as the last escape from tired machine civilizations, was shown to Americans for the first time last night from the screen of the Vanderbilt Theatre. The film, "Isle of Paradise," was produced in Bali by an amateur photographer, Charles Trego, and last night's performance was a special charity showing for the Bellevue Hospital Social Service Committee.The film is a record of the daily life of the Balinese, set against pastelle skies, rice fields, shadowy lagoons, mountains and the pounding surf of the Pacific. Richard Mack has written a running commentary, which David Ross recites. A musical score, incorporating the native music, is synchronized with the fluid panorama of Balinese manners and customs.Bali is shown as a land where "every task seems a pleasant one" and where "the process of being happy is a graceful art and every Balinese knows the secret."The ceremony of cremation, most popular of the native customs, occupies a good portion of the film. Gold-topped towers are borne down to the sea and, preceding the actual cremation of the body, the celebrants spend themselves on games, dances and religious rituals. There are cricket matches, cock fights and bull races in the Ben-Hur manner. Dancers wearing costumes of inlaid gold cloth, jeweled headdresses and macabre masks perform for the rajah and the populace. The atmosphere is one of holiday, unfunereal, without gloom.The towers burn to the ground amid general rejoicing, following a symbolic ritual in which the living and the dead fight for possession of the body. The ashes are afterward taken out to sea and thrown to the winds. Then the gods of the living are placated with offerings of food and with benedictions of holy water, which the priests sprinkle on the celebrants from bamboo gourds.Mr. Trego made the film earlier this year during a six months' vacation in Bali. He said last night that no arrangements had as yet been made for a public exhibition.The program preceding the showing of "Isle of Paradise" included selections by the Meyer Davis Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra, under the direction of Mischa Borr, and a Balinese dance by Dan Carthe.The special charity performance of the film "Isle of Paradise" shown last night at the Vanderbilt Theatre was preceded by several dinner parties given in the Starlight Roof Garden of the Waldorf-Astoria. Many who had subscribed to the benefit as well as several of the sponsors of the project gave dinners and took their guests to the theatre.Among the hosts and hostesses were Mr. and Mrs. Ogden H. Hammond, Mrs. Charles Morgan, vice chairman of the committee which arranged the benefit, and Miss Louise Marock.Other dinners were given by Sir Hubert Wilkins, Mrs. Oliver J. Wells, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Spero, Mrs. J. Harry Wagner, John Chapman and William S. Fanshawe White.The committee for the event included, besides Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Richard Whitney, Mrs. Frank Lyon Polk, Mrs. Reeve Schley, Mrs. Robert Pruyn, Mrs. Charles L. Lawrance, Mrs. Franklin B.

Bell) this film is entertaining, and even those not so well versed in that language may enjoy some lovely views of the Riviera, inside and outside the casinos.The acting of Mlle. Bell and of MM. André and Fabre, the male principals, is excellent, the support is good and the photography and direction are satisfactory.The none too original story is about a rich young widow, Tania Balieff, who meets an old flame, Dr. Gaston (M. André), at a seashore resort and vows for his sake to conquer her passion for the green table. She arrives at her Paris apartment to find her furniture being seized for overdue rent. As there is not a sou in her handbag and her remittance of cash is not due for a day or two, the situation looks ominous. But after rejecting the advances of an admirer, of her landlord and of Dr. Victor (M. Fabre), who takes her to his apartment after paying her bill in a restaurant, Tania is reunited at last with Dr. Gaston. Then the expected registered letter arrives and all is well.

1383-> Edmund Lowe in Role of a Shrewd Lawyer Who Defends Himself Successfully at Trial for Murder.
The latest pictorial narrative inspired by incidents in the career of a notorious New York lawyer is "Attorney for the Defense," in which the leading rôle is played by Edmund Lowe. His characterization in this film, which is now at the Paramount, is bound to recall Warren William's in "The Mouthpiece," John Barrymore's in "State's Attorney" and William Powell's in "For the Defense."The present contribution is based on a story by James K. McGuinness. Although it is often melodramatic and scarcely convincing, and Mr. Lowe does not always succeed in lending to his portrayal the necessary sincerity—which, it is true, would not be an easy matter in the circumstances—its last scene was greeted with applause from an audience yesterday afternoon.It is a popular brand of story, with little or no subtlety, but the final glimpse is fairly satisfactory. Here, there is an other District Attorney who is surfeited with being a prosecutor and who resigns his office to defend those accused of crimes.In the initial sequence this William J. Burton is attacked vociferously by a man named Wallace, who has been convicted of murder. Ruth Barry, Burton's efficient and sympathetic secretary, believes that her employer is so clever that he sends innocent persons to the electric chair and to jail. She wishes that he were handling defense cases, and it is not long before this comes to pass. Burton even visits Mrs. Wallace and her young son and offers them financial assistance. He sends the boy, Paul, to school, and takes such a keen interest in young Wallace's career that he gives him a position in his (Burton's) own office.Burton's mistress, Val Lorraine, reveals a fondness for Nick Quinn, a reprehensible individual, and the lawyer, on finding them together, vows he will have nothing more to do with her. He promises Quinn that if ever he has a chance to even up matters with him in court it will be emphatically unfortunate for Nick. Eventually, Burton comes into possession of incriminating documents belonging to Quinn, and Val, knowing of Burton's paternal interest in Paul, sets her cap for the young man. In the course of the subsequent events, Val is found dead one morning, and as both Paul and Burton had been in her apartment, one of them must stand trial for the murder. Burton, at first believing that Paul had killed Val, insists on the young man keeping silent, and the circumstantial evidence points to Burton as the slayer.Burton acts as his own counsel, and through his crafty tactics and his keen observation succeeds, not only in freeing himself but in revealing the real killer.Although Mr. Lowe in several scenes is hardly in character, he shines in the closing court room sequence. Evelyn Brent is capable as the sinister Val and Bradley Page does fairly well as Quinn. Constance Cummings is admirable as Ruth Barry. Nat Pendleton, the former Olympic wrestler, gives a creditable portrayal as Burton's chauffeur. Donald Dilloway is acceptable as Paul.In the stage offering, titled "All in Fun," there are the film players Mary Brian, George Raft and Ken Murray, also Milton Charleston, Miriam Lax and others. Rubinoff is the conductor of the Paramount Orchestra. ATTORNEY FOR THE DEFENSE, based on a story by J. K. McGuinness; directed by Irving Cummings; a Columbia Picture.

Clarence MuseExcept for an interlude aboard a steamship, the incidents that go to make up the story of "Man About Town," the current film at the Roxy, occur in Washington, which is referred to as "the city of diplomacy, intrigue and mystery." Among the happenings are a dispute at a roulette table, secret service agents getting their men, a quarrel between two friends who love the same girl and international prying and spying by an individual who is killed.It is a rather disappointing vehicle for Warner Baxter, for the direction is poor and the dialogue is amateurish. Besides Mr. Warner, other players of undeniable talent are handicapped by the lines they are called upon to speak. Alan Mowbray, for instance, who gave such an excellent account of himself in "The World and the Flesh," declaims his lines and, as Ivan Boris, is constantly asking others to have a drink. This seems to be Boris's only way of starting a conversation.Mr. Baxter as Stephen Morrow, who has turned his fine old family home in the Capital into a gambling den, goes to an Embassy ball with his chum Bob Ashley. The Ambassador host reproves Ashley for bringing in Morrow, who in the meantime has discovered that Helena, who is engaged to be married to Ashley, is the girl he has raved about ever since he encountered her in Budapest. For some reason or other, they have not heard from each other for a long while and the instant Helena and Morrow meet again it means the end of her engagement to Ashley.Morrow is an impulsive man, for after hearing that the Ambassador had frowned upon his presence in the Embassy, he goes to his gambling place and orders it to be closed and forthwith seeks his former position in the secret service. Ashley is his superior and he instructs Morrow to go on a dangerous mission, after a counterfeiter who is known as a killer. Ashley does not conceal his hope that Morrow may not come back alive. Such are the leading men.As for Helena, who is portrayed by Karen Morley, she shoots and kills Boris, after he has stolen a treaty from a safe, for which act his wife, Countess Vonesse, is likely to be blamed. This Countess long thought that the ignoble Boris had been killed in the World War, and she is naturally shocked when he turns up in Washington.The question then arises as to how Helena is to be saved from, prosecution for shooting Boris, and this is settled in a somewhat stereotyped fashion, first by having Morrow declare that he killed the spy and then by having Ashley destroy the evidence he has gathered.It is a crude narrative, which even during its best moments is only moderately interesting. Mr. Baxter and Miss Morley do what they can with their róles at odd moments. Conway Tearle makes the most of a thankless part. Leni Stengel contributes some good acting, and Halliwell Hobbes helps with his portrayal of a butler.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld conducts the orchestra, the overture being "Impressions of Havana." The stage compilation of numbers is called "Rhythms Modern." Among the performers are the Roxyettes, Gomez and Winona, Janet Reade and the ever-dependable drummer, Jack Powell.
