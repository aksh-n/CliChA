Is it not the one abominable thing of our day, that men first cut down the wages of female labor to so miserable a pittance, that the severest and most assiduous labor can only with difficulty obtain bread, for the widow and her dependent children, and then snatches from them every kind of honest business in which they can earn those wages, if they themselves can make any better profits, by adding it to their multifarious methods of money-making ? If a woman makes a comfortable living in a place, by selling thread and needles, straightway a man, stout enough to earn a dollar a day at farming. sets up a thread and needle store in opposition.

LATEST INTELLIGENCE; By Telegraph to the New-York Daily Times Courtesies to the Press. MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY'S OFFICER,
From St. Johns. N. B.
In the City of New-York, as out of it, there are scores of excellent men who habitually neglect to vote at elections. Seeing the City almost given over to rowdyism, they take the only step which can quite surrender it. Seeing the great political parties of the country influenced and controlled, to a large extent, by irresponsible, selfish and unworthy men, they desert the honest men in the ranks who would make it otherwise, and give over the helm to unprincipled demagogues.
