One day after dinner an acquaintance, in speaking of his eloquence, happened to observe, that it must have been born with him.

94-> The Casualty of the Reindeer.
The catastrophe on board the Reindeer crowded upon us yesterday so full a summary of details, that the remarks destined to accompany them were omitted. But delay, under such circumstances is decidedly for the best. We have time to digest the facts; to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and come to a deliberate conclusion.

97-> BOSTON.; Webster Obsequies--New-England Earthquake--Webster memorial--General Pierce's "Bon Mot"--Yankeo Literature, &c.
The funeral ceremonies of yesterday were impressive enough--though, in the opinion of some, not so much so as they might have been. The Fire Department, it seems, was not cordial, and a few other local discontents were talked of. But the demonstration was creditable, and the keen, sunny weather favored it, bringing the population a good deal out of doors, and crowding the thoroughfares.

98-> Loss of the Atlantic--An Affecting Narrative.
We copy from the Erie Commercial Advertiser, the following interesting and affecting narrative of the escape girl, by the sinking of the Atlantic. Mr. CARLEY is a young man in delicate health.

Great excitement was created at Panama by the announcement that General FLORES had entered Guayaquil at the head of his victorious troops. Later accounts show the statement of have been premature.

CHARLES LAMB settled the discussion as to the origin of the Celts, by pronouncing the Chinese the true Sell-tea. The pun is not one of LAMB's happiest; but it is a little curious to note the recent migratory spirit developed among the Chinese, and the fact that a tide is now flowing from the celestial upon our western shores, threatening in tune to equal the Celtic immigration at the eastward.

112-> Manners of the Senate.
Senators RHETT and CLEMENS have contributed largely, in their recent collision, to that unworthy-spirit which has been infused into the United States Senate within the last ten years, and which threatens, unless checked, seriously to impair the character and influence of that distinguished body. They have indulged in personal accusations, and in the use of. epithets of the most offensive and reprehensible character.

A WOMAN KILLED ON THE NEW-HAVEN RAILROAD.--At 8 o'clock Saturday morning, a woman named ELIZAA CULLEN, residing in Fifty-second-street, was run over and Instantly killed by the New-Haven accommodation train, near Fifty-first-street.

To the Editor of The N.

One of the riddles of the day is the facility with which the French people bend to the will of the individual, who has swindled them out of their own. That a great nation, proud, four years ago of their republican institutions; who wrote liberte, egalite, fraternite on their frontlets;

120-> Saturday Night at the Australian "Diggins."
From a private letter in the London Times, July 2, 1852, during a recent solitary tour in search of stray horses, I was forced to visit the celebrated "Bendigo" diggings, and as events of a prodigious nature follow each other so quickly in this go a head colony, it's just as well to jot down memoranda of them while they are yet fresh.

123-> RURAL RAMBLES--NO. II.; Otsego Co.--A Last View--Advantages and Disadvantages--Coleridge and the Pantisocrats.
Yesterday, we made an exploration of a new Sulphur Spring near Otsego Lake, from which the citizens of the town are drawing all manner of conjectures, and in consequence of whose villainous odor they prophesy the coming celebrity of Cooperstown as a watering-place. He who shall venture in search of the health-giving qualities of the new phenomenon, will find it a watering place indeed. 
--------
124-> The Hudson River.
The City of New-York owes much of her prosperity and growth; probably, indeed, her very locality and existence, to this majestic stream. We are so familiar with it, that we do not often stop to give it the praise it merits. As a channel of active commerce, what other river can bear comparison with it? 
--------
125-> Europe and America
We published, not long since, extracts from sundry English papers, indicating a remarkable tendency of public sentiment in England towards a vindication of precisely those characteristics of American progress, which have generally enlisted the most emphatic condemnation from the influential organs of British opinion.

We observe in some of our cotemporaries every few days, an anxious inquiry about the new Park which our City Fathers determined, over a year ago, to provide, but of which no symptoms have yet appeared.

It is not a little amusing to read the speculations of the newspapers in relation to the Cabinet of General PIERCE.

--------
1021-> The Penalty of Murder.
The funeral of Grunzig was attended on Sunday by two or three thousand Germans. That the body of one executed for murder should be attended to the grave by such public demonstrations of respect, is a novel and startling occurrence. In this case it indicates, in ourjudgment, avery strong conviction, on the part of great numbers of our fellow-citizens, that he was not guilty of the crime -for which he suffered. 
--------
1022-> Foreign Items.
The first panorama ever exhibited in England, was that painted by BARKER, and shown in Leicester-square in 1793. The subject was a representation of the grand fleet, under Lord HOWE, lying at anchor in two parallel lines at Spitbead. One of the stories told of this panorama is to the following effect: 
--------
1023-> The Isthmus.
We learn from our Chagres correspondent that the Panama Railroad has been opened to a point thirteen miles from Navy Bay. This road is no longer a child of doubt ; and within two years we may expect to see the silks and other products of Asia, and the oils of the Pacific passing over this road for New-York and New-England ports. 
--------
1024-> Interesting from the Plains
STEPHEN B. Ross arrived at Independence on the 17th inst., from Utah. He reports that at Salt Lake City great activity pervaded every department of trade.

--------
1025-> Kossuth, and Major Tochman and his Wife.
A correspondence is published, which recently passed between Gov KOSSUTH and Major TOCHMAN, growing out of what the Major considered rather cool treatment of his wife (formerly M'lle JAGIELLO) by the ladies of the Hungarian party. The first letter, dated WASHINGTON, Jan. 6, says: The marked reserve in the reception of my wife (Mrs. Tochman) by the ladies of your family, on New-Year's day. 
--------
1026-> The Homestead Bill.
The Bill giving to actual settlers a tract of the Public Lands, is likely to pass at least the popular branch of Congress. It has been the ostensible topic of debate in that body for some weeks; and although most of the speeches made upon it have scarcely alluded to its merits, its provisions have nevertheless commended themselves very warmly, to the approbation of the House. 
--------
1027-> New-York Enterprise at Panama.
The completion of the Panama Railway, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific at the Isthmus, is now beyond reasonable doubt. The physical impossibility which had been conjured up by parties questioning the feasibility of the Road, has no sort of existence in fact. New-York enterprise has already overcome the most important and threatening obstructions. 
--------
1028-> New-York Rents.
The recurrence of the First of May, brings to mind a practical sense of the increasing extravagance of New-York rents. We have before treated this matter as a crying evil. The effective remedy it would be difficult to point out. 
--------
1029-> The City of Buffalo.
This flourishing Lake City recently subscribed $150,000 to the Brantford, Canada, Railway, and to-day made an offer of its Bonds, running 20 years, and bearing 7 per cent. interest to the highest bidders in this market.

--------
1033-> City Post-Office.
It is rumored that extensive additions are to be made to the present Post-Office building. We trust the Post-Office Department will not sanction any such useless expense. That building never can be made what the Post-Office for such a city as this should be. Nor is it just or proper to waste a hundred thousand dollars, or any such sum, in fitting up a Post-Office so far out of the way. 
--------
1034-> British Taxes on Knowledge.
To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: I have no desire to be considered presumptuous, for it is with great diffidence I address the editor of a newspaper, but I do not think you can be aware of the existence of tile following facts, when you assert that the Government of England, by the Paper and Stamp duties, prevent the circulation of knowledge among the working classes. 
--------
1035-> Steamboat collision on the Mississippi--Tea or Fifteen Lives Lost.

1038-> Tobacco in England.
We find the following communication addressed to the Editor of the London Standard, in that paper of the 19th ult: SIR,--As American corn growers have full liberty to compete with our farmers in the article corn, is it not a great injustice to prevent our farmers from competing with the Americans in the article tobacco? 
--------
1039-> The Southern Mail--Affairs in Mexico--Kossuth in Mississippi, &c.
The New-Orleans mail as late as due is received.

Prof. SHURTLEFF, of Dartmouth College, recently made the following remarks at a meeting held on receiving intelligence of Mr. WEBSTER's death: I wish for liberty to state, before the close of the meeting, a few facts in Mr. WEBSTER'S history for the benefit of the young gentlemen in College. 
--------
1042-> The Theory of Charity.
Some persons, seeing how large are the demands of the poor and needy, and how many Societies and associations operate for their relief without supplying the demand, are disposed to be discouraged, and drawing them selves within their shell, determine to take care of themselves and let others do the same. The hand is always extended for Charity. 
--------
1043-> MORAL AND RELIGIOUS.; Church and Missionary Intelligence.
A series of Sabbath Evening Lectures for Young Men has been commenced in Philadelphia, by the managers of the Episcopal Reading Room in Walnut street. The first lecture was preached by the Right Rev.

We have had fine weather, with little interruption, during the week and the harvest is proceeding rapidly. The CORN trade has consequently been dull, and WHEAT and FLOUR are both rather cheaper.

--------
1045-> WASHINGTON.; Vessels on the Musquito Coast--The Prometheus. &c.
I have seen letters from officers of our vessels sent to the Musquito Coast, dated the 15th and 17th January. The Saranac and Albany were there, and a very strong British force. The Saranac was the first American ship of war that ever appeared there, though the British Navy have a force fully commensurate with the importance of their pretensions in that quarter. 
--------
1046-> Items from Baltimore.
We have no mail south of Washington. The boiler at HAMMILL'S Steam Grist Mill, on Long Dock, exploded this morning, dangerously scalding an Engineer, named JOHN NORTH. Two conductors of freight trains on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, named JOSIAH RAY and ELIAS BEVINS, were caught between the cars to-day, and badly crushed.

--------
1048-> Gen. Scott at Cincinnati.
General SCOTT received visitors all this morning at the Burntt House, until 11 o'clock, at which hour he took a private carriage to drive round the city and view the public buildings. He went quite privately, it being his desire, if possible, not to be recognised. The people on the route, however, knew his countenance, and the carriage was soon compelled to drive through crowds assembled almost instantaneously as it passed along. 
--------
1049-> Elections for Mayor, &c.

It is now stated here by those who are well acquainted with Mr. HINCKS, the Inspector-General of Customs, and the objects of his visit to Lon don, that he has had no part in prompting the present Ministers to their recent course on the subject of the fisheries. I mentioned, the other day, the rumor that he was at the bottom of the motive. 
--------
1064-> New Direction of Trade.
It was only a day or two since that we ventured the speculation that the British freight and passenger trade with China, would at an early day be directed in part across the Isthmus of Panama. The Africa brings intelligence of a yet more immediate, if not more important movement in this direction.

To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: The Editor of the Courier and Enquirer, since the nomination of Gen.

--------
1075-> Boiler Inspections.
To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: In your Editorial of Saturday, entitled "Defective Boilers," you say, " The Coroner's quest in the matter of the Reindcer, has proven at least one thing--to wit, that the certificates of steamboat inspectors are a sorry humbug, productive of more mischief than they are designed to remedy," and "that the corrosion at the spot where the accident originated could have been detected by the slightest inspection." 
--------
1076-> What Then?
The medal has been reversed. We get at the other and Democratic side. Gen. PIERCE is President de facto. The remainder of Mr. FILLMORE'S term is as the smouldering snuff of a blewn-out candle.

--------
1081-> The Disraelite Ministry.
Although the news by the Canada is without essential moment, it is not entirely devoid of interest. The march of politics in England is particularly instructive and amusing. There is a rare mustering of opposition to the sickly Ministry of My Lord Derby. Recent animosities are healed over, and the oldest prejudices laid at rest, in courtesy to the new reglinc. 
--------
1082-> Kossuth in Washington.
A letter from our correspondent at Washington states that Congress will do nothing for KOSSUTH; and that fear of deranging Presidential programmes is the operating motive. The South seems to have taken ground against him, and Presidential candidates court the favor of the South.

It would be a very difficult task here, or elsewhere, to enter into any detailed inquiry as to the means by which delegates have been elected in favor of Mr. FILLMORE, Gen. SCOTT or Mr. WERSTER.
