INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 16 -- The statement of D.S. Alexander of Buffalo that Gen. Harrison would not be a candidate for reelection as President, and the prompt announcement of Gen. Harrison himself that no one was authorized to speak for him, have caused no little amusement in political circles. 
--------
7-> DOHERTY IS A PUZZLE NOW.; Statements as to His Intention to Talk Are All in a Tangle.
Has ex-Police Capt. Doherty seen a vision or has he been misrepresented?

9-> A Roast of Eland.
The flesh of the eland is excellent -- fat, well tasted, and resembling young beef, with a gamelike flavor. The shape of the animal is, of course, well known.

Richard Theil of 161 Gold Street, Brooklyn, was a dog-catcher until yesterday afternoon. He thought a few weeks ago that dog-catching was a pleasant and remunerative political position.

--------
21-> HOW HAS INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT AFFECTED AMERICAN AUTHORS?
American writers of books were among the most earnest advocates of international copyright. We never saw any indication that their advocacy was prompted by self-interest. Most of them followed Mr. Lowell's example in resting the argument on common honesty. Some of them may have hoped, under copyright protection, to tempt the English reader. 
--------

--------
30-> BEAUTIFUL STAGE GOWNS; Now on the Boards at the Empire and the Star Theatres.
A few years ago the pretty gowns worn in the first act of "The Masqueraders" at the Empire Theatre would have aroused unrestrained enthusiasm and pens would have been busy describing and descanting.

--------
32-> New and Old Shops -- Paris.
The growth of the Bon Marche and the Louvre, which has been entirely effected within the last forty years, supplies evidence enough that in Paris, as in London, the tendency of the period -- outside the cooks -- is toward comprehensive establishments, where objects of many natures can be found at low prices under the same roof. 
--------
33-> TO IMPROVE NEW-YORK CITY'S SCHOOLS.; Report of Commission Appointed to Prepare a Bill for the Legislature.

LONDON, Aug. 1 -- The Spanish Government purchased three cruisers from English firms to-day.

WASHINGTON, March 14 -- It was expected that the motion to reconsider the vote by which the Bland bill was advanced to its third reading in the Senate would be defeated, and, also, that a majority of the Senators would refuse to recommit the bill for amendment.

Yrigoyen, the Charge d'Affaires of the Peruvian Legation, said to-day that the report that the so-called revolutionists of Peru had killed several members of the family of the British Consul at Callao could not be true.

--------
51-> CHICAGO PRODUCE MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 13. -- The already much discussed Government report will not "down." It still continues to receive attention of a hostile nature, however, and to indirectly affect the grain markets.

--------
55-> THE SUGAR PLANTERS' DEFECTION.
The situation created by the avowed intention of a considerable party of the Louisiana sugar planters to act in national politics with the Republicans is interesting, but is not likely to be of great importance. It may give a few seats in the House to the Republicans, but on the issue of restoring McKinleyism, in full or in part, these few votes will have no material effect.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12. -- If the friends of John L. Stevens, late Minister of the United States to Hawaii, believed that his connection with the Hawaiian annexation scheme was to receive no more serious condemnation in the Senate than had been bestowed upon it, they were sadly disappointed to-day when Mr. Gray took the exMinister in hand. 
--------
60-> THE RESTORATION OF RATES.
With the beginning of the new year freight rates, which had become greatly demoralized, were restored to a standard basis by an agreement between the Presidents of the Eastern and Western trunk line railroads.

The bears show that they appreciate the change in sentiment, and the advance to-day was due to the covering of short contracts as much as to anything else. 
--------
63-> BROOKLYN REFINERIES RESUME; Fourteen Hundred Men at Work at Midnight and Thirteen Hundred More Will Be Employed To-day.

--------
71-> NO CHANGES IN RACING RULES.; The Jockey Club Members Decide to Make Haste Slowly.
Nothing of consequence was done at the meeting of The Jockey Club last evening.

There can be no question that it would be perfectly in agreement with the usage of civilized nations for Russia to commence war against Turkey with an attempt to seize on Constantinople by a sudden and unlooked-for attack; though it may be very well questioned whether Constantinople would necessarily fall in consequence of the appearance of a hostile fleet before it.

--------
294-> FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL; PRICES IS THE STOCK MARKET STILL ADVANCING. Sugar the Leader in Point of Activity, but Its Fluctuations Narrow, Pend- ing Definite Tariff Information -- General Electric and Western Union the Strong Features -- St. Paul Moving Up on Improving Business Conditions in Its Territory.
NEW-YORK, Wednesday, Feb. 28 -- P.M. Conditions which have prevailed for some time again governed to-day's market. There was the usual grist of alleged information from Washington as to the treatment sugar is to receive under the new tariff, but it was of the same contradictory nature as all that has come from that centre for weeks past.

--------
298-> ORANGE BLOOM A WINNER.; Had Not Trotted in a Race Since 1887, but Was Speedy at Gravesend.
The postponed programme of the Parkway trotting meeting, which was interrupted by rain last Thursday, developed some good sport yesterday. Although the track was by no means fast, the horses of the 2:27 class trotted their second heat in 2:25 1/4, treating the spectators to a fine finish between Boy Blue and the favorite, Orange Bloom. 
--------
299-> HOW ABOUT THIS, MR. PAXSON?
From The Wall Street Journal. The London Financial Times of Jan. 2 contained a two-column interview with Receiver Paxson of Reading, an abstract of which was published by us. In the course of cross-examination in the Rice suit at Philadelphia, Receiver Paxson contradicted a number of statements therein, and said that the interview was inaccurate, and that he was not responsible for very much of it.

--------
301-> WILL BE EASILY SUBSCRIBED.; Bankers Believe that the New Bonds Will Command an Extra Premium.
Secretary Carlisle's action was taken too late in the day to affect the down-town markets except by anticipation. All day Wall Street had been supplied with reports from Washington which foreshadowed something of the kind. The markets broadened under this influence, and purchases, especially in securities, reflected greatly improved feeling through the unerring signs of firm, if not of advancing quotations. 
--------
302-> WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION; NEW-YORK ADMINISTRATION MEN NATURALLY ANXIOUS. Senator Hill's Hand Seen in the Delay in Acting on New-York Nominations -- No Need for Him to Pose Longer as a Persecuted Friend of the Administration -- The Brother of ex-President Harrison Rejected by the Senate on Political Grounds.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 -- In the last two or three days several Administration Democrats of New-York State who have been appointed to more or less responsible positions have appeared in Washington to ascertain, if possible, why their nominations have not been confirmed. Valentine Fleckenstein of Rochester, named by Mr. Cleveland for the position of Collector of Internal Revenue for the Twenty-eighth District, is one of these. 
--------
303-> THE MONEY MARKET.
The money market was quiet. Call loans were made at 1@1 1/2 per cent. The last loan was made at 1 per cent. 
--------
304-> MR. CARLISLE'S BANKING PLAN.
In several substantial and even essential features the plan submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury for the remodeling of the bank currency system of the United States is extremely encouraging. Its general purpose proves, on examination, to be, as we inferred from the President's summary of it, excellent. 
--------
305-> PULLMAN CAR PATRONS PROSCRIBED.; General Master Workman Sovereign Defines the Issue.
DES MOINES, Iowa, June 30 -- General Master Workman Sovereign Issued an order to-night to the Knights of Labor to boycott every person who patronizes the Pullman Company or rides in a Pullman car. It reads.

--------
307-> THE PEOPLE'S SINGING CLASSES; Mr. Hewitt Commends Mr. Damrosch's Work, and Thinks the Public Ought to Help Sustain the Cooper Union Work.
To the Editor of The New-York Times: I am very much relieved and gracitied to learn from the card of Mr. Frank Damrosch that I was mistaken in saying, in a private letter not intended for publication, that be had discontinued his musical instruction in the great hall of Cooper Union. The error, however, is easily explained. 
--------
308-> COULD NOT REMEMBER HIS LATIN.; The Rev. Mr. Olmstead Has an Impromptu Argument with Mr. Wateman.
An open-air meeting was held last night in Union Square in favor of the underground rapid-transit scheme of the Chamber of Commerce.

--------
309-> THE CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 16. -- The feature of today's market was its activity in all of the principal lines, but it wholly lacked interest, because of the narrowness and infrequency of fluctuations. Enough business was transacted in West Chicago to expect a difference of several points in figures, but the opening quotation, 141 3/4, and the closing price, 141 5/8, indicate its inertness. 
--------
310-> NEWPORT'S SEASON WELL BEGUN.; Well-Known Summer Residents Who Opened Their Cottages Last Week.
NEWPORT, R.I., June 16. -- Newport's harbor is dotted once more with white-winged pleasure craft, her drives are filled with prancing horses and handsome traps each afternoon, the Casino has begun to have its visitors, and there is every evidence that the season is well begun. 
--------
311-> Dover of the Past.
Of all the Cinque ports, Dover, perhaps, offered the least natural inducements to forming a harbor. But it was the gateway of the shortest cut to the Continent, and accordingly the commanding cliffs have been fortified from time immemorial. There was probably a standing British encampment on the heights that are now surmounted by a castle, which incloses thirty-five acres within its precincts. 
--------
312-> Southern Pacific and Atchison.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., March 16. -- The rate war situation was somewhat modified by the expressions of C.P. Huntington, President of the Southern Pacific Company, last night. Said Mr. Huntington: "This war is sure to end sooner or later. When the time comes the companies will agree to a settlement.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn., June 16. -- The score or more of charming Summer resorts along the Sound are awakening after the long Winter of solitude to the fact that the season has opened, and hotels and cottages are fast filling with guests.

SING SING, N.Y., Aug. 18 -- If a person who had not visited Sing Sing Prison within the past six months should call there today he would hardly know the place, except that the long main portion, where the galleries are, will strike him as familiar, but all the other externals are so changed that it is hard to remember just how the old place looked. 
--------
319-> HAS NO USE FOR MR. FAGAN.; Attorney General WiLL Pick His Own Assistants if He Goes to Troy.
ALBANY, March 16. -- Gov. Flower and the Attorney General do not agree as to the manner in which the Troy election crimes should be prosecuted.

The Attorney General declined to undertake the task under dictation as to whom he should associate with him. 
--------
320-> THE STRIKE ON SCHOOLHOUSES BEGUN.; Men Who Are Getting Union Wages May Refuse to Quit Work.
Acting under orders from the Board of Walking Delegates, a number of painters and carpenters employed in repairing the public school buildings in this city began a strike yesterday, which, if the intentions of the board are carried out, will include nearly all the men making repairs and alterations to the buildings, and throw out of employment 1,500 men, principally carpenters and painters.

--------
322-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
There was a general taking possession of office yesterday by those elected last November, and it produced considerable change of political complexion. At Albany Republicans took charge of the executive departments for the first time since 1883, except that the candidacy of MAYNARD for Secretary of State in that year led to the continuance of CARR in that office for two years more.

Let me now give you an instance of wonderful heroism, rising to meet the demands of a sudden crisis. 
--------
325-> The Sugar Duty.
To the Editor of The New-York Times: One point in the objectionable Senate sugar schedule which seems to have escaped general observation is that any ad valorem rate on raw and refined will deprive consumers of that small concession in the McKinley bill which places sugar not over No. 16 Dutch standard on the same basis as raw. 
--------
326-> QUESTION THEIR FATHER'S INVESTMENT.; The Marshall Sisters Seek to Recover a Fund of $89,000.
Thomas W. Marshall died in July, 1892, leaving an estate estimated to be worth $100,000. He had three daughters, Mary K. Marshall, Rebecca M. Marshall, and Penelope A. Luttgen, who, by the will, received equal shares in the estate. Mary K. Marshall was made executrix.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 1 -- Three hundred and fourteen years ago the English navigator Sir Francis Drake made a landing from his ship, the Golden Hinde, at what has since been known as Drake's Bay, and Francis Flitcher, a Presbyter of the Church of England and Chaplain of the Golden Hinde, preached the first sermon in the English tongue on the Pacific coast. 
--------
330-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The bill prepared by Assemblyman Lawson is undoubtedly the outgrowth of the agitation in this city and Brooklyn in regard to the display of Ireland's green flag on St. Pattrick's Day.

332-> PLAYS BY AMATEUR ACTORS.; Successful Entertainment by the Students' Dramatic Club.
Although the majority of society people have left town for their country homes or Europe, the Berkeley Lyceum was well filled with a fashionable audience last evening when the Students' Dramatic Club gave an interesting theatrical entertainment. Two clever plays were unusually well presented.

--------
334-> TIMING OF ATHLETES.; Merits of the Fly-Back and Side-Movement Watches Discussed.
The question of timing sprinters and cyclists has been discussed at great length by the sporting authorities of England and America, and there appears to be a difference of opinion regarding the best watch to use. In amateur circles in both countries the fifth-second stop and fly-back is universally used, but among professionals the old-fashioned side-movement watch that records yards, and not fractional parts of seconds, has the call. 
--------
335-> CHARGED WITH BEING A COUNTERFEITER.; Russell B. Hoyt, Arrested by Secret Service Officers, Declares He is Innocent.
Russel B. Hoyt was committed yesterday in default of $10,000 bail by United States Commissioner Alexander to await examination on a charge of counterfeiting United States notos Mr. Forsyth, Chief of the Secret Service Bureau, who made the arrest, refused to give details, on the ground that the arrest of others believed to be implicated with Hoyt might be prevented.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 -- The statement quoted in The New-York Times to-day from the Berlin Tageblatt of Nov. 1, that the United States has given some sort of promise to the German Government that the Administration will make a request to Congress to abolish the discriminating duty on "bounty-paid" sugars, has not been corroborated here.

--------
339-> CIVIL SERVICE REFORM PROGRESSING.; Secretary McAneny Tells What Has Been Accomplished in the Last Month.
George McAneny, Jr., Assistant Secretary of the Civil Service-Reform Association, has just Issued his monthly report.

340-> PRENDERGAST GROWING SULLEN.; Murderers' Row Has an Unpleasant Effect on the Assassin.
CHICAGO, Jan. 1 -- Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast was on his dignity again to-day. When his breakfast was served he was asked if he wanted coffee to drink. "No," he snarled.

--------
341-> FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL; SPECULATIVE INTEREST CENTRES IN THE INDUSTRIALS. Sharp Declines in Sugar and Chicago Gas -- Heavy Liguidation in Distilling and Cattle Feeding Forces the Price Down, but Insiders Mark It Back Again in the Late Trading on Light Transactions -- Railway Stocks Quiet and Not Materially Lower.
Interest in speculation yesterday centred in the industrials, and of these Sugar and Distilling and Cattle Feeding were the most active. Sugar was fairly well held in the early trading, but became weak about noon, when it was announced from Washington that the tariff conference committee had determined to report a disagreement.

342-> Trow Directory Officers Elected.
JERSEY CITY, N.J., July 17 -- The annual meeting of the Trow Directory Printing and Bookbinding Company of New-York was held in this city this afternoon.

346-> NEED OF REFORMS IN THE NAVY; No Administrative System Worthy the Name Say Experts.

--------
348-> THE ARMENIAN QUESTION.
The work of the Armenian revolutionists, to which we referred a few weeks since, is already bearing fruit. We may indeed question the absolute accuracy of news from Asia Minor that conies to us via Vienna and London. The story of 125 killed and 340 wounded at Yuzgat may be very heavily discounted, as may also most of the statements that come in that roundabout way. 
--------
349-> Greek and Latin Churches.
The eleventh century established the rupture between the Greek and the Latin Churches, which has never yet been closed; but which, on the contrary, has, it is to be feared, been seriously widened by the proceedings of the Vatican Council of 1870 -- proceedings which appear to have so greatly sharpened the edges of Papal infallibility. 
--------
350-> James Wilson McDill.
James Wilson McDill of the Inter-State Commerce Commission died in Creston, Iowa, yesterday morning. He was born in Monroe, Butler County, Ohio, March 4, 1834.

He declined a re-election, and was appointed a State Railroad Commissioner by Gov. Gear. 
--------
351-> THE BOSTON MARKET.
BOSTON, Feb. 14. -- There was some trading in local securities to-day, but the fluctuations were not wide, and interest in the market was slight. Bell Telephone declined somewhat, selling once at 169 1/2, but later recovering to 170. The agitation of telephone matters in the State Legislature may partly be responsible for the weakness of stock. 
--------
352-> COLUMBIA COLLEGE LIBRARY.; Many Improvements Made Since the Close of the College Year.
Columbia College students, when they return to their studies the first of next month, will notice several changes in the library. The constant accumulation of books keeps the problem of properly shelving them continually before the librarian and his staff, and, as the room itself is not increased, it is a more difficult matter to solve year after year. 
--------
353-> THE BOSTON MARKET.
BOSTON, Oct. 15 -- Local stocks generally were quiet to-day. The chief feature of the market wag the drop in Bell Telephone, which opened at 199 3/4, the same as the last sale, declined without any recovery to 195 1/2, closing 1/2 higher at 196. There was no apparent reason far the decline. Some one evidently wanted to sell badly enough to sacrifice stock, ana no one wanted to buy except at a bargain.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. -- That conferences do not always result satisfactorily to those who bring them about is a fact which certain protection Democrats realize fully to-night. The caucus which was called last week by Senator Gorman was the outcome of the efforts of the "conservatives" on the Democratic side of the Senate chamber to force the sub-committee of the Finance Committee to make concessions which had been denied them on their individual applications.

357-> HE HAS NO THOUGHTS OF BESIGHTNG.; Gen. Daniel E. Sickles Tells Why He Opnoted the Wilson Bill.

--------
360-> ONODAGA COUNTY'S CELEBRATION.; It Will Last for a Week and Will Be Made an Occasion of General Rejoicing.
SYRACUSE, N.Y., June 2. -- The legend of Hiawatha, so rhythmically told by Long-fellow, will form the basis of the great celebration which Onondaga County is to have during the week of June 4, Clark and Beauchamp, the local historians, have established beyond dispute that Hiawatha was the wise man and chieftain of the Onondagas, who called together the strongest tribes of the Iroquols, and founded the wonderful confederation of the Six Nations.

WASHINGTON, June 2 -- Orders were cabled last night to the flagship Baltimore of the Asiatic squadron to proceed with all possible dispatch to the coast of Corea and take whatever measures are necessary for the protection of American interests. An official note of thanks will be sent to the King of Corea for his timely warning of the rebellion of some of his subjects which is said to be directed against Americans. 
--------
362-> THE AMENDMENTS.
We advise voters to vote against the apportionment amendment because it is wrong in principle, inconsistent with a Democratic form of government, and intentionally partisan and unfair. It sets up a rural imperialism, declaring that New-York and Brooklyn, though they may come to have three-fourths of the population of the State, shall never elect more than half the Senators. 
--------
363-> EXTENDING THE REFORM.
Under the United States civil service law the range of the merit system depends practically on the discretion of the President. It is for him to say to what offices appointments shall be made from open competitive examinations and what offices may be left to the will of the appointing power. 
--------
364-> MINSTRELSY BY FAIR YOUNG WOMEN; Dress Rehearsal by Members of the Monte Relief Society, Costumed as Flowers of the Field and Garden. "Doesn't Ella look handsome? Didn't she do that grand? I tell you, she's a real Southern girl, and she knows just how to do it."
It was at a minstrel rehearsal of the Monte Relief Society that these admiring exclamations were called forth. For a long time the society has been working hard with balletmasters and costumers, and with solos and choruses, its intention being to charm the dimes and dollars out of the pockets of admiring friends for the sake of charity.

370-> THE BOSTON MARKET.

The 4s declined 1 point, to 52, later recovering 1/2, to 52 1/2. The continued low price of silver is against any immediate rise in these securities.

--------
374-> THE DEUTSCHER LIEDERKRANZ.; The Oldest and Richest of the Local Singing Societies.
It is not unnatural to begin an account of the leading German singing societies of New-York and Brooklyn with some account of the origin and growth of the German Liederkranz. Though it now shares its fame with its offshoot, the Arion, there was a time when it stood almost alone in the field which it cultivates. At any rate, it is the oldest of the large societies, having been founded on Jan. 9, 1847.

--------
384-> SOUTHERN DEMOCRACY.
In adopting resolutions indorsing the Wilson Tariff bill and denouncing the course of Senators Camden and Faulkner, the Hickory Democratic Club of Parkersburg, West Va., has performed a service of great value to its party. The value of the service does not consist in the fact that the action taken was favorable to the Wilson bill, but in the fact that any action at all was taken. 
--------

--------
386-> THE STATE OFFICERS.
There is one subject that may very well engage the attention of the Constitutional Convention about which nothing has heretofore been said, and that is the propriety of a change in the mode of choosing what are called the State officers.

Mr. Janvier writes not of the whole theme which old New-York supplies, out of certain striking phases of it.

The speech of Chairman Wilson in the House yesterday and the letter of Mr. Cleveland are to be taken together. Each reinforces and interprets the other.

The railway list, although heavy, was not so weak as the industrials.

Chauncey Olcott, formerly of the minstrel halls, has become, under the able administration of Augustus Pitou, the successor to Emmet and Scanlan in the eye of the public. He is a singing comedian, who is not expected to act very much. He seems to have all the needful qualities of a popular stage hero of this sort. 
--------
533-> THE KOW-SHING AFFAIR AGAIN.
It is not surprising to find the Japanese Legation in London denying the report that Japan has offered an apology to Great Britain, with money indemnity, for the sinking of the transport Kow-Shing by the cruiser Naniwa. If such an offer were made, it would have to be ascribed to the desire to placate England rather than to any sense that it was due.

From The Outlook. It is rightly said that this is the age of woman. She certainly has been a discovery to some, and they have employed heralds to announce the fact.

Nothing could be more exemplary or encouraging than the fate of Bourdin, who carried a dynamite bomb to Greenwich Observatory and made himself jump by a premature explosion of the same.

D' Anvers.) Illustrated. In two Volumes. New-York: Longmans. Green & Co.
This is not so much a story of discovery and research as a narrative of adventures.

733-> Mr. Courtlandt Palmer's Debut.
It is generally conceded that the Madison Square Garden Concert Hall is somewhat small for orchestral playing.

Now that woman's suffrage is so generally "in the air," says an English print, it is consoling to learn that at the recent general election in New-Zealand everything went off well.

The story told in The Star yesterday or three little children, the oldest eleven, the other two nine, traveling from Elliot, Mo., to Folsom, Cal., 2,500 miles, without other care or attendance than they might meet from the railroad people, illustrates the perfection to which what might be called the art of traveling has been brought in this country.

799-> Carlyle, Tyndall, and Herbert Spencer.
To me, profoundly averse to autocracy, Carlyle's political doctrines had ever been repugnant. Much as I did, and still do, admire his marvelous style and the vigor, if not the truth, of his thought -- so much so that I always enjoy any writing of his, however much I disagree with it -- intercourse with him soon proved impracticable.

Railroad managers in the West are much annoyed by a decision by the Kansas Board of Railroad Commissioners which is in effect an order to the lines within that State to scale freight rates I5 per cent. below the standard schedules. Practically this order is not alarming, because the Western lines in their eagerness for business have ignored the schedules and have made rates to secure it.

ALBANY N. Y., March 20. -- Before the Assembly Committee on Agriculture this afternoon a hearing was given on the Kerr bill providing for the construction of roads by local assessment, county and State aid.

1025-> NOVELS OF THE PERIOD.; A Good Russian Story. COUNTESS JANINA. A Historical Novel from Russian Life. By the Baton Gustav Genry chowitch Taube. 12mo. New-York: G.W. Dillingham. Paper, 50 cents.
Why, at least in fiction, should not both parties have a hearing? We certainly have had abundance of romances deprecatory of the Russian Government. It is the Baron with the long Russian name interposed between the two German ones who advances all the claims of Russia. The most impartial of readers, in studying Russian characteristics, is impressed with the two instincts of the subjects of the Czar -- mortal hatred of Poles and Jews. 
--------
1026-> Old Grosson Dead.
Old Grosson, who for long years was in charge of the Chateau d'If, made famous all the world over by "Monte Cristo," has died, and some amusing anecdotes are being recorded about him.

1041-> A STUPID PIECE OF LEGISLATION.
As the result of the law passed at the last session of the Legislature forbidding the Dock Department of this city to do its own work of construction and requiring that work to be done by contract, the building of the massive sea wall, which is essential to the improvement of the water front, will have to stop indefinitely.

Plans for the Year's Campaign with Mr. Hamlin's Famous Filly -- The Record for Four-Year-Olds Her Mark for This Year -- Chances of Contests for the Stallion Championship -- Some of the Stars That Will Be at Cleveland This Week.
Of the numerous aspirants for the trotting championship, Fantasy is now more prominently in the public eye than any of the others. The rapidity with which this young mare made speed last season in her three-year-old form and cut the record for her age nearly two seconds by her mile in 2:08 3/4 at Nashville, bids fair to be quite outdone by her development at four years. 
--------
1043-> WANTED PAY FOR HER HUSBAND.; Joseph Jarrw's Claim Against Mrs. Herzog Thrown Out of Court.

--------
1047-> A RELIC OF THE OLD NAVY.; Last Days of the Portsmouth, Unsurpassed as a Corvette.
Moored to a wharf at the New-York Navy Yard is a vessel which represents an era in marine construction far removed from that of the Iowa.

The main drill floor will contain the many booths, at which prominent society women will sell various wares to the people who will be in attendance. 
--------
1052-> "THE SUNLIGHT OF HONEST DEMOCRATIC POLITICS."; Mr. Shepard's Prophetic Picture of the Results of Party Revolution.
But, whether he be elected or not, the State cannot survive without profound and permanent loss a deliberate affirmation by the people at the polls that they prefer to limit our choice in future politics to the things for which David B. Hill stands on the one hand, or for which Thomas C. Platt stands on the other. 
--------
1053-> AUGUSTIN DALY AND THE CHURCH.; Religious Side of the Life of the New-York and London Manager.
The report from South Bend, Inc., that the University of Notre Dame is to present to Augustin Daly this year the Laetare Medal, which is annually bestowed on a prominent Catholic layman living in this country, will be the first intimation to many that the widely-known theatrical manager of New-York and London is a zealous member of the Catholic Church, who devotes almost as much time to his religious as to his managerial duties. 
--------
1054-> THE TREASURY OUTLOOK.
The United States Treasury will begin business this morning with assets of $789,364,442 and liabilities of $651,766,112, and a total cash balance of $137,598,330, of which $105,530,332 will be in gold. It is an interesting question how long this money will last, as against current liabilities and expenditures. 
--------
1055-> SEVENTH REGIMENT MARKSMEN.; Scores in the Three-Prize Match -- Private Halstead's Good Shooting.
The constant practice at the armory range which the men of the Seventh Regiment get and the emulation created by the frequently-recurring prize competitions have had the effect of placing the marksmen of this regiment far in advance of those of any other organization. Week after week they roll up scores which show a very high state of efficiency. 
--------
1056-> DEMOCRATS LIRE THE TICKET; THINK MR. PLATTS MEN CAN BEADILY BE DEFEATED. The Morton-Saxton-Haight Combination Can Arouse No Enthusiasm -- Messrs. Whitey, Thacher, and Lockwood Regarded as Men who Could Lead the Democratic Party to Victory -- What Is Said of the Republican Candidates.

--------
1058-> BUSINESS OUTLOOK GROWS BRIGHT.; Wall Street's Wailing and Fad of Hopelessness Not Founded on Facts.
It has become the fashion in Wall Street to find fault and indulge in wailing. Hopelessness has developed into a fad. This fact is the most conspicuous thing discernible anywhere in the Stock Exchange district. A casual observer must be forced to the conclusion that the average broker and investor have given up all expectation of ever again seeing good times. 
--------
1059-> PARISIAN PLAYS AND PLAYHOUSES.; Chateau d'Eau and Ambigu Made Money in Summer. Others Wait for the Cold.
PARIS, Sept. 7. -- It has long been the custom to begin the theatrical season here the first of the present month, without consideration for wind or weather. Formerly, I believe, the theatres were never closed during the entire year. The change came about, not to suit the temperature, but because of the railroad facilities, and the fact that stars wished to be seen elsewhere. 
--------
1060-> ARRESTED FOR INSULTING WOMEN.; Another Well-Dressed Man Caught at the Park Avenue Tannel.
Several complaints have been made recently to the police of the East Thirty-fifth Street Station that women alighting from the Madison Avenue cars at the tunnel stairways between Thirty-third and Forty-second Streets have been insulted by well-dressed men who loitered around the tunnel stairways.

1062-> A.P.A. IN THE REPUBLICAN CAMP.; It Claims 110 Delegates and Three Men on the Platform Committee. SORE OVER THEIR DEFEATS
SARATOGA, Sept. 19. -- The Republican State Convention, through its Committee on Resolutions, has gone squarely on record in its refusal to adopt as part of its platform a resolution declaring against the A.P.A. and its religious intolerance and bigotry, and thereby clearly established. In the most decisive sort of way, the kinship of the A. P.A. and the Republican Party. 
--------
1063-> SAYS M'KANE IS TO BLAME.; Coney Island Woman Regains Her Property and Is Bound to Hold It.
In the Supreme Court, Brooklyn, yesterday, before Justice Cullen, the case of Frederic R. and Charles Coudert against W.T. Bailey came up on a motion of the defendants to vacate a judgment of foreclosure of property on Coney Island which was formerly owned by Mrs. Morey. The motion was denied.

--------
1065-> IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.; Peculiar Questions for the Superintendent to Answer.
From The Milwaukee Sentinel. Peculiar questions are asked the Superintendent. One lady said she remembered having seen, when a child, a cookery-book, the frontispiece of which represented the scientific carving of a goose. She could remember neither the title of the book nor the author; could the Superintendent help her to find It? 
--------
1066-> FOR A DEMOCRATIC UNION; TAMMANY WORKING FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE TICKET. Republicans Much Annoyed at the Prospect of Having to Fight Un- divided Forces -- James J. Martin's Significant Remarks -- Senator Hill's Attitude in Favor of One Local Democratic Ticket -- Ready to Support Any Good Democrat for Mayor.
A significant statement was made by James J. Martin, who is Chairman of the Executive Committee, or Committee of Sixty, of Tammany Hall, and who is a member of Tammany's Campaign Committee of Eight, when the Congressional Convention of the Thirteenth Congressional District was in session last night. 
--------
1067-> NEW PUBLICATIONS.; TWO NEW NOVELS. A Girl With Too Much Money. A VICTIM OF GOOD LUCK. A Novel.
There are those to whom time ambles withal, and they must find rare enjoyment in a Norris novel. Here is one as placid as the water of a mill pond, and as clear, and almost as deep, too, for there's quiet satire underlying this long, finely-spun, almost motionless tale of the quiet, unimpassioned tribulations of a girl who had too much money. 
--------
1068-> Parents Objected, So They Eloped.; Ten Per Cent. After Ten Years. Controller Roberts Rested Quietly.

--------
1069-> THE HOUSE AND SENATE TARIFF BILLS.
There were three successive revisions of the Wilson bill in the Senate Committee on Finance. The original revision, made by the sub-committee, retained the House bill's free list and slightly reduced the House bill's duties. The second revision was that which the sub-committee prepared after the conferences at which the McKinley Democratic Senators made known their demands. 
--------
1070-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The Legislature will do nothing With the Chamber of Commerce Rapid-Transit bill unless compelled to take action by the force of public opinion. Tammany opposes this bill apparently because it wants something else. The Republicans at Albany will not willingly authorize a public work that might conceivably give aid and comfort to their opponents in this Democratic city during the next four or five years. 
--------
1071-> OFFICERS CHOSEN BY MASONS; JOHN HODGE ELECTED GRAND MASTER BY THE STATE LODGE. John Stewart Defeats W.D. Pownall for Deputy Grand Master and Jerome E.

There is great interest and anxiety among those connected with the management of the various charitable and educational institutions of New-York, not under city or State control, to learn how the revenue of these institutions will be affected by the provisions of the new Constitution. 
--------
1078-> FIRST GAME FOR THE GIANTS; THE ORIOLES WERE OUTBATTED AND OUTFIELDED. Three-Base Hits by Van Haltren, Dzvis, and Doyle and a Two-Bag- ger by Rusie Resulted in 4 Runs -- The Home Team Only Scored Once -- Almost a Riot on the Ball Grounds -- Police Necessary to Protect Umpire Emslie.
BALTIMORE. Md., Oct. 4. -- No deeper nor more intense feeling or rivalry ever characterized, a game of baseball in Baltimore than was felt and displayed in to-day's contest. Trouble was averted at different stages of the game by the few coolerheaded players and a riot at the conclusion of the game was prevented only by the large police force which escorted Umpire Emslie off the field. 
--------
1079-> Gigantic Corean Art Work.
The Miyako Shimbun speaks in enthusiastic terms of a certain work of art, of great age, now in Corea. This is the image of a dragon, most skillfully sculptured in soapstone, the size being quite that of an ordinary dwelling house. The huge figure is carved with special attention to details, and its like is not to be found in any other Eastern land. 
--------
1080-> THE JAPANESE TRENT AFFAIR.
The seizure and detention, of two Americans and a Chinaman by the Japanese at Kobe, on board of an English steamer, recalls the seizure of Mason and Slidell by Commodore Wilkes during the first year of the war. The resemblance, though striking, is, however, only superficial. 
--------
1081-> ATTACKED DIVVER AND TEKULKSY.; Rev. Mr. Irvine Scores the "Judge" and the Liquor Dealers' President.
The Rev. Alexander Irvine, pastor of the Church of the Sea and Land, at Henry and Market Streets, gave very free expression last evening to his opinion of Police Justice Patrick Divver and Morris Tekulsky, President of the Liquor Dealers' Association. Mr. Irvine is a Scotchman bred in the most rigid school of Scotch Presbyterianism, and he does not hesitate to tell what he thinks. 
--------
1082-> TALKS ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT; Alfred R. Conkling Opens a Series of Public Meetings to Discuss Defects in the City Departments.

Manipulating Sugar in the Interest of the Clique -- Rumors About Lend -- Sharp Decline in Reading on an Announcement that Efforts Are to we Made to Foreclose the General Mortgage -- Another Committee in the Field -- Gold Shipments To-day.
The stock market was less active yesterday as a whole, but there was considerable interest in some of the specialties. Sugar was the most active stock, but the trading in it was not excessive. It was weak in the early hours on reports from Washington that there was a "hitch" in the arrangement which is to give greater protection to the product. 
--------
1084-> THE FOURTH AT LARCHMONT; FIFTY-EIGHT YACHTS SAIL IN THE ANNUAL REGATTA. A Freah Breeze Favored the Racers -- The Emerald Beats the Ariel Badly -- Queen Mab Wins from the Katrinn, and Wasp from the Gloriana -- Five Twenty-one-Footers Race and the Vaquero Wins -- Two Break Down Before the Start.
The Larchmont Yacht Clubmen are very patriotic. They always celebrate the glorious Fourth with a regatta, and invariably this regatta is the best of the year. Yesterday's race was no exception to this rule. It was, in fact, the most important regatta that has been witnessed in many years.

PURDY'S, N.Y., Nov. 9 -- A party of leading citizens of this town became so excited over the fact that the Republicans polled about seventy-eight-eightieths of the eighty votes cast Tuesday that they could not help having a celebration Wednesday night.

Carter, Sixth Cavalry; Lieut. James S. Rogers, Twentieth Infantry, Recorder. 
--------
1244-> ART AND STATESMANSHIP.
Poor Mr. St. Gaudens must feel that he has fallen among the Philistines. He might even search the Scriptures for a more appropriate and disrespectful comparison and declare that after the manner of artists he has fought with beasts at Ephesus. The trouble is that he and his official supervisors are applying to his work standards that are incommensurable. 
--------
1245-> FUTURE "SECTARIAN APPROPRIATION'S."
The only decisive thing in the revised Constitution concerning what are vaguely called "sectarian appropriations" is the prohibition of the use of public money or credit for the benefit of schools or institutions of learning "wholly or in part under the control or direction of any religious denomination, or in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught."

--------
1247-> CARELESS BUT COSTLY OFFICIALS; Kings County Supervisors and the Vote on the Consolidation Question.
The methods and results of the handling of the consolidation figures of Kings County have been, from the beginning, far from satisfactory. Carelessness, shiftlessness, neglect, inaccuracy, and slowness have characterized the work for which the Supervisors have been drawing $3 each per day.

--------
1251-> RECONSTITUTED DEMOCRACY.
The great meeting at the Academy of Music in Brooklyn last evening has very much more than local interest or significance. It is the most advanced and vigorous effort made in this State to restore to the mass of Democratic voters the control of their own affairs, of which the machine and the bosses have for so long deprived them. 
--------
1252-> DEATH AT THE CARMENCITA BALL.; Terence Gullagher Expires While Roughs Are Fighting the Police.
It was a decidedly unsavory procession that wended its way into the Tammany Hall Assembly Room during the late hours of Monday night and the early ones of Tuesday morning. The disreputable resorts along the Bowery, in Bond Street, Houston Street, Bleecker Street, and Fourteenth Street were denuded of their frequenters.

First prices yesteruay on the Stock Exflange were higher, but the advance of recent days culminated in the first hour under free realizing of profits, and in the final hour the market was heavy.

A Certificate of Character for the Receivers -- The General Mortgage Bondholders Not Likely to Improve Their Position in the Event of Foreclosure -- An Independent Management to Operate the Property for What There Is in It Necessary.
The public abandonment by the Reading receivers of their plan for the reorganization of the property under their temporary control was a step which had to come sooner or later, owing to the entire loss of confidence in the chief financial centres of the world in the ability of the receivers to rehabilitate the company successfully. 
--------
1263-> COSTLY ECONOMY.
The Board of Indian Commissioners, in the recent debate on the Indian Appropriation bill, received highly significant expert testimony as to its value. The Hon. Dennis T.

1274-> Management.
From Harper's Bazar. Nobody likes being managed. The secret of management is not known to all, but those who have learned it from the good fairies who preside over domestic tranquillity have attained brevet rank among the fortunate of this world. There is everything in taking people at the right moment, and in suggesting an arrangement instead of ordering an arbitrary change of base. 
--------

A Jersey City minister recently said from his pulpit: "The bicycle mania is spreading far and wide, and we rejoice in it, for wheeling is a noble sport and destined to improve the American stock. The craze is more than a passing fad. It is an abiding and increasing popular form of recreation. 
--------
1277-> Reminiscences of Kean.
One of Keen's boon companions was a low comedian of the Adelphi, named John Reeve. He was a clever imitator of wellknown characters, including Kean. He was, however, more prudent in money matters.

This work, though not new to print, will be new to most readers. Published originally in Washington by Tone's son about seventy years ago, it has always been known to students of the period which it covers, but to the great body of readers it long since ceased to be a familiar book. Mr. O'Brien's title page does not read exactly as it should.

--------
1287-> TILLMAN AND POPULISM.
This is not a particularly happy year for demagogues. The industrial and political conditions of the country for the most part concur toward the exposure and rejection of demagogues. Of all the demagogues none is put in a worse plight than Gov. Tillman of South Carolina. 
--------
1288-> COTTON.
Contracts were active and unsettled, with the early trading at a decline of 4@5 points, as Liverpool was disappointing; and the room offered freely. A prominent short at New-Orleans began to cover there and here, and forced prices up 4@5 points, but local longs supplied the demand, and the close was barely steady at 7@9 points decline.

--------
1290-> THE PROBLEM OF POLICE LEGISLATION
The certainty that the plan of concentrating all police authority in the Mayor will make a partisan Mayor a despot and will devolve upon all Mayors much larger duties than they can perform is made clear by a glance at the powers now exercised by the Police Department.

The fin do siecie Christmas weather continued without interruption yesterday. No one seems to expect old-fashioned Christmas weather any more. Boys in this part of the country do not talk any longer about going skating Christmas. They pile their overcoats on a front doorstep and play shinny in the public thoroughfares, to the obvious inconvenience of pedestrians, who appear to be under the impression that the streets were intended for some other purpose.

1374-> SUGAR STOCK DECLINES IN PRICE; Large Sales Made and Quotations Reduced to 91 1-4.
Sugar furnished more than half the business in the stock market yesterday, sales reaching 76,819 shares in the total of 141,930 shares. Saturday is usually a light day, and it is a day when the sugar managers are supposed to let the market take its course. 
--------
1375-> Thinks O'Garry Should be Forgiven.
Some ill-feeling was caused yesterday between the District Attorney's office and the Court of General Sessions on one side and the Department of Charities and Correction on the other because the Charity Commissioners discharged Thomas O'Garry, who drove one of the city hearses. O'Garry testified in the recent murder trial of David Hampton.

--------
1378-> THE SUGAR SCHEDULE.
Although there was still pending, at adjournment, an amendment providing for the imposition of a duty on raw sugar, the report of yesterday's proceedings shows that the conclusions of the House with respect to the sugar schedule of the Wilson bill have been recorded and that the action which may hereafter be taken upon amendments still before the Committee of the Whole will simply confirm those conclusions. 
--------
1379-> BUTLER REBUKES GOV. TILLMAN.; Says He Has Brought His Campaign Down to the Level of a Dog Fight.
CHARLESTON, S.C., June 22 -- The fifth of the series of campaign meetings was held at Camden to-day. 
--------
1380-> BAD CITIZENSHIP.
Though the testimony of yesterday and the day before was by no means so sensational as that given at several previous sessions of the, Lexow committee, it may be doubted whether any previous testimony has been more significant and symptomatic than that which has made evident the habitual bribing of the police by storekeepers. 
--------
1381-> McKANE'S REPORT NOT READY; HIS SON NOW PROMISES TO PRE- SENT IT NEXT TUESDAY. The Gravesend Board of Audit Met Yesterday, but George McKane Failed to Appear -- When Called Up on the Telephone He Announced He Would Take All the Time the Law Allows -- Many Big Sums of Money Unaccounted for on the Books.
The finances of the town of Gravesend are in such a muddled condition that the Town Board of Audit, at its meeting yesterday, afternoon, in the Coney Island Police Headquarters, was unable to arrive at any conclusion regarding John Y. McKane's shortage in the accounts. 
--------
1382-> On the Orange Oval.
ORANGE, N.J., June 22 -- The play in the tennis tournament in the Orange Athletic Club was continued this afternoon at the Orange Oval in the presence of many spectators.

Mr. Higgins announced that the memorial had been sent to Mr. Hill, but that the latter was out of the city and had requested him to introduce it in his absence. 
--------
1384-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
There is not much use in indulging in surmises as to the contents of the official dispatches from Honolulu brought by the Corwin, and the "impressions" reported from Washington seem to be based upon surmises. There will soon be definite information upon which something more than impressions may be based. 
--------
1385-> COXEYITES THRASHED BY DEPUTIES.; Twenty-five Hurt in the Conflict Near Buffalo -- Sixty-five Arrested.
BUFFALO, Aug. 24. -- Sheriff Taggart's posse of twenty-five men, assisted by fifteen policemen, put to flight "Count" Rybakowski's army of 250 tramps this afternoon, after a lively battle, in which twenty-five of the "hoboes" and Deputy Sheriffs were injured.

--------
1388-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The testimony of the little people engaged in innocent callings who have been blackmailed by the police, or who have been persecuted for refusing to pay blackmail, is one of the most pathetic chapters of the Lexow investigation. The petty persecutions of Alexander and Levy, as detailed in our report to-day, show to what trivialities of meanness the force will descend. 
--------
1389-> CELEBRATION BY DEAF MUTES.; Twenty-first Anniversary of the Formation of Their Church Mission.
The twenty-first anniversary of the establishment of the Church Mission to Deaf Mutes will be celebrated to-night in the Protestant Episcopal Church of Zion and St. Timothy, in Fifty-seventh Street, near Ninth Avenue.

Dr. Thomas Gallaudet. 
--------
1390-> THE INCOME-TAX DEBATE.
The advocates of sound revenue legislation -- which the income tax clearly is not -- may well ask that their cause be saved from its friends. Few men in New-York doubt the folly of the income tax from the fiscal or the party point of view, but no one who desires that blunder to be remedied can without a sense of extreme disgust read the carping, snarling comments of Senator Hill upon the measure. 
--------
1391-> HIS WIFE REPENTED TOO LATE.; George Winchester Shoots Himself Because His Family Deserts Him.
NEW-ORLEANS, La., Jan. 6. -- A sensational suicide occurred this morning on Carondolet, near Josephine Street, in the heart of the most fashionable residence portion of the city. George Winchester, a man of middle age, of fine family and good position, being a Government sugar weigher, shot himself in the right temple because his wife refused to meet his overtures for a reconciliation. 
--------
1392-> BEARDS, HAIR, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
It is, or, at any rate, it has been, gen- erally conceded that a man has a right to cut off his own beard, always providing that, in case he was a married man, his wife did not object. But it now appears that there is a secret order of Chebra Swats, one of whose constitutional man- dates is that no member shall remove his beard. 
--------
1393-> Taxes on Knowledge.
It appears that the custom of paying an author by an agreed percentage on the sale of each volume is almost universal in France. Books are sold in editions of 1,000, and publishers find it to their interest to advertise that a book has passed into as many editions as possible, as the more successful the public suppose the book to be, the more it is bought. 
--------
1394-> FRENCH HISTORICAL SKETCHES.; GLIMPSES OF THE FRENCH COURT. Sketches from French History.
Mrs. Richards modestly describes her little book as a collection of "Flummery a la Louis Quatorze," and warns historical students that they will not find matter of moment in it.

--------

SPRINGFIELD, Mass., NOV. 23. -- This town has the football fever badly. Nothing is talked of but the big game to-morrow to be played between Yale and Harvard. These two words, Yale and Harvard, are used more to-night than any other two words in the English language. Old men talk of the two teams, young men grow enthusiastic on the merits of the elevens, and tiny children just learning to talk lisp "Yale," "Harvard." 
--------
1400-> THE BANK STATEMENT.; Deposits Continue to Increase in the City Banks, and the Surplus Reserve Keeps Growing.
The weekly bank statement issued yesterday showed an increase in reserve of $1,177,025. The banks now hold $82,008,025 in excess of the legal requirements.

A ten-horse-power gas engine used for the purpose of running an elevator for the hoisting of wagons in the boarding stable of W.

--------
1404-> FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL; STOCKS STRONG IN SPITE OF THE DAMAGE TO CORN. An Upward Movement Late in the Day, Which Left Practically Everything on the List Higher than on Monday -- Sugar Advances Sharply -- Another Attempt to Liquidate by the Whiskey Pool, Which Caused the Price to Break More than a Point.
Until late in the day, yesterday's stock market was dull and uninteresting. In the early trading London sold a few stocks, but the movement was not important, and only had a sentimental effect on prices. Great dullness ensued until the final hour, when, under a general covering movement, the whole list moved upward, and closed above the last prices on Monday, and at the highest prices of the day. 
--------
1405-> NEW CLEARING HOUSE BUILDING.; Plans Proposed for a New Structure in Cedar Street.
The Building Committee of the New-York Clearing House yesterday decided upon plans for a new building at 79, 81, and 83 Cedar Street. Seven architects submitted plans, and after they had been considered for several weeks those of R.W. Gibson were accepted.

Strong, President of the Central National Bank, and Treasurer of the Guild, to a reporter for The Times yesterday afternoon. 
--------
1407-> THE BOSTON MARKET.
BOSTON, July 23. -- Telephone stocks were strong, with very light transactions. Westinghouse Electric was very weak, in spite of the unofficial statement that the company is doing a large business. It sold down to 33 on limited transactions, with the preferred selling at 52. Transactions in West End Railway were 200 shares at 46, an advance of 1 point. 
--------
1408-> FERRY ACCIDENTS.
The infrequency of serious accidents upon the ferries to and from this island is a common subject of remark. Undoubtedly it argues a high degree of skill and vigilance upon the part of the pilots of ferryboats. The accident that occurred yesterday in the North River is a striking exception to the rule. 
--------
1409-> RIGHT OF STUDENTS TO VOTE.; Test Case Respecting Residence Will Be Carried to Court of Appeals.

I write to protest against the insinuations of various local sheets against the integrity of the motives of the gentlemen who have given their time and money in patriotic support of the movement for pure water. 
--------
1411-> DEBS'S DEFENSE.
Next to a bayonet or a club there is nothing that gives a riotous striker so much trouble to confront as an indictment. In one respect the indictment is more perplexing to him than the weapon, because good and wise men may be fatally injured by the reckless use of clubs or bayonets without having a chance to explain how good and wise they really are. 
--------
1412-> RELEASE PROPOSED AS REMEDY.; Leavenworth Prison Overcrowded with Violators of Military Law.
WASHINGTON, April 21. -- There is some talk of making a wholesale release of military prisoners at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where accommodations for 550 men are occupied by 643 culprits. This overcrowded condition gives the administrative officers much concern, as new men are continually being sentenced to the place, and the releases are not sufficient, even by the average remission of sentences, to relieve the condition. 
--------
1413-> NEWTOWN CHILDREN ATTACKED; A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER TERRORIZING THE TOWNSPEOPLE. Believed by Some to be the Strangler Who Recently Appeared in Woodside -- Several Children Hurt.
NEWTOWN, L.I., Nov. 23. -- A man of Medium height, about twenty-one years old, and wearing good clothes, is wanted by the authorities of this town.

--------
1416-> MR. VAUX IS "OBNOXIOUS"; But Commissioners Clausen and Tappen Will Not Say Why. OLMSTED RECOGNIZES HIS WORTH He Refuses Either to Succeed Him or to "Work, on the Speedway Unless It Is Acceptable to His Friend.
There was a lively meeting of the Park Commissioners yesterday.

The Educational Article Passed to Third Reading by the Convention as It Came from the Committee -- The Friends of Sectarianism Make a Strong Fight and the Majority Has a Small Margin -- Republicans Accused of Insincerity.
ALBANY, Sept. 4 -- For three hours this morning the Constitutional Convention was befogged by politics and the debates, and results took such a turn as to throw the Democrats into transports of encouragement for this Fall's election, and of delight over the bad split with which the majority found itself confronted on the educational question. 
--------
1418-> THE NEW FOE OF DIPHTHERIA.
The discovery of the efficacy of what la called anti-toxine in the treatment of diphtheria is one of the results of a long series of experiments made in Berlin at the laboratory or institute of Prof. Koch. Some of these were made by Prof. Koch himself and others were the work of those who were pursuing investigations under his direction. 
--------
1419-> PARISIAN DINERS-OUT REBELLIOUS; Boulevard Prices Provoke Interesting Arguments.
Paris Correspondence London Telegraph. An outery has been raised against the high prices charged for dinners and suppers in the fashionable restaurants of the Boulevards.

SARATOGA, N.Y., Sept. 22. -- Only a knot of Democrats are here to-night, but they are all leaders.

--------
1429-> ANOTHER REFORM VICTORY.
The election for Supervisor in the Eighth Ward of Brooklyn yesterday resulted in the election of Mr. Fischer, the candidate of the anti-machine Democrats, by a small but sufficient plurality.

--------
1432-> KINGS COUNTY TOWNS.
We have already called attention to the lesson taught by McKane and McKaneism in Gravesend as to the utter inadequacy of ordinary town methods for the decent administration of a community that has outgrown the old-time conditions of town life. The essentials of those conditions were a pretty even level of character among the people, a general familiarity of the people with each other, and a fairly equal distribution of interests. 
--------
1433-> A DISAGREEABLE RESPONSIBILITY.
Senator McPherson of New-Jersey declares with commendable frankness that he is responsible for the delay in reporting the Tariff bill to the Finance Committee of the Senate.

PARIS, Sept. 24. -- The yellow carpet of golden, ruddy leaves grows too fast. After the escapades of a freaky Summer, we seem likely to be able to growl at a twin Fall, and to berate the speedy frosts of an early Winter. Wine growers are in despair. Ten days or one week of hot sunshine would have brought a fortune; but the twenty-four hours so greedily offered were quite insufficient.
