0-> THE PRICE OF POSTAGE STAMPS.
Mr. GEORGE H. THOMPSON, the Postmaster at Warren, Wyoming, has informed his customers that hereafter the price of two-cent stamps at his office will be 5 cents. Mr. THOMPSON says that he cannot afford to sell the stamps for less than 5 cents, and, as he has no competitors, he is able to dictate terms and dispose of his stamps at that rate.

1-> Article 6 -- No Title
HAILSTONES. -- Hailstones sometimes assume the form of lumps of ice -- some even as large as hens' eggs, and weighing several ounces, having been known to fall. The stories of masses of hailstones, weighing many pounds, having been found after storms, are explained by the fact that the hailstones, after they have fallen, may have frozen to one another and formed a solid lump on the ground. 
--------
2-> WON THE PRIZE IN ARCHITECTURE.
PRINCETON, June 14. -- The Frederick Barnard White prize in architecture, which was open for competition to the entire Senior Class, and not announced on Commencement Day, has been awarded to George H. Stephens of Pennsylvania for the best essay on "The Origin of the Ionic Style," and passing the best examination on the "History of Ionic Architecture."

3-> LIBERALS TAKE NEW HOPE; GLADSTONE TO MAKE A SCOTCH AUTUMN CAMPAIGN. PARLIAMENT ON THE VERGE OF A PANIC -- LONDON'S POLICE -- PRINCE FERDINAND TO GO -- FARMER DREW. BY THE COMMERCIAL CABLE FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
LONDON, June 14. -- For the past forty-eight hours British politics have been in a state of anarchic confusion and excited unrest not paralleled by any previous episode since the present House was elected. For a little while yesterday it even looked as if a panic had set in which must result fatally to the Ministry. 
--------
4-> A WARNING TO PLATT.; A THREATENED LOSS OF REPUBLICAN VOTES.
" Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad." The whole march of history proves its truth, and the present course of some of our legislators at Albany if continued will be another example of its truth. 
--------
5-> IN BROOKLYN'S POLITICS; THE PARTY MANAGERS AND THE NEW ELECTION LAW. HILL AND CHAPIN AS DAMON AND PYTHIAS -- COL. BAIRD'S DECLINATION -- THE LATE E.A. KOLLMYER.
Although the next election will take place in what is popularly known as an "off year," there being practically no State ticket and not much of a county or city ticket, the men who are managing Democratic politics in Kings County began work in earnest last week. "We propose to start in right now," said William A. Furey the other night, "and we won't let down for the hot weather." 
--------
6-> CARPENTERS IN CONVENTION.; THE NATIONAL BROTHERHOOD MEET TO DISCUSS IMPORTANT SUBJECTS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 4. -- The 177 representatives of 77,000 men belonging to the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of the United States filed into Plasterers' Hall to-day and commenced their labors as delegates to the National Convention of the Brotherhood. The convention has under consideration several important changes in the constitution which was adopted nearly eight years ago, and which is inadequate to reach the issues which have arisen in the past two years. 
--------
7-> A DAY OF MELODY.; NEW-ORLEANS CHARMED WITH THE MUSIC OF THE GREAT SAENGERFEST.
NEW-ORLEANS, Feb. 14. -- The third day of the great Saengerfest opened with superb weather, the thermometer standing at about 74. The vast auditorium was soon filled. At 1:15 o'clock Herr Christopher Bach's orchestra opened the concert with the overture to "Oberon," of Weber. As in all the previous concerts, the ensemble was remarkable and the clarionette obligate very artistically rendered. 
--------
8-> DISTRUST AMONG REPUBLICANS.; GREAT DISCONTENT AMONG THE CONNECTICUT LEADERS.
NORWICH, Conn., June 14. -- The failure to place Connecticut in the column of Republican States at the Presidential election two years ago has been the occasion of great discontent and dissatisfaction among the leaders of the party. The breach is more likely to be widened than bridged during the approaching struggle for supremacy in the organization. 
--------
9-> THE FORTY-FOOT YACHTS; CONFLICTING OPINIONS AS TO THE GOSSOON'S MERITS. GEN. PAINE BELIEVES THE MINERVA TO BE THE SLOWER BOAT -- THE SUNDAY DOINGS IN NEWPORT HARBOR.
NEWPORT, R.I., Aug. 3. -- The talk of yachtsmen here to-day has been in relation to the race between the forty-footers Gossoon and Minerva yesterday. No race has occurred this year which has been of such general interest, and it served to make a quiet Sunday pass off more pleasantly on board the yachts of the New-York Yacht Club's fleet. 
--------
10-> UNEASINESS IN SAMOA.; GOVERNMENT BY CONSULAR BOARD DISLIKED -- MATAAFA BREEDING TROUBLE.
APIA, Samoa, July 15, per steamer Zealandia to San Francisco, Aug. 3. -- Great dissatisfaction was expressed here last week, both by the foreign residents and loyal natives, on receipt of the news by steamer from New-Zealand that America, England, and Germany had further delayed the appointment of a Chief Justice and President of the Municipal Board, and that the matter had been referred to the King of Sweden. 
--------
11-> CITY RAILROAD REPORTS.
ALBANY, N.Y., Feb. 14. -- The following railroad reports for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1889, have been filed here: 
--------
12-> PROTECTING THE AUTHORS; PRESENT STATE OF THE COPYRIGHT BILL. PROBABILITIES OF ITS PASSAGE -- DICTATOR REED'S RULES ADOPTED -- CIVIL SERVICE INVESTIGATION.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14. -- The House Judiciary Committee took favorable action upon the International Copyright bill to-day, and a substitute measure will be reported to the House to morrow by Mr. Adams of Illinois. The so-called substitute is in reality the bill as introduced in the House by Mr. W.C.P. Breckinridge and by Mr. Platt in the Senate changed in form. 
--------
13-> SEPTEMBER IDEAS IN DRESS.
One of the most effective conceits that has appeared in woman's dress for a long time is the use of white wools for Autumn wear. The idea is gaining popular favor every day and the result affords a noticeable relief from the influx of black and dark toilets usual upon the first suggestion of cool weather. 
--------
14-> PARNELL'S DEFEAT CERTAIN; THE MOB OF KILKENNY POWERLESS TO SAVE HIM. THE RURAL POPULATION, GUIDED BY THE BISHOPS AND PRIESTS, ARRAYED AGAINST HIM -- ANTI-PARNELLISM EVEN IN CHURCH MUSIC. BY THE COMMERCIAL CABLE FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
KILKENNY, Dec. 18. -- To-day I again visited the rural districts, driving over thirty-five miles of country. A great change was noted from the mob of the city of Kilkenny, which latter does not vote. In the country I found the rural population to be under the leadership of priests and ardently anti-Parnellite. 
--------
15-> THE READY-MADE CLOTHIER.
I had a chat recently about styles with one of the shrewdest manufacturers of ready-made clothing in the business. "It is necessary for me to be posted," said he, "upon what is going on in the 'gay world of fashion!' If there is anything new -- any deviation from the current vogue, however slight -- I want to know it as soon as it occurs. 
--------
16-> RECLAIMING CONVICTS.
Many readers must have been struck by the remark, reported yesterday, of a thief convicted in Judge MARTINE'S court the day before. It was that "there is nothing left for a thief but to steal." The case was one in which three professional and lifelong thieves were arraigned. One of them turned State's evidence, apparently on his own motion and at his own risk, and told the whole story at the expense of the others. 
--------
17-> JACOB VANDERBILT SUED.; HIS SON'S DISCARDED WIFE WANTS $100,000 OF VANDERBILT CASH.
The famous scandal in the Vanderbilt family which occurred in May, 1888, when "young Jake" Vanderbilt, son of old Capt. Jacob of Staten Island, a brother of Commodore Vanderbilt, married a woman called Violet Ward, who, to put it mildly, was entirely "unknown" in the social circles in which the Vanderbilts moved, was recalled in the Supreme Court, Chambers, yesterday. 
--------
18-> BASEBALL AT COLUMBIA.; THE COLLEGE WILL PUT A NINE INTO THE FIELD THIS YEAR.
The Columbia College Baseball Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to place a nine in the field this Spring. After the Treasurer had reported that the deficit of the season of 1888 had been reduced to about $50, the report of the Athletic Advisory Committee was read. The committee gave its reasons for deeming it advisable to put a baseball nine in the field this year. 
--------
19-> THE NEW STREET COMMISSIONER.
There ought not to be any question in the minds of intelligent citizens of the annexed district as to which of the two candidates for the office of Commissioner of Street Improvements they should support. The issue is in no sense a political one; in fact, politics ought to be the last thing thought of in connection with the work which the Commissioner will be called upon to do. 
--------
20-> FORTRESSES OF THE SEAS; EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN LINE-OF-BATTLE SHIP. DRAWBACKS OF THE MONITORS -- ENGLAND'S EXPERIENCE WITH HEAVILY-ARMORED VESSELS.
Ever since Secretary of the Navy Tracy made a call for eight new battle ships to be authorized during the present session of Congress, an animated discussion has been going on in professional circles as to the type of craft best suited to the purposes of this country. 
--------
21-> Article 9 -- No Title
THE BUILDING MATERIALS OF OLD ROME. -- From the archaeologist's point of view the subject is an important one, as in many cases the strength, prosperity, or even the very existence of an ancient city has depended on the local supply of stone or brick with which defenses against rival towns or foreign enemies could be constructed. 
--------
22-> IN THE FRUIT MARKET.; CALIFORNIA PEACHES NOT SELLING AS HIGH AS EXPECTED.
Probably not more than six or seven carloads of peaches came to this market last week, 75 per cent, of which came from California. Yet prices were only a trifle higher than for the same quality of fruit last season, and the California products actually sold for higher prices last season at the corresponding date than they did on Saturday last. 
--------
23-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
When the London meeting to protest against the Siberian atrocities was in agitation, Mr. GLADSTONE observed that Russia might not be very powerfully impressed with remonstrances upon the condition of Siberia from the nation responsible for the condition of Ireland. For this utterance he was sternly taken to task by the British press. 
--------
24-> Article 3 -- No Title
THE TROUBLES OF GOVERNMENTS. -- It has always been said that despotism is the simplest of all methods of government, and the Russian Emperor, with his legal autocracy and acquiescent people, would seem to be in the best position for proving the proposition; but he is harassed, embarrassed, and in a sense imprisoned by the insoluble problem of Nihilism. 
--------
25-> PLATT AND ALGERAND CONTRACT LABOR
Republican Boss T.O. Platt and Republican Grand Army of the Republic candidate for the Presidency Russell A. Alger, President and Director respectively of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company, which is the lessee of the convicts of Tennessee and Alabama, and owner of the Daily American, in assuming to tell freeborn Democrats who they shall and shall not vote for for Governor, is an exhibition of cheek and gall that is rarely, if ever, equaled. 
--------
26-> THE ROMANCE OF A PICTURE.
No better answer to the scoffs of the French press, when the painting by MILLET called the "Angelus" was captured at auction by an enterprising Yankee, could well be found than the purchase of the "Angelus" from that same Yankee by the French Government. A patriotic lady of Rheims bough a painting by MILLET which equally patriotic experts assured her to be superior to the "Angelus" and presented it to the Louvre. 
--------
27-> CRUMBS OF COMFORT.
Indeed, the one well-founded complaint against the present Mayor is that he failed to keep the pledges he made in the matter of appointments. 
--------
28-> HAD A SOLDIER'S FUNERAL; HUNDREDS PAY TRIBUTE TO GEN. DURYEE'S MEMORY. THERE WAS AN ATTENDANCE OF MILITARY MEN ALMOST WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN THIS CITY.
Seldom in the history of the city of New-York has a more truly representative assemblage been gathered together than that which attended the funeral services of Gen. Abram Duryee in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Lenox Avenue ad One Hundred and Twenty-second Street, yesterday. The attendance of military men intent on honoring his memory was almost without precedent on any similar occasion. 
--------
29-> THAT YACHTS OF THE EAST;
BOSTON, June 14 -- Never has a yachting season shown a brighter front than the one which is now just opening. The score of yacht clubs which have their headquarters in and about Boston have arranged a series of more than 150 marine events. This is another illustration of the fact that the absence of an international race gives increased vigor to the domestic rivalry. 
--------
30-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
An act passed at the recent session of the Legislature provides for a commission to revise the judiciary article of the State Constitution. This commission is to hold its first meeting at Albany on Tuesday, and will consist of some of the most eminent lawyers in the State, representing the eight judicial districts. 
--------
31-> GRANT SHIFTS THE BURDEN.; SOME OF THE MEN WHO RECOMMENDED "PADDY" DIVVER.
Mayor Grant felt ill at ease yesterday over the criticisms which were visited upon his action in appointing ex-Alderman Patrick Divver to a Police Justiceship and took occasion to shoulder part of the responsibility off upon the persons who had recommended Divver's appointment. He showed to the reporters letters from several "distinguished" citizens recommending and indorsing Divver for the appointment. 
--------
32-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
Wall Street is a hard place to surprise, but when you can surprise it, it goes all to pieces. That is what it did the other day when that single-line dispatch was shot into the Street: "Judge Collins has appointed a receiver for Chicago Gas." Then it seemed that every one who had a share of the stock rushed frantically to sell it. 
--------
33-> NEW PUBLICATIONS; PARIS HAUSSMANNIZED. MEMOIRES DU BARON HAUSSMANN. II. Prefecture de la Seine. Paris: VICTOR HAVARD, New-York: J.W. BOUTON.
The first volume of Baron Haussmann's Memoirs recited his career in the civil service of his country. It made clear the reasons of the Emperor for his choice of him to be Prefect of the Seine. He was capable, fearless, and devoted to the Emperor. The second volume does not as clearly tell the story of his seventeen years of Edility. 
--------
34-> MR. TOOMEY'S INVITATION.; A RECEPTION AT THE ASHLAND HOUSE THAT DID NOT OCCUR.
The following puzzling and unexpected invitation was received by THE TIMES yesterday: 
--------
35-> WHO WILL BE SENATOR; SMITH M. WEED THINKS HE WILL HAVE HILL'S SUPPORT. HE HAS NO IDEA OF SEEKING REPUBLICAN AID -- TAMMANY'S RIDICULOUS SCHEME TO ELEVATE WINDY BOURKE COCKRAN TO THE OFFICE.
ALBANY, Dec. 18. -- The Democratic politicians are very much amused over the stories disseminated in the Republican papers charging that Mr. Smith M. Weed has threatened to make an issue with the Governor unless the latter throws his influence for the Plattsburg lawyer's candidacy as Senator. Mr. Weed is not indulging in threats, nor is he a man likely to do so. 
--------
36-> NO HASTE IN LEGISLATION; INDEPENDENT SENATORS WHO WILL NOT BE HURRIED. MR. TELLER IS ONE, AND HE WILL HAVE NO GAG LAW ON THE TARIFF OR ANY OTHER BILL.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 4. -- Even the Senatorial worm will turn. It is a good while getting at it, but when provoked it may wriggle into an attitude that is intended to resemble resentment. 
--------
37-> RAPID-FIRE GUNS.
The completion and successful test of the first of our 4-inch rapid-fire guns for naval use has given assurance that a supply of this ordnance will be ready in due season for the vessels now under construction and designed to carry them. Yet the number of these guns of the 4-inch, 5-inch, and 6-inch calibres, already required under existing plans, is very great. 
--------
38-> TWENTY-FIVE PEOPLE INJURED.; FALL OF A BRIDGE WITH A CROWD UPON IT AT CLEVELAND.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 15. -- There was serious accident this evening at Beyerle's Park, a Summer resort in the southern part of the city. At least 5,000 people had assembled to see a man jump from Cable Street shed across a miniature artificial lake. People stood all around the lake, and a hundred or more were on a rustic footbridge about ten feet above the ground, and extending from a bluff out across the lake. 
--------
39-> OUT OF THE DEEPS.
" Thank you, Miss Fawcett, that will do. Now Dr. James and I are going to consider about you, and then tell your mother how she is to help you to get well again." 
--------
40-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
After a liquidation of extreme severity, which had brought prices so low that the instinct of the average man prompted him to buy, we are met by the announcement that the greatest mercantile and banking house in the world has been on the edge of insolvency. The house of Barings and the house of Rothschilds are known wherever civilized men trade. 
--------
41-> PLAINFIELD VOTES REPUBLICAN.; THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A WORKING MAJORITY IN THE ELIZABETH BOARD.
PLAINFIELD, N.J., Dec. 3. -- The Republicans of New-Jersey gained a gain of comfort yesterday by electing their candidate for Mayor of Plainfield. The contest was spirited and good- natured. The Republicans nominated Mr. Alexander Gilbert, cashier of the Fulton Market Bank of New-York, who has made his home in Plainfield for the past twenty-five years; the Democrats rallied behind Joseph S. Cutter, a grocery dealer. 
--------
42-> BALTIMORE TO HAVE A BENCH SHOW.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 15. -- The officers of the Maryland Kennel Club have settled down to work now arranging for their first bench show, to be held in this city on the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st of March. Hesper and Harper, the former a St. Bernard, the latter a bulldog, will be in the exhibition; Blodwin and Lord Clifton will be present, and the Chesapeake Bay breed will be well represented. 
--------
43-> AT SARATOGA.; COURT OF APPEALS STILL IN SESSION -- PLEASURE SEEKERS ARRIVING.
SARATOGA, June 14. -- The weather here for most of the week has been incomparable, a succession of perfect June days every one of which has seemed to add an extra touch to the early Summer loveliness of this garden country. Cottagers are arriving daily; all the hotels open are well filled; strangers are everywhere -- the place would be called full except that Saratoga's standard of repletion is set at a very high figure. 
--------
44-> A RUSSIAN JEW'S STORY.; HE WRITES OF THE EFFECTS OF THE LAWS AGAINST HIS RACE.
From a trustworthy correspondent the translation of a Hebrew letter written by a Prominent Jew in Russia to the chief minister of one of the London synagogues has been received by the London Daily News, which says the letter throws some light on odious May laws and their application, and affords some indication of the nature of the new ukases threatened to be published early in September. 
--------
45-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Complaint is made in Boston that corporations organized in Maine under loose laws concerning the amount of paid-in capital are doing business, in that city in competition with local corporations governed by stringent laws on this subject, and it is proposed that remedial statutes shall be enacted without delay. 
--------
46-> PRACTICAL TEMPERANCE REFORM.
Nearly everybody who is not pecuniarily or politically interested in the liquor traffic believes that it ought to be regulated and restricted. Most American communities are in the same position with this municipality, in which the traffic is not regulated or restricted at all. To most people who resent this condition of things the "National Temperance Congress," which has for two days been in session here, must be a very depressing body. 
--------
47-> THE BARINGS IN TROUBLE; WALL STREET LOSES ITS HEAD WHEN THE WORST IS OVER. STOCKS TUMBLE WILDLY IN THE BREAK RESULTING FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE GREAT ENGLISH HOUSE.
Before the market opened yesterday, the Street was flooded with abounding rumors intended to create distrust and accomplishing all that was intended. For a long time the Stock Exchange district has been flooded with tales of dire distress in high financial quarters. Not one house, but many, rumor has declared to be in difficulties threatening disaster. 
--------
48-> NEW CONNECTIONS.
INDIANAPOLIS, May 31. -- Negotiations have been pending for several days between the Vandalia and the Louisville, New-Albany and Chicago Road looking to the establishing of closer traffic relations. The business from Indianapolis for the Terre Haute and Logansport Road has been going Colfax for many years, the Vandalia running its trains to connect with certain trains of the Big Four. 
--------
49-> TO FORM A BIG TRUST.; THE LEAD AND SILVER SMELTERS WILL MAKE A COMBINATION.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3. -- The lead and silver smelters concluded their deliberations to-day after adopting a plan for organizing an association which shall include all the lead and silver smelting plants in the United States. The question will be discussed by the respective companies, and some time in January another meeting will be held in Chicago and the organization perfected. 
--------
50-> POLICEMEN AT THEIR BEST; ANNUAL PARADE OF THE METROPOLITAN FORCE. THE LINE OF MARCH CROWDED WITH THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS -- GOV. HILL REVIEWS "THE FINEST."
How fine a thing it is to be a "dandy copper" of the metropolitan police force was felt by every policeman in the city yesterday. The bluecoats that were lucky enough to be assigned a place in the annual parade of the department swelled with pride, and the unfortunates that had to remain on post or do duty elsewhere shriveled with envy. 
--------
51-> THE CASTLE GARDEN MUDDLE.
Some of the criticisms of Solicitor HEPBURN in his report to the Secretary of the Treasury on the administration of the Board of Emigration are quite pertinent and others are rather impertinent, but his conclusions are such as ought to hate been reached and put in effect long ago. The regulation of immigration is a national and not a State affair, and its execution ought to be in the hands of United States officials. 
--------
52-> DOINGS AT NEWPORT.; A CASINO ENTERTAINMENT -- THE LATEST COTTAGE RENTALS.
NEWPORT, R.I., April 12. -- The Winter society people held one of their Casino entertainments at Masonic Hall this week, which was a very delightful affair. The principal work was performed by W.R. Hunter, Miss Eldredge, and a few lady assistants. The early portion of the evening was devoted to tableaus. They were announced from the stage by Master Robert Dunn and Master Bleecker, who were dressed in the costume of pages. 
--------
53-> A NEW ASSESSMENT LAW.; MARYLAND PROPOSES TO MAKE CORPORATIONS PAY LARGER TAXES.
BALTIMORE, April 12. -- Gav. Jackson states that he will sign the new assessment bill. This measure changes the methods of taxation in Maryland. It divines the State into seventy-nine assessment districts, of which twenty-two are in Baltimore City, one for each ward. For each of these districts are three Assessors and three persons who shall constitute a board of control and review. 
--------
54-> A ROLLING MILL SYNDICATE.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 1. -- A dispatch from Youngstown, Ohio, says: "The announcement was made to-day that the leading iron manufacturing concerns in the Mahoning Valley have been sold to an English syndicate. Some time ago options were secured by a broker on the Warren Rolling Mill, Girard Rolling Mill, Youngstown Rolling Mill, Lowellville Furnace, Youngstown Steel Works, the Andrews Iron Works, and the Mahoning Valley Iron Works. 
--------
55-> THE PRINCETON CONCERT.
A large and fashionable audience attended the concert of the Princeton University Glee and Banjo Clubs at Chickering Hall last evening. The concert was under the auspices of the Princeton Club of this city, and the proceeds will go to the University Athletic Association. The programme, which embraced several novelties in the way of college glees, was well rendered throughout, many numbers earning merited encores. 
--------
56-> PHANTOM SHIPS AND SAILORS.; THE WANDERING INDIAMAN AND THE MURDEROUS GERMAN BARON.
To the Dutchmen we have to look for the original of phantom-ship tales which form about the most familiar of sea legends. The famous phantom ship that remains off the Cape as the harbinger of wreck and woe is a Dutchman whose skipper dresses in yellow, wears a nightcap, smokes a short pipe, and is always kind enough to heave in sight when a vessel is going to founder or run ashore. 
--------
57-> Article 8 -- No Title
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAXATION AND ROBBERY. -- If individuals take away some of your property for purposes of their own, it is robbery; you lose your money and get nothing in return. But if the Government takes away some of your property in the shape of taxes, it is supposed to render to you an equivalent in the shape of good government, something without which our lives and property would not be safe. 
--------
58-> A DAUGHTER'S TRIBUTE.; HER VIEWS OF THE EXISTING TROUBLES IN ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH.
A friend has just sent me the article in your paper of the 25th ult. which imputes false motives to my father, Mr. James Blackhurst, in his opposition to the consolidation scheme of St. Stephen's and Holy Trinity parishes.

What is called the "Constitutional Prohibitory Committee," representing the temperance organizations which held a convention at Syracuse in the latter part of May, has issued an appeal for support in the effort to have the prohibition amendment to the Constitution ratified at the special election to be held in April next. 
--------
60-> ROADS IN CONNECTICUT.; TURNPIKE COMPANIES DYING OUT -- POOR ROADS.
HARTFORD, March 1. -- The public roads in this State, which cost annually $1,156,000, are the outgrowth of a system of improvements begun by private enterprise nearly a century ago. These improvements contemplated an extensive ramification of roadways through the State to be known as turnpikes. Prior to 1800, upward of twenty turnpike companies had been chartered by the Legislature, and the stock was held by the shrewdest investors of the time. 
--------
61-> DEFECTS IN THE PHILADELPHIA.; THE CRUISER'S STEERING GEAR GIVES OUT AND SHE ALSO LEAKS.
GARDINER'S BAY, L.I., Oct. 1. -- The glitter of the new cruiser Philadelphia does not appear to be all gold. Having managed to disable her machinery twice on the run from Philadelphia to New-York, her departure from that port for final speed trials was delayed several days by another mishap. Now a defect in the steam steering gear will deter the cruiser from giving an exhibition of speed over the official course. 
--------
62-> A QUAINT OLD PARCHMENT.; HOW BOYS WERE INDENTURED IN THIS STATE EIGHTY YEARS AGO.
MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., March 1. -- Moses Adams, an esteemed citizen of Marathon, died the other day at the advanced age of eighty-eight years. Among the old gentleman's most cherished possessions was a quaint old parchment document, executed in 1809, when he was eight years old, that bound him as an apprentice for thirteen years and until he should become of age. 
--------
63-> THE TEN-CENT MAN.; HE WILL HAVE NO REASON TO BLESS THE TARIFF ON CIGARS.
Cigar dealers, especially those who have a pretty regular run of custom, have not yet advanced their prices to the scale which will obtain when the new tariff law is fully understood by them. Of course there has been some advance in the rates charged in stores depending on transient trade, but even in these places the limit has not been reached yet. All the dealers agree that prices will go up. 
--------
64-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The debate in the Reichstag on the mining strikes shows the difficulties which a benevolently paternal young Emperor is likely to encounter in his self-imposed task of making everybody happy. One speaker opposed the reduction of the hours of labor in mines upon the ground that miners were no worse off than other workmen. 
--------
65-> RAUM DECLINES TO ANSWER.; HE REFUSES TO GIVE THE INFORMATION MR. COOPER DEMANDS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. -- Gen. Raum stated, when the Raum investigation committee began its session this morning, that he had made diligent search for the McGilley affidavit, but had been unable to find it. 
--------
66-> PREPARING FOR THE NEW LAW.
Controller MYERS does well to remind the Police Board of the desirability of an early beginning in the preparations for putting the new Ballot act into effect in this city. It is very desirable that everything shall be done this year in due time and order to secure a smooth and successful working of the law, so that the preparations may be a model to be followed hereafter. 
--------
67-> Article 10 -- No Title
THE EXTINCTION OF THE BUFFALO. -- At one station we see four little snow-covered flower beds close to the track, bordered with buffalo horns, and I count the horns. Fifty to a bed -- two hundred in all; the relics of a herd of bison. There is not one buffalo now upon the Buffalo Plains; all have been murdered for their hides.

68-> HALF A MILLION OF DEBTS.; FAILURE OF THE SMITH PURIFIER WORKS OF JACKSON, MICH.
DETROIT, Jan. 14.--George T. Smith's Middlings Purifier Works at Jackson were placed in the hands of R.H. Emerson and Z.C. Eldred as assignees to-day, with liabilities reported at $500,000. The failure creates an immense sensation, as the company owned valuable patents connected with the flouring business, and had the world for their market. Their plant covers seventeen acres of ground, and was fitted up with the best machinery. 
--------
69-> MR. GODDARD'S POSITION.
CHICAGO, Oct. 1. -- It was given out officially to-day that J.F. Goddard is to be Commissioner of the Trunk Line Association in the place so long held by Albert Fink. 
--------
70-> Article 18 -- No Title
THE RANGE FINDER. -- This invention was made by Lieut. Bradley A. Fiske of the navy, an officer who has already achieved reputation for his ingenious adaptations of the electric motor to the working of gun carriages and to the hoisting of shot and shell. The apparatus is by no means complicated, and involves nothing but simple elementary principles in mathematics and electricity. 
--------
71-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
There is a blue look to the market. It is useless to disguise the fact that a feeling of discouragement begins to be felt in the street. Except in Sugar stock there is nothing that is active which does not go down. The bank statement yesterday contributed to the feeling of depression. It showed a further loss in the surplus reserve, and it is now down to $7,600,000. 
--------
72-> Article 10 -- No Title
PITTSBURG, Dec. 18. -- The present snowstorm that has been raging in this city for forty-eight hours is the most disastrous that this city has ever experienced.

--------
73-> BILL TO OPPRESS FARMERS; SENATOR CARLISLE ANALYZES THE WAREHOUSE SCHEME. IT WOULD ROB ITS ALLEGED BENEFICIARY, BE UNJUST TO ALL, AND GIVE UNDUE POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT.
WASHINGTON, May 31. -- To B.F. Howard of Tuskegee, Ala., Senator Carlisle has written a letter in response to Mr. Howard's request for the Senator's views upon the agricultural sub-Treasury proposition, as contained in bills before Congress, to provide for a system of warehouses for farm produce throughout the country, to be operated by the Government, which is to issue its notes upon products stored therein. 
--------
74-> THREE GOOD RUTGERS MEN.; THEY ARE TRAINING TO MEET DOHM AND WELLS.
NEW-BRUNSWICK, N.J., Feb. 15. -- The athletic prospects at Rutgers are brighter than they have been for several years. In general athletics everything is in preparation for the Spring field-day sports, which will be held early in May on the college athletic grounds. These grounds are to be improved before the season opens, and a new grand stand, which has been much needed, is to be erected. 
--------
75-> BROKER SISTARE ARRESTED.; HE IS IN LUDLOW STREET JAIL IN DEFAULT OF $75,000 BOND.
W.H.M. Sistare, the head of the firm of G.K. Sistare's Sons, brokers at 16 Broad Street, which failed recently, is in Ludlow Street Jail. He was arrested Monday afternoon at his residence, 30 East Sixtieth Street, by Deputy Sheriff Ferguson, at the instance of Richard Hecksher of Philadelphia, who sues the firm recover $112,000. 
--------

The French ultimatum to Dahomey -- the cession of Kotonou and Whydah -- is a natural outcome of this year's operations in that region. Whydah is the town on the coast which Commander FOURNIER bombarded toward the end of last April in consequence of the King's seizure there of half a dozen Frenchmen, who had not taken the warning to escape.

152-> THE ARGENTINE CRISIS.
The current dispatches perhaps give an adequate explanation of the crisis in the Argentine Republic. Certainly they supply abundant reasons for revolution, since they make it quite clear that no change in the Government could be for the worse. A nation in which the premium on gold fluctuates from 190 to 209 within twenty-four hours in time of peace is in a very bad way.

It seems to be practically admitted that JOHN J. O'BRIEN'S position as Chief of the Bureau of Elections was a sinecure, and that his principal loss in being deprived of it is the salary of $4,000 a year, which gave him a living income while his time was devoted to political management in the Eighth District and the occasional jobbery that comes in the way of a party "leader."

The unusual southerly movement of ice in the ocean has been the cause of special inquiry among merchants and masters of vessels engaged in transatlantic trading, and considerable anxiety is being manifested in relation to the possibilities that may have caused the detention of vessels which, during the past six weeks, have been from three days to a week overdue.

Belgium begins to-day her prolonged festival on honor of the twenty-fifth anniversary of King LEOPOLD'S ascension to the throne and the sixtieth of her independence.

SWATHMORE, Penn., Feb. 15. -- At this time of the year all outdoor sports at Swathmore are, in a measure, being neglected.

The bedding and mattress factory of George Heyman, at 103 and 105 Mott Street, was wrecked by fire yesterday morning, involving a loss on the building and contents of $60,000.

NEW-HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 5. -- The first definite results of the experiments by local scientists with Prof. Koch's lymph were observed to-day.

Vermont's hopes are now evidently centred not so much on making a gain of a few hundreds over her census population of 1880, as on escaping an actual loss.

HARRISVILLE, N.Y., March 1. -- The oldest woodmen on this side of the Adirondacks cannot bring to mind a Winter anything like the present, and some of them have lived here off and on for forty years.

Some of the Republican stump speakers in the West are already urging the people not to study "the details" of the new tariff law. "It is not at all necessary, as ex-Gov.

There is something very plausible in the story that comes from Albany to the effect that while Tammany Hall politicians are professing to be in sympathy with public opinion against the Cable Railroad bill they are secretly trying to induce the Governor to sign it.

PATERSON, N.J., June 2. -- There has been a reduction of from 10 to 20 per cent. in the wages of silk ribbon weavers at Paterson during the past week.

Several more or less important suits brought against the elevated road by various persons for damages for injury to property and to person were decide yesterday by the Court of Appeals.

SARATOGA, Aug. 6. -- Nothing could have been more refreshing than the strong, cool breeze which sprang up yesterday toward noon and prevailed the rest of the day. About 5 o'clock it had driven some storm clouds above the town, which released their burden of moisture in a sudden, sharp shower, which sent the gay carriage folks abroad for a drive scurrying to cover.

The Silver bill became a law last Monday. Because the stock market remained dull some people seem to have an idea that as a bull influence silver legislation is a delusion.

No volume in this interesting and valuable series has had for its subject a more moving story than this of the mighty corsairs who reigned and roamed over the Mediterranean waters for many centuries, terrors alike to good men and bad. The theme, moreover, is one which English writers have strangely neglected.

So soon are men forgotten when dead that it seems proper here to recall the fact that the subject of this memoir was for fifteen years repeatedly in the public eye, here as well as in Great Britain, as an English clergyman under repeated prosecution for ritualistic practices. Mr. Mackonochie had become engaged in such an inevitably losing contest that the result was to be foreseen long before it came.

By an act of Congress, this hand has an official connection with the World's Fair. By an act of James G. Blaine this hand would fain have a much closer and more personal connection with the World's Fair.

There is a fair prospect that the result of the last election will destroy the arrogant control which THOMAS C. PLATT has exercised for some years over the Republican Party in this State.

A stranger visiting Washington and walking the streets a few minutes before 9 o'clock in the morning would be surprised at the crowds of people he would see, but if, by chance, he should be on those same streets at a few minutes after 9, he would find them practically deserted.

NEW-HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 3. -- The Democratic State Central Committee has decided upon a short and sharp campaign in preference to one covering several weeks, and the mass meetings of the Democrats will not begin until about Oct. 20. This will give the party about two weeks during which speakers of national reputation will be heard.

214-> THE PRESIDENT'S GRAVE MISTAKE.; HIS APPROVAL OF THE DEPENDENT PENSION BILL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
President Harrison has approved the Dependent Pension bill. His act is not a surprise, but it is to be regretted. The Republican Party is now formally committed to an ultra-radical theory of pension giving. The bill puts 250,000 names on the rolls, and increases the pensions of 50,000 persons already enrolled. Estimates of its annual cost vary from $35,000,000 to $100,000,000.

There was happiness after all in Wall-street at the close of the year. The money squeeze of Monday, with its attendant depression of stock quotations, had altogether disappeared yesterday. Instead of 40 percent., loan rates were down to 6 percent. Stocks which declined sharply on the day before were yesterday not only firm, but buoyant.

NEW-BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 6. -- There are prospects of litigation over the last tax assessment in this city, about which there has already been considerable grumbling. This year a provision of the revised city charter went into effect under which the work of assessing real estate in the city was taken from the Assessors and placed in the hands of a Board of Commissioners of Valuation. 
--------
225-> WRONG IN SIBERIA, RIGHT IN IRELAND.
The Times is in a state of furious indignation at the Siberian massacre, which, it justly says, has roused the indignation of Europe, and it deems the attempt of the Czar to evade investigation an aggravation of the wrong-doing. In all this I agree. But why is it wrong for a gang of Russian officials to massacre people in Siberia and right for a gang of Irish officials to massacre people in Ireland? 
--------
226-> A REPUBLICAN TRAP.; INTO WHICH THE IOWA DEMOCRATS FAILED TO FALL.
DES MOINES, Iowa, Feb. 1. -- The third week of the House dead-lock ended to-day with a manifestation of the Republican desire to put the Democrats in the attitude of transacting some business besides the election of permanent Speaker, as agreed to in the stipulation by which the dead-lock on temporary organization was broken. 
--------
227-> WILEY OUGHT TO BE QUIET.; THE CONGRESSMAN WARBLES ALLITERATIVELY OF HARMONY AND HILL.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. -- A Washington paper this afternoon contains an interview of some length with Representative John M. Wiley of New-York, in which he is allowed to say a good deal about the chances of Representative-elect Daniel M. Lockwood for the Speakership and something more about two candidates from the State of New-York for the Presidency. 
--------
228-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
Public political debates, in which Democrats, Republicans. Prohibitionists, Nationalists, and Labor men will take part, will be held every night this week at Botanic Hall, 68 East Broadway. The first meeting will take place this evening at 8 o'clock. Among the speakers expected are Messrs. Wardwell, Bogardus, Lee, Manierre, Laird, Hart, and De Leon. 
--------
229-> PROBABLY A SUICIDE.; AN INSOLVENT DEBTOR FOUND DEAD IN HIS HOTEL.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Aug. 31. -- Joseph J. Brittain, Jr., of Butler, Penn., was found dead in his room at the Hotel Boyer this morning. He was greatly depressed before retiring last night, and this, together with the fact that an empty morphine bottle, and a letter addressed to his brother, were found in the room, have caused it to be generally believed that he committed suicide.

TOULON, France, Feb. 16. -- The officers and men of the American squadron of evolution have learned with deep regret of the terrible calamity which has befallen Secretary Tracy, and profoundly sympathize with him in his bereavement. The Admiral received a cablegram announcing the sad facts soon after the arrival of the cruisers, but they were not generally known throughout the squadron until yesterday, when the French newspapers published the reports. 
--------
231-> THE BALLOT-BOX FORGERY; GETTING AT THE FACTS IN THE CASE. EX-GOV. FORAKER TELLS THE HOUSE COMMITTEE HOW HE MET WOOD AND SECURED THE FORGED PAPER.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16. -- The special House committee appointed to investigate the Ohio ballot-box forgery began its work this morning with all the members present except Representative Struble, who is suffering from the grip. 
--------
232-> DOING OF THE NAVY.
The officials of the N.F. Palmer, Jr., Iron Works think that the new cruiser Concord can be launched in the course of two weeks. It was the intention of the contractors to slip the cruiser off the ways on the 20th inst., but this was prevented through delay at the Roach Works. The Bennington is to be launched within a month after the Concord. Such, at least, is the present programme. 
--------
233-> GRANT'S RESTING PLACE; THE PROPOSITION TO REMOVE THE BODY DISCUSSED. IN ANY EVENT THE MONUMENT ASSOCIATION WILL ERECT A TOMB ARCHITECTS TO SUBMIT DESIGNS.
Whether Gen. Grant's remains are allowed to rest where they now are, in the Riverside Park tomb, or will be removed to the National Cemetery at Washington, in accordance with the resolution which was adopted by the Senate, and which is now before the House, is something that the Grant Monument Association is evidently not going to worry itself into hysterics over just at present. 
--------
234-> WHAT A BOYCOTT MAY DO.; THROW THOUSANDS OUT OF WORK AND CAUSE A LOSS OF MILLIONS.
The threatened boycott of the New-York market by the Brick Manufacturers' Association of New-York and New-Jersey causes considerable excitement among business men connected with the various branches of the building trades. They all earnestly hope that matters may not come to such a pass as this, as it may throw about 150,000 men out of employment in New-York and vicinity and put a stop to the circulation of millions of dollars. 
--------
235-> THEY GAVE HIM GODSPEED; A BRILLIANT RECEPTION TO ARCHBISHOP CORRIGAN. AN ADDRESS BY FREDERIC R. COUDERT AND A RESPONSE BY THE PRELATE -- TO SAIL FOR ROME TO-MORROW.
Archbishop Corrigan, who sails for Europe on the French steamer La Bourgogne to-morrow, was tendered a reception last evening at the Lenox Lyceum, Fifty-ninth-street and Madison-avenue, by his parishioners and friends generally without regard to creed. There were present many officials of the City Government, representatives of the judiciary, all the pastors of the Archdiocese of New-York, scores of prominent citizens and great numbers of handsomely dressed ladies. 
--------
236-> SHEEPSHEAD BAY RACES; TENNY'S OWNER WANTS ANOTHER RACE WITH SALVATOR. BLUE ROCK, ADELINA, GOLDEN REEL, PELHAM, ECLIPSE, AND CAST STEEL WON YESTERDAY'S RACES.
It is usually the case that there is an off day for racegoers on the day following the decision of any great event like the Suburban. But yesterday proved the exception to the rule. The attendance was unexpectedly large, and the racing remarkably good, some six thousand people enjoying it. Of course there was more or less talk about the Suburban and about the horses who were placed in that great event. 
--------
237-> IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; IN HONOR OF FRANKLIN. THE TYPOTHELE LISTEN TO STORIES ABOUT THE PRINTER-STATESMAN.
The portrait of Benjamin Franklin, which was painted when that good old patriot was Minister to France, hung in the big ballroom of the Hotel Brunswick last night, with its ancient frame encircled with smilax. Below it sat President W.C. Martin, whose years have not yet deprived him of the pleasure of celebrating Franklin's birthday with his fellow Typothetae. 
--------
238-> SPORTS ON LAND AND WATER; ANNUAL GAMES OF THE STATEN ISLAND ATHLETIC CLUB. INTERESTING CONTESTS IN WHICH ATHLETES OF PROMINENCE TAKE PART -- VIEWED BY MANY THOUSANDS.
The popularity of amateur sports was tested on Staten Island yesterday and found to be greater than ever before. The Staten Island Athletic Club held its fourth annual Labor Day games on its well-equipped grounds at Livingston, S.I. Fully 6,000 people wore present. Some estimates of the crowd put it at considerably more than his figure.

IF ARTIFICIAL DIAMONDS WHERE TO BE MADE. -- The question is a curious one, for it involves a good deal of human nature. Is the value of a precious stone wholly dependent upon its rarity and the consequent proof it affords that its owner is possessed of wealth, or, at all events, of wealth which he can afford to waste? 
--------
240-> THE END OF A CROOKED LIFE.; A WELL-KNOWN CONFIDENCE WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN HER ROOM.
Mrs. E.G. Hudson, a "confidence" woman who had many pseudonyms, was found dead yesterday in her furnished room at 132 East Eighteenth Street. She seemed to have fallen over a chair while preparing a glass of lemonade; but as there was a quantity of laudanum in the room and a bottle of the drug that had recently been emptied, it will require an autopsy to determine the cause of death. 
--------
241-> DINNERS AT THE CAPITAL,; AT WHICH THE PRESIDENT WAS AND WILL BE A GUEST.
WASHINGTON, April 15. -- President Harrison will be the guest of honor at the dinner to be given to-morrow by the Latin American delegates to the Pan-American Congress. The floral decorations will cost $700. The table, which will be set in the dining room of the Arlington, will be in the shape of a deeply indented star of eight points, at each of which a guest of special honor will be seated. 
--------
242-> NOTES OF VARIOUS INTERESTS.
The Chicago Journal says that it has been practically settled that the Wabash Railroad Company will extend its line from Butler, Mich., to a connection with the Western Indiana, thereby rendering it independent of the Chicago and Erie for an entrance to Chicago, and that the Canadian Pacific will be given a Chicago line by the same route. 
--------
243-> WHERE NAPOLEON III. DIED.
An ineffectual attempt was made in London on Friday afternoon, June 27, to sell by public auction the freehold estate, 124 acres in extent, upon which stands Camden Place, the country house in which Charles Louis Bonaparte, Emperor of the French under the title of Napoleon III., breathed his last on Jan. 9, 1873. For a good many years after the illustrious exile's death this house was inhabited by his widow, the ex-Empress Eugenie. 
--------
244-> THE CRY HAS SUBSIDED."
Our high-tariff contemporaries continue to tell their readers that "there is no more talk of rising prices on account of the McKinley act." These are the words of the Philadelphia Press. "The free-trade howl about higher prices has ceased," says the Cleveland Leader. "The cry of higher prices has subsided since election, showing that it was raised with little warrant and for political purposes only." 
--------
245-> THE NEW APPRAISER'S STORES.; THE SITE WHICH HAS BEEN PRACTICALLY SETTLED UPON.
Secretary Windom's arrival in New-York yesterday was made the basis for a rumor that he had come from Washington to settle definitely the question of location of the Appraiser's Stores. This was a mistake. The Secretary said yesterday that he had only come to attend the Chamber of Commerce banquet. As to the Appraiser's Stores matter he could only say that it was approaching a stage when there might be something to say about it. 
--------
246-> CHANGES IN AUTUMN SKIES; SOME BRILLIANT SPECTACLES FOR STAR GAZERS. THE SUN'S SOUTHERLY JOURNEY AND THE SHORTENING DAYS -- CONJUNCTIONS DURING OCTOBER.
The sun is now hastening southward at highest speed through the sign of the Scorpion, as though anxious to get rid of so unpleasant a companion, a fact only too apparent as gradually-decreasing daylight and an increasing chilliness of the atmosphere tell us that we have the colder half of the year to pass through before we can again welcome him north of the equator. 
--------
247-> HE BELIEVES IN SHAKESPEARE.; MR. POPE DERIDES IGNATIUS DONNELLY AND HIS THEORY.
The members of the Goethe Society and their friends filled the ballroom of the Hotel Brunswick last evening. It was the first meeting of the society this season. President A.M. Palmer said in his address of greeting that it would be the endeavor of the Executive Committee to make the programme during the coming Winter in every way as interesting as that of last year. 
--------
248-> THEY ARE GLAD TO BE HOME; THE RECORD OUR TEAMS MADE ON THEIR WESTERN TRIP. NOT ONE TO BE PROUD OF -- ANSON'S MEN AND THE BUFFALOS TO PLAY HERE TO-DAY -- BASEBALL NEWS.
The Eastern teams, those of the National and Players' Leagues, have completed their first trip West, and to-day the Western clubs will begin their second series of games in the East. There is going to be some lively work during the next two weeks, and it will in a measure show what teams will have the best show for the pennants. The race in both leagues is interesting.

The final result of the caucus of the Democrats of the Kentucky Legislature is what was to be expected from the start, the nomination of Mr. CARLISLE for the United States Senatorship. The Democratic nomination, which was finally made unanimous last night, is of course equivalent to an election.

CITY OF MEXICO, March 2. -- Large numbers of American tourists are here. One trainload of Illinois editors are sleeping in their Pullmans, owing to the scarcity of hotel accommodations.

" ALL ENDS IN MIRE." -- Rousseau was a compound of "mysticism and sensuality"; no law was sacred to him but the gratification of instinct. He grafted every virtue upon a vice. He treated adultery as one of the fine arts, and abounded in theatrical sentiment while forwarding his children to the Foundling Hospital, duly as they arrived.

253-> ERASMUS.; ERASME, Par EMILE AMIEL. Paris; ALPHONSE LEMERRE.1889.ERASMUS. By R.C. JEBB, Litt. D. Cambridge, England: UNIVERSITY PRESS. 1890.
Montaigne was grateful that he lived in a century which was "not soft, languishing, or unoccupied." Erasmus was a prince in it, loved, envied, hated, condemed, with all the activity of that extraordinary epoch. A calm judgment of him then was not to be expected. There were no critics; there were only friends or enemies. M. Feugere counted in 1874 thirty-nine works before his own devoted to Erasmus. 
--------
254-> ON THE ASIATIC STATION; OUR SQUADRON IN JAPANESE AND CHINESE WATERS. MOVEMENTS OF ADMIRAL BELKNAP'S VESSELS -- COMMANDER M'GOWAN'S ILLNESS -- SOME POLITICAL MATTERS.
ASIATIC STATION, NAGASAKI, Japan, Jan. 29. -- The Chinese New Year passed without reports of any disturbance from any quarter. It was at Chinese New Year last year that Chin-Kiang, or the foreign part of it, was burned. Foreigners at Che-Foo sent telegrams to the American and English Admirals informing them of expected troubles there and elsewhere.

255-> THE DOMINION PARLIAMENT.; SPEECH OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN PROROGUING THE HOUSE.
OTTAWA, Ont., May 16. -- The Dominion Parliament was prorogued this afternoon. The Governor General, in his address, said:

FRANKFORT, Ky., May 16. -- When the Democratic caucus met to-night there was evidence of suppressed excitement. The candidates as well as their friends knew that the Senatorial fight was nearly over. All day long there had been desperate scheming and wire pulling on all sides, and some strong efforts were made for combination, but they were unavailing. 
--------
258-> JOHN DEAN BENTON DEAD.; THE MAN WHO REPRODUCED IN MINIATURE ERICSSON'S MONITOR.
PROVIDENCE, R.I., Oct. 18. -- John Dean Benton, known all over the country as a maker of gold and silver models of machinery, gunboats, , died in East Providence this morning aged sixty-six years. He was born in Fort Independence, Boston Harbor, and learned the trade of a jeweler before the war. He contracted rheumatism in the hands during the war and was discharged for disabilities. 
--------
259-> FRENCH FISHING RIGHTS.
PARIS, May 16. -- M. Bozerian opened debate in the Senate to-day with an interpellation on the Newfoundland fisheries question. He asserted that the rights of the French fishermen were really not disputed. It was simply a question as to the scope of those rights. The French were permitted to take fish, but not lobsters, under the ridiculous pretext that lobsters are not fish. 
--------
260-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
Pending the settlement of the canteen question by the Senate and the House, Secretary PROCTOR has taken some steps on the subject. The present regulations of the army exclude ardent spirits from the canteens, but allow the sale of beer and light wines. The House approved this system, but the Senate voted to prohibit even the beer and the wine. 
--------
261-> MONACO'S NEW PRINCE.; FORMAL ENTRANCE INTO HIS STATE -- SATIRE ON HIS POSITION.
Those who have the misfortune to suffer from low spirits, says the Paris correspondent of the London Times, "to effect a cure should read the detailed account published in the French papers of the entrance into the State of Monaco of the new sovereigns of that principality. Nothing could have been more enthusiastic or solemn. The railway station was bright with the colors of the Grimaldis; the Casino was covered with oriflammes. 
--------
262-> TESTIMONIAL TO FRANCE.; WHAT CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW SAYS ON THE SUBJECT.
DETROIT, Feb. 17. -- The following letter has been received from Chauncey M. Depew by W.H. Brearley of this city: 
--------
263-> CHICAGO PRODUCE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Feb. 17. -- Provisions were more active to-day, but the trading was almost entirely between the local professionals. The leading features were the large and steady buying of Pork by Hutchinson and the selling of Lard and Ribs by packers. Underwood sold over 1,000,000 lb. of May Ribs, it was claimed, and Hately sold Lard freely, supposed by some to be for account of Armour. 
--------
264-> GUNS, SHIPS, AND POWDER.
Military men believe there is no doubt that this year will see the beginning of the era of smokeless powder. Should peace prevail in Europe the Spring and Autumn manoeuvres will furnish much valuable experience with the new explosives, but it is very likely that the number of foreign spectators at the operations will be greatly reduced. 
--------
265-> MEN'S WEAR.; OLD-FASHIONED INVISIBLE GREEN REASSERTING ITSELF IN SUITS.
Very few blue flannel suits are seen on well-to-do men during the Summer now; for the likelihood of being taken, perchance, for a brakeman or ticket chopper is not altogether to their relish. The owner of a fine blue flannel suit will generally wear it nowadays in sections, putting on the coat with a different pair of trousers and the blue flannel trousers with a coat of another shade.

ALBANY, Feb. 17. -- Senator Saxton received this evening a roll of paper six feet in length, signed by 300 of his constituents, which he handed up for consideration. Its reading produced an outburst of merriment. Here it is: 
--------
268-> THE CATHOLIC CENTRE SHIFTING.
The politicians of the Vatican have not yet recovered from the shock their views of what is proper received last June when the statue of GIORDANO BRUNO was unveiled with an outburst of popular enthusiasm that must have surprised the Liberals of Italy themselves. It was a cruel blow to the pride of the leaders of the Church for other than local reasons. 
--------
269-> LIVE MUSICAL TOPICS.
That distinguished representative of unmusical England, Mr. Joseph Bennett, in his "Letters from Bayreuth" complains a goes deal about the dramatic power of "Die Gotterdammerung." He says: "Had the master employed ever so freely the splendid resources that lay ready to his hand, it is doubtful whether the dramatic power of 'Gotterdammerung' would not have put the music in a secondary place."

Before a bower of palms, roses, and peonies Miss Sara Elkins, daughter of Stephen B. Elkins, was married last evening to Mr. Alexander C. Oliphant of Trenton, N.J., son of Gen.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. -- The President to-day sent to the Senate the following nominations: 
--------
272-> NATIONAL GUARD GOSSIP.
The detective camera is likely to play an important part in National Guard instruction hereafter, in the event of the undertaking set in motion by Major Heywood C. Broun, Inspector of Rifle Practice Twenty-third Regiment, proving the success it promises. Photography is proposed to be employed by Major Broun in perfecting the officers and non-commissioned officers first, and subsequently the rank and file of "Ours" in rifle practice. 
--------
273-> SHE HAD PRACTICED.; A BILLIARD ENTHUSIAST UNDERTAKES TO TEACH HIS WIFE THE GAME.
A well-to-do gentleman who lives in Madison-avenue became greatly interested in the game of billiards some time ago and had a fine table put up in his house. He and his friends found much enjoyment in a series of games that continued evening after evening, and any interference with their pleasure was a great disappointment. 
--------
274-> Editorial Article 7 -- No Title
The explosions of the English press over the cession of Heligoland to Germany seem slightly comic, they are so disproportionate to the subject. CHARLES II.'s sale of Dunkirk could scarcely have excited deeper emotions, or, at least, more violent language. According to one journalist, Lord SALISBURY "has fixed upon the brow of the Imperial-Unionist Party an indelible brand of ignominy." 
--------
275-> POLITICAL NOTES.
The Minneapolis Journal answers squarely to the assertion made during the Maine campaign by Reed, McKinley, and Lodge that the Tariff bill was put through the House in answer to a popular demand for its passage. It says: "It was whipped through by Speaker Reed and Congressman McKinley, no opportunity for any serious discussion being given and most of the amendments being entirely rejected.

276-> WHEN GOD IS MOST OFFENDED.; NUNS WHO PUNISH THEMSELVES ON DAYS OF PUBLIC REJOICING.

Boetterling, Pertz  Co., manufacturers of silk ribbons at 410 and 412 East Sixty-eight Street, have failed, and the members of the firm, William Boetterling, Hugo Pertz, and Miss Elizabeth Gaskell, yesterday made an assignment to Carl M. Vom Baur, giving preferences for $11,000, the largest being to Franz Merz for $5,000, Paul Boetterling for $3,800, and William Teschermacher for $1,800.

280-> MRS. FLACK AS A WITNESS; SHE TELLS HER STORY OF THE DIVORCE CONSPIRACY. ALTHOUGH A NERVOUS WITNESS, HER EVIDENCE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EMPHATIC -- SHE TRUSTED HER SON AND IS CONFUSED AS TO THE PAPERS SHE SIGNED.
Sheriff Flack's wife was a witness in the Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday afternoon and gave testimony against her husband, her son, and Lawyer Joseph Meeks, all of whom are on trial for conspiring to procure a divorce decree and making Mrs. Flack the innocent victim. The District Attorney expected that the wronged wife would tell a plain, straightforward story, and he was not disappointed. 
--------
281-> THE OREGON REPUBLICANS; STATE TICKET NOMINATED BY THE CONVENTION YESTERDAY.
PORTLAND, Oregon, April 16. -- The Oregon Republican in convention to-day renominated Binger Hermann for Congress and made the following State ticket: For Governor -- D.P. Thompson; Secretary of State -- George W. McBride; Treasurer -- Phil Melchan; Superintendent of Public Instruction -- E.B. McElroy; Supreme Judge -- R.S. Bean; State Printer -- Frank C. Baker.

282-> HE HAS TO BE SATISFIED.; SENATOR MITCHELL OF OREGON ACCEPTS THE TARIFF LAW.
Senator John H. Mitchell of Oregon is going home for the first time in thirteen months. He left Oregon in September, 1889, and, owing to the long session of Congress, has not been able to cross the continent since. 
--------
283-> HERESY TO REPUBLICAN EARS.; GEORGE A. BUTLER OF NEW-HAVEN FORCED OUT OF A PARTY LEAGUE.
NEW-HAVEN, Oct. 18. -- George A. Butler, President of the Tradesmen's Bank, a day or two ago sent in his resignation as a member of the Republican League, a social club composed of many of the leading citizens of New-Haven, all of them Republicans. 
--------
284-> AN AWFUL DAY AT ASHLEY; NINETEEN BODIES RECOVERED FROM THE MINE. AT LEAST TWENTY-FIVE LIVES LOST THROUGH NEGLIGENCE -- THE SUPERINTENDENT'S STATEMENT.
WILKESBARRE, Penn., May 16. -- The work of attempting to rescue the imprisoned miners at Ashley was interrupted by a heavy rush of gas at 3 o'clock this morning. At 7 o'clock it was deemed partially safe to resume the efforts to rescue the men. A large party of rescuers entered the slope and commenced work upon the cave, beyond where three men were found last night. 
--------
285-> ELEVEN THOUSAND PECAN TREES.
Mr. F.A. Swinden of Brownwood is in the city. Mr. Swinden enjoys the distinction of owning the only pecan orchard of any size in the world. He is an enthusiast on the subject of pecan culture, and talks entertainingly on the subject. "Yes," said he, in response to an interrogatory, "I have a pecan orchard of 11,000 trees, covering 400 acres, within two miles of the town of Brownwood. 
--------
286-> TOM PLATT'S HELP NEEDED; DAGGETT'S POSTAL CARD CONTRACT IN DANGER. TOO MANY COMPLAINTS AND TOO MANY EXCUSES -- AN OFFICE FOR A BROOKLYN WARD POLITICIAN.
WASHINGTON, March 17. -- The President to-day sent the following nominations to the Senate: 
--------
287-> GROWING SISAL HEMP.; SIR AMBROSE SHEA TALKS ABOUT A BAHAMA INDUSTRY.
An ardent admirer of the United States is Sir Ambrose Shea, Governor of the Bahamas, who has passed the last few days in this city. Sir Ambrose is a typical Englishman -- tall, well proportioned, and wearing a look of health which amply supports his declaration that life in the Bahamas is very delightful. He is apparently about sixty years of age. 
--------
288-> DEPOSITORS MUST WAIT; THE BANK OF AMERICA OF PHILADELPHIA SUSPENDS. OFFICERS CANNOT SAY HOW MUCH THE ASSETS WILL RETURN -- THE M'FARLANE STORIES CAUSE THE CRASH.
PHILADELPHIA, April 30. -- The Bank of America of this city was forced to close its doors this afternoon and the officers posted a notice at the entrance in the hallway of the building at Fourth and Chestnut Streets, which simply announced, "This bank has temporarily suspended."

THE UNDERFED BRITISH SOLDIER. -- Recruits when they join the army first cannot be too well fed; because, coming as they do from a class which, as a rule, is irregular in its habits, after undergoing a regular system of drill and a regular manner of living, they are more hungry at meal times than they otherwise would be. 
--------
290-> Article 4 -- No Title
The Tammany leaders are furnishing what ought to be a strong argument against their organization in their manner of raising campaign funds and the use they are putting them to. Public employes in the various departments and members of the fire and police forces are directly assessed, while the brewers and saloon keepers are called upon as usual for their contributions. 
--------
291-> THE BLIZZARD IN THE SOUTH.; MUCH DAMAGE CAUSED BY SNOW AND FREEZING WEATHER.
NORFOLK, Va., March 2. -- The blizzard which has been raging in the South and West for the past few days struck this section of the country yesterday morning, beginning with a rain and a decided drop in the temperature, which has continued until this time with increasing energy. It has grown into about the first touch of really wintry weather we have had this season. 
--------
292-> LOSS OF LIFE BY DYNAMITE.
WARRENTON, Ga., April 30. -- Two men lost their lives by the explosion of a dynamite blast at the quarry of the Quincy Granite Company this afternoon. Several other workmen on the place were more or less injured. Andrew Latimer was torn to pieces, and a third laborer named Burch cannot survive. 
--------
293-> THE CROP OUTLOOK IN NEBRASKA.
In the matter of crops Nebraska has no cause to complain. With few exceptions our State has been favored with enough rain, the seed for the most part has proved good, and the Fall will witness a harvest as large as any State can boast. The corn is perhaps two weeks behind last year, but the Nebraska Autumn has always left weeks to spare. 
--------
294-> WEARY OF OFFICIAL LIFE.; REPORTED RESIGNATION OF UNITED STATES TREASURER HUSTON.
INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 17. -- Lively political gossip was circulated here this afternoon regarding the resignation of United States Treasurer Huston. It is believed, and on good authority in this city, that Mr. Huston's resignation has already been placed in the hands of the President. Mr. Huston has paid frequent visits to Connersville, and has now in progress elaborate improvements upon his home there. 
--------
295-> BOXING AND WRESTLING.; SOME GOOD SPORT AT THE OPERA HOUSE LAST NIGHT.
One of the most successful athletic entertainments given in this city was held at the Metropolitan Opera House last night, when the championships -- boxing and wrestling -- of the Amateur Athletic Union were decided. The crowd was fair and orderly and the sport was of a first-class character. 
--------
296-> HERBERT BISMARCK IN PARIS.
Count Herbert Bismarck, after spending five weeks with different friends in England, has arrived in Paris. Our correspondent there writes: "He has come chiefly in search of distractions,' which was also his object north of the Channel. Whether the search has been so far successful is more than doubtful, as he is looking a sad and depressed man, wearing the appearance of one from whom the tide has flowed. 
--------
297-> UNEASINESS IN THE SENATE.; MEMBERS ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR NEWS FROM COOPER UNION.
ALBANY, Feb. 17. -- Not since 1881 was so much uneasiness displayed in the Senate as there was to-night. Everybody was awaiting news from Cooper Union. It was the universal impression that the success of that meeting, the uprising of a number of prominent Republicans in protest against the Platt Senate amendments, would lead to a break among the Republican Senators. 
--------
298-> THE TARIFF AND THE NORTHWEST.
The appearance of Senator PADDOCK of Nebraska as a tariff reformer is, perhaps, more significant of the feeling of the Northwest upon the subject than that of any of the Northwestern Senators who have preceded him in remonstrating against the McKinley bill. According to the adage, it is straws that show which way the wind blows. 
--------
299-> MORE WAR SHIPS NEEDED; OTHER NAVAL FORCES STILL GREATLY SUPERIOR TO OURS. THE NAVY DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES THE SITUATION, AND CONGRESS IS TO BE URGED SPEEDILY TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS REQUIRED.
The chances for early naval legislation during the present session of Congress are as yet uncertain. This is due to the preponderance of election and financial measures. At the same time it is recognized that Congress, in order to be consistent with the announced policy of the majority to continue the enhancement of the naval establishment, cannot long delay action.

300-> MR. PLATT CAPITULATES; HE WILL NO LONGER OPPOSE THE WORLD'S FAIR. THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ASSERTED IN MASS MEETING. A REMARKABLE ASSEMBLAGE IN AND ABOUT COOPER UNION -- MR. DEPEW'S PLAN LEAVING THE COMMITTEE OF 103 INTACT FORMALLY APPROVED BY PLATT.
Thomas C. Platt has said "Me too" again, and, so far as anybody can now foresee, those two little words will give to New-York its coveted World's Fair in 1892. Mr. Platt has abandoned the lofty stand he has occupied for the past few weeks. He bows to the popular will and has made haste to withdraw his impertinent opposition to the World's Fair. 
--------
301-> SUED BY A PROMOTER.; A CLAIM AGAINST BREWER RUPPERT WHICH DOESN'T WORRY HIM.
The startling announcement was sent around to the newspapers yesterday that Henry Powers, a broker of this city, had, through his counsel, Col. John O'Byrne, brought an action against the well-known brewer Jacob Ruppert for $750,000, alleged to be due for services in negotiating for a sale of the Ruppert and Ehret breweries to a firm of English capitalists. 
--------
302-> OBITUARY.
Benjamin Vaughan Abbott, a legal writer of wide reputation, died yesterday at his home in Brooklyn after a lingering illness. Mr. Abbott inherited his literary tastes.

BUFFALO, N.Y., Sept. 1. -- When Division Superintendent Burrows was asked to-day if he would take back the striking switchmen, he said: "They will never work another day for the New-York Central Road while I am here. The new men are doing better work than they ever did. Get them to go away? Suppose they do.

304-> RETURNED TO HIS BRIDE.; THE TRAGIC ENDING OF A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE'S QUARREL.
PHOENIXVILLE, Penn., Sept. 1. -- Six months ago James Prim, a handsome youth of twenty, son of Joseph Prim of Warwick Township, this county, wooed and wedded the pretty daughter of a neighboring farmer, and within a fortnight afterward unaccountably left his bride and disappeared. Two weeks later his brother, John V. Prim, two years older, also disappeared. 
--------
305-> RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.; CHANGES WHICH HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON IN CONFERENCE.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. -- After a week's steady work, the conferrees on the River and Harbor bill have reached an agreement and signed their report. The changes made in the bill by the Senate were generally agreed to, but in numerous cases the appropriation was reduced. As agreed upon, the principal items in the bill where changes were made are as follows: 
--------
306-> MORE RECIPROCITY.
It is plain that reciprocity is in the air. It permeates the minds and speech of all who have to deal with fiscal legislation or to discuss it. Mr. BLAINE'S advocacy of it is a sign of the times. It is not an original idea with him, as we have long since pointed out, his own now pet plan for it having been brought forward before he thought of it by Senator EDMUNDS. 
--------
307-> CRUISERS FOR THE FISHERIES.
OTTAWA, Ontario, June 18. -- The fisheries protection service will be resumed this week, probably on Saturday. Four cruisers will go into commission. 
--------
308-> LEAGUED WITH THE SPECULATOR.; THE EXPERIENCE OF A MAN WHO WENT TO THE STANDARD THEATRE.
Prompted by your leading article in to-day's issue relative to managers of theatres and speculators, I beg to call your attention to my experience last Saturday night. 
--------
309-> THE OUTLOOK IN DEADWOOD.; PAST AND PRESENT OF A FAMOUS BLACK HILLS MINING CAMP.
" The Deadwood stage coach was celebrated before Col. Cody introduced it to the crowned heads of Europe," remarked Col. J.F. Potter of of Sturgis, S.D., who is at the Grand Pacific. "But its days are numbered. Deadwood will be a station on a railroad in a few weeks, and the famous stage coaches will have a place only in history and Wild West shows. 
--------
310-> THE SUBSTITUTE OFFERED; HOW IT IS PROPOSED TO MODIFY THE FORCE BILL. SEVERAL CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE WHICH CONSIDERED IT -- GENERAL WASHINGTON NEWS.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 -- The Senate Committee on Privileges and Election to-day held a meeting, at which the substitute prepared by the Republican members for what is known as the Lodge Elections bill was submitted to the full committee. It was decided by a party vote to report the bill to the Senate, and this was done late in the afternoon by Chairman Hoar. 
--------
311-> OUR GUNS AND FORTS.
The controversy over the Watervliet Arsenal items of the Fortifications bill has been long and obstinate. The bill as it passed the House provided for building a new wing at the Government factory in West Troy and fitting it up with machinery for the finishing of heavy guns. The Senate cut down the appropriation for machinery and tools and struck out altogether the provision for adding a wing to the building. 
--------
312-> THE POLITICS OF SILVER.
On Tuesday Mr. WOLCOTT, a talented and ambitious young gentleman who represents the not over-large State of Colorado in the Senate of the United States, made a very "eloquent" speech in favor of free coinage. His arguments were not of the most profound character, and we do not think that those that related to the financial phase of the subject carried much weight. 
--------
313-> MR. BAIRD'S MISSION TO GLOUCESTER.
OTTAWA, Oct. 18. -- Great interest is being taken here in the visit to Gloucester, Mass., by the Hen. Robert Baird, M.P., of the Newfoundland Government, who is urging Gloucester fishermen to petition Congress to admit Newfoundland fish and products free into the United States in return for free access to the bait, ice, and outfitting privileges of the American coast to American fishermen. 
--------
314-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
As the Senate has now agreed to the House bill for founding a national military park on the battlefield of Chickamauga, making only some small amendments which can easily be adjusted, it will be possible to begin the work on the twenty-seventh anniversary of the great contest during the coming Autumn. This selection will tend to give to Chickamauga among the Western battles a pre-eminence like that of Gettysburg among the Eastern. 
--------
315-> POLYGAMY STILL FLOURISHING.; THE UTAH COMMISSION CALLS FOR MORE STRINGENT LAWS.
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Sept. 17. -- The Utah Commission has forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior a long report of its operations and proceedings for the year ending Sept. 1, 1890. The principal feature of the report is the recommendation of further legislation in support of the existing laws. After reviewing the elections held in Utah since their last report the Commissioners say: 
--------
316-> THE JOINT TARIFF DEBATE.; THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED AT THE LEWIS COUNTY FAIR.
LOWVILLE, N.Y., Sept. 17. -- Ex-Congressman Roswell G. Horr of Michigan and ex-Collector of Internal Revenue William A. Beach of Syracuse debated the tariff question at the Lewis County Fair here this afternoon. The attendance was not large owing to the weather and the fact that recent floods destroyed nearly all the highway bridges in four towns adjoining. 
--------
317-> JAMESON'S DIARY AND LETTERS.; A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONTROVERSY -- A GOOD WORD FOR STANLEY.
LONDON, Nov. 18. -- Mr. Quilter, editor of the Universal Review, has an article in that publication on the Stanley controversy which has attracted much attention.

PEEKSKILL, July 20. -- The Rev. Dr. Talmage's functions as Chaplain of the Thirteenth were ably and satisfactorily filled to-day by the Rev. James Smith, pastor of the Presbyterian church in Peekskill, who preached in the Young Men's Christian Association tent at 4 o'clock to a small congregation, mainly made up of members of the regiment. 
--------
319-> A PROTEST FROM THE VETERANS.; QUAY MUST RECOGNIZE THEM OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
PITTSBURG, Penn., July 20. -- The Mystic Picket Guard, a secret society of veteran soldiers organized for political purposes, held a meeting last night to formulate a notice to Senator Quay and Congressman Dalzell that they are entitled to some recognition from the present Administration. It is charged by members of this organization, which represents 2,800 votes in this county, that the old soldiers have been treated unfairly by Mr. Quay and Mr. Dalzell. 
--------
320-> CHURCH CIRCLES EXCITED.; A RECTOR SAYS THAT MINISTERS HAVE POWER TO FORGIVE SINS.
BRIDGEPORT, April 16. -- The course of the Rev. Louis N. Booth, rector of Trinity Church, this city, has attracted considerable attention of late. It has been known for some time that Mr. Booth's interpretation of the Scriptures differed somewhat from that of the other Episcopal clergymen of this city. He is a pronounced High Churchman, and has taught the children in the Sunday school to call him Father Louis. 
--------
321-> BISMARCK WILL BE THERE; THE CHANCELLOR GOING TO BERLIN. IN SPITE OF HIS PHYSICIANS HE IS DETERMINED TO URGE THE PASSAGE OF THE SOCIALIST BILL IN PERSON.
BERLIN, Jan. 18. -- In the Reichstag the budget has passed the second reading. The proposition made on behalf of the Centre Party by Huene to exempt from military service all theological students was rejected by 121 to 89, but the propositions of Von Kleist and Vardorff for mitigating the terms of service of such students were accepted.

322-> THE NEW CABINET NAMED; CONFIDENCE REVIVING IN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. PRESIDENT PELLEGRINI HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE LEADING CITIZENS -- HOW CELMAN RESIGNED.
BUENOS AYRES, Aug. 7. -- The following Cabinet is announced: 
--------
323-> PLEA FOR THE FORCE BILL; A SPEECH BY MR. HOAR WHICH DID LITTLE GOOD. WORDS, BOTH BY HIM AND MR. FRYE, WHICH WILL DO LITTLE TO FORWARD MR. HARRISON'S PET SCHEME.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20. -- As the leader of the Force bill advocates in the Senate, in the opening battle with the supporters of the Quay scheme for postponing action upon the Force bill, Mr. Hoar to-day proved to be a very disappointing person. 
--------
324-> Article 8 -- No Title
SUSQUEHANNA, Penn., Aug. 20. -- A heavy windstorm unroofed houses and barns and filled the road with timbers and debris at Brushville, three miles from here, at 6 o'clock last evening. A house occupied by Luther Hall and family was partially blown down, and one of Mr. Hall's sons was killed and another fatally injured. 
--------
325-> MINNESOTA STILL REPUBLICAN.; THE MAJORITY GREATLY REDUCED -- A DEMOCRATIC GAIN IN CONGRESS.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 4. -- Minnesota may still be classed as a Republican State, although the pluralities received by that party's nominees at to-day's election are nothing to brag of. W.R. Merriam is re-elected Governor by a plurality of about 8,500, against 24,000 two years ago. The remainder of the Republican ticket except Auditor is elected by greatly reduced pluralities Adolph Bierman (Dem. and Alliance) is elected Auditor by about 20,000 majority.

--------
327-> A STEAMER DISABLED.; THE MARK LANE BREAKS HER PROPELLER AND IS TOWED TO PORT.
HALIFAX, N.S., April 16. -- Another disabled steamship was towed in here to-day, the Mark Lane from New-Orleans, with maize to Belfast, Ireland. Capt. Pengilly reports he sailed from New-Orleans March 31, called at Norfolk, Va., for coal, and left there on the 8th instant. On the 10th and 11th a strong southwest gale with heavy southerly sea was encountered. 
--------
328-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
An impression has prevailed that the Commissioners sent from France to the isthmus were to make a thorough and impartial inquiry concerning the condition of the unfinished project of the Panama Canal Company and the feasibility of carrying the work to completion, and were to withhold their conclusions until all the data required by competent and disinterested engineers should have been procured. 
--------
329-> IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; THE HISTORY OF A THEFT. A REAL BARON ACCUSED OF STEALING A DOCTOR'S SACHEL.
Baron Jose Ma Munoz of 27 East Twenty-sixth Street and his wife and young son were passengers on a down-town Fourth Avenue car that left the Grand Central Station at 2:30 o'clock Tuesday afternoon. Dr. E.P. Stein, who is stopping with friends at 30 East Fifteenth Street, rode down town on the same car. 
--------
330-> THE NIAGARA TUNNEL.
NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Oct. 4. -- Niagara rejoices to-day over the commencement of the tunnel which, by the development of power that it will bring, will place her in a position to be rightly termed the "Manchester of America." The first sod was lifted at 10:42 o'clock this morning by C.B. Gaskill, President of the Niagara Power Company, the implement used being a nickel-plated shovel. 
--------
331-> THEFT OF TWO SENATORS; THE SCHEME TO DEFRAUD MONTANA CARRIED OUT. THE LEGALLY ELECTED DEMOCRATS TURNED FROM THE SENATE -- AN ATTACK ON CIVIL SERVICE RULES.
WASHINGTON, April 16. -- For the first time in the history of the Government the Senate of the United States numbers eighty-four members. Thirty-two Republican Senators stood together late this afternoon, and, with a thorough knowledge of what they were doing, deliberately declared that Wilbur F. Sanders and Thomas C. Power, Republicans, should be seated as Senators from the State of Montana. 
--------
332-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
If any proof were needed of the recklessness of the Republican leaders, it would be found in the way in which they rushed the Service Pension bill through the House yesterday. This is a measure which will add at least $50,000,000 to the expenditures, which will make any serious reduction of the taxes impossible, and which, if enacted at all, should have had the most careful consideration and the most thorough discussion. 
--------
333-> EL SOL IN PORT.; ARRIVAL OF THE NEW MORGAN LINER FROM PHILADELPHIA.
The new Morgan Line steamer El Sol arrived in port Friday. She came directly from the yards of her builders, William Cramp  Sons of Philadelphia, and began loading in the afternoon for her maiden outward-bound passage. 
--------
334-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
At last the Tariff bill is fairly before the Senate. It will be taken up formally at the close of the morning hour to-day. The debate that will follow is likely to prove rather one-sided if the present plans of the Republicans are carried out. They announce their intention to take no part in the general debate, leaving all the set speeches to be made by the Democrats. 
--------
335-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The General Registration bill as finally agreed upon in committee was presented in the State Senate last night by Mr. LINSON and made a special order for Thursday.

--------
336-> ARMY AND NAVY CADETS.; PREPARING FOR THE COMMENCEMENT DAYS AT THE TWO ACADEMIES.
WEST POINT, May 17. -- The official announcement of the annual examination at the United States Military Academy has been made.

--------
337-> NEW BOOKS.
-- The Princess of Monsterrat. By William Drysdale. Hudson River Series. Albany Book Company, Albany. -- When Harry Richmond was stranded in London, being a newspapery man, he never despaired. If he might not be dramatic critic of a leading English paper, he felt within himself the possibilities of turning his hand to any other vocation. 
--------
338-> MANY BASEBALL GAMES; FOUR VICTORIES FOR THE LOCAL CLUBS YESTERDAY. MUTRIE'S MEN PLAY AN ERRORLESS GAME AGAINST CLEVELAND -- ANOTHER DEFEAT FOR CHICAGO.
There was a marked improvement in the attendance at the Polo Grounds yesterday, the crowd numbering 1,327, the largest since the opening game. Yesterday's game was well contested thronghout, and not one person present regretted having seen it. The great work of the day was done by Rusie. He struck out fourteen men, which breaks the record of strikeouts for this season. 
--------
339-> THE BIG BOOK IN ALBANY; THE MONSTER PETITION FOR BALLOT REFORM. IT CREATES A SENSATION IN THE ASSEMBLY AND MAKES GOV. HILL'S SPOKESMAN LOSE HIS TEMPER.
ALBANY, March 3. -- The personal representative of Gov. Hill, nearly swept off his feet by the irresistible pressure of a mammoth ballot reform petition, against whose introduction he was frantically protesting, but which was introduced in spite of his protests, was the event of the night in the Assembly. 
--------
340-> IN THEIR NEW HOME.; ALPHA DELTA PHIS CLUB HOUSE THROWN OPEN TO MEMBERS.
The new clubhouse of the Alpha Delta Phi Club, at the corner of Madison Avenue and Thirty-ninth Street, was thrown open to the members of the club last evening under the most agreeable conditions.

--------
341-> PRINCETON COLLEGE.
PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 20. -- The new college catalogue, which will be ready for distribution in a few days, is of special interest this year, as it shows the great advance made by the college during the past year. It announces a number of new courses open to Juniors and Seniors, the appointment of several new instructors, as well as additional prizes and scholarships. 
--------
342-> REED AND GRADY.; ONE SUSTAINED AND THE OTHER DENOUNCED BY JOSEPH COOK.
BOSTON, Feb. 17. -- Joseph Cook, very heavily freighted with impossibility and polysyllables, startled his audience at to-day's lecture in Tremont Temple by a vigorous defense of Speaker Reed and his new rules, and by an equally vigorous denunciation of Mr. Grady's recent Boston speech. On the first subject he said: 
--------
343-> WILL THERE BE A GLASS TRUST?; WINDOW-GLASS MANUFACTURERS IN SECRET SESSION IN CHICAGO.
CHICAGO, Sept. 2. -- Representatives of nearly sixty window-glass manufacturing firms met at the Auditorium this afternoon and held a secret session. They then adjourned until tomorrow. They indignantly deny the report that they are engaged in forming a trust, but there is good reason to believe that that is just what they are here for. 
--------
344-> THE JUDICIARY COMMISSION.; COMMITTEES APPOINTED TO TAKE CHARGE OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS.
ALBANY, N.Y., June 4. -- The Constitutional Commission convened at 10:30 o'clock this morning. Only twenty members were present when President Danforth called for order. Clerk Bunn read the journal of yesterday, which was approved. 
--------
345-> IN DICTATOR REED'S PLACE; REPUBLICANS ANXIOUS ABOUT THE NEXT SPEAKER. THEY INFORM THE DEMOCRATS WHOM THEY WOULD PREFER -- MEN FROM WHOM THE MAJORITY CAN SELECT.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. -- Although the Fifty-second Congress will not meet until a whole year has passed unless the Republicans in the Fifty-first Congress attempt to do more than there is absolute necessity for doing and force an extra session, the Republicans have begun their gratuitous work of selecting a Speaker for the majority. 
--------
346-> PHYSICIANS IN COUNCIL.
BERLIN, Aug. 8. -- To-day's discussion in the Medical Congress included typhus fever, military hygiene, obstetrics, epidemics of children's diseases, neurology, psychiatry, and diseases of the larynx. The delegates visited the Tempelhof Garrison Hospital, the Natural History Museum, and the Municipal Disinfection Institute. 
--------
347-> MR. BRECKINRIDGE'S SEAT.; THE CLAYTON CASE CALLED UP YESTERDAY -- MR. SMYSER'S SUCCESSOR.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2. -- Speaker Reed has felt for several days that it is absolutely necessary to do something in the House to get the Republicans together. The events of the last fortnight and the loss of party spirit that they have engendered have made it apparent to the "boss" that nothing short of an appeal to the Republicans to draw Democratic blood would answer the purpose. 
--------
348-> HOPEFUL SIGNS IN INDIANA; THE OLD SOLDIER LOSING POWER IN POLITICS. YOUNG AND PROGRESSIVE MEN COMING TO THE FRONT -- THE STATUS OF THE TWO OLD PARTIES.
INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 2. -- It is a hopeful sign when a State so politically provincial and narrow as Indiana frees herself of some of the old prejudices and evinces a disposition to experiment with new ideas and methods. Perhaps no other Western State has suffered from the narrowness so much as Indiana, and surely the emancipation has been less marked in other States than in that of the Hoosiers. 
--------
349-> OUR NAVAL POLICY.
The Shipbuilding Policy Board, of which Commodore W.P. MCCANN is President, is put on the defensive by the minority report which Mr. CHANDLER has made upon the Hale bill. Congress cannot sanction a scheme to expend $350,000,000 on the new navy, including what is already laid out or authorized, until Senator CHANDLER'S objections are refuted. 
--------
350-> THAT CORRUPT CABLE BILL; MUCH SPECULATION AS TO WHAT GOV. HILL WILL DO. IDENTIFYING HISTORY OF THE MEASURE -- THE STRONG PROTEST MADE BY CONTROLLER MYERS.
Metropolitan politicians of a corruptnature are becoming more and more nervous as the time of Gov. Hill's final action on the Cable bill diminishes. Bets have been made within the past forty-eight hours between men well informed as to the Governor's probable disposition of this measure. Mayor Grant has openly asserted that Gov. Hill will not sign it, and Shed Shook is equally confident that he will. 
--------
351-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
One result of the legal proceedings in California against the sugar refining company that was originally a member of the Trust, and that afterward sold its property to certain refiners in the Trust, is that the sugar market of the State is now controlled by CLAUS SPRECKELS, whose refinery in San Francisco continues in operation.

The penalty for this offense under the new election law is from one to five years in the penitentiary. 
--------
355-> DAINTY GOWNS FOR WOMEN.
Doubtless the elderly ladies of to-day look with a tinge of melancholy reflection at the quaint and picturesque costumes in which their granddaughters are so charming, and while their fond eyes rest lovingly upon the beautiful young faces their minds return with gentle regret to the thought of how much of artistic heightening their own beauty missed. 
--------
356-> FEATURES OF THE NEW BILL.
WASHINGTON, March 18 -- The internal revenue features of the new Tariff bill are as follows: 
--------
357-> PREPARING FOR ELECTION DAY.; WHAT THE EXPENSES OF THE DEPARTMENTS WILL AMOUNT TO.
The Board of Estimate and Apportionment met yesterday in the Mayor's office and found plenty of pressing business awaiting its attention. Police Commissioners Martin (Tammany) and Voorhis (Voorhis Democrat) were there to present the estimate of their department for the expenses of the forthcoming election. The total amount asked for all election expenses (including the election of a Congressman in Register Fitzgerald's place in the Sixth Congressional District last Winter) was $464,743, divided as follows: 
--------
358-> THE LONDON POLICE STRIKE.
London was left virtually at the mercy of her 200,000 criminals last night until midnight, because a few policemen on the Metropolitan force had been dismissed for violating what the Chief regarded, very properly, as the discipline of the service. The reinstatement of these men was demanded, and when the demand met with no response a general strike of the policemen of London was begun. 
--------
359-> TARIFF THE ONLY ISSUE.; M'KINLEY HAS A HARD BATTLE BEFORE HIM AT HOME.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 17. -- It will not be many days before a big political battle will begin in this district, the Sixteenth, and this city of Canton, the home of Major William McKinley, will be the theatre of the hottest contest ever waged between the two great parties in Ohio. For Ohio this one is just as important from a party standpoint as was the one in Maine. 
--------
360-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
As the bark Shenir of Glasgow, from Demerara, was lying off Bedlow's Island yesterday morning, striking her topgallant masts so as to be able to pass under the bridge to her dock.

--------
363-> WHERE THE OLD CORKS GO; BOUGHT UP BY DEALERS, CLEANED, AND SOLD AGAIN. THE TRADE MEANS A PRETTY PENNY FOR HELPERS IN RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PLACES OF REFRESHMENT.

SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 18. -- Judge Zane to-day decided that six Mormon Councilmen, who received the highest number o votes in their wards, are entitled to certificates of election. This would make the incoming Council stand 9 Gentiles and 6 Mormons, giving the former a good working majority. 
--------
365-> NEWS OF THE NAVY.
The Government has at present only two naval attaches in Europe regularly assigned to legations. These officers are Lieut. Commander W.H. Emory and Lieut. Aaron Ward. The former is stationed at London, the latter at Berlin. Until recently Lieut. Buckingham was naval attache at Paris, but he is now doing duty on the staff of Admiral Walker in the squadron of evolution.

366-> THE POPE'S TEMPORALITIES.
Since the union of Italy the point has been considerably blunted of THACKERAY'S famous lines: 
--------
367-> DR. T.L. CUYLER TO RESIGN; HE WILL LEAVE HIS CHURCH EARLY IN APRIL. RECORD OF THE THIRTY YEARS HE HAS SPENT WITH THE LAFAYETTE-AVENUE CHURCH IN BROOKLYN.
The Rev. Theodore L. Cuyler, who for almost thirty years has been pastor of the Lafayette-Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, has finally made up his mind to give up the charge to which he has devoted so much of his life. He is in need of rest, and has determined to abandon active work. 
--------
368-> MR. MURPHY'S LITTLE BILLS.; HOW THEY WERE TREATED BY NEW-JERSEY'S STATESMEN.
TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 18. -- The Assembly to-day dealt with surprising candor with some of Assemblyman Murphy's measures. Assemblyman Murphy achieved notoriety by being elected from the Third Jersey City District, which is usually Republican, on a Democratic nomination. He has since achieved distinction as the introducer of an unusually large number of shady bills. 
--------
369-> MR. REED AND 1892.
During the recent debate in the House upon the new rules, Mr. Speaker REED was nominated as the Presidential candidate of his party for 1892. The suggestion was made by an Ohio man, which is significant, because it is very rarely that an Ohio man names anybody for any place, unless he be also an Ohio man. 
--------
370-> ENGLAND IN EAST AFRICA.; HER TRANSFER OF HELIGOLAND TO GERMANY CAUSES MUCH DISCUSSION.
LONDON, June 19. -- In the House of Lords to-day the Earl of Rosebery asked whether the Government, before arranging for the transfer of Heligoland to Germany, had consulted the naval and military authorities; also whether an effort had been made to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants of Heligoland in the matter.

Monday. 
--------
372-> A BANK CLOSES ITS DOORS.; THE GLOUCESTER CITY NATIONAL FOLLOWS THE BANK OF AMERICA.
PHILADELPHIA, May 1. -- The Gloucester City National Bank, an institution closely allied with the people who control the broken Bank of America, the American Life Insurance Company, and other shaky or bankrupt concerns in this city, suspended to-day.

The author of this timely book was moved to his investigations partly, no doubt, by the scholarly instinct, but chiefly by the conviction which he expresses that to restrict the gift of religious inspiration to one small fraction of the human race is not in accord with God's way of working. 
--------
375-> CENSUS-BRED BITTERNESS; ST. PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS HAVE LOCKED HORNS. CHICAGO'S BIG CLAIM OF A MILLION AND A HALF POPULATION -- A RECOUUT NEEDED FOR ST. LOUIS.

376-> A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT.
COLUMBIA, S.C., Sept. 18. -- Political revolutions seem to be the order of the day in South Carolina, and the Republican State Convention which has been in session here for two days illustrates this fact.

--------
379-> WHY THE GIANTS DIDN'T WIN.
Both the New-York clubs started for Pittsburg last evening. All of the League men, with the exception of Esterbrook, accompanied the clubs. Hatfield, Gore, and Keefe were left behind by the Brotherhood team. Gore is still suffering from his sore leg, and Keefe's hand is so bad that he cannot handle the ball with his accustomed skill. Hethinks that it is advisable to take a rest. 
--------
380-> WHO CAUSED THE FIRE?; THE COX, PARISH & UNGER INVESTIGATION NOT YET CONCLUDED.
Fire Marshal Mitchel began at 9 A.M. yesterday an investigation of the Cox, Parish  Unger fire of last Thursday. He examined a large number of witnesses, including Messrs.

At the last moment, just before their Tariff bill was laid before the House, Mr. McKINLEY and his associates -- neither Mr. BURROWS nor Gov. GEAR excepted -- surrendered to the Sugar Trust.

--------
387-> AN OLD MAN'S VOW.
Mrs. Mollie Ellen Saunders died at her home in this city last week after a brief illness. She was the youngest and only surviving child of Elle Ellen, an old resident of Truckee. Her death recalls a striking incident, which is related as taking place six or seven years ago.

--------
388-> OF NAVAL INTEREST.
Lieut. L.K. Reynolds, who has recently been ordered to the command of the Coast Survey steamer Endeavor, served on board the United States frigate Constellation during the early part of the present decade.

NEW-ORLEANS, La., Dec. 6. -- No official statement has yet been made regarding the failure of V.  A. Meyer  Co. yesterday, but it is learned that their assets will exceed $3,000,000, while their liabilities are very much less, approximating $2,000,000. 
--------
390-> TOLEDO'S CHOLERA HERO.; DON RUFIANO'S DEVOTION WHEN OTHERS HAD FLED IN DISMAY.
A correspondent writes to the Pall Mall Guzetie as follows: "A few miles from the city of Toledo there is a small township called Arges. At the commencement of the year its population was nigh 500 souls; its Mayor, or 'Alcalde,' is Don Rufiano Jimanez -- an extensive lime burner, deservedly enjoying the popularity and confidence of his fellow-villagers.

CAMP ABBETT, SEA GIRT, N.J., July 21. -- Strict military discipline was enforced in camp to-day, and the men of the Second Brigade were worked hard from morning until night.

--------
392-> HOW MUCH DO VOTES COST; THE AQUEDUCT GRAB IS ON THE ROAD TO SUCCUESS. TO BE REPORTED BY THE HOUSE CITIES COMMITEE -- A GREAT SCANDAL PREDICTED -- OTHER BAD MEASURES.
ALBANY, April 17. -- If there has been one bill introduced this year more iniquitous and infamous than any other it is that Erwin aqueduct contractors' grab. Every decent self-respecting man in the Legislature is against it, but judging from results, the decent self-respecting men can be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
--------
393-> THE COPYRIGHT BILL.
It is very gratifying and creditable that the International Copyright bill, in which there is absolutely no "politics," only justice and decency, should have been reached in the House of Representatives yesterday. The bill needs only to be brought to the notice of any intelligent and fair-minded man to convince him that it is in the interest of justice and decency. 
--------
394-> RACING AT WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. -- The first meeting of the new Washington Jockey Club will begin at the track at Benning's Station to-morrow.

NEW-ORLEANS, Oct. 19. -- The coils are tightening around the Matranga party of Sicilians, as the assassins of the late Chief of Police. The Provonseanos, who had been convicted of lying in wait to murder the Matrangas, on testimony which Judge Baker declared to be unworthy of belief, in granting them a new trial, have given their version of the matter. When asked who shot the Chief of Police they replied: "Matranga, sure." 
--------
397-> THE VICTOR OF CAWNPORE.; HAVELOCK. By ARCHIBALD FORBES. (English Men of Action Series.) London and New York: MACMILLAN & CO. 1890.
Havelock's career was long since made the subject of a book. Details of its most memorable events are familiar to all Englishmen and to many Americans. The Indian mutiny is an occurrence of which vivid personal memories survive with men not yet old. England still counts scores of survivors of the various engagements in which the British fought to subjection the natives of their Eastern Empire. 
--------
398-> GOOD NEWS FOR ATHLETES.; NATIONAL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP MEDALS TO BE PRESENTED.
At the games of the Manhattan Athletic Club, to be held to-morrow on the club's grounds, Fifty-sixth Street and Eighth Avenue, the championship medals of the old National Association of Amateur Athletes, won in 1888, will be presented.

--------
401-> ROCKAWAY VALLEY'S EXTENSION.
SOMERVILLE, N.J., Aug. 8. -- The new Rockaway Valley Railroad has already completed preparations for an extension from Peapack to Mendham. The extension will be nearly as long as the present main line itself and will reach to within a short distance of Morristown. One-fourth of the capital for the extension was subscribed by Morristown capitalists, and after the completion of the tracks they will provide for its continuation to the Morris County seat itself. 
--------
402-> PUBLIC EDUCATION.
The meeting in this city of the Department of Superintendence of the National Educational Association ought to be, perhaps, a more important event than it is, but it is by no means without importance. Public education is one of the subjects reserved to the States by the Constitution, and, like several other subjects in the same category, it suffers from the lack of system and uniformity with which it is managed by the several States. 
--------
403-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The Hon. R.P. KENNEDY of Ohio "unpacked his heart with words" yesterday before the House of Representatives. He began a speech on the Clayton-Breckinridge case, turned to the merits of the Elections bill, then took up the Senate, which, under the dictation of QUAY, had thrown that bill over. 
--------
404-> CLASS DAY AT HARVARD.; GREAT CROWDS OF VISITORS AND VERY ENJOYABLE EXERCISES.
BOSTON, Mass., June 20. -- If '90 had had weather made for the occasion it could not have been more satisfactory in any way. The sun rose in Cambridge on a clear sky and with its light came a fresh breeze which lasted through the heat of the day. 
--------
405-> THE SUGAR TRUST'S NEW MOVE.; SAID TO HAVE GAINED CONTROL OF A FORMER COMPETITOR.
A report was freely circulated in down-town sugar circles yesterday that the trust had forged another weapon with which to fight its opponents in Philadelphia, especially Claus Spreckels. The largest refinery in Philadelphia is that of Harrison, Frazier  Co. This concern has never been willing to go into the trust as a firm.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 8. -- "Dick" Tate, Kentucky's defaulting Treasurer, is believed to be dead.

Circumstantial evidence to establish the truth of this opinion almost beyond the possibility of a doubt is forthcoming.

ALBANY, Feb. 3. -- The overwhelming afflictions in the families of Secretary of State James G. Blaine and Secretary of the Navy B.F. Tracy led to an early adjournment of the Legislature this evening -- in the Assembly within a few minutes allotted for the reading of a set of concurrent resolutions which Gen. Husted presented, and which were read from the Chair. 
--------
412-> EVIDENCES OF SYMPATHY.; MANY ENTERTAINMENTS POSTPONED -- RESOLUTIONS OF CONDOLENCE.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3. -- Owing to the deplorable calamities which have befallen the households of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Navy a large number of invitations for receptions, dinners, and dancing parties to have been given during the present week by prominent society people have been recalled.

ST. PAUL, June 5.--The fierce storm which raged all night over Southern Minnesota has nearly abated, and reports which are now coming in show the rainfalls to have been almost a general cloudburst, and the damage heavy and widespread. Where the rain was heaviest the wind did no damage, but at Chatfield and Mapleton, where a cyclone prevailed, there was no rain. 
--------
415-> MR. REED'S TEMPER TRIED; THE FIGHT OVER THE SILVER BILL IN THE HOUSE. TIME NOT REGARDED AS WASTED BY OPPONENTS OF FREE COINAGE --STRUGGLE WITH THE SPEAKER.
WASHINGTON, June 20. -- With the exception of a short break to dispose of the conference report on the Anti-Trust bill, the House spent all of to-day in discussing the subject that occupied it yesterday -- the question of the propriety of the reference by the Speaker of the Senate Free Coinage bill to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. 
--------
416-> CONFRONTED BY A DEFICIT; REPUBLICANS ALARMED AT THE MANY RAIDS. ESTIMATES OF EXPENSES WHICH WOULD MAKE THE SURPLUS MELT AND HIGHER DUTIES NECESSARY.

PEEKSKILL, March 19. -- This town is all excitement over the shooting affair in which young Walter Scribner received a twenty-two calibre bullet in the head from a pistol in the hands of Miss Emma Lonsbury yesterday afternoon.

--------
418-> A LIFE SENTENCE FOR A WOMAN.
RAVENSWOOD, West Va., Aug. 21. -- In the Circuit Court yesterday evening the jury in the murder case of Mary Jane Morgan, charged with murder in the first degree, brought in a verdict of guilty, and Judge Jacobs sentenced the prisoner to be confined in the penitentiary for life.

--------
419-> TRACING BENWELL'S MURDER.; THE ALLEGED ASSASSIN ARRESTED -- STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.
OTTAWA, Ontario, March 4. -- There are astonishing developments in the Princeton murder case. Without a doubt the young Englishman so mysteriously killed was the victim of a murderous conspiracy.

--------
420-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
Alderman Daly of the Nineteenth District presented a petition signed by residents of his district to the Board of Aldermen yesterday asking that the name of Ninth-avenue from the Boulevard crossing at Sixty-fourth-street to One Hundred and Tenth-street be changed to Columbus-avenue, and that the name or Tenth-avenue from Seventieth-street to Fort George-avenue be changed to Holland or Amsterdam avenue.

ORANGE, N.J., Oct. 5. -- The Democratic primaries for the election of delegates to the convention which will nominate a successor to the late Freeholder William H. Lamb, who died two weeks ago, will be held to-morrow night, and a lively time is expected. The party is split into two factions in this city, which are known as the Hartford and anti-Hartford factions. 
--------
422-> A BAD POSITION.
The attitude of Congress toward the civil service is not encouraging, and it is not creditable to that body. The only thing that has been done so far is to sanction an "investigation" by a committee of the House into certain very vague charges against the Civil Service Commissioners. 
--------
423-> LEASING WHARF PROPERTY.; PIERS AND BULKHEADS BRING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE.
A large number of business men interested in dock property were present yesterday noon at the auction sale of leases by the Dock Department at Pier A.

--------
425-> THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
It is a curious fact that when ex-GOV. PATTISON examined carefully the laws and the Constitution of Pennsylvania in order to determine in what way a reform of the ballot system could best be secured he found that the secrecy of the ballot was rendered practically impossible by the Constitution. The Constitution declares: "All elections by the citizens shall be by ballot.

426-> ILLINOIS STANDS IN LINE.; A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF PROBABLY 15,000.
CHICAGO, Nov. 5. -- For the first time in its history, Illinois has gone Democratic, and by such a large majority as to make it seem probable that it will stay Democratic, at least until after the next Presidential election.

The election of Gen. CARLOS EZETA as President of Salvador has been followed by popular rejoicings that are very significant. But his present triumph is only the corollary of his success in the field against a country so much larger and credited with greater military resources. It was natural for Salvador to ratify a policy which under EZETA'S leadership had yielded so much military prestige. 
--------
432-> LAWLESSNESS IN KENTUCKY.; SIX PERSONS KILLED WITHIN A WEEK IN KNOX COUNTY.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 4. -- A special to the Enquirer from Barboursville, Ky., says: Sunday, at Flatlick, Sheriff Calloway Carnes was fatally shot by a desperado named Bill Smith, leader of the Smith faction of the Smith-Slusher feud.

435-> ART NOTES.
Worcester porcelain received in 1788 the permission to call itself "Royal Worcester."

439-> THE HOUSE SILVER BILL.
We suppose that the bill which was presented by Mr. McKINLEY and amended by Mr. REED in the Republican House caucus and brought up in the House yesterday fairly represents the very best that the Administration can hope to wring from the majority in the direction of sound finance. It is to be remarked that Mr. CONGER sounded what we may call in the slang of current politics the "key note" of the caucus. 
--------
440-> THE OFFICERS TESTIFY.; BUT LITTLE LIGHT IS THROWN ON THE NEW-YORK CENTRAL STRIKE.
With a quiet as of night and a calmness as of perfect peace the investigation by the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration into the causes of the recent strike on the New-York Central Railroad ceased yesterday.

The denial by the Germans in Zanzibar of the recent report that a proclamation permitting the slave trade had been issued at Bagamoyo and Daressalaam is a relief, although it was hardly to be supposed that the report was literally correct. But the entire abolition of slavery in Zanzibar' is an affair only of the future.

Within the last week the American quinine manufacturers have renewed their efforts to have quinine taken from the free list and to have the former duty of 25 per cent. restored.

In one or two cases the recent investment of English money in American industries has been closely related to the formation of combinations in those industries, the combinations having been made by the American owners just before the sale of the property.

--------
453-> TRUSTS IN THE COURTS.
The "experience of New-York shows," says the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, that "the Trusts can be dealt with effectually by the common law," and it follows, our contemporary adds, that "there is a remedy for the Trust abuse which can be readily applied in many of the States in which the abuse exists, without any new legislation whatever."

454-> GEN. GRANT'S CONVERSATION.; DR. JOHN P. NEWMAN RELATES HOW IT CAME ABOUT.
The Thirty-seventh Street Methodist Episcopal Church, which has been undergoing repairs, was reopened yesterday, and special services of an appropriate character were held, forenoon, afternoon, and evening. Popoular interest centred in the service of the afternoon, the feature of which was the dedication of the memorial windows, of which descriptions were given in THE TIMES of Saturday.

455-> VIRGINIA'S REVENUES.; BELIEF THAT THE LAND ASSESSMENTS WILL INCREASE THEM.
RICHMOND, Va., July 22. -- The representatives here on the holders of Virginia bonds are watching with interest the new assessment of land and other subjects of State taxation in the hope that they will afford largely increased revenues.

456-> THE REPUBLICANS WARNED; THREE SHARP ATTACKS MADE UPON THE TARIFF BILL. THE ENORMOUS INCREASE OF DUTY ON COTTON TIES A TEXT FOR SENATORS VANCE, TURPIE, AND DANIEL.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9. -- Three Democratic Senators made speeches during the debate on the Tariff bill to-day. Their trend was the enormous increase of duty put upon cotton ties, but each of them branched out into a general discussion of the bill as a whole, and the relative merits of a tariff for revenue and a tariff for the exclusive benefit of protected manufacturers. 
--------
457-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
It is not unnatural that the journals o Germany should resent the Emperor WILLIAM'S spiteful declaration that "journalists are high-school products run to seed." The tendency of an educated journalist to hesitation in accepting as indisputable every idea of the young ruler on any subject from political economy and foreign a policy to the proper costume for ladies and the cooking of dinners, is not necessarily the result of too much Latin and Greek. 
--------
458-> THE TARIFF AND THE ELECTIONS.
Undoubtedly the McKinley tariff was the chief issue in the elections of Tuesday, but not the professed principle of the bill nor even the extreme application of that principle. The real issue was the general policy of the Republican Party, of which the Tariff bill was the most conspicuous and the most important embodiment. 
--------
459-> SCHOOLEY'S MOUNTAIN.
SCHOOLEY'S MOUNTAIN, N.J., Aug. 9. -- This ancient resort continues to hold its own and, just at present, considerably more than its own. The hotel are filled, gayeties follow in rapid succession, and the prospects for the rest of the month are of the best. 
--------
460-> Article 57 -- No Title
PICTURESQUE PRAYERS. -- The young hos and hostess were what is known as "smart" people, such as one might be slow to credit with thoughtful or reverent habits; nevertheless, their practice was to conduct a simple service, which became not only a spiritual refreshment and a purifying influence, but a very notable feature in home life.

461-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
Mr. HENRY C. LEA of Philadelphia, an ardent adherent of the Republican Party in the past, be it remembered, has supplemented his scathing arraignment of "Boss" QUAY with a letter addressed to QUAY'S candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania, GEORGE W. DELAMATER, which is calculated to make even the callous integument of that person tingle. 
--------
462-> PENSION MONEYS PROTECTED.
ALBANY, March 19. -- A question of much interest was settled by the Court of Appeals Tuesday. It was whether real estate purchased by a veteran with his pension moneys can be levied upon and sold under execution. The case on which the decision was rendered came up under the title "Yates County National Bank against Zeno T. Carpenter, impleaded." 
--------
463-> THE PENSION DEFICIENCY; MILLIONS REQUIRED TO MEET THE DEMANDS. PLANS OF THE REPUBLICANS TO MAKE THE COMING DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MAKE GOOD THE BIG DEFICIT.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. -- Republican members of Congress are apparently reluctant to return to Washington. They are coming so slowly that this morning, when the Committee on Appropriations should have met in response to the request made by Mr. Cannon at the close of the first session, there were but two Republicans in the committee room, and Mr. Cannon was not one of them. 
--------
464-> AFTER MANY YEARS.; THE WIFE OF A MISSING SOLDIER SECURES A PENSION.
MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Nov. 5. -- The remarkable and long-pending widow's pension claim made by Mrs. Margaret A. Jacoby of Port Jervis, Orange County, has at last been brought to a successful issue.

--------
466-> A MODEL MERCHANT VESSEL.; THE ITALIAN STEEL SHIP CHEVALIERE CIAMPA NOW IN THIS PORT.
The Italian steel ship Chevaliere Ciampa, the handsomest if not the largest merchant ship over seen in this port, was decked in holiday attire at her anchorage off Bedlow's Island yesterday in honor of a party of visitors who, through the kindness of Mr. Louis Contencin, President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, had been invited to inspect the vessel. 
--------
467-> STATE CARE OF THE INSANE.; A NEW ORDER ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION IN LUNACY.
ALBANY, N.Y., April 18. -- The State Commission in Lunacy has directed the Superintendents and financial officers of the various State insane asylums to adopt some general system of keeping a record of accounts and statistics to the end that the commission may know exactly how many inmates each institution has, how they are classified, what the expenses of asylums are, and all other material facts.

MISSAPPLIED TALENT. -- The mild Hindu has a faculty for fraud that is not always suspected. In the bazaars of Calcutta and Bombay the vilest poison is sold to the English sailors in bottles branded and capsuled as Martell's or Hennessy's brandy, Dunville's whisky, and the like. Jack pays the full price of the genuine article, but is supplied with a villainous compound of native concoction.

CHICAGO, Jan. 19. -- Marshall Field has given ten acres of land, valued at $100,000, for a site for the Chicago University, the project for which originated with J.D. Rockefeller of New-York. 
--------
470-> LAWN TENNIS AT YALE.; INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCHES OPENED, BUT SPOILED BY THE WEATHER.
NEW-HAVEN, Oct. 6. -- The weather was far from auspicious here to-day, and this fact kept many people from witnessing the opening matches in the intercollegiate lawn tennis tournament which was commenced here this morning. The courts were a trifle damp, and after seven matches had been played it commenced to rain, and play was postponed until to-morrow morning at 10:30. 
--------
471-> HUNTING HENNESSY'S ASSASSINS.; THE POLICE OF NEW-ORLEANS ARREST ANOTHER ITALIAN.
NEW-ORLEANS, Oct. 20. -- The police have all the time insisted that there were five men in the party of assassins who murdered Chief Hennessy, and they asserted that they had four of these behind prison bars the next day. They have been searching diligently for the fifth man, and last night Manuel Pietro, an Italian living on Julia Street, near Barrone, was selected as the man. 
--------
472-> CONGRESS AND BUSINESS.
It is perhaps unavoidable, but it is certainly unfortunate, that the meetings of Congress are always, looked forward to with a good deal of uneasiness by business men who are in the habit of basing their calculations on large views of the situation. The unknown is, according to the proverb, magnificent, and it is apt in any case to be magnified, and nothing is more completely unknown than the action of Congress. 
--------
473-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
There is something very symptomatic in the campaign document just issued by the Republican Congressional Committee and described in one of our Washington dispatches. It has a title page bearing the portraits of GRANT and LINCOLN, and it recites the achievements of the Republican Party. 
--------
474-> MORLEY ANSWERS BALFOUR.; A VERY TEMPERATE REPLY TO THE LEADER OF THE TORIES.
LONDON, Oct. 20. -- Mr. Morley addressed his constituents in Newcastle this evening. He said he had promised when at leisure to write a history of England from 1886 to the next general election, but he despaired of being able to please Mr. Balfour in so doing. Mr. Balfour's arguments in his recent speeches were mainly Tu quoque, misrepresentations and irrelevancies. 
--------
475-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
" Q C.B. Co." -- The House had eighteen contested election cases before it, in seven of which the Republican contestants were seated. Two cases remain to be decided. The right of eight sitting Democrats to their seats was confirmed, and the seat of one Democrat (Breckinridge) was declared vacant. The only contest in the Senate was that from Montana, and the Republican claimants from that State were seated.

The process of amending the Saxton Ballot Reform bill is thought to be complete now, and the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly is expected to report it to-day. Probably no public measure in this State was ever subjected to such careful and repeated scrutiny and such persistent and thoughtful revision for the purpose of leaving it free from defects or reasonable objection. 
--------
478-> BEHRING SEA BELLIGERENTS.
Mysterious intimations come from Victoria and Ottawa of a terrible fate in preparation by the British Columbian sealing vessels for our unsuspecting revenue cutters in Alaska waters. It appears not only that the crews of all the private sealers are "fully armed," but that two clipper schooners are being secretly fitted out in Maple Bay, with a special view to "meeting the Yankees." 
--------
479-> QUOTATIONS OUT OF A BOX; A NOVELTY IN WALL STREET "STOCK OPERATIONS." THE NEW SCHEME IS CLAIMED TO BE LEGAL BUT IT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN POPULAR BUT WICKED GAME.
The recent short-lived activity of the police of the First Precinct in arresting the proprietors of bucket shops in the vicinity of the Stock Exchange didn't have the effect, as it was announced it would, of closing the shops permanently. Not at all. They opened up again immediately and they have been running serenely ever since, although the proprietors, like the brokers, complain sorely of a lack of patronage. 
--------
480-> THE BROOKLYN RACES.; THE SEASIDE STAKES TO BE DECIDED THIS AFTERNOON.
With a good track this afternoon there should be plenty of sport at the Brooklyn track, for the six races have received a good lot of entries, such as promise exceptionally good sport for an "off day," as Monday usually is. The stake event will be the Seaside Stakes for two-year-olds at five-eighths of a mile, for which fifteen probable starters are named. The entries and weights for the several events are as follows: 
--------
481-> FIRE IN A SEASIDE HOTEL.; MANY GUESTS HELPED TO SAFETY BY THE FIREMEN AT ATLANTIC CITY.
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., May 18. -- Soon after 1 o'clock this morning fire was discovered in a storeroom in the rear wing of the Osborne House, a large hotel at Arkansas and Pacific Avenues, and by the time the Fire Department reached the scene the entire wing was enveloped in flames, and a dense mass of smoke was pouring through the halls of the main building.

482-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
There was a little flurry in the Senate yesterday over the conference committee's report on the Silver bill, but it was confined practically to the Democrats, who, in the absence of aid from the lately recalcitrant Republicans, do not count. The objections made by the Democrats were not very clear, and where they were intelligible were not reasonable. 
--------
483-> NO REGARD FOR JUSTICE; THE PROTESTS OF FLORIDA OF NO AVAIL. SWAYNE AND STRIPLING CONFIRMED -PROBABLE COURT-MARTIAL OF COMMANDER M'CALLA.
WASHINGTON, April 1. -- Senator Edmunds and the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee have succeeded in saddling Charles Swayne and Joseph N. Stripling upon the people of Florida, the former as District Judge and the latter as District Attorney. It has been a long and earnest contest, and the final struggle to-day took up over five hours' time.

The committee of the New-York Yacht Club appointed last Thursday night to write a reply to Lord Dunraven's letter was to have held a meeting yesterday afternoon in the clubhouse, at 67 Madison-avenue, but only two members, Chairman J.R.

--------
486-> A MESSAGE FROM GLADSTONE.
Gen. W.T. Sherman presided at a meeting held yesterday afternoon in the rooms of the Lawyers' Club, Equitable Building, to listen to a message sent by William E.

In the handsomest banquet hall that this city has ever possessed the members of the New-England Society of New-York last night enjoyed their eighty-fifth anniversary dinner.

About 500 men sat down to the tables and found themselves rather too closely packed together.

The Rev. THEODORE L. CUYLER announced on Sunday his intention of resigning as minister of the Lafayette-Avenue Presbyterian Church, in Brooklyn, after thirty years of labor in connection with it and after nearly half a century in the ministry.

The New-York Athletic Club's second ladies' day for this season, observed yesterday in the clubhouse, 104 West Fifty-fith-street, was in every way as enjoyable and as well attended as the first one, held last month.

PIETY UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL -- "Piety," says Euthyphre, in his dialogue with Socrates, "is an art which goes and men have of doing business with each other."

RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 23. -- Was there an attempt on the part of the opponents of the provisional Government to tamper with the common soldiers? Was the mutiny of a part of the Second and Ninth Regiments of Artillery prearranged, and was it due to a conspiracy in which a number of leading men were concerned?

The accident at Newburg yesterday, by which a horse and a man were killed and another man severely injured, is a new and impressive testimony to the extreme peril of the arc electric light, and to the literally vital necessity of a strict supervision of it.

495-> COUNTERFEITERS AND THUGS.; MR. HICKEY HAS HARD LUCK WITH BAD CHARACTERS.
J.F. Hickey, who keeps a saloon at Cottage Place and Bleecker Street, had a little experience with passers of counterfeit money Sunday night which he will not soon forget. Mr. Hickey was standing in front of his saloon about 9:30 o'clock when two men named Frank Smith and Edward Fox approached and asked him to change a two-dollar bill. Hickey did so.

--------
500-> NORTH DAKOTA'S SENATOR.; REPUBLICAN FACTIONAL QUARRELS MAY ELECT A DEMOCRAT.
ELLENDALE, N.D., Nov. 20. -- The Senatorial canvass in this State has become bitterly personal. Feeling runs so high between the hostile factions that there is no certainty of the Republican caucus settling the matter. The possibility of North Dakota sending a Democrat to the United States Senate is not so remote that it has escaped the attention of the national leaders, and hence the outside world is viewing the contest here with keen interest.

CHICAGO, Sept. 19. -- The Chicago race meet was inaugurated to-day at the new quarter-mile track at Parkside.

503-> A TRIBUTE TO CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
Hypocrisy is said to be the tribute that vice pays to virtue, and the attack made by such vulgar champions of the spoils system as Messrs. HATTON and EWART upon the Civil Service Commissioners, under the pretense that they have failed in their duty, may be taken as a conspicuous tribute to the cause of civil service reform.

DETROIT, Oct. 6. -- James M. Turner, Republican candidate for Governor, is out this afternoon in a defense against the charges brought against him last Friday by J.F. McElroy, Superintendent of the State School for the Blind. It is fully as long as his accuser's statement, and is, as a whole, what the lawyers would term a plea of confession and avoidance.

In deference to the wishes of a small number of wool growers, chiefly in Ohio, who furnish less than 3 per cent. in value of the products of that State, the Republicans of Congress propose to advance the duties on wool of all kinds, and on carpet wools to the point of prohibition. This they call "protection" to the farmer.

Dispatches from Boston regarding the latest announcement of a deal between the New-York and New-Haven and New-York and New-England Railroads are very generally to the effect that though negotiations are undoubtedly afloat no conclusions have so far been reached nor contracts made. In this city, however, there is a very pronounced belief that the deal announced has already been accomplished. 
--------
513-> TAMMANY'S PRETENSES.
Mayor GRANT'S letter accepting a renomination at the hands of Tammany Hall has been prepared with a degree of care and a display of ingenuity, and with an absence of showy rhetoric, which indicate that a more skillful and sober pen than that of BOURKE COCKRAN was employed in its composition.

PITTSBURG, Penn., March 5. -- The Pittsburg and Western Railroad Company is having surveys made for the purpose of constructing a branch into the rich Beaver Valley.

PROVIDENCE, R.I., Oct. 7. -- It was a foregone conclusion that the Republican Conventions to-day would renominate Congressmen Spooner and Arnold, and the proceedings were consequently somewhat of the cut-and-dried order. Aggressive Republicanism seemed to be the keynote, and both conventions "whooped" for Speaker Reed and his methods at every opportunity.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. -- Representative Buchanan of New-Jersey to-day presented to the House from the Committee on Labor a bill agreed upon by the committee amendatory of the alien contract labor law.

Another good crowd and another good day's sport was the record at the Elizabeth track of the New-Jersey Jockey Club yesterday. The betting ring had its usual crowd of bookmakers, and the thousands who packed the inclosure kept them busy all day long. The layers of the odds had a little the best of it in the first two and the fourth races, as the favorites won, but the outsiders won in the other three. 
--------
518-> TOO MANY POLICE JUSTICES; A BROAD AND FERTILE FIELD OF REFORM. THE CITY MIGHT SAVE $125,000 ANNUALLY -- SPECIAL FITNESS NEEDED ON THE POLICE COURT BENCH.
On the 8th of last May the ex-Sheriff, who is now Mayor of this city, was authorized by an act of the Legislature to appoint four additional Police Justices. The measure was the outcome of a dicker between politicians. Its net result was to foist four useless and unnecessary men on the taxpayers, the reward to the office mongers $32,000 per annum and "pickings," and the advantages to the public negative.

519-> TOO FREE WITH THEIR MONEY.; SECRETARY WINDOM CAUTIONS THE WORLD'S FAIR COMMISSIONERS.
CHICAGO, Oct. 21. -- Secretary Windom has sent a long communication to the Executive Committee of the National World's Fair Commission, calling attention to the lavish expenditures for salaries of officers and expense of committees.

521-> SHAKESPEARE ON THE STAGE.
The late FREDERICK BALSIR CHATTERTON was an alert, aggressive, but not over-successful British theatrical manager. It was his aim, of course, to "give the public what it wants," but he seemed to lack the faculty, which many common and vulgar men possess, of exactly gauging the public taste.

There can be no doubt that the sentiments uttered by Dr. Frederick M. Warner of the Charity Hospital and by Dr. Shearer of Baltimore, on their arrival Monday from Germany, expressing strong opinions in favor of smaller and less frequent doses of Dr. Koch's lymph than those which have been usually administered in this city, have created a decided sensation, both in the ranks of physicians and laymen.

--------
532-> THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR.
Those charitable organizations that depend upon voluntary contributions labor under a double embarrassment this year. "Hard times" increase the needs of the poor and diminish the gifts of the rich. Charity is classed with the luxuries by many worthy persons, and it is in that class of expenditures that retrenchment begins when the pinch of a financial stringency is felt.

VOLTAIRE'S LOVE OF CHILDREN. -- It will come like a surprise upon some to be told that children were among the most welcome of Voltaire's visitors. His relations with them were especially tender.

541-> LEGALIZING PRIZE FIGHTING.; VIRGINIA OFFERING A "CITY OF REFUGE" TO PUGILISTS.
When, March 6, the Governor of Virginia approved a bill incorporating the Virginia Sporting and Athletic Club, a greater stimulus was given to the deplorable "sport" of prize fighting than it has received in years.

BALTIMORE, May 3. -- The Elk Ridge Fox-Hunting Club has issued invitations for a luncheon, to be given at the Kennels on Saturday afternoon next at 5 o'clock.

How, then, can we say that he is true to nature, when he makes Hamlet or Brutus or Macbeth see ghosts, talk with them, and thereby in all respects believe in them?

SARATOGA, Sept. 20. -- Saratogians are settling down to normal village life and planning industriously for next year's campaign. In addition to the three enterprises noted last week still another improvement scheme is being put on a footing. Saratoga's roadways are a part of her stock in trade, and their poor condition is a cause for comment and complaint. 
--------
601-> WILL HE BE DISCIPLINED?; WHAT THE "STAATS-ZEITUNG" THINKS OF ASSEMBLYMAN SOHMER.
The Stecklers of Stecklerville and their followers have taken no definite steps as yet to "discipline" Assemblyman Sohmer, the Tammany representative from the Tenth District, who had the honesty to vote for the Saxton Ballot Reform bill. The documents sent through the district asking for an indorsement of Senator Roesch's course in opposing the bill and condemning Mr. Sohmer's course by inference were returned to the Steckler Association last night with over 4,000 signatures attached. 
--------
602-> THE SQUADRON AT CORFU; TARGET PRACTICE ON HISTORICAL GROUND. GREAT-GUN AND SMALL-ARM FIRING BY OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SQUADRON OF EVOLUTION.
SQUADRON OF EVOLUTION, CORFU, Ionian Isles, March 30. -- In settling down to some difficult or important undertaking, it is a good thing to gather about one all the necessary material for the labor, exclude as far as possible all disturbing influence, and then give one's self up to uninterrupted effort. The squadron is now carrying out this policy to a letter. 
--------
603-> INDIGNATION IN FRANCE.
PARIS, June 21. -- In the Chamber of Deputies to-day M. Deloncle put an interpellation regarding the British protectorate in Zanzibar. He contended that the Anglo-French declaration of 1862, which contained a pledge of mutual non-interference in Zanzibar and assured the independence of the Sultan, had not fallen into abeyance, and Great Britain, before establishing a protectorate in Zanzibar, must ask the consent of France. 
--------
604-> LOSSES BY FIRE
A fire occurred last night in the Young Men's Christian Association Building at Rockland, M.c., occupied by the Western Union Telegraph Company, Price Robbins, dealers in boots and shoes, and Miss Etta Philbrook, milliner.

--------
605-> LENOX.; MANY SOCIETY ENTERTAINMENTS, NOT WITHSTANDING BAD WEATHER.
LENOX, Mass., Sept. 20. -- This has been another gay week. The tennis tournament, dinner parties, the assembly balls, the Stokes dancing party, the meeting of the archery club, and other entertainments have completely occupied the time of the cottagers every day and evening since Monday. The weather has been the worst possible, as it rained every day up to Thursday, so that driving through the country was next to impossible. 
--------
606-> TO CAPTURE WHALES.; CAPT. WHITELAW'S SCHEME MAY YET COME TO NAUGHT.
It was stated in the Chronicle a few days ago that Capt. Whitelaw, the well-known wrecker, was perfecting an enterprise for the capture of whales in the Gulf of George. This gulf occupies a position between Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia. It is under the control of the Dominion Government, which in years past has let it out as a whaling ground to various parties. 
--------
607-> A GALA WEEK AT THE PIER.; ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH HARDLY GAVE THE VISITORS BREATHING TIME.
NARRAGANSETT PIER, R.I., Aug. 23 -- This has been the gala week of the year, and the young and giddy Pierites have been well-high distracted in their attempts to occupy two places at the same time. The third subscription hall came off Monday in the Casino, but the dancing was mild, for the lucky ones were storing their energies for the Dunmere reception the next night. 
--------
608-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
It is to be hoped that the rumor is baseless which attributes to the Administration the intention of bestowing upon Gen. MAHONE the Consulate General at Paris. This is to be hoped in the interest of public decency and of the national character, for it will not make any great difference in the public judgment of the Administration. 
--------
609-> PUSHING TARIFF REFORM; EFFECTIVE WORK OF THE INDIANA LEAGUE. BRANCHES TO BE ORGANIZED IN EVERY TOWNSHIP -- CLEVELAND AS THE LEADER OF THE MOVEMENT.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 21. -- The Indiana Tariff Reform League, organized last March, met in this city to-day. The impression was general over the State that the annual meeting was not to be held until March 4, one year from the date of the organization of the league. The constitution, however, provides that the meeting shall be held on the third Tuesday in January of this year, thus giving rise to some confusion. 
--------
610-> TOWN CLERK HALSEY DID IT; WITHOUT HIS AID THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO GIN MILL. ADJT. GEN. PORTER DENIES THAT HE SANCTIONED OR EVEN HEARD OF THE "CANTEEN" -- A HOT NIGHT.
PEEKSKILL, July 9. -- The further investigation is made into the circumstances attending the establishment of a liquor saloon in close contiguity to the State Camp of Instruction, the more significant appears the true inwardness of that peculiar transaction. The Board of Excise of the town of Cortlandt is composed of three members.

611-> SERMONS IN BRICKS.; CATALOGUE OF THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS IN THE KOUJUNJIK COLLECTION OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM. By DR. CARL BEZOLD. London: LONGMAN, GREEN & CO. 1889. Vol. I., 8vo, 420 pages.
It is now a little over forty years since Sir Henry Austen Layard began his remarkable excavations in the mounds of Mesopotamia. His second expedition (1849-51) was devoted almost exclusively to the huge mound Koujunjik, on the Tigris, directly opposite Mosul, and it was here that he made his most extensive discoveries. 
--------
612-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The bids of the electric-light companies for furnishing light to the city, which were opened on Friday, were found to be uniformly about 20 per cent. higher than the charges of last year. Doubtless the inference of Mayor GRANT that the companies had combined to put up the price was justified. 
--------
613-> NO BARS IN BOSTON.
BOSTON, May 20. -- The warning of the Board of Police to the liquor dealers against having any open bars after May 19 was apparently sufficient, for not a dealer could be seen selling over a bar to-day. In every case waiters were on hand ready to go behind the old bar, unless that had been removed, and get the liquors for the customers seated at the tables. 
--------
614-> PRINCETON COLLEGE.
PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 20. -- It has been customary with Princeton professors no less than with the students, to lay aside to a great extent their cumbrous volumes during the Summer months and enjoy a genuine vacation. This has by no means been an exceptional year. 
--------
615-> NOT A DOLLAR FOR PARNELL.; PHILADELPHIA'S CONTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT GO TO IRELAND AT PRESENT.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 9. -- When Dillon and O'Brien, the Irish envoys, were here all was happiness and harmony with the Irish Leaguers. It had been arranged among them that all the money raised should be sent by draft to Dr. Joseph E. Kenny, M.P., and Alfred Webb, M.P., the Treasurers of the Laud League funds. As is well known, the meetings in this city were very successful. 
--------
616-> TREASURER BOYER INDIGNANT.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 9. -- State Treasurer Boyer, in talking of the Delamater failure prior to his visit to Meadville, said: "I felt shaky about the Delamater deposit. It wasn't that I was afraid they were going to fail, but I didn't think it was wise to let them have the money without my bondsmen being fully protected. 
--------
617-> A DEFEAT FOR RECEIVER GRAY.; HE CANNOT SUE THE OXNARD BROTHERS COMPANY.
The suit of Henry Winthrop Gray, receiver of the North River Sugar Refining Company, against the Oxnard Brothers Company, sugar refiners, was up before Judge Ingraham, in the Supreme Court, yesterday, on a demurrer interposed to the complaint on the ground that the defendants were defective parties; that the receiver did not have the capacity to sue, and that there was not a sufficient cause of action.

--------
619-> Article 28 -- No Title
A CHINESE TELEGRAPHIC OFFICE. -- As usual in all officially conducted enterprises in China, (and the Chinese Government acknowledges no union of capitalists for large enterprises apart from official management,) little encouragement is given to the general public. In the case of the telegraph, the charges are high, averaging about one shilling a word, more or less, according to distance.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. 6. -- Miss Jessie Preston and George A. Draper were married to-night at the home of the bride's Parents on West Third Street.

Ward of the Episcopal church officiated. 
--------
621-> A SEASON OF BAD STORMS; THE WIND PLAYS HAVOC IN EASTERN AND WESTERN STATES. A YACHT AND THREE LIVES LOST AT ROUSE'S POINT -- GREAT DAMAGE AT CLEVELAND AND OTHER PLACES.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 9. -- The windstorm which swept this city last evening was perhaps the most severe as regards destruction to property ever experienced. The advance of the storm seemed to be a number of sharp, quick gusts of wind, that rocked chimneys, blew down trees, and sent everything movable through the air. 
--------
622-> Article 4 -- No Title
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., Aug. 9. -- The men on the Poughkeepsie way freight trains have all left and the coal handlers in the yards have struck. There have been two meetings of the Poughkeepsie Knights of Labor to-day, but nothing definite can be learned as to the result. 
--------
623-> SIR GEORGE STOKES ON PERSONAL IDENTITY.
The recent address of Sir GEORGE STOKES on "The I" has called forth an immediate response which indicates that he has touched upon a vital issue. He undertook to ascertain in this remarkable inquiry wherein is the personal identity or essential part of man. He could not find it in the body, which is material, nor in the psychic existence. 
--------
624-> OUR STEEL SHIPS OF WAR; RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE SQUADRON OF EVOLUTION. THE MODERN UNITED STATES NAVY REGARDED EVERYWHERE WITH INTEREST AND ADMIRATION.
With the separation of the Yorktown from the squadron, of evolution at St. Vincent June 7 a first chapter of the development of our new navy may be considered as closed. To Europeans, with their constant readiness for war, with their great battle ships, heavy armor and ordnance, the squadron, composed not of armor-clads, but of cruisers, has not in itself proved a formidable sight. 
--------
625-> COL. STONE'S QUEER LETTER.; SOME THINK IT IS A DECLINATION AND MANY DO NOT.
PITTSBURG, Pen., June 6. -- Col. W.A. Stone, whose nomination to Congress to succeed Col. Thomas M. Bayne has created such indignation, this evening issued this address to the Republican voters of the Twenty-third District:

NEW-BRUNSWICK, N.J., Sept. 20. -- Already there have been eighty-four applications for admittance to the Freshman Class of Rutgers College, the largest in the history of the institution. 
--------
627-> EFFECTED BY "INFLUENCE."; THE TWENTY-SECOND'S ARMORY DEVOTED TO AN IMPROPER USE.
The summary transfer of the Twenty-second Regiment from its adequately-equipped quarters in Fourteenth-street to the unfinished armory building on the Boulevard, at Sixty-seventh and Sixty-eighth streets, in older to make room for the holding of a fair for the benefit of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Home, calls for investigation at the hands of the military authorities at Albany. 
--------
628-> WESTWEGO LEVEE GIVES WAY.; THE BREAK IS IN A BAD PLACE AND IF NOT CLOSED SOON WILL STOP TRAVEL.
NEW-ORLEANS, May 3. -- About 9 o'clock last night the Westwego Levee, in Jefferson Parish, opposite the city of New-Orleans, and just at the upper end of the town of Gretna, gave way. The crevasse soon increased in size until it was 40 feet wide and between 5 and 7 feet deep. The Southern Pacific Company soon had men on the scene and worked hard on it all night. 
--------
629-> PROGRESS OF ELECTORAL REFORM.
Of the nineteen votes cast for the Saxton Ballot Reform bill in the Senate on Wednesday two were those of Democrats -- AHEARN of this city and CHASE of Albany. Two Republicans, ERWIN and SHEARD, and one Democrat, MCNAUGHTON, were absent, and Mr. LINSON, Democrat, refrained from voting on the avowed ground that he did not wish to go upon record as opposing ballot reform.

630-> WHAT FORAKER REFERRED TO.; THE WAR DEPARTMENT'S CIRCULAR REGARDING STATE MILITIA.
CINCINNATI, Feb. 20. -- The Commercial Gazette this morning publishes the War Department circular referred to in Gov. Foraker's interview sent from here in last night's Associated Press dispatches, which the Governor also referred to in his speech at the armory last Saturday night, and which called forth a reply from Adjt. Gen. Kelton last Monday night. Here is the circular: 
--------
631-> THE EGYPT BURNED AT SEA.; NEWS OF THE LOSS OF ANOTHER NATIONAL LINE STEAMSHIP.
LONDON, July 23. -- The Dutch steamer Spaarndam, Capt. Boujer, from New-York, July 12, for Boulogne and Rotterdam, passed the Isle of Wight to-day. She signaled that the National Line steamer Egypt, Capt. Sumner, from New-York, July 10, for Liverpool, had been abandoned on fire at sea, and that her crew were on board the British tank steamer Manhattan, Capt. Robinson, from New-York, July 9, for Hull, and would be landed at Dover.

632-> FOR NEW-YORK HARBOR.; CONGRESS COMING TO THE CITY'S RELIEF -- A CRY FROM FARMERS.
WASHINGTON, April 19. -- Secretary Proctor has sent to the House of Representatives the draft of a bill to amend the act to prevent obstruction and injurious deposits within the harbor and adjacent waters of New-York City by dumping or otherwise.

633-> Article 4 -- No Title
OGDEN, Utah, Dec. 9. -- About ten days ago the Union Pacific discharged three men from the night force of switchmen in the yard in this city. The result was a strike of the night men. Last Sunday a committee of the strikers visited General Manager Resseguie, but received no satisfaction, and yesterday the entire force of union and non-union men went out and not a wheel turned in the yards. 
--------
634-> THE FUTURE OF HOME RULE.
There is matter enough for amusement and also for exasperation in the history of the Irish Parliamentary Party since the judgment against PARNELL was delivered, but the uppermost feeling, not only among the special friends of Ireland, but among all humane persons and believers in progress, must be one of profound melancholy. 
--------
635-> WILL OBJECT VIGOROUSLY.
The people of Hempstead, L.I., do not like the idea of the Brooklyn Water Works invading their town. The officers of the town have written a communication to Mayor Chapin relative to the extension of the conduit from Rockville Centre to Massapequa. They speak plainly, and the courts may be appealed to. The town claims that the water streams are the town's alone, and in the communication sent Mayor Chapin The Town Board says:

GOOD-BYE TO HIS CORREGIO AND TITIAN. One day I was walking in the new apartments of Mazarin's palace, (it is the large gallery which runs along the Rue Richelieu, and which led to his library.) I was in the small gallery wherein there was a piece of tapestry which represented the life of Scipio. 
--------
637-> ERRATIC MISS COFFIN.; HER MOTHER PETITIONS TO HAVE HER DECLARED INSANE.
The question of the sanity or insanity of Miss Harriet E. Coffin, the young woman who attained considerable notoriety by her pursuit of Kyrle Bellew, was the subject of an investigation by Justice Cullen and a jury in the Supreme Court, Brooklyn, yesterday. The matter came up on an application by Mrs. Coffin to have her daughter declared insane, so that a commission of her person and estate could be appointed. 
--------
638-> THE NEEDS OF WEST POINT.; ECONOMY THAT IMPERILS THE LIVES OF CADETS. OLD GUNS THAT ARE POSITIVELY DANGEROUS TO THE CADETS -- CREDITABLE PONTON BRIDGE BUILDING.
WEST POINT, N.Y., June 7. -- Soon after 9 o'clock this morning a battery of field pieces on the parade began to bark vigorously and set people to wondering what was up. Seventeen times they boomed. "The Secretary of War must have come, for that's his salute," said an artillery officer who had counted the shots. He was correct. 
--------
639-> SHERIFF SICKLES'S TRIALS; HE EXPLAINS THE COMPLEXITIES OF HIS OFFICE. THE POLICE COMMISSIONERS ASKED TO DETAIL FIVE POLICEMEN FOR DUTY IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
Interest in the present condition of affairs in the Sheriff's office was increased yesterday when Gen. Sickles sent the following letter to the Police Commissioners: 
--------
640-> THE SHERIFF AND THE PENAL CODE.
The second presentment of the Grand Jury concerning the administration of the Sheriff's office is a logical supplement to the first. It is not much pleasanter reading for the citizens of New-York than the first, but it is equally wholesome. The first presentment exposed the disease; the second submits remedies. 
--------
641-> STRIKERS MAKING TROUBLE.; PRESIDENT WEIHE OF PITTSBURG UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS MEN.
PITTSBURG, Feb. 21. -- President Weihe of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers is being defied by a Iodge of skilled workers employed at Shoenburger  Co.'s steel works in this city.

642-> THE BARLOW SALE GOES ON; MANY RARE BOOKS OFFERED TO THE BIDDERS. SOME OF THE BARGAINS OF THE DAY -- THE BUYERS AND THE PRICES THEY PAID YESTERDAY.

--------
643-> JIM'S LITTLE BOX TRAP; READY FOR CATCHING LEGISLATIVE GUDGEON. " NEW RULES" TO HELP HUSTED HOLD THE LID DOWN WHILE HE PERFORMS THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY.
ALBANY, Jan. 5. -- There is a grand opening for some independent and fearless member of the Assembly on the Republican side to win what politicians term "imperishable renown" by standing up in his place on the first day of the session and exposing the weaknesses in Gen. Husted's new set of rules, which were snapped through the Assembly of 1889 on the last day of the session. 
--------
644-> OF INTEREST TO SPORTSMEN.; FLOUNDERS AND BLACKFISH ALREADY SHOWING THEMSELVES.
Fishermen in this city who keep posted as to the condition of the inhabitants of the salt water near by were surprised to hear of flounders being caught in Jamaica Bay this week. One, two, and even three pounds were the reported sizes, and they were secured with clam bait. They were even so abundant that two were caught at a time. It is a curious incident of a curious Winter. 
--------
645-> THAT FATAL PORK CORNER.; THE CHICAGO DIFFICULTIES OF SAWYER, WALLACE & CO.
CHICAGO, Sept. 5. -- The history of the attempted pork corner run by Sawyer, Wallace  Co. of New-York, who failed yesterday, is told in a bill for injunction filed by the firm last September.

HALIFAX, N.S., June 21. -- Commander Marquis of the French war ship Indre, now patrolling Newfoundland waters, was asked to-day about the fisheries question. 
--------
649-> SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRACY.; A STATE CAMPAIGN IN WHICH IT WILL BE SERIOUSLY DIVIDED.
CHARLESTON, S.C., Aug. 10. -- There is one new and important feature in the South Carolina political situation which has not yet been fully developed. The State campaign was closed Aug. 5. Then the round of the counties had been made, and in each of them Capt. Tillman laid his claims for election before the people. In nearly every county there has been an actual majority in favor of Tillman at the various mass meetings. 
--------
650-> DEFYING PUBLIC OPINION.
The political issue in this country, as it comes to be more and more clearly defined, is seen to be one that has not been raised before with anything like the same definiteness, even by the nomination of BLAINE. It is in fact the question whether under a free Government and with universal suffrage a party can keep itself in power without regard to public opinion. 
--------
651-> BROOKLYN BRIDGE BLUNDERS.
Brooklyn Bridge affairs have been copiously discussed of late, and yet no mention has been made of a most desirable reform on the Brooklyn side, namely, that the bridge and elevated railways shall be so joined as to exchange passengers on a level. An example of how this can be very badly done is afforded by the connection with the New-York elevated railroad. 
--------
652-> NEWS ABOUT RAILROADS; SOME SOUTHERN PACIFIC STOCK MAY CHANGE HANDS. A REPORT FROM SAN FRANCISCO THAT MRS. HOPKINS-SEARLES WANTS TO SELL OUT HER INTERESTS.
A report comes from San Francisco that an appraisement of the Southern Pacific Railroad property is soon to be made at the instance of Mrs. Hopkins-Searles, who is said to be represented by the law firm of Butler, Stillman  Hubbard of this city. It is current gossip in San Francisco that Mrs. Searles wants to sell her stock in the railroad and put her money into securities with coupons attached to them.

653-> WILLIAM D. WIMAN MARRIED.
MOLINE, Ill., Oct. 8. -- The wedding of Miss Anna Deere, eldest daughter of Charles H. Deere, of Moline Ill., and William D. Wiman, son of Erastus Wiman, the well-known New-York financier, was solemnized in the Congregational church at 7 o'clock this evening. It was a brilliant affair. The service was celebrated by the pastor, the Rev. Mr. Morgan. 
--------
654-> TROTTING AND RACING.
PHILADELPHIA, May 21. -- There were three excellent contests between the trotters and pacers at the Driving Park this afternoon. The number of fast heats shows that the old Point Breeze track has been greatly improved and the horses were not at all hindered by the fact that the course was a sea of mud yesterday, for the wind and sun dried it up thoroughly. 
--------
655-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
Frederick Nauglo, the bookkeeper for Ransom Parker, Jr., who did business as the Commonwealth Ice Company, proved to Justice McMahon by his books in the Yorkville Police Court yesterday afternoon that the $116 he had obtained by indorsing a check payable to the company had been spent in paying the company's bills. 
--------
656-> THE CONNECTICUT PROBLEM.; TROUBLE ARISING FROM THE MARKED BALLOTS IN BRIDGEPORT.
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 7. -- On the marked ballots cast at Bridgeport hangs the election of a Governor of this State. It is certain that the Democratic Senate will not take a step toward a joint convention of the Legislature until the Bridgeport issue is determined by the court. The controversy, if the Republicans decide to press it, will involve the Legislature in the gravest responsibility that has fallen on that body in years. 
--------
657-> TO-DAY'S RACES.
The first half of the Fall meeting of the New-Jersey Jockey Club will be brought to a close this afternoon with the usual card of six races. The entries and weights for the several events are as follows: 
--------
658-> YALE WINS AT FOOTBALL.; HER TEAM SCORES ITS SECOND VICTORY AGAINST WESLEYAN.
MIDDLETOWN, Conn., Oct. 8. -- Yale defeated Wesleyan here to-day at football by a score of 34 to 0, but as two of Wesleyan's best players were unable to take part in the game the victory was not so overwhelming as it seems. Wesleyan played a good game, bat Yale's rush line was the heavier and her team excelled in interference. Yale's team showed up poorly, her rush line being weak. 
--------
659-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The new Ballot act which has been passed by the New-Jersey Legislature differs materially from any of those that have been adopted in other States. While it is a half-way sort of a measure, it is a great improvement upon the present election laws of that State. In the first place, it provides for a general registration, with an equal division between the two political parties of the registration boards and the officers of election. 
--------
660-> THE SOUTHERN QUESTION REPEATED.
It is evident that there is to be a determined push to make the Force bill the chief issue in the approaching Congressional elections, whether it passes or not. It has already been placed above the Tariff bill, and, of course, far above the Silver bill, in the order of importance by the course of the party leaders. 
--------
661-> POLITICAL NOTES.
For the use of the negro voters of the Second Arkansas District a greenback ticket was provided. It was a handsomely-lithographed greenback, its centre a vignette of the late Judge Benjamen, who was murdered in October, 1888, and is exploited by Arkansas Republicans as a martyr. The ticket bears upon its face the following: "Election, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 1890. 
--------
662-> A GOOD WORD FOR THE MUGWUMPS.
Our usually sagacious contemporary, the Atlanta Constitution, advises Mr. Cleveland to "cut loose from the Mugwumps." This gives a wrong idea of the relationship. Mr. Cleveland has no absolute authority in the matter. It was not he who attached himself to the Mugwumps, but they who attached themselves to him. He hasn't the power to do what the Constitution asks except at the price of self-stultification. 
--------
663-> WILL INVESTIGATE BIGLIN'S EXPRESS.
Col. Weber returned from Washington late Friday evening, and was at his post at the Barge Office yesterday. He said that he would thoroughly investigate the charge that Bernard Biglin's employes had broken open the baggage of immigrants and had stolen their goods. The Colonel thought it quite possible that in the confusion of handling the baggage some articles might have been broken open accidentally. 
--------
664-> AMERICAN ACTORS IN LONDON.
The fourth London engagement of the actors of Daly's Theatre will close with this weak. Since the beginning of June they have occupied the stage of the Lyceum Theatre, the scene of the triumphs of HENRY IRVING and ELLEN TERRY, and their performances both of modern light comedy and Elizabethan drama have been liked and honestly praised. 
--------
665-> THE CARTRIDGE EXPLODED.; A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AT FORT WADSWORTH -- ONE MAN KILLED.
Five men were at work in one of the casements of the lower Fort Wadsworth, on Staten Island, at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon preparing cartridges for use on United States ships of war.

NEW-HAVEN, Jan. 21. -- The Junion promenade of the Yale students was held at the Union Armory this evening, and it was admitted by all to exceed any previous event of the kind in point of attendance and enthusiasm, as well as in financial success. 
--------
668-> SALES OF STOCK YARDS.; RUMORS THAT CHICAGO CATTLEMEN ARE THINKING OF GOING WEST.
CHICAGO, June 21. -- It is not exactly clear to a good many who have looked into the matter why owners of stock yards stock, paying all the way from 6 to 15 per cent. on the capital invested, should be so willing to sell out. 
--------
669-> OBESITY AND LA GRIPPE; TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE ACADEMY OF MEDICINE. SEVERAL WAYS OF GETTING RID OF SUPERFLUOUS FLESH -- DR. LOUISE F. BRYSON ON THE INFLUENZA.
There were two subjects which came before the section in practice of medicine of the New-York Academy of Medicine last night which are of great interest to the community at large. The first thing talked about was the "Physiological Treatment of Obesity," and the result was that most of the stout physicians of the town assembled to hear Dr. Walter Mendelson tell about it.

BRADFORD, Penn., Sept. 21. -- It is expected that ex-Senator Emery's address, which is to be delivered in the Opera House in this city next Friday evening, will have an important influence upon the candidacy of Mr. Delamater for the Governorship of this State. 
--------
671-> THIS DAY MAY SETTLE IT; THE CENTRAL WILL TRY TO RESUME FREIGHT TRAFFIC. STRIKERS' ATTEMPTS TO ARBITRATE REJECTED BY THE ROAD -- PASSENGER TRAINS MOSTLY RUNNING.
This morning the officers of the New-York Central Railroad propose to resume freight traffic from the yards on the west side of the city. If they succeed in this, it means that the strike, which has already shown such marked signs of petering out, is a positive failure and that the yardmen and switchmen must either confess themselves beaten or call upon other associations of railroad men to come to their support. 
--------
672-> FORCE TO ASSIGN.; FAILURE TO MONROE ECKSTEIN AND LEOPOLD WERTHEIMER.
Monroe Eckstein and Leopold Wertheimer, brewers, doing business under the name of Monroe Eckstein at Four Corners, S.I., rated by Bradstreet at $500,000 to $1,000,000, acknowledged their inability to meet their obligations yesterday.

ST. LOUIS, March 7. -- Late this evening Treasurer Noland sent his resignation to the Governor. He says: "I do this in order that complications may be removed, and that I may give the people my side of the story. I shall consult my attorney and will have my statement ready to-morrow."

ALBANY, Jan. 21. -- The Court of Appeals. First Division, to-day handed down the following decisions:

675-> MR. DALY HOME AGAIN.; HIS SUCCESSFUL LONDON SEASON AND HIS PLANS FOR THIS WINTER.
Mr. Augustin Daly returned from England last night on the Umbria. He was accompanied by Mrs. Daly and Miss Ada Rehan. Mr. Daly is in excellent health. He has gained materially in weight and his complexion has a ruddy glow, which is quite foreign to its general appearance. 
--------
676-> RACE ON JAMAICA BAY.; THE BAYSWATER YACHT CLUB'S ANNUAL REGATTA SAILED YESTERDAY.

Clinton G. Reynolds, the lawyer who was shot by young Alphonse Joseph Stephani last Thursday, died yesterday morning at the Chambers Street Hospital.

The former remained within call later, while the two young men retired for much-needed rest.

678-> GLEASON MEETS HIS MATCH.; A LONG ISLAND CITY TEACHER WHO WOULDN'T BE BULLDOZED.
" For two pins I'd throw ye out the window, neck and heels, so I wud," said Long Island City's 250-pound Mayor, Patrick Gleason, to Principal Burdick of the First Ward School of that delectable suburb of Brooklyn, last night, just before the meeting of a committee of Long Island City's Board of Education, which is investigating certain charges against the Principal that have been made by the Mayor.

CHICAGO, Nov. 22. -- Chairman Finlay of the Western Passenger Association is now industriously calling the attention of his association to the fact that several lines are paying commissions to Thomas Cook  Son of New-York in direct violation of the agreement.

The Republicans of Ohio go in considerable awe of the eleventh commandment, which enjoins upon the breakers of the other ten not to be found out. When one of them violates this commandment, his fate is like that of the wounded shark, of which the unwounded sharks leave not one fin upon another.

681-> BELDEN'S INSOLENT LETTER; IT CREATES MUCH AMUSEMENT FOR SENATORS. WHAT A REPUBLICAN EDITOR SAYS OF THE CONGRESSMAN'S EFFORT TO DIRECT THE REPUBLICAN PRESS.
WASHINGTON, July 10. -- While the Republican Senators have been inclined to resent the appearance on their floor of the messengers of the "boss" of the House, bringing hourly reminders from Mr. Reed of the importance of taking up the Election bill immediately, they have for a time forgotten their resentment and given themselves over to the enjoyment of "Boss" Belden in the attitude of an assistant leader.

682-> TERRIBLE FIGHT WITH NEGROES.; HEADS BROKEN AND BLOOD SHED FREELY ON A TRAIN.
WHEELING, West Va., July 10. -- A dispatch from Bromwell, Mercer County, says there is great excitement throughout the mining region growing out of a terrible riot on the night of July 6 on the line of the Bluestone Branch of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, and that further trouble may occur at any time.

CHICAGO, Feb. 6 -- Senator R.F. Pettigrew of South Dakota was in the city to-day, and vigorously denied the destitution stories which have been published in the Chicago papers about the people of his State. He said the reports from first to last were malicious and without any foundation in truth. They were written for the purpose of keeping money away from South Dakota and accomplished that purpose.

684-> BRITISH SHIPS IN THE CANALS.; A FORMIDABLE FLEET THAT COULD BE MASSED ON THE LAKES.
A propos of the showing in THE TIMES of a recent date that none of the vessels of the new navy, save the torpedo boat Cushing, is capable of passing through the Canadian canals on their mean displacement draught, it is of interest to know how many war ships Great Britain can pass into the great lakes in anticipation of trouble with the United States.

CHICAGO, Dec. 24. -- Miss Mary Patrice Whitebeck, an actress, playing in "The Midnight Call" at one of the theatres here, is the plaintiff in a breach of promise suit for $20,000 begun to-day against A.P.

Some interesting experiments concerning the transmission of tuberculosis, or consumption, from animals to man have recently been made by a professor in the University of Pennsylvania.

BOSTON, Feb. 6. -- The New-England Amateur Rowing Association at its eighth annual meeting last night in the Revere House had a very lively time. Its President, E.P.

Eugene Field writes that at a lunch given recently by Mr. J. IL Osgood at the Century Club, London, the chief dish was corned beef hash, which was devoured' with great gusto.

We recently mentioned the rcdiction of the President of the Farmers' Alliance in Georgia that the farmers would liil the House of Representatives with advocates of the Agricultural Sub-Treasury bill if the present members should not pass that measure.

696-> CANOEING IN ROUGH WATER.; UPSETS NUMEROUS AT THE RACES OFF BATH BEACH.
The beautiful grounds of the Marine and Field Club along the water front at Bath Beach, L.I., contained many visitors yesterday afternoon who had come to see the annual canoe regatta of the club. The races of the day were sailed under difficulties, owing to the strong sweeping wind that came in from the west across Gravesend Bay and the rough condition of the water.

701-> WHY BUTTERFLIES ARE GAY.; THE COLOURS OF ANIMALS. Their Meaning and Use, Especially Considered in the Case of Insects. By EDWARD BAGNALL POULTON, F.R. S. New-York: D. APPLETON & CO. 1890.
It would have been better had Mr. Poulton been content with a title less general than "Colours of Animals," for readers are sure to demand too much from so comprehensive a term. Some may even expect to learn the latest ideas concerning the coloring of human beings, and be disappointed at the meagre and incidental mention of this important question.

702-> YOU WILL HAVE TO MEET THEM.
Supervisor of Census Charles H. Murray has begun to swear in the small army of enumerators who, June 2, will begin to make life a burden to the people of this city by ringing door bells and asking questions, some of which would be considered decidedly impertinent were it not that they are indispensable to the compilation of that prospective boon to public speakers -- the eleventh census.

Justice Andrews of the Supreme Court yesterday handed down a decision in the test suit of William Van Valkenburg against Controller Myers for a mandamus to compel the Controller to pay him weekly under the weekly payment law.

One of the oddest things about the upset of the Republican Party on Tuesday is that nobody seems to have taken the trouble to ask the President of the United States what he thought about it.

705-> RICHFIELD SPRINGS GAYETIES.; MUSIC AND GERMANS AT THE HOTELS -THE COACHING PARADE.
RICHFIELD SPRINGS, Aug. 23. -- The last has been a week of small sports, with but one crowning event, the Spring House german. The present rage is for music. Concerts, like meals, are served at least three times day with plentiful bites between in the way of musical lunches. Music is as much the theme here as ever philosophy was at Concord.

706-> SUFFERING IN OKLAHOMA.; PROVISIONS, SCARCE AND SETTLERS IN DESPERATE NEED OF ASSISTANCE.
TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 9. -- The press dispatches in relation to the destitution in Oklahoma did not tell half of the story of the suffering and want of the poor settlers in that cheerless region. Snow five inches deep covers the entire country, where hundreds of children are barefooted and only half clad. J.C. Strong, who lives near Kingfisher, came here to-day to solicit aid for his suffering neighbors.

LEBANON, Ohio, March 8. -- The entire town to-night is talking of the heavy sentence given ex-Auditor Graham to-day by Judge White. Graham, the once dashing auditor of Warren County, stood up in a brand new and faultlessly fitting suit of clothes this morning and took his medicine without a murmur.

714-> RIGHTS OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
Nobody in these days disputes the right of workingmen to organize for the protection and promotion of their own interests, and few deny the benefit which they may derive from organization. The time has gone by when labor is to be treated as a mere commodity, like the raw materials of manufacture, to be obtained at the lowest possible price under relentless competition, and used for money-making purposes by employers according to their own discretion.

In the past what a general public required of a traveler was in a measure limited. Push, courage, and endurance, with a fair, lively style in describing what he had seen sufficed. To-day, in addition to certain physical and mental traits, a great deal more is wanted. The traveler must be a very well-rounded and grounded man.

719-> THE NEW ARMY LAW.
The measure which Congress has enacted for the decrease of desertion is the most comprehensive ever undertaken for this purpose. It multiplies the risks of capture, takes away certain causes of discontent, and adds to the motives for faithful service. Instead of trusting only to the military authorities for overhauling the fugitive soldier, it empowers United States Marshals and their deputies, Sheriffs and their deputies, constables, and police officials to arrest him.

Mark Twain does not bear with equanimity the discomfiture of a legal overthrow.

722-> THE SEASON OF SMALL FRUITS.; WHAT CAN NOW BE HAD IN CHERRIES STRAWBERRIES, AND RASPBERRIES.
Rain fell throughout the Hudson River Valley nearly every day last week, and consequently no cherries came from there in good condition. Very few growers attempted to gather any. There would have been half a crop only from the Upper Hudson had the weather been favorable, but the rains destroyed all except the very late varieties before they could ripen.

RICHMOND, Va., July 24. -- The Force bill still continues to be the absorbing topic in this city, while the conservative sentiment is overwhelmingly opposed to any boycott of the North. It seems to be the general idea that the enactment of the proposed law is certain to bring about far-reaching political results in the South.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 8. -- It will not be the fault of the Republican Congressional Committee if the father of the McKinley tariff act is not returned to the Fifty-second Congress. The committee is devoting special attention to the gerrymandered district, believing that to re-elect McKinley under existing circumstances will be worth more to the party than the return of any other dozen Republican Representatives.

" There are doctors whose chief prescription," says the London Daily Telegraph, "consists in advising their patients to take walking exercise, from four to six miles every day; yet no physician has yet astonished an invalid by recommending him to walk round Europe.

731-> SUPERNATURAL RELIGION AGAIN.; A REPLY TO DR. LIGHTFOOT'S ESSAYS. By the author of "Supernatural Religion." London and New-York: LONGMANS, GREEN & CO. 1889.
Controversy is in general the least satisfactory kind of reading which one meets with in these days. There is no topic or matter of importance which is not more or less disputed about, and none on which controversialists do not declaim with astonishing vigor that they are right, and that they who differ from them are wrong.

The approaching trial of the cruiser Philadelphia, which was launched last Autumn, becomes the more interesting because her contract substitutes speed for horse power as the guaranteed element which is to earn premiums for excess or forfeit penalties for shortcomings.

We present this morning a carefully-authenticated account of the tripartite agreement between "Boss" CROKER, DE LANCEY NICOLL, and the Wine, Beer and Liquor Dealers' Protective Association of this city in regard to the Tammany candidacy for the office of District Attorney. It is the most disgraceful political bargain which has come to the surface in a long time, and of the three parties to it Mr. NICOLL appears in altogether the worst light.

Dr. Wolfred Nelson, who has spent a number of years at Panama, has just returned from Paris, where he completed a series of investigations concerning the present status of the canal. Dr. Nelson says that the feeling in Paris regarding the Big Ditch is one of profound despair. Le Grand Francais, figuratively, has been dashed from his pedestal, while as President of the Geographical Society of France he no longer presides.

739-> THE THEATRE LIBRE.
The experimental Free Theatre in Paris, upon which a great deal of ill-advised and thoughtless praise has been bestowed by persons who ought to know better, seems to have reached the lowest stage of intellectual and artistic degradation with the production of "L'Honneur," a "comedy" by HENRI FEVRE.

740-> THE JEWELERS AT DINNER; NEW-YORKERS ENTERTAIN VISITING BRETHREN. A BIT OF GOOD-NATURED RIVALRY FOR THE WORLD'S FAIR -- CHEERS FOR EX-PRESIDENT CLEVELAND.
As there has been a great immigration of jewelers into New-York during the last few days to attend the annual trade meetings which were held here Tuesday, what could be more in keeping with the general good-fellowship of the dealers in diamonds and the decorators of the race, as represented by the New-York Jewelers' Board of Trade, to entertain their visitors at Delmonico's last night?

The teams of Indianapolis and Washington have retired from the National League, and, as THE TIMES predicted some months ago, only eight clubs will play for the pennant this year. President Brush of Indianapolis, who has been obdurate for some time past, agreed to accept $30,000 for the club yesterday and to leave the baseball arena.

When the second installment of the charges of Davitt's Labor World against William R. Hoare, the British Consul at this port, were read to that gentleman yesterday he specifically denied every assertion made by Mr. Davitt as to his connection with "Red Jim" McDermott and also as to any knowledge of such a person as Matt O'Brien, for whom he was said to have secured a position in the New-York Post Office through Inspector Newcombe. 
--------
747-> LIVE MUSICAL TOPICS.
That much-debated topic, programme music, has come to the surface again of late, and the everlasting dispute as to the subjectivity or objectivity of music has been reopened. No one can deny the interest which is added to a composition for the average hearer by the application of a "programme." People love to have a peg on which to hang their imaginations.

748-> BARGE OFFICE AFFAIRS.; A BUSY DAY AT THE NEW IMMIGRANT LANDING DEPOT.
The anticipated rush of immigrants which was to put to the test the capacity of the Barge Office did not take place yesterday.

Judge O'Brien of the Supreme Court yesterday handed down an opinion which ought to be interesting reading to New-Yorkers who have long been deprived of their rights to the sidewalks by merchants who seem to think that sidewalks are laid out especially for their use a stands for trucks and teams.

827-> Article 17 -- No Title
LORD PALMERSTON. -- Sir Arthur Helps used always to declare Lord Palmerston to be the most perfect of hosts -- not worrying his guests, not insisting on their seeing interesting ruins or model farms, or even pictures, but taking infinite pains to aid them in doing as they liked in their own way, even studying Bradshaw on their behalf, and adapting domestic arrangements so as to suit their particular plans.

828-> Article 2 -- No Title
TRENTON, N.J., May 5. -- The H.B. Claflin Company of New-York City filed articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State to-day. The firm's places of business are given as Elizabeth, N.J.; New-York City, Manchester, England, and Paris, with the principal office in New-York City. The buying and selling of merchandise and commodities is stated as the business of the firm. 
--------
829-> Article 17 -- No Title
THE TUDOR EXHIBITION. -- In Elizabeth's gallery we come upon times of far greater brilliancy and interest, although the artistic quality of the portraits is far inferior to those of Henry's time. Holbein is gone, and no one takes up his mantle. The favorite Court painter is Zucchero, an excellent painter of tissues, but without a spark of genius. 
--------
830-> DR. CROSBY'S CRITICISMS; FLAWS HE FINDS IN THE EXCISE DEPARTMENT. LIMIT DISCRETIONARY POWER, HE SAYS, AND STIR UP THE POLICE -- THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE.
The Senate Committee on Cities closed its investigation in the Excise Department yesterday and began with the County Clerk's office. The Rev. Dr. Howard Crosby was called by William M. Ivins to give expert testimony in relation to excise administration. At the outset Dr. Crosby in response to Mr. Ivins's question, said: 
--------
831-> A HUNDRED FATHOMS DEEP; RESULTS OF A DIP INTO THE OCEAN'S WATERS. GLACIAL SHELLS AND OTHER CURIOSITIES FOUND -- HARDINESS OF SOME DEEP-SEA DWELLERS.
Probably few persons have ever sailed across the ocean without wondering what is concealed under those deep blue waters. So far as the greatest depths are concerned we are not likely to learn very much; but it is possible to obtain specimens from the bottom at less depths. The results of a "scoop" from a bottom 130 fathoms below the surface are set forth in an interesting manner by a writer in the Edinburgh Scotsman. 
--------
832-> CHINESE LAUNDRYMEN.; THEIR CONSUL WILL PROTECT THEM AGAINST COMPETITORS.
The recent decision by the Master Laundrymen's Association systematically to interfere with the business of the Chinese laundrymen in this city and to do everything in the power of its members to drive the unoffending Chinamen out of the laundry business has provoked this letter from Shen Woon, the Chinese Consul to this port, to Superintendent of the Police Murray. 
--------
833-> BOSTON FULL OF VETERANS; AUSPICIOUS OPENING OF THE GRAND ARMY ENCAMPMENT. PRESIDENT HARRISON ARRIVES ON THE BALTIMORE -- THE STATE RECEPTION -- GEN. ALGER AT SALEM.
BOSTON, Mass., Aug. 11. -- Grand Army week opened here with bustle, excitement, and cool weather. Members of the Department of Information were at their posts all night, and have been of great assistance to the incoming veterans, large delegations of whom arrived in the course of the early morning. The Information Bureau is on the Common, and is in charge of the Sons of Veterans. 
--------
834-> EDWIN BOOTH'S SEASON.; RESULTS OF THE FIRST WEEK OF HIS BALTIMORE ENGAGEMENT.
BALTIMORE, Nov. 8. -- Edwin Booth and Lawrence Barrett closed the first week of their engagement here to-night. The play was "Hamlet," Mr. Booth, of course, playing the title role. It was one of the two Washington nights of the week, and several hundred persons from that city came over on special trains. 
--------
835-> THE LITTLE MARQUIS.
Herve de Nervainville, Marquis de Saint-Laurent, was at once the biggest and smallest landlord of Calvados, the most important personage of that department and the most insignificant and powerless. Into his cradle the fairies had dropped all the gifts of fortune but those two without which the others taste as ashes -- love and happiness. 
--------
836-> RELIGIOUS MANIA THE CAUSE.; MRS. SARAH F. HENSSLER KILLS HERSELF IN A FIT OF INSANITY.
Mrs. Sarah F. Henssler, the widow of Prof. Frederick W. Henssler, committed suicide by shooting herself in the head yesterday morning at 8 o'clock at her residence, 873 East One Hundred and Thirty-fourth Street, while suffering from a sudden attack of religious mania. 
--------
837-> SHERIFF OF HUDSON COUNTY.; THREE CANDIDATES NOMINATED AT HOBOKEN YESTERDAY.
The sting of yesterday's ring convention in Hoboken to ratify Boss Davis's choice of John J. McPhillips, his Under Sheriff, as his successor in the Sheriff's office, was all in its tail. The convention was made up of city and county officials, who all owe their places to the boss's favor, and everything went off according to programme. 
--------
838-> INDEPENDENT COLLEGIANS; NO AMATEUR ATHLETIC UNION FOR THESE MEN. THE INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DECIDES TO RETAIN A NEUTRAL STAND.
The annual meeting of the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America was held yesterday afternoon in the Firth-Avenue Hotel. Action was taken on several matters of general interest, one being in relation to the association's becoming a member of the Amateur Athletic Union, the organization which claims a national jurisdiction over amateur athletics in so far as they do not pertain to rowing, tennis, or bicycling. 
--------
839-> DANIEL DREW'S OLD HOME; THE VILLAGE OF CARMEL AND ITS SURROUNDINGS. DREW SEMINARY AND ITS OCCUPANTS -- A REVOLUTIONARY ROMANCE -- CARMEL'S LAKES AND BUILDINGS.
CARMEL, N.Y., Nov. 8. -- The village of Carmel consists for the most part of a long, shaded street. On the one side lie the waters of a peaceful lake and upon the other stretches a narrow valley. At the lower end of the long street rises a hill, upon the side of which is perched an imposing-looking castellated building. 
--------
840-> Article 15 -- No Title
A CRANBERRY BOG. -- The largest cultivated bog in existence lies about six miles north of Wareham. This bog is 160 acres in extent. Other bogs in the vicinity belong to the same management. These bogs are all as clean as the tidiest garden. The long and level stretches, like a carpet strewn with white and crimson beads, are a most pleasing and novel sight. 
--------
841-> AFFAIRS OF RAILROADS; SECEDERS FROM THE ORDER OF RAILWAY CONDUCTORS. A MEETING TO-DAY IN THIS CITY TO COMPLETE AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION -- GENERAL NEWS.
A meeting will be held at the Coleman House in this city to-day for the purpose of completing the Independent Order of Railway Conductors, which is the outgrowth of the defection from the old organization of railroad conductors. The new order includes the conservative conductors on the Morris and Essex Division of the Lackawanna and the New-York, New-Haven and Hartford Roads. 
--------
842-> INCREASED BY THE TARIFF.
CHICAGO, Nov. 8. -- The Chicago packers of canned meats held an important meeting this afternoon. All the large packers were represented, the object being to consider some action to be taken in view of the increased duties on tin. The meeting was also for the purpose of discussing the possibility of moving the stock yards and plants of the various packing houses. 
--------
843-> EXCESSIVE WATER TAXES.
There is no question that the cost of Croton water should be reduced to the taxpayers from year to year. But the receipts show a remarkable increase. 
--------
844-> HEAR FROM THE COUNTRY.
The caucus of Republican Senators adjourned on Thursday evening, after having appointed a committee of four to study prayerfully some method by which debate on the Force bill can be cut off and the bill passed without curtailing discussion. The committee will not be able to do that, and is not expected to do it. 
--------
845-> PLANS OF THE COUNTIES.; A MEETING OF THE LEADERS -- A PROBABLE CONTEST.
The County Democracy is going to keep right on in business. Its leaders allege that an analysis of election returns shows that there are more than 40,000 Democrats in this city who are opposed to the rule of Tammany Hall, and they think that 40,000 men make a pretty good nucleus for an anti-Tammany Democratic organization. 
--------
846-> THE LONG TARIFF DEBATE; NO VOTE IN THE SENATE PROBABLY BEFORE WEDNESDAY. MORE TIME NEEDED TO TALK OVER RECIPROCITY AND SUGAR -- THE FREE LIST ENDED.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. --Under the agreement made a fortnight ago the Senate should have finished the tariff debate to-day and begun voting on the McKinley bill Monday. The five-minute rule in operation for the last three days has greatly expedited the discussion, but when the Senate adjourned to-night it had not disposed of the sugar schedule and the question of reciprocity. 
--------
847-> THE LINE DRAWN AT FLACK; JUDGES DECLINE TO DRINK TO THE SHERIFF. PUBLIC OPINION OF HIS DOINGS PLAINLY EXPRESSED AT THE SECOND PANEL'S DINNER -- THE SPEECHES.
Only one regret obtains among the people who attended the annual banquet of the second panel of the Sheriff's jury at Delmonico's last night, and that is that a year must elapse before the second panel can hold another banquet. The dinner was excellent in quality and service, the wines were plentiful even for a banquet of the second panel, and the speeches were as light and sparkling as the champagne. 
--------
848-> PRINCETON COLLEGE.
PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 8. -- The second term of Evelyn College will begin Feb. 11, and promises to be the most successful in the short history of Princeton's college for young ladies. President McIlvaine reports thirty-eight students at the college, eighteen of whom reside in the building. Profs. Murray, Schanck, and Osborn and Dr. Rankin, all of Princeton, will deliver lectures during next term at Evelyn. 
--------
849-> A THOUSAND FREIGHT CARS MOVED.; THE LARGEST DAY'S BUSINESS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE STRIKE.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., Aug. 25. -- For the twenty-four hours ending at 9 o'clock to-night more freight trains have passed north and south on the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad than during any previous twenty-four hours since the strike commenced. There were twenty-five trains, some going north and others south, and composed altogether of a thousand cars. 
--------
850-> Article 27 -- No Title
ECCLESIASTICAL CENSORSHIP. -- From the introduction of printing down to the close of the sixteenth century the action of the Church in the matter of press censorship was local. Although Sixtus issued orders from Rome, they were not general orders, but applicable only to such narrow jurisdictions as that of Cologne University. 
--------
851-> Article 10 -- No Title
THE MONGOOSE AND THE RATS. -- Ten or fifteen years ago one or two residents of Jamaica imported this animal from the East Indies with the view of pitting him against the rats, which did enormous mischief in the cane pieces. In attaining this object they were perfectly successful. The mongoose found himself in a land peculiarly adapted to his health and habits. 
--------
852-> ADIRONDACK CATAMOUNTS; AN OLD GUIDE TALKS INTERESTINGLY OF THEM. NOT AS DANGEROUS AS POPULARLY SUPPOSED, BUT THEY CAN SCREAM FEARFULLY.
I have read stories of hunters meeting the catamount (or panther) in the Maine and Adirondack woods. The catamount is always just ready to spring on the lucky or unlucky hunter just as he pulls the trigger, carrying the idea that a catamount is a very dangerous animal to meet. My experience with them gives me a different idea. 
--------
853-> A WEEK'S VITAL STATISTICS.
There were reported at the Health Department last week 671 deaths, 713 births, and 345 marriages, showing an increase of 69 deaths over the preceding week, and 11 above the average for the corresponding week for the last five years. The annual death rate for the past week was 22.49, in an estimated population of 1,648,948, as against 19.06 the preceding week in an estimated population of 1,647,998. 
--------
854-> PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN MANITOBA.
The same question with regard to public instruction that is in agitation among ourselves has arisen in every English-speaking community in which there is a considerable Roman Catholic population. In Australia it was settled some years ago by the withdrawal of all State grants to denominational schools, and with the proviso that the public instruction shall be absolutely secularized. 
--------
855-> HARD LIFE AT TOPOLOBAMPA.; A RETURNED COLONIST TELLS OF SICKNESS AND NEARLY FAMINE.
ABILENE, Kan., Nov. 23. -- A lady of this county, who left here a year ago to join the Topolobampa colony, on the western coast of Mexico, founded by A.K. Owen of New-York, has returned, and tells a narrowing tale of the sufferings of the colonists. After describing the troubles of the trip and the arrival in the harbor of Cinaloa, she says: 
--------
856-> MEXICO MAY RETALIATE.; THE M'KINLEY TARIFF OBSTRUCTS COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE.
CITY OF MEXICO, via Galveston, Dec. 25. -- Money is easy and there is little demand for loans. There have been remarkably few failures during the year, and a small proportion of them were bad ones. THE TIMES'S correspondent has interviewed the leading bankers of the city, who say, in substance, that the country, on the whole, is prosperous. Government revenues are keeping up well and railway receipts are excellent. 
--------
857-> THE "NEW PARTY" IN KANSAS.
The revolt against the Republican Party in the Northwestern States seems to be formidable. It has assumed more threatening proportions in Kansas, perhaps, than in any other State, and yesterday's TIMES contained an interesting account of its progress in that Commonwealth. The movement for a new party seems to be the same sort of movement that has already given rise to so many new parties, and to proceed from the same causes. 
--------
858-> THE CUSHING'S FAST RUN.
WASHINGTON, May 5. -- The torpedo boat Cushing arrived at the Washington Navy Yard yesterday afternoon at 6:30 o'clock, having made the run from New-York in twenty-eight and one-half hours, a performance that beats all previous records for that trip. She used only one boiler, with an average pressure of eighty pounds of steam, and, notwithstanding the weather was thick and heavy made an average speed of fifteen knots an hour. 
--------
859-> CAVALRY FOR PINE RIDGE.; SECRETARY PROCTOR IN CONSULTATION WITH GEN. SCHOFIELD.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. -- Secretary Proctor did not receive any information to-day from the seat of the threatened troubles with the Indians. He had a consultation, however, with Gen. Schofield respecting matters in that section in which the situation was talked over. The regiments of cavalry which it has been decided to send to the Pine Ridge Agency are the Seventh, now stationed at Fort Riley, Kan., and the Sixth, now in New-Mexico and Arizona. 
--------
860-> THE CHARTER OAK STAKE.; SIX CRACK TROTTERS TO COMPETE FOR THE PRIZE AT HARTFORD.
There are three associations at the Eastern end of the Grand Trotting Circuit which are in to stay, namely, these at Hartford, Springfield, and Philadelphia. The Charter Oak Association, at the Connecticut capital, has been making money every year under the management of its keen and capable Secretary, T.O. King, who pinned his faith on stake races and has made them a success. 
--------
861-> PLAINTS OF G.A.R. MEN.; THEY SAY MR. GILROY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST THEM.
The charge has lately been renewed by Grand Army men that veterans who are eligible to municipal appointments are discriminated against by the Department of Public Works in violation of the law, which says that preference shall be given to honorably-discharged soldiers and sailors who are qualified to perform the required work. 
--------
862-> THE OLD WAYS THE BEST; A TALK WITH EX-GOV. PRICE OF NEW-JERSEY. THE STATESMEN OF THE PAST SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY -- ABUSES IN THE LEGISLATURE.
TRENTON, N.J., March 8. -- One of the most quiet and unpretentious and yet interesting men who visit the State capital is ex-Gov. Rodman McCamley Price, who now lives on a farm in Bergen County. He is too modest a man to deal greatly in personal reminiscence, though he evidently has a rich fund of it to draw upon. 
--------
863-> NOTES FROM YALE.; OSBORN HALL, THE NEW RECITATION BUILDING, DEDICATED.
NEW-HAVEN, Jan. 7. -- With the opening of the Winter term at Yale University to-day Osborn Hall, the splendid new recitation building, was dedicated. The meeting was held in the large hall of the building at 9:30 o'clock. The principal feature of the opening was an address by President Dwight, who paid a high tribute to the generosity of the donor, Mrs. Miriam A. Osborn of New-York. 
--------
864-> GOWNS ON AND OFF THE STAGE.
PARIS, Jan. 22. -- The Court world is in mourning, and every day stretches out the official term; aristocracy follows; the results of influenza have been painfully sad. On no side has the official outlook brightened save in Spain, where the Regent might so easily have gone back forever to the mantilla of black cashmere, bordered with crepe, under which she once hid her blonde hair for over three long years. 
--------
865-> THE COSTLY PANAMA CANAL.; NINE HUNDRED MILLION FRANCS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE IT.
PARIS, May 6. -- The report of the special commission sent out by M. Brunet, the liquidator of the Panama Canal Company, to investigate the condition of the canal, estimates that it would cost 485,000,000f. to complete the canal on the lock system. To this should be added 20 per cent. for unforeseen expenses and 29 per cent. for the expenses of management and for interest. 
--------
866-> SOCIALISM IN GERMANY; ALARM CREATED BY ITS INCREASED VOTE. WILLIAM'S COMING CONTEST WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES -- BIGGAR'S DEATH.
LONDON, Feb. 22. -- Everybody has heard the saying, now variously ascribed to a number of wise men, to the effect that when the German proletariat has once decided to rebel there will be an upheaval compared with which the French Revolution was a mere Mardi Gras festival. Recollections of this sinister prophecy have been brought up with sharp emphasis by the news coming in from the Reichstag elections. 
--------
867-> TARIFF AND THE MONEY MARKET.; A BANKER'S EXPLANATION OF THE GREAT DEMAND FOR MONEY.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 25. -- In the course of lengthy interview on the money market and the financial situation, Rufus J. Lackland, President of the Boatmen's Bank and a recognized financial authority, said: 
--------
868-> TWO ENGLISH MEN OF ACTION. PETERBOROUGH. [English Men of Action Series.] By WILLIAM STEBBING, London and New-York: MACMILLAN & CO. 1890.; CAPTAIN COOK. [Same series.] By WALTER BESANT. London and New-York: MACMILLAN & CO. 1890.
Mr. Stabbing, in writing of Peterborough, has conceived discretion to be valor's better part. Peterborough's abilities and services were scarcely understood in his own lifetime, and the lapse of years, so far from helping to make them more clear, has added to the obscurity and intensified the conflict of judgments. 
--------
869-> THE POSTMASTER KILLED.; A MISSISSIPPI REPUBLICAN SHOT BY THE MAN HE SOUGHT TO MURDER.
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 25. -- A special to the Appeal-Avalanche from Carrollton, Miss., says: "A fatal tragedy occurred on the principal business street in this town to-day at 12 o'clock noon, in which John Prentiss Matthews, the Republican Postmaster at this place, was killed by young W.S. McBride, a wealthy and prominent young druggist here. 
--------
870-> PAWTUCKET'S FESTIVAL WEEK.
PROVIDENCE, R.I., Sept. 23. -- Pawtucket today issued its programme of festivities, by which it is proposed to celebrate the centenary of cotton manufacture in this country by Samuel Slater. The date is itself in doubt by nearly a year. The State has dealt very liberally by the little city, which is sometimes carried by its ambition to ludicrous lengths, and even responded to a call for $3,000 additional, after having generously granted $10,000. 
--------
871-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The Aqueduct Contractors' Arbitration bill was hardly recognizable when it came up in the Assembly yesterday. The provision allowing the contractors to get from the city whatever might be allowed by arbitrators appointed in the Second Judicial District had disappeared altogether, and the bill simply provided that the contractors might bring suits against the city and have them tried as preferred causes on the calendar in any part of the State. 
--------
872-> NEW-YORK CHURCH NEWS.; A BISHOPRIC DECLINED -- SEVERAL CHANGES IN PASTORATES.
MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Nov. 8. -- A few days ago the Rev. Charles Scadding, rector of Grace Episcopal Church, this city, received a communication from Bishop Henry C. Potter tendering him a nomination to the House of Bishops for the post of Bishop of Japan. The Rev. Mr. Scadding declined the proffered honor and will remain with Grace Church. 
--------
873-> DOCTRINES OF PRETERITION; THE SUBJECT DISCUSSED BY THE PRESBYTERY. AN INTERESTING DEBATE -- A RUMOR THAT AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO DIVIDE THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT.
There seemed to be a general impression that yesterday's debate at the session of the Presbytery would be livelier than any which had yet taken place. The reports of remarks verging upon personal attacks which had been uttered at Wednesday's session made many people think that there would be still more definite outbreaks in the course of the discussion yesterday. 
--------
874-> OBITUARY.
Raymond Deslandes, the French dramatist, died in Paris, March 20, and his funeral services were held at the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette two days later. He is known in this country principally by his "Antoinette Rigaud" and his association with Sardou in the authorship of "Belle Maman." But in France he has been held in high esteem for many years. 
--------
875-> AN ESTABLISHED MONOPOLY.
The actual driving out of business of a firm of importers of woolens is a novel effect of the McKinley bill. It is, we believe, unprecedented in the history of tariff legislation in this country. The importers in question, Messrs. BERNHEIMER, SON  Co. of this city, explain that they are forced to quit business because there is no longer any profit in handling the goods in which they have hitherto dealt. 
--------
876-> THE CANVASS OF THE VOTES; CHIEF JUSTICE M'ADAM'S VIEWS OF THE LAW'S PROVISIONS. THE COUNT SHOULD BE MADE OFFICE BY OFFICE -- HOW THE POLITICIANS LOOK AT THE QUESTION.
Since the ballet-reform law was passed there has hardly been a point raised regarding its interpretation that is of such general interest to voters as the one raised by THE TIMES yesterday in regard to the method of canvassing the ballots. There have been questions of more vital importance, but the speed with which the votes are canvassed and the results made known is a matter that appeals strongly to New-Yorkers. 
--------
877-> NATIONAL BANKS PRAISED; AN INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN PROSPERITY. ANNUAL REPORT OF MR. LACEY, CONTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY -- SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE CIRCULATION.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24. -- The annual report of Mr. Lacey, the Controller of the Currency, gives the following information in reference to the affairs of national banks, and covers the operations of the bureau for the twelve months ended Oct. 31, 1890: 
--------
878-> CAUCUSED TO DEATH.
The most serious reflection upon the sincerity of the Republicans in the Legislature in dealing with ballot reform is that which was cast upon it by the action of the Republican Senators in caucus on Monday night. The Saxton bill had been changed by the co-operation of its author and representatives of the Ballot-Reform League and of Gov. HILL to a form for which the approval of the Governor was assured. 
--------
879-> MORE TARIFF ABSURDITIES.; METAL DEALERS AND CIGARMAKERS OPPOSE THE M'KINLEY BILL.
SYRACUSE, N.Y., April 22. -- Twenty-five of the leading hardware firms and metal dealers in Central New-York to-night sent a vigorous protest to Congressman J.J. Belden against the outrageous feature of the McKinley Tariff bill, which increases the duty on tinned plate 125 per cent. over the present rate. All but six of the signers of the protest are Republicans, who voted for Harrison and a high tariff. Among other things, they say: 
--------
880-> MINISTER DOUGLAS AT HOME.; HE IS WELL AND TALKS PLEASANTLY OF HIS LIFE IN HAYTI.
On board the Royal Dutch West Indies Line steamship Prins Frederik Hendrik, which arrived here yesterday afternoon from Port an Prince, was Frederick Douglass, who for ten months has had the honor of representing the United States Government as Minister to Hayti. He was accompanied by Mrs. Douglass, and his object in returning to this country was to enjoy a vacation of sixty days. 
--------
881-> THE PRESIDENT'S GUESTS; A STATE DINNER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. MR. HARRISON'S FORMAL ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS CABINET--A CROWDED RECEPTION BY MME. ROMERO.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.--The first State dinner of the season was given to-night by the President and Mrs. Harrison in honor of the Cabinet. 
--------
882-> TURF GAMBLING RUINED HIM.; WILLIAM J. LARD ARRESTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT.
ST. LOUIS, April 21. -- William J. Lard, somewhat known to fame as a crack rifle shot and the winner of several medals, was to-day arrested for embezzlement. He was bookkeeper and handled the funds for Flesh  Mook, painting contractors, having been with them since 1882. He was discharged on March 17, the firm suspecting his honesty. 
--------
883-> Article 22 -- No Title
NOSTRADAMUS. -- Michel Nostradamus was a Provencal physician who died in 1566. He seemed to have been a man of considerable scholarship, and he attained a wide reputation for medical skill. Having settled in the town of Salon, he studied astrology in order to extend his powers in curing man's diseases, and was thus led to practice the seer's craft, beginning in the modest character of an almanac-maker. 
--------
884-> PRINCES INSANE.; INMATES OF THE GRATZ ASYLUM AND THE NATURE OF THEIR DISORDERS.
The Gratz private asylum will soon deserve the name of "Rendezvous des Princes et des Princesses." Poor Prince Pedro or Saxe-Coburg has just been sent there from Cannes. His mania was the fear of poison. He thought the Republicans and the d'Eudists were equally anxious to cut him off. Prince Charles of Lichtenstein will meet him probably in a few days. 
--------
885-> DAN M'CARTHY'S TROUBLES.; A DISCHARGED ACTRESS HAS THE "STAR" ARRESTED IN BOSTON.
BOSTON, Oct. 25. -- A pretty blonde actress is making trouble for Dan McCarthy, star and manager of the "True Irish Hearts" company, which is playing at the Grand Opera House. Miss Florence Hastings was, up to Oct. 6, the leading lady of the company, having, as she says, played for sixty-one performances without a word of dissatisfaction from McCarthy. 
--------
886-> RIGHTS OF THE HOUSATONIC.
HARTFORD, Oct. 25. -- An attempt to foreshadow the character or extent of the railroad legislation that will come up in the next Legislature, which will meet here in January, would be futile at the present juncture. It may be safely stated, however, that the Housatonic Company's contest for the elimination from its charter of the provision that in effect prohibits the building of branch lines will be renewed. 
--------
887-> Article 19 -- No Title
ON BREAKING THE BANK AT MONTR CARLO. -- The most skillfully devised system may prolong the player's agony, and that is all. There is a large class which gains a livelihood by concocting systems and selling them, and in this case the buyers are the persons who, in slang phrase, are really sold. 
--------
888-> VISIONS OF THE KAISER; WHAT HE WOULD EFFECT BY ABSOLUTE POWER. NO OBSTACLES TO BE ALLOWED IN HIS WAY -- THE REICHSTAG, HOWEVER, WITH A WILL OF ITS OWN.
BERLIN, March 8. -- The Government has decided to open the business of the Reichstag with the projects prepared by the Council of State, the foremost of which are bills regulating work on Sunday and restricting the hours of labor of women and children. The more complex measures, relating to the hours of the male adults' and the miners' work day, will be reserved until the Autumn session. 
--------
889-> GOWNS SEEN IN PARIS.
PARIS, Feb. 25. -- Mme. Ludinart has prepared designs for two ball dresses. One -- called the snowball -- is made of an under-slip of white satin, completely covered, except the train, with tulle, tufted by clusters of white cherry blossoms, and the tulle entirely sprinkled with white jet. The tulle jupe is plain, of course, and the satin train very narrow, very short, and plain -- just one breadth, plaited in at the waist. 
--------
890-> AGAINST QUAY AND DELAMATER.; INDEPENDENT REPUBLICANS OF PENNSYLVANIA URGE PATTISON'S ELECTION.
The following appeal, which has been made public in Philadelphia, speaks for itself: 
--------
891-> DEFYING PUBLIC OPINION.; A BALLOT-BOX THIRF DRAWN AS A JUROR IN HUDSON COUNTY.
The discovery was made yesterday in Jersey City that one of the election officers implicated in the Hudson County ballot-box frauds has been drawn to serve on the next pettit jury, and that another was on Thursday last given a position by the Jersey City Tax Commissioners as a clerk for that board.

892-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
Until the new Park Comissioners appointed by Mayor GRANT last week shall have had time to gain some special knowledge of the work they have to do, of the needs of the parks, and of the policy and methods of their more experienced associates in the board, Messrs. GALLUP and HUTCHINS, there will be some apprehension in the public mind lest unwise measures be hastily and inconsiderately adopted. 
--------
893-> HIGH WATER AT PITTSBURG.; MANY STREETS IN ALLEGHENY CITY FLOODED AND DAMAGE FEARED.
PITTSBURG, Penn., March 23. -- The Monongahela River touched the highest notch of the present flood at 2 o'clock this afternoon, when the marks registered twenty-four feet even. The Allegheny River reached the same point a short time later, and is still rising. River men, however, do not anticipate a much higher stage, as it has grown quite cold and the reports from the head waters show the rivers to be stationary. 
--------
894-> A CHURCH ROW IN ORANGE.; MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST CHURCH IN FAVOR OF A DIVISION.
ORANGE, N.J., June 24. -- The Standing Committee of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark met in Newark yesterday, and heard the arguments over the division of Christ Church, East Orange. The applicants were represented by Messrs. P.R. Patriarch and Eugene M. Brewster. Christ Church Vestry was represented by the pastor, the Rev. Horace S. Bishop, S.W. Wittmore, and Frank Kellogg, the curate of the parish. 
--------
895-> GEN. NOYES BURIED.; FOLLOWED TO THE GRAVE BY THE VETERANS OF HIS OLD REGIMENT.
CINCINNATI, Sept. 7. -- The funeral of the late Gen. Edward F. Noyes this afternoon, though conducted with great simplicity, was the occasion of a large and varied attendance. A hymn was followed by the burial reading and a prayer by the Rev. Dudley W. Rhodes, rector of the Protestant Episcopal church on Mount Auburn. Then the march was taken up to the Mount Auburn Presbyterian Church, where the public services were held. 
--------
896-> CONNECTICUT'S CRIMINALS.; THE NUTMEG STATE FURNISHES SOME INTERESTING STATISTICS.
WATERBURY, Conn., Feb. 8. -- During the past fiscal year 7,436 persons were committed to the county jails of Connecticut. An average of 1 person to less than 100 inhabitants of the land of steady habits served time behind iron bars. Classified according to sex, this large criminal population is composed of 6,706 males and 730 females. 
--------
897-> THE COPYRIGHT BILL.
In all likelihood the bill for international copyright will not be called up before the Committee on Patents until Thursday. Those who are watching in Washington are sanguine of its passage, as usual, because its enemies are neither many nor determined. Its danger seems to lie in the apathy of those who have paid little attention to a question which to them appears to have less claims to importance than other matters now before Congress.

--------
902-> PHOTOGRAPHERS AT WORK.; DR. NICHOLS'S SOLUTIONS FOR NEW METHODS OF PRINTING.
Amateur photographers are noticing that there is not nearly so much difficulty in procuring sitters for portraits or permission to "take" objects of interest as there used to be. It was not so long ago that the sight of a black cloth had the same effect as a red one on a bull upon the proprietor of a waterfall or a Summer resort hotel keeper. Now the knights of the camera are welcome almost everywhere. 
--------
903-> TO TICKETS IN THE FIELD.; A LIVELY TIME EXPECTED AT THE HOLLAND SOCIETY ELECTION TUESDAY.

--------
908-> THE RIGHTS OF RESIDENTS.
Residents and property owners in the neighborhood of Forty-fourth Street and Sixth Avenue are engaged in an effort to suppress a nuisance in the shape of a disorderly house which, under the pretense of being a hotel, is the resort of disreputable persons for unlawful purposes. There is no doubt that these residents and property owners have the law on their side, but they appear to be having some difficulty in getting the law enforced. 
--------
909-> BROOKLYN A GOOD FIELD.; THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING OF INTEREST.
Mayor Chapin of Brooklyn has been occupied for several days in preparing answers to the list of questions in regard to the municipal Government submitted by the legislative investigating committee, and the politicians expect the Senators to give Brooklyn an overhauling before they return to Albany. If they do they will find several interesting matters to inquire into. 
--------
910-> A HAT.
There was recently published in the Washington Post a report of an interview with Senator BLACKBURN of Kentucky, in which the Senator recounted an incident in the career of a very eminent hat -- a high hat in every sense of the word -- that is not without a certain interest quite apart from the truth of the story. 
--------
911-> WALT WHITMAN ILL.; TOO MUCH SPRING AIR HAS GIVEN THE POET THE GRIP.
PHILADELPHIA, April 5. -- Walt Whitman has not been out of his quaint little cottage home for ten days. Lying upon his old-fashioned four-post bed in a room strewed with newspapers, periodicals, and proofs, the poet said:

--------
915-> EMPTIED BY ROUGHS.; A GANG OF LAWLESS RUFFIANS DESTROYING PROPERTY.
For several years the owners of property in Sixty-first Street, between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues, have been very much annoyed and subjected to a great deal of expense by the lawlessness of a band of boys and young men who infest that neighborhood. The persons composing the band are not known, but they are supposed to be members of families who formerly occupied buildings on the block and were evicted for non-payment of rent.

917-> CHICAGO PRODUCE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, July 26. -- Provisions, under the stimulus of the excitement and heavy operations in Grain, have become quite interesting from a speculative point of view. Trading to-day was decidedly active at a further sharp advance in prices for everything in the list. Packers were the principal sellers, and they kept feeding the market with product as prices advanced. 
--------
918-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
One day's investigation into the Excise Board is very much like another's. At least the testimony of any one day shows conclusively that the Excise Board, as an instrumentality for investigating drinking places, is a farce and a fraud. What else could be expected of it? Tammany politics and liquor selling are two phases of the same thing, two pernicious industries pursued by the same people.

919-> THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.; WHAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO DO TO RELIEVE IRELAND.
LONDON, Nov. 24. -- The Queen's speech, which will be reed at the opening of Parliament to-morrow, was communicated at to-night's Ministerial dinners. It is of unusual brevity.

At the meeting held on Tuesday evening for that object, under the auspices of the Workingwomen's Society, the wrongs of the shop girl were exhaustively set forth.

--------
922-> SAFE FOR CLEVELAND.
The Democrats elect all of their candidates for Congress in St. Louis, and reclaim their loss of two years ago. It will be safe to put old Missouri down for Cleveland and tariff reform in 1892. 
--------
923-> MORMONS GOING TO CANADA.; THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT.
MONTREAL, Feb. 8. -- The citizens of the Northwestern Territories are becoming alarmed at the prospect of polygamy becoming an institution in their country.

SCRANTON, Penn., Oct. 10. -- James M. Dougherty, the murderer of Dr. Lloyd, was a picturesque character in this section in 1884, when he came out this way to string the wires of the Postal Telegraph Company.

MARBLEHEAD, Mass., Aug. 26. -- To-day the Gossoon won the second race of her series with the Minerva, beating last year's champion in as handsome a race as was ever sailed.

No suspicion of a fluke occurred during the whole race. 
--------
933-> THE STRUGGLE WITH THE STREETS.
Commissioner BEATTLE of the StreetCleaning Department has every appearance of desiring to make a good record with his task of giving New-York clean streets. At all events, he is anxious to be credited with an earnest effort in that direction, for he loses no opportunity to put forward his claim that he is doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances. 
--------
934-> LORENZ REICH'S GOOD WINE.
Apart from the mere question of purity, good wine is, perhaps, a matter of taste; nor is this a matter of fashion, but of good judgment, and if we find that a kind has received the commendation of connoisseurs we may at least try it with confidence. 
--------
935-> COULD NOT STAND SCORN.; DR. SIMON'S ASSOCIATES DRIVE HIM TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE.
Dr. Edward Simon, until recently employed in the editorial department of the New-Yorker Handels-Zeitung, a German commercial and trade paper printed in William Street and owned by Mr. Moritz Meyer of Berlin, tried to commit suicide yesterday.

937-> FIVE LOCAL TEAMS WIN; A GREAT DAY FOR NEW-YORK AND BROOKLYN BALL CLUBS. MUTRIE'S MEN DEFEAT ANSON'S COLTS AND EWING "WHITEWASHES" THE CLEVELANDS -- OTHER GAMES.
Yesterday's game at the Polo Grounds was enough to put enthusiasm into the coldest-blooded of mortals, Nearly 3,200 people were on hand to see Anson and his colts.

MONTREAL, June 8. -- A great sensation was caused here this afternoon in St. Catherine Street, one of our most public thoroughfares and one which usually, on a Sunday afternoon, is crowded with pedestrians.

--------
941-> AMUSEMENTS.
An ingenious, logical, cleverly written one-act play called "After Thoughts," by Augustus Thomas, whose "Man of the World" is so pleasantly remembered, was acted before "A Pair of Spectacles" at the Madison Square Theatre last evening. Nothing could be slighter in texture or less theatrical in quality than this piece, which lacks even the deference to popular sentiment that is shown in Bronson Howard's "Old Love Letters." 
--------
942-> SCOTTISH RITE MASONS.
WASHINGTON, April 22. -- An edict was issued July 25, 1889, by the then Grand Master of Masons of the District of Columbia against the "Cerneau" Scottish Rite Masons for having, as alleged, entered into fraternal relations with the Grand Orient of France,  A second edict on the subject has just been issued by the present Grand Master annulling the former edict and declaring it no longer in force. 
--------
943-> THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.
A number of interesting observations have lately been made on the destructive power of coffee upon various microbes, and they prove that the organisms die in a longer or shorter period. Good and bad coffee produce the same effect. It is held that the antiseptic effect of coffee does not depend on its caffeine, but on the oils developed while roasting. 
--------
944-> POOLS AND TRUSTS.

PEEKSKILL, July 26. -- The members of the Thirteenth Regiment and the First and Second Brigade Signal Corps managed to extract a great deal of pleasure out of their last night in camp, notwithstanding the storm.

--------
947-> IMPROVING TELEPHONE SERVICE.; METALLIC CIRCUITS TO BE GRADUALLY SUBSTITUTED FOR SINGLE WIRES.
Complaints that have been made with increasing frequency of late of imperfect and deficient telephone service have given currency to the rumor that the great switchboard at the Cortlandt Street station had proved a failure, and was to be replaced as soon as the telephone company could get the work done with a new one. On inquiry at the office this explanation is declared to be wrong. 
--------
948-> ACROSS THE EAST RIVER; WHAT SOME OF THE BROOKLYN POLITICIANS ARE DOING. WARD HEELERS OPPOSING THE POLICE JUSTICE BILL -- DO POLICE OFFICERS SELL RUM? -- WORTH'S NEW OFFICE.
From all accounts Gov. Hill is having a hard time trying to convince certain Democratic bosses in Brooklyn that it would be a politic thing to veto the infamous Police Justices bill.

--------
949-> WORK OF THE AMATEURS.; YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHERS BUSY WITH LANTERN-SLIDE PICTURES.
Lantern-slide exhibitions of the pictures of the amateur photographers have become popular as entertainments at e b-rooms and meetings of societies other than photographers.

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 13. -- The fight which ended at Sacramento to-day in the nomination of H.H. Markham for the Governorship, was the most desperate that has been waged within either party in California in the past ten years.

958-> MR. ALDRICH'S "CLOSURE."
Senator ALDRICH of Rhode Island seems to think that he can manage his reputation on the principle of the Sibylline books, the smallest remnant being worth as much as the original stock. When he entered the Senate and for some time afterward, he was looked upon as a man of intelligence, fairness, and a decided tendency to conservative views and behavior.

The hearing given to the representatives of St. Louis by the special committee of the Senate has had the effect of putting the claims of that city to the centennial before the country in a clear and striking light.

WEEDSPORT, N.Y., Sept. 24. -- But few people went to the fair grounds to-day, and it is doubtful if at any one time there were over twelve hundred on the grounds.

--------
966-> MUST LOOK TO THE AGENT.; DETROIT MEN WHO SPECULATED IN LIFE INSURANCE.
From a dispatch in yesterday morning's TIMES from Detroit it is evident that several wealthy gentlemen of that city fell under the spell, about a year ago, of a very plausible insurance agent named S.L.

973-> AID FOR THE OVERWORKED; A FAIR FOR THE TEACHERS' MUTUAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATION. REASONS WHY THE "BAZAAR" SHOULD BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS -- HOW IT WILL BE CONDUCTED.
There are to be several fairs held in this city the coming Winter, all of them for worthy objects, and all of them with attractions of greater or less variety. One of them, however, is to be unique in many of its particulars, especially in the object for which it is to be given. It is a fair in aid of the Teachers' Mutual Benefit Associaton.

974-> UNHONORED FUNERAL GUESTS.; NEGLECT OF KENTUCKY'S REPRESENTATIVES BY CINCINNATI'S MAYOR.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 9. -- Gov. Buckner and staff and 165 members of the Kentucky Legislature went last Friday evening to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of Minister Pendleton.

975-> SWARTHMORE COLLEGE.
SWARTHMORE, Penn., May 24. -- The past week has been a very successful one for athletics at Swarthmore. On the 17th the Spring meeting of the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Athletic Association was held in Philadelphia, and despite the fact that several larger colleges made strenuous effort to secure the prize, the superior training of Swarthmore's athletes told, and for the first time in the history of the college the coveted honor was secured. 
--------
976-> HOME NAVAL MATTERS.
The Government has determined to do away with the Annapolis Proving Grounds, and a deed has just been put on record in Charles County, Md., conveying to the Government 660 acres of land near Indian Head, on the Potomac.

977-> BROOKLYN WINS AGAIN.; THE BRIDEGROOMS AHEAD FOR THE WORLD'S CHAMPIONSHIP.
Brooklyn League players are on a fair road to win another championship. By the most skillful kind of work this Summer they outplayed their opponents in the League and they are engaged in a similar task just now with the Louisvilles, who won the champions of the American Association. The contest is for that title known in baseball parlance as the world's championship.

978-> THE TARIFF IN FRANCE.; PROPOSED NEW DUTIES -- VIEWS ON THE M'KINLEY BILL.
PARIS, Oct. 25. -- The new Tariff bill was issued to the Chamber of Deputies to-day. It dwells upon the tendency toward protection displayed by most nations. It refers especially to the high tariffs of the United States, Canada, and the South American States. 
--------
979-> HUMPHREY KNEW DAGGETT; AND DID NOT WANT HIM AROUND WHERE MONEY LETTERS WERE.
A portion of the time when Fry-the-Fat James P. Foster was President of the National Republican League and A.B. Humphrey was its Secretary the two used to have a regular "cat-and- dog" time of it. This was shown by the evidence given yesterday before Referee L.C. Raegener in the interminable suit which Tallmadge  Martin, printers, have been pressing against the league to collect about $12,000 for printing campaign literature in 1888. 
--------
980-> BRAZIL'S OLD RULER.; BELIEF THAT DOM PEDRO WILL FORMALLY RESIGN HIS CROWN.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. -- In December last, after the revolution in Brazil, and while there was still some doubt in the minds of many Americans as to whether the overturning of the monarchy was to be succeeded by a stable and orderly republic, Senhor Mendonca, in addressing an audience in New-York, ventured the prediction that Dom Pedro, the exiled Emperor, would before many months surrender his sovereignty to the people. 
--------
981-> NOT A NEWSPAPER.; A READER DISCUSSES SOME WEAKNESSES OF "THE EVENING POST."
THE TIMES evidently needs to bear itself with unusual circumspection in these days. The editor of the Evening Post has his glittering eye fixed upon it and any error of omission or commission, whether real or imaginary, is promptly transfixed.

THE LAST PLACE WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD FIGHT. -- Never was a more wonderful mingling of strange elements than in this great temple of the Holy Sepulchre. The Greeks have one portion of it, the Latius or Roman Catholics another, the Armenians a third, and there is also a division, I think, for the Copts. In the holiest sanctuaries of

SIOUX CITY, Iowa, June 25. -- The Republican State Convention was called to order at 11 o'clock by Chairman Pray of the Central Committee. Temporary Chairman S.M.

984-> THE FATE OF RAPID TRANSIT; HAVE HILL AND PLATT COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING? " JOBS" FAVORED BY THE RAILROAD COMMITTEES -- NEW-YORK CITY'S INTERESTS IGNORED.
ALBANY, April 6. -- Have Gov. Hill and Mr. Platt come to an understanding on rapid transit? Has Mr. Platt's modification of the Fassett bill, in the matter of permitting the Governor to name eight Commissioners, (an extraordinary concession on Mr. Platt's part,) been done with a view of placating the Governor and of capturing his approval of the bill?

985-> A CHANCE FOR OUTSIDERS; THE THREAD COMBINATION LOSES A POINTS. HOW THE "BIG FOUR" HAVE MANAGED TO KEEP DOWN COMPETITION -- GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY.
The combination of four of the largest six-cord spool cotton concerns in this country for the purpose of crushing a number of smaller competitors has recently met with a check.

--------
986-> HAPPENINGS AT CORNELL.
The Cornell Glee and Banjo Clubs scored a success in their evening concert. It was the result of hard, constant world. There are better voices in the club than ever before, and the harmony is pleasing and natural. Besides, the programme of songs is selected with better judgment. President Mack deserves generous credit for his well-directed labors for the club.

987-> Article 9 -- No Title
CAN WE INCREASE SPEED IN STEAMERS. -- The possibilities of obtaining an increasing speed with steamships seem, at first sight, as limitless as the ocean on which they float; but, like all else, they must end somewhere. At one time it was supposed that there must be a limit in size, beyond which materials did not exist of sufficient strength to enable steamers to be built. 
--------
988-> ST. GEORGE'S BIRTHDAY.; THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTH ANNUAL DINNER OF THE SOCIETY.
" But in spite of all temptations, he remains an Englishman," was the air that moved everybody's heart at Delmonico's last night, when the St. George's Society sat down to its one hundred and fourth annual dinner. Even the stirring strains that accompanied the triumphant procession of the roast beef failed to make everybody so unanimously cheerful.

990-> PORTER'S LITTLE SCHEME.; A PLAN TO PERPETUATE REPUBLICAN CONTROL WHICH FELL THROUGH.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9. -- Superintendent of the Census Porter seems to have decided, as long ago as when Quay was trying to postpone action on the Force bill in the Senate, that the population of the United States would not exceed 63,000,000. 
--------
991-> THE EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN.
It will be generally conceded that President CLEVELAND'S tariff message was the greatest of all the public services he was able to render. This ought to be conceded quite independently of one's opinions upon the merits of protection or the need of revenue reform. It ought to be conceded by men who believe in high protection, not "for revenue only," nor even from partisanship because it is a part of the Republican creed.

992-> CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
ITHACA, N.Y., Oct. 25. -- The generous gift of the Hon. H.W. Sage and the action of the Trustees in appropriating it for the establishment of the Susan E.

Of course THOMAS C. PLATT understands that the amendment of the Congressional World's Fair bill by making the date 1893 instead of 1892 will release every subscriber to the guarantee fund and diminish by over $5,000,000 the amount now available for fair purposes. Over the agreement printed in the books in which the subscriptions were entered appears the following headline:

MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 23. -- President Miller of the St. Paul Road flatly denies all rumors concerning his retirement from his present position.

What is known in France as the McKinley bill, in reality the Customs Administration bill, has given rise to a great deal of discussion there, which is not fairly represented by the reports that reach us by cable from time to time. It has been very earnest, but it is only fair to note that it has, on the whole, been very dignified, candid, and practical.

997-> BASEBALL NOTES PROTESTED.; A SUIT FOR $2,400 AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE PITTSBURG CLUB.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Aug. 13. -- The Meridian National Bank of Indianapolis to-day entered suit here against W.A.

1001-> LAWYERS AND DOCTORS.; SEVENTH ANNUAL DINNER OF THE SOCIETY OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE.
The Society of Medical Jurisprudence ate dinner last night in the Hotel Marlborough, and it was a very jolly one.

1003-> DR. PHELPS'S EXPERIMENT; IS IT ANYTHING MORE THAN USELESS VIVISECTION? HE HAS ENGAGED IN LIKE ENTERPRISES BEFORE -- VIEWS OF PHYSIOLOGISTS ON SUCH EXPERIMENTS.
In the daily papers of the past week have appeared accounts of an operation performed at Charity Hospital on Sunday, Nov. 16, by Dr. A.M. Phelps. The operation was done upon the shortened leg of a boy of fourteen, and he is presumably to be benefited by the ingrafting of a piece of bone from the leg of a living dog. 
--------
1004-> PROTESTS AGAINST A BOLT.; SENATOR BUTLER'S ADVICE TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATS.
COLUMBIA, S.C., Aug. 26. -- United States Senator M.C. Butler arrived in the city to-day from Washington. He came thinking he might be instrumental in calming the political storm that agitates the State. In view of the eagerness of some extremists for a split in the party, Senator Butler's views will be found interesting. There is no crumb of comfort for the splitters in his words. 
--------
1005-> JUDGE LARREMORE RETIRES; HIS ILL HEALTH FORCES HIM TO SEEK REPOSE. HIS RESIGNATION A SURPRISE -- IT GIVES GOV. HILL A FAT OFFICE TO FILL BY APPOINTMENT.
Chief Justice Richard L. Larremore of the Court of Common Pleas yesterday sent his resignation to Gov. Hill, to take effect Oct. 1. The Governor was informed of the fact by a telegram from Albany announcing that the resignation had been received there.

PORTUGAL IN AFRICA. -- Portugal had a hard fight before she got rid of the last of the Moors, but it left her braced and welded into an independent nation. The famous siege of Centa, in 1415, at which Prince Henry the Navigator sought to win his spurs, was really a test of her strength as a nation for enterprises beyond her own borders. 
--------
1007-> A STRAIGHT TICKET INDORSED; BY A FEW UNENTHUSIASTIC MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL CLUB.
A ridiculous indorsement of the ridiculous Republican straight-ticket scheme was given at the Federal Club last night. It can not be fairly called a meeting of the club. There were not more than twenty-two members present at any time, and there are 150 in the club. The tabled resolution demanding a straight ticket inspired by eccentric Col. E.F. Shepard was called up for discussion as soon as President Charles L. Bidwell took the chair. 
--------
1008-> THE DEVASTATED CITY.; SOMETHING ABOUT ITS PLAN AND ITS FORMER SAD EXPERIENCES.
LAWRENCE, Mass., July 26. -- South Lawrence is the name given to that portion of the manufacturing city of Lawrence lying a distance of twenty-six miles from Boston on the south side of the Merrimac River.

1012-> CLASS DAY AT PRINCETON.; PLEASANT OCCASION IN WHICH FRIENDS OF STUDENTS PARTICIPATED.
PRINCETON, N.J., June 9. -- This was Class Day at Princeton. The exercises were of special interest this year, as the Class of '90, numering 141, is the largest which ever graduated from Princeton College. 
--------
1013-> THE END OF THE STRIKE.
Now that the strike is over, the men who engaged in it may perhaps be willing to listen to reason. If they are not, there ought to be a moral in it which other workingmen will heed, whether or not they happen to be Knights of Labor. It is plain enough that nobody has benefited directly by the strike, except the unemployed men who have found employment filling the vacancies left by the strikers.

A TROPICAL FOREST. -- It is not easy to fix upon the most distinctive features of these virgin forests, which, nevertheless, impress themselves upon the beholder as something quite unlike those of temperate lands, and as possessing a grandeur and sublimity altogether their own. Amid the countless modifications in detail which these forests present we shall endeavor to point out the chief peculiarities as well as the more interesting phenomena which generally characterize them.

When the agents of the carbonate ring of Colorado were demanding that Secretary WINDOM should reverse the old ruling under which silver-lead fluxing ores were admitted free of duty, they declared that a failure to exclude these ores would paralyze the mining industries of the West and Southwest and throw many thousands of men out of work. 
--------
1016-> THE THOMAS CONCERT.
The eighth of the Thomas Sunday concerts, given last evening at the Lenox Lyceum, was at least equal in musical interest to any of its predecessors. The orchestral programme was especially attractive, comprising extracts from Gluck's "Orpheus," which are nearly a novelty as a concert selection and of a very high intrinsic interest, in addition to their unique importance in the history of dramatic music.

OCEAN GROVE, N.J., July 12. -- More tents have been rented here this season than has been customary, but there are still a good many cottages awaiting tenants.

1019-> WAS IT PINKERTON'S PLOT?; THE REMARKABLE STORY TOLD IN COURT BY JOHN REED.
TROY, N.Y., Dec. 26. -- An evening session of the Court of Sessions was held to-night and the proceedings were quite sensational. John Reed, on trial on a charge of train-wrecking near Greenbush last September, was sworn in his own behalf. He told a most remarkable story. He declared that he had nothing whatever to do at any time with wrecking trains or misplacing switches.

When the Republican substitute for the Mills bill was reported to the Senate, in October, 1888, Mr. ALLISON said, with reference to the proposed change in the duty on ingot copper from 4 cents to 2 cents a pound: "The duty does not affect the price of copper one way or the other in this country.

A soldier named Uny has just been condemned at a court-martial held at Lyons to "hard labor for life," for the brutal murder of one Giraud, an officer's servant, who was quartered with him in the infantry barracks at Chalon-sur-Saone.

It is hardly to be supposed that Mr. PLUMB really expected to carry his proposition to increase the tax on distilled spirits from 90 cents to $1.25 per gallon. Mr. DAWES showed the true party spirit when he said that he could not vote for such an amendment because he could not bring himself to declare, even by implication, that there would be a deficit under the Republican legislation.

1027-> HALFORD GIVES THE TIP.; HE HELPS TO PUT DOWN AN ORIGINAL PACKAGE MAN.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Aug. 13. -- President Harrison's private secretary has just been used to trap Charles Silverman, the first original package man in Pennsylvania.

PARIS, Oct. 11. -- The agitation over the new United States tariff law was greater than ever during the last week. The wildest ideas as to the scope and effect of the law were prevalent.

PLAINFIELD, N.J., Oct. 11. -- Daniel Randolph, a Park Avenue farmer, found two young sportsmen gunning in his woods this morning, and ordered them off the premises. Instead of obeying him they jeered in derision, and he tried to drive them away with stones. A fight resulted, in which one of the trespassers struck him over the head with the butt of his gun and felled him senseless to the earth. 
--------
1032-> THE ALLIANCE IN THE NORTH AND WEST.
Neither in the North nor in the West has the Farmers' Alliance made the brilliant conquest that it has in the South. In the Eastern and Middle States it has done scarcely more than establish outposts. In Connecticut, however, it has made headway, and in Vermont, too, its hand is visible; in fact, it took part in the recent campaign, and worked to such purpose that two of its candidates were elected to the Legislature.

1033-> CUNARD LINE TROUBLES.; COLLECTOR ERHARDT AND AGENT BROWN SETTLE A MISUNDERSTANDING.
During the last week the Cunard Steamship Company, represented by its agent, Vernon H. Brown, and the Treasury Department, represented by Collector Joel B.

Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Florence, and Mrs. Drew returning to New-York after a prosperous tour of the other cities, found the familiar three-acuversion of "The Rivals" as good a medium as any fresher play could be for the beginning of their engagement at the Fifth-Avenue Theatres last evening. The house was well filled and the audience was eagerly attentive, sympathetic, and demonstrative. 
--------
1035-> DARTMOUTH WINS AGAIN.
HANOVER, N.H., May 24. -- The game to-day between Dartmouth and Amherst was a much better one than yesterday, Dartmouth making but three errors and Amherst five, but the hitting was even harder.

Cunningham of Brooklyn.

1039-> AN IMPORTANT REFORM.; NEW RULE REGARDING DECISIONS OF CONNECTICUT'S SUPREME COURT.
HARTFORD, Jan. 8. -- Chief Justice Charles B. Andrews of the Supreme Court in this State has instituted an important reform in that body in regard to the announcement of decisions.

HARTFORD, Conn., March 9. -- The court-martial ordered by Nathaniel Lyon Post of the Grand Army in this city on account of disclosures published in THE NEW-YORK TIMES four months ago about the rejection of a colored veteran's application for membership in the organization was begun last night behind bolted doors, with guards inside and out, for the protection of the order.

1043-> THE WORKS OF HERBERT SPENCER.; THEIR RELATIVE CIRCULATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES.
In the letter of Prof. H.F. Osborn of Princeton College, in your issue of April 6, a statement is made in regard to the relative circulation of Mr. Herbert Spencer's works in England and America which is so erroneous, and is calculated to convey such a wrong impression of the number of readers of these works in both countries, that it requires authoritative correction.

1044-> MAY IN THE ADIRONDACKS; DEER PLENTIFUL IN THE STILL-WATER COUNTRY. A SPORTSMEN'S PARADISE IN WHICH THE AXE OF THE LUMBER MAN HAS AS YET DONE LITTLE DAMAGE.
HACKMATACK CAMP, IN THE ADIRONDACKS, May 22. -- For many persons this is the most agreeable time of year to spend in the woods.

ALBANY, Feb. 24. -- Some time ago the Hudson River Telephone Company secured a temporary injunction against the Watervliet Turnpike and Railroad Company to restrain it from using the single trolley system.

Mr. Reinhart says: "There is not the slightest foundation for the silly rumors issued by irresponsible persons about Atchison.

1050-> BROOKLYN WINS AGAIN.; THE ASSOCIATION PLAYERS COMPEL TOLEDO TO LOWER ITS COLORS.
The Toledos, fresh from their victories over the Athletics, struck a large-sized snag at the Polo Grounds yesterday. The Brooklyn Association team is playing a hard game to beat just now, and Manager Morton's men found it out yesterday to their sorrow.

Until a few days ago the difference between the price of granulated refined sugar and the price of centrifugal raw sugar had been maintained for a long time at about 5/8 of a cent a pound. This was the margin between the raw material and the finished product, and out of it the refiners were paying the cost of manufacture and taking profits.

That eminently respectable old plug hat that may be said to be almost a landmark to people who live in New-York and Washington, and that has such a world-wide celebrity, that glorious old tile of Senator Evarts, is, perhaps, the most famous hat in America to-day. It has been pertinently asked, where did he get it? The extraordinary thing about it is not that it looks old, but that it never looks new.

NEWARK, N.J., Nov. 25. -- Lawrence T.

There was some queer politics exhibited in the rapid-transit contest at Albany yesterday. There is no doubt that an understanding existed with Gov.

WINES. -- The vine is, in one respect, out of the many that could be mentioned, a particularly remarkable plant. It might be called a climatometer -- a measurer or indicator of climate.

1075-> SOCIETY OF BALTIMORE.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 8. -- Hardly more than a week now remains within which society may beguile itself, and yet no invitations have been issued for anything more interesting than receptions and teas. It is therefore highly probable that the season will end without that increased brilliancy which commonly marks its close. 
--------
1076-> THE POPULAR "VERDICT."
The most striking thing about the Republican speeches on the Tariff bill thus far has been the declaration that the outrageous increase in the duties proposed by the Ways and Means Committee was demanded by the people at the last Presidential election. Mr. MCKINLEY made much of this assumption in his speech of Wednesday, and yesterday Mr. BURROWS followed yesterday in the same vein.

RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 26. -- Mahone is manifesting very little interest in the political fight this year. Even in the Fourth District, where his bitterest enemy, John M. Langston, is making such an active canvass, the Chairman of the Republican State Committee is apparently indifferent. His seeming apathy there, though, is accounted for here by the fact that he is afraid to take part against the colored independent candidate.

The swans do not breed until they are three years old; they are strictly monogamous, and the male bird takes his full share in the incubation.

1088-> SALVATOR AGAINST TIME.; A TEST OF THE GREAT COLT'S SPEED AT MONMOUTH TO-DAY.
The Monmouth Park track will be in good condition to-day, and so Mr. Byrnes will send his peerless colt Salvator over the straight mile in an endeavor to beat Raveloe's record of 1:39 1/4 for the distance.

It appears that would-be settlers are gathering on the borders of the Cherokee Strip, waiting to hear the news that it has been opened to them through the enacting of the Oklahoma bill or otherwise.

Expert Penman D.N. Carvalho was the first witness called to the stand yesterday when the trial of the case of Mrs. Mary McShane against her brother Michael J.

The most serious obstacle to obtaining for the city of New-York that complete control of its purely local affairs to which it ought to be entitled is the frequent exposure of inefficiency and dishonesty in the exercise of that measure of control which is already accorded to its own authorities. Nobody questions the principle of local self-government.

1121-> BLOCKS IN PLACE OF LOTS.; THE NEW LAW FOR RECORDING AND INDEXING LAND INSTRUMENTS.
The amendments which have been made in the act adopted by the Legislature last year providing for recording and indexing instruments affecting land in the city of New-York according to city blocks or other limited areas are not of a nature materially to change the law. The Tax Commissioners are given more latitude in fixing the boundaries of the sections, eight of which, however, must be below the Harlem River. 
--------
1122-> MATERIAL FOR NEW NOVELS.; STORIES NOT YET TOLD, AND A WAY TO MAKE USE OF THEM.
A new and pleasing profession for the imaginative, or for men "having knowledge of adventures," is suggested by an advertisement in the London Athenaeum. "Experienced writers of fiction, (ladies especially,) may be supplied with new materials of an exciting and romantic character." Here is an opening, says a writer in the Daily News, for "persons who have seen the world, or who, while they possess unbounded fancy, are too indolent or too unskilled to write. 
--------
1123-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
There is danger that relief of the Supreme Court of the United States will be again postponed on account of the changes made by the Senate in the bill as it passed the House. Both branches of Congress have given their approval to the plan for intermediate courts of appeal in the several circuits, which is the most rational and effective method of relief that has been proposed. 
--------
1124-> ANYTHING BUT HARMONY.; JARRING FACTIONS AMONG BROOKLYN REPUBLICANS.
For the first time in three months the Kings County Republican General Committee met last evening in the Athenaeum, on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, and the members by their action dispelled all idea of a settlement of the fight between the Woodruff and Baldwin forces. Mr. Woodruff presided and listened with some apprehension to the resignations of five members, among them that of the venerable Benjamin F. Estes. 
--------
1125-> KNIGHTS OF LABOR ASSEMBLY.; POWDERLY ADVOCATES THE DISCUSSION OF THE TARIFF.
DENVER, Col., Nov. 11. -- Over two hundred delegates to the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor were called to order to-day by Grand Master Workman T.V.

--------
1126-> MILLINERY OF MIDWINTER; PREPARATIONS FOR THE LENTEN SEASON. MANY NEW MATERIALS USED IN HEADGEAR -- A WEALTH OF FLOWERS -NEW RIBBONS AND NEW STYLES.
" Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing," but New-Yorkers and the strangers sojourning hero desire first to see some new thing. The ladies find their liveliest gratification of this instinct in the ever-changing panorama of fashion. 
--------
1127-> PETER J. CLAASSEN'S TRAIL.; HE WAS NEVER LEGALLY PRESIDENT OF THE SIXTH NATIONAL BANK.
The taking of testimony in the trial of Peter J. Claassen, charged with embezzling the funds of the Sixth National Bank of this city, was begun before Judge Benedict in the United States Circuit Court yesterday. United Sates District Attorney Edward Mitchell and Assistant United States District Attorney A.J. Rose appeared for the prosecution and A.W. Tenney and Benjamin B. Foster for the defense. 
--------
1128-> VICTIM OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.; A WOMAN'S DEATH FOR WHICH JAMESTOWN LADIES WILL HAVE TO ANSWER.
JAMESTOWN, N.Y., May 9. -- For several years a band of women, several of them of prominence in social circles, has been attempting to cure the sick in this city by means of Christian science, hesitating at nothing, scorning to call in the services of regular practitioners, and making a failure of every case which came under their care. 
--------
1129-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Commissioner RAUM asks for a deficiency appropriation of $33,000,000 to straighten out his bureau up to the end of June next. As there has already been appropriated $97,000,000, this would bring the amount for the current year up to $130,000,000, in round figures. Next year he says that he (or his successor) will want a little over $133,000,000. 
--------
1130-> POLITICAL NOTES.
A convention of the conglomerate sort, modeled after the Columbus (Ohio) Convention of July 15, is to be held at Fort Worth, Texas, Sept. 8. Practically every Texas organization, whether of farmers or laborers, which favors class legislation has been invited to send delegates to this convention. 
--------
1131-> THE CLAYTON MURDER.; A SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTS.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 8. -- Judge John McClure of this city, it was learned to-night, will conduct the inquiry on behalf of the Government before the sub-committee appointed from the House Election Committee to-day to investigate the Clayton-Breckinridge contest in the Second Arkansas District, and to inquire into the circumstances surrounding Clayton's assassination.

1133-> NEW PUBLICATIONS; WITH GUN AND DOG. SHOOTING ON UPLAND, MARSH, AND STREAM. A Series of Articles. Edited by WILLIAM BRUCE LEFFINGWELL. Illustrated. New-York: RAND, MCNALLY & CO.
This handsome volume contains a carefully-selected series of articles written by experts. It is well known that with the fine opportunities sportsmen have in the United States there are men who are, so to speak, specialists, and, devoting their shooting to one particular bird, treat about the ways of that bird, because they know better than any one else its ways and habits. 
--------
1134-> A RANCHMAN MURDERED.; MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE MURDER OF A RICH OLD MAN.
MERCED, Cal., Nov. 11. -- A horrible murder was committed Sunday night near Merced Falls, a small village on the Merced River about twenty miles from this city. John L. Ivett, seventy years of age, and worth half a million and without an enemy, was the victim. Ivett lived at his ranch near Merced Falls with his wife, a young girl of twenty, to whom he had been married about two years. 
--------
1135-> THE CENSUS AND THE CITY.
At first sight it seems odd that the Board of Health should be the first official body to protest against the official enumeration of the people of this city. On reflection this is seen to be entirely natural. The Board of Health is the official body that has the most direct and urgent interest in securing an accurate count of the inhabitants. 
--------
1136-> MUTTERINGS OF WAR.; THE BEHRING SEA QUESTION PROMISING TO BECOME A BURNING ONE.
HALIFAX, N.S., June 11. -- There is a feeling among military people here that the presence of United States cruisers in Behring Sea will eventually lead to trouble between England and the United States. From the London Standard's remarks on the subject, it would seem that a very small spark might just now kindle a large-sized conflagration. 
--------
1137-> OBITUARY.
Amzi S. Dodd, one of the pioneers of the bag, gage express business in his city and well known from his connection with various enterprises, died yesterday a the home of his son in-law, Joseph Kavanaugh, 234 West One Hundred and Twenty-first-sreet 
--------
1138-> A BIG FIRM ASSIGNS.; FAILURE CAUSED BY THE STEALING OF LARGE SUMS BY THE FOREMAN.
CHICAGO, Feb. 25. -- Surprising developments accompanied an assignment made this afternoon by A.G. Leonard  Co., boot and shoe manufacturers, 207 Monroe-street. The immediate cause of the assignment was failure to meet $6,400 due on new factory at De Kalb, Ill. The liabilities are placed at $100,000, with assets the same. 
--------
1139-> HENDERSON NOT AT FAULT.; HIS CHARACTER UNJUSTLY ASSAILED BY A FIRM IN MEXICO.
An Associated Press dispatch from the City of Mexico announced Thursday evening that the firm of Knight-Bruce  Samuel, brokers in that city, had asked for the extradition of Charles Henderson, now in New-York, charging him with robbery. When an extradition is wanted by the Mexican Government, advices are at once sent by wire to the Mexican Consulate, which are then put into the hands of the local police authorities. 
--------
1140-> CHRISTIANITY FOR SIX MONTHS.
During the present month in this and other cities and in all the large towns the churches of the different denominations will begin their working season, which usually lasts from October to April or a little longer. The half year devoted to the Summer resorts effectually limits the active life of our parishes to six or eight months, and this fact to-day colors and tones and controls the Christian forces of the country. 
--------
1141-> STRIKERS ASKING FOR WORK.; NEW-YORK CENTRAL MEN APPLYING FOR REINSTATEMENT.
ALBANY, Aug. 27. -- At the New-York Central station offices here to-day there have been applications made by a large number of the strikers or reinstatement.

The marriage was solemnized by the Rev. Dr. John W. Brown of St. Thomas's Protestant Episcopal Church. 
--------
1143-> A COSTLY EXPERIMENT.; FISH PLANTING IN THE GREAT LAKES DECLARED A FAILURE.
" So far as stocking the inland lakes with fish is concerned, the hatching experiment in this State is a flat failure," said H.W. Welcher, ex-Superintendent of the hatcheries. Mr. Welcher is a practical fish hatcher, having been connected with Seth Green's establishment years ago. He came to Wisconsin to hatch fish for W.K. Fairbank, at Lake Geneva, and was finally induced to take charge of the State hatcheries. 
--------
1144-> COURTLANDT PALMER'S WILLS.; THERE WERE THREE OF THEM AND A COMPLEX SITUATION FOLLOWS.
The complications over-the will of Courtlandt Palmer are being discussed in the courts. He died July 23, 1888, at Lake Dunmore, where he was sojourning. It was found that he had left practically three wills. These were all admitted to probate by Surrogate Ransom, despite objection, in order that an appeal might be taken to the Supreme Court, where the legal standing of the heirs could be determined upon. 
--------
1145-> PRINTING ALL THOSE BALLOTS.; HOW THE WORK IS PROGRESSING ON THE DIFFERENT TICKETS.
The big job of printing the official ballots for the coming election is progressing satisfactorily, although it is yet far from being completed. Mr. Kelso, who has charge of the printing of the ballots, said yesterday that, while the multiplicity of ballots was so great that the possibility of mistakes and hitches was increased, no one need have any fear that the printing would not be done satisfactorily, both as to form and time. 
--------
1146-> THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE.
There is a cruel irony in the official title of the committee that has to deal with the tariff in the House. It is known as the Ways and Means Committee, and just at present it is distinguished by its utter inability to discover any means or any ways by which the objects of the majority of its members can be accomplished or put in the way of accomplishment. 
--------
1147-> A RACE FOR DERBY HORSES; SEVENTEEN NAMED TO START IN THE BROOKLYN DERBY. READY FOR RACING AT MORRIS PARK -- THE CONEY ISLAND STAKE DAYS -- THE BRIGHTON SUMMER MEETING.
The Spring meeting of the Brooklyn Jockey Club, the most successful in the history of this organization, will be brought to a close this week, Thursday, and then the racers will move to the track of magnificent distances, Westchester. But before the horses leave the Gravesend track there will be some memorable contests. 
--------
1148-> THE STRIKE IN SCOTLAND.; IMPROVEMENTS IN TRAIN SERVICE -- SHIPPING EMBARRASSED.
GLASSGOW, Dec. 27. -- There is a slight change for the better in connection with the railroad strike. Even the strikers admit that the railroad companies are making improvements in the train services. The number, regularity, and punctuality of the trains are increasing, and with this improvement the hopes of success for the strikers get smaller and smaller. 
--------
1149-> FATAL RAILROAD ACCIDENT.
ST. JOHN, N.B., Jan. 10. -- An express train for Quebec over the Intercolonial met with an accident near Jacquet River this morning. The snow plow left the track and the engine followed it and turned over. Fireman P. Gauget was taken out in a dying condition. Engineer J. McGowan, at last accounts, was still in the wreck, and is probably dead.

1150-> DANIEL B. FAYERWEATHER AT SCHOOL.
John M. Toucey, General Manager of the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company, New-York, writes us the following letter: "I was interested in your account of D.B. Fayerweather. As you did not mention an incident in his life which is an interesting one, and one, perhaps, you are not cognizant of, I take the liberty of giving it to you.

PROVIDENCE, R.I., May 25. -- Gen. Alger, Commander in Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, attended divine service with the department officers in St. John's Church this morning, and in Beneficent Congregational Church this evening. There was a large turnout of Grand Army men and Sons of Veterans at both these and other services. 
--------
1152-> SWEPT OVER THE FALLS.; TWO MEN DRIFTED IN THEIR BOAT INTO THE CURRENT AND WERE LOST.
NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario, Aug. 14. -- At about 11 o'clock this morning a report was circulated here that a man had been seen going over the Horseshoe Falls clinging to a common rowboat. Upon inquiry it was learned that Thomas Glynn, a hackman, was driving a party of visitors along the south shore of Goat Island when a man was seen rowing toward the Canadian shore above the Canadian rapids. 
--------
1153-> AMUSEMENTS.; THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.
The third public rehearsal of the Philharmonic Society yesterday afternoon was devoted chiefly to the performance of classical music. Two symphonies were played, one at the beginning and one at the close of the entertainment. The first was Mozart's in E flat, catalogued by Kochel as Opus 543, one of the three great symphonies composed by the universal genius four years before his death.

THE COLORS OF BIRDS NOT "FAST" COLORS. -- At the present moment the menagerie of the Zoological Society, Regent's Park, has an unusually large number of touracos, a species of birds which has not before been exhibited in this country. Touraco is the native name of a beautiful group of birds peculiar to Africa, and sometimes called, from their food, plantain eaters. 
--------
1155-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
The saddest thing about the Mayor's appointment of Mr. PAUL DANA as Park Commissioner is that it muzzles the New- York Sun in regard to park matters. The elder DANA is a gentleman of much experience and taste in the choice and disposition of trees, shrubs, and plants for the adornment of landscapes. 
--------
1156-> A LOSS TO SCIENCE.; THE DEATH OF A LEPER WHOSE RELATIVES OBJECTED TO DISSECTION.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., April 25. -- There died here, early this week, a man named Hyland, who was famous in medical circles because it was believed that he had a well-defined case of leprosy. The various phases of the disease were watched with untiring interest by the profession, and every experiment was tried to obtain control of it, but without effect. 
--------
1157-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
Issues more trivial than national insolvency have frequently been the exciting cause or the pretext of revolutions in the South American republics, but the Argentine revolution, already successful, if the dispatches may be trusted, seems to be the result of a want of confidence in the late Government's management of the finances. 
--------
1158-> REVOKING THE CHARTERS.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 10. -- A special to the Journal from Jefferson City, Mo., says: "The Secretary of State to-day revoked the charter of the 'Quickmeat' Stove Company of St. Louis. This action was taken in accordance with the provisions of the anti-trust law. The company refused to make affidavit hat it was not a member of the Stove Trust. 
--------
1159-> NEW-YORK COUNTY DEBTS.; CHANGES DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS AS SHOWN BY THE CENSUS.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. -- The Division of Wealth, Debt, and Taxation of the Census Bureau, of which Mr. T. Campbell Copeland has charge, has just finished the detailed report of the indebtedness of the counties of New-York State. The information in regard to the State is contained in the following table: 
--------
1160-> HEATED SOUTHERN BLOOD; THREE SHOTS FOLLOW A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT. A LIVELY SCENE IN TWENTY-FIFTH-STREET IN FRONT OF THE SOUTHERN SOCIETY'S ROOMS.
Persons walking down West Twenty-fifth-street, near Broadway, were surprised about 6 o'clock last night to see a gentleman rush out of the Southern Society's rooms at No. 18 and dash toward Sixth-avenue. Soon after, two other gentlemen emerged from the clubrooms. "Will you take that back?" shouted one to the other. 
--------
1161-> BUYING ANGLERS' RIGHTS; PRIVILEGES IN CANADA SOLD AT AUCTION. MANY BOUGHT BY FISHERMEN OF NEW-YORK AND OTHER CITIES NEAR BY -- WHAT A LEASE COSTS.
QUEBEC, Jan. 10. -- The sale of Canadian salmon streams and trout lakes belonging to provincial Government took place to-day at Parliament House, when privileges to the extent of $12,000 a year annual rental were disposed of. The salmon streams on the north shore of the St. Lawrence were sold as follows: 
--------
1162-> JAMAICA BAY FISHERMEN; THE STADLER BILL DISCUSSED IN COMMITTEE. COGENT REASONS FOR PROTECTING THE FISH FROM WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION BY NETS.
ALBANY, March 11. -- The Senate Committee on Internal Affairs gave a hearing this afternoon on the Stadler bill, which prohibits the taking of fish, except with rod, hook, and line, in Jamaica Bay at any time of the year. The committee room was crowded with the friends and enemies of the measure, and a good deal of bitterness was displayed during the two and one-half hours in which arguments were permitted. 
--------
1163-> WHAT BECAME OF THE MONEY?; A THIRD OF MR. BUNTING'S CONTRIBUTION UNACCOUNTED FOR.
LOCKPORT, N.Y., Nov. 11. -- William Spalding, Chairman and Treasurer of the Democratic County Committee of Niagara County, published the following statement in the Journal to-night: 
--------
1164-> THE HIGH EXPLOSIVES.
The announcement that a special gun is under construction at the Washington Ordnance Yard for the purpose of using shells charged with emmensite sufficiently indicates the hopes that are entertained by the Navy Ordnance Bureau of this new high explosive. The system of armor for our ships is now practically settled; so is that of our heavy guns; while even the question of projectiles is also far advanced toward solution. 
--------
1165-> SOCIETY TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
Christmas tide has brought for the first time in some years seasonable weather, and the social world has made merry in town and country all the more in consequence. While the snow delayed its advent just a few hours too long to make Thursday other than a "green Christmas," its coming was too surely foretold to allow of any croakings or depression on the part of even the most superstitious. 
--------
1166-> ALWAYS THE THIEVES' FRIEND.; MEN WHOM DANA HAS DEFENDED DURING THE PAST TWENTY YEARS.
Only one newspaper, the Sun, has a word to say in Grant's favor. All the others are either silent on the subject, or strongly opposed. As for the Sun's support, we show in another column what that is worth by giving our list, with Grant and his semi-criminal supporters at the end, of the rascals and shady political characters whom the editor of the Sun has taken to his bosom during the past twenty years. 
--------
1167-> THROUGH FIELDS OF ICE.; OCEAN VESSELS INTERCEPTED BY FLOATING PACK ICE AND BERGS.
The incoming steamships continue to report meeting with great fields of ice and icebergs off the Banks of Newfoundland. Capt. Stenger of the steamship Amsterdam of the Netherlands-American Line, from Amsterdam, says that on Feb. 5, between latitude 46 6', longitude 46 46', and latitude 43 45', longitude 48 15', he passed a large field of heavy pack ice, among which were six very large icebergs. 
--------
1168-> A BAD DAY FOR LOCAL CLUBS.; FOUR OF THE FIVE BROOKLYN AND NEW-YORK CLUBS LOSE.
The Boston players had it all their own way at Eastern Park yesterday. Their fielding was sharp, and in the first four innings they made four double plays-one in each inning. Although the Brooklyns outbatted the Bostons, yet their hits were scattered, but one being of any benefit to them in run getting. On the other hand, the Bostons hit Sowders just at the right time. 
--------
1169-> SIGHTS AT THE HATCHERY; METHODS OF FISH CULTURE AT COLD SPRING. COMMISSIONER BLACKFORD'S GUESTS INSPECT THE PONDS AND SEE MANY CURIOUS THINGS.
If the big fat trout in the ponds at the Cold Spring State Hatchery had known what distinguished and scientific gentlemen were peering down at them yesterday, undoubtedly they would have stood up on their tails and made obeisance, but instead they darted away as though fearful of harm. They were large trout. Some of them would weigh two pounds. 
--------
1170-> YOUNG RACERS AT AUCTION.; THE KENNESAW, RICHLAND, CLIFF LAWN; AND PEYTONA YEARLINGS SOLD.
NASHVILLE, April 26. -- Somo 600 horsemen were present to-day at the sale of the Kennesaw, Richland, Cliff Lawn, and Peytona yearlings, and good average prices were obtained. The seventy-three animals sold brought $47,095; an average of $578 each. This ends the sales in this State for the present. The animals disposed of to-day with their purchasers were as follows: 
--------
1171-> CROSSING THE HARLEM.
The dispute that was continued yesterday before the Board of Government Engineers about the best means of crossing the Harlem River seems curiously irrelevant to the interests really involved. It has taken the form of a controversy between the navigation of the Harlem River and the facility of crossing that stream for railroads, for vehicles, and for pedestrians. 
--------
1172-> A CHANCE FOR CADETS.; VACANCIES WHICH MIGHT BE MADE IN THE REVENUE MARINE.
There is much anxiety among the naval cadets at Annapolis to know just how many extra vacancies will be made in the navy should the proposed measure to transfer the Revenue Marine to the naval establishment pass. It is figured out that there will be sixteen vacancies by reason of the age clause alone, but, for all causes, forty officers, at present on the active list of the Revenue Marine, will be eligible for retirement. 
--------
1173-> OVER SIXTY LIVES LOST; TERRIBLE RESULTS OF THE STORM IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA. A STEAMER AND BARGE OVERTURNED WITH TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE -- HEROISM SHOWN BY RESCUERS.
LAKE CITY, Minn., July 14. -- Lake Pepin, on whose banks this little town is built, is a part of the Mississippi River. For a distance of about twenty-five miles the river has an average width of about three miles, and for years this body of water has been locally known as Lake Pepin. Similar lakes are found in the St. Lawrence River. 
--------
1174-> CASATI TALKED WITH.
Casati, the friend and comrade for so many years of Emin Pasha, has been interviewed at his villa in Monza by Carl von Reinhardstottner, who gives in a Berlin paper a long account of the eventful life of the revolutionist, scientist, patriot, and African explorer. Casati was born at Lesmo in 1838, and studied mathematics at Milan and the University of Pavia. 
--------
1175-> ATALANTA AND YALE RACE; THE FIRST GREAT AQUATIC CONTEST OF THE SEASON. AN ENGLISH EXPERT CRITICISES THE CREWS OF YALE AND HARVARD AND THE THEORIES OF COLUMBIA.
Less than two weeks remain before the race between the eight-oared crews of the Atalanta Boat Club and Yale University. The season of rowing is now so far advanced that oarsmen and all interested in aquatic contests can look forward to the coming events and plan for them more definitely than a few weeks ago, when dates of races were merely a matter of speculation. 
--------
1176-> WHEAT IN FARMERS' HANDS.; MR. DODGE'S FIGURES PARALYZE THE CHICAGO BULLS.
CHICAGO, March 11. -- After the performance to-day in the wheat pit it is a conundrum which is the greater bugbear to the Board of Trade -- the bucket shops or "Old man" Dodge at Washington. The speculative world knows Mr. Dodge to its great inconvenience. Two years ago the reports of this gentleman were telegraphed to Chicago about midday the 10th of each month. 
--------
1177-> ARE THERE SEVEN?
There has recently been some discussion in various parts of the country as to whether the Republicans in Congress would not read aright the lesson of the recent elections, and of the remarkable demands for reduced duties made by manufacturers before the Ways and Means Committee, and really undertake an honest and substantial revision of the tariff. 
--------
1178-> Article 15 -- No Title
THE RUSSIAN THIRST. -- There is no outlet for Russia in the North to open water, the natural Atlantic harbor of the arctic provinces, Hammerfest, where the water never freezes, being still in Swedish hands, and on the South the Turk, though incompetent to rule his own dominions, and only propped on his tottering throne by foreign support, still holds the Russian gateway with a bared sword. 
--------
1179-> IN HONOR OF MR. JEFFERSON.; MR. CRANE WILL GIVE A PROFESSIONAL MATINEE OF "THE SENATOR."
The continued successful run of "The Senator" at the Star is due to the professional courtesy of Mr. Joseph Jefferson, whose engagement was to have begun at that house last Monday evening, but who consented to be transferred to the Fifth-Avenue, that the interests of his fellow-artist, Mr. Crane, might not suffer. 
--------
1180-> Article 5 -- No Title
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 14. -- Mrs. Fremont this afternoon received the following message of condolence from President Harrison:

1181-> ANOTHER PLAYER DESERTS.; TUCKER, BROOKLYN'S FIRST BASEMAN, JOINS THE BOSTON CLUB.
The Brotherhood of Professional Baseball Players received a set-back yesterday when Tucker, the champion batsmen of the American Association, deserted the organization and signed an agreement to play with the old Boston League team.

--------
1183-> SISTERS IN BRITANY HAVE A SUIT.
A singular case, says our Paris correspondent, has just been tried before the Civil Tribunal of Nantes. The Sisterhood of Pont l'Abbe, in Brittany, claimed 80 of one of its former boarders. This boarder when a child had been handed over to the community by her father, who was never afterward heard of. Before going, however, he intrusted to the chaplain for her use an important sum of money. 
--------
1184-> UNDER THE NEW CENSUS; REPUBLICANS EXPECT TO GAIN SEVEN MEMBERS NET. AN APPORTIONMENT WHICH WILL GIVE 355 CONGRESSMEN -- THE INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT BILL.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10. -- Representative Dunnell of Minnesota to-day introduced, as the Chairman of the Committee on the Eleventh Census, a bill for the apportionment of the representation in Congress under the new census. It is not intended for passage by this session of the House. Mr. Dunnell says it is doubtful whether the committee will meet to consider the bill before next December. 
--------
1185-> THE CITY'S PART IN THE FAIR.
Assuming that there is no constitutional obstacle in the way, the bill "to provide for an exhibition of arts, sciences, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine, and sea, in the city of New-York," which has been prepared by the World's Fair Committee to be introduced in the State Legislature, makes a very proper provision for enabling the city to do its part for the proposed exhibition. 
--------
1186-> TO-DAY'S RACES.
Because there is but one stake race on the card for to-day that does not necessarily mean a poor day's racing. On the contrary, the card is one that will bring out good finishes, for while the class is high in none of the races, the lot are pretty well matched and will make picking the winners a decidedly difficult task. The entries and weights for the several races are as follows: 
--------
1187-> A GAMBLER KILLED.; AND A WOMAN ARRESTED, SUSPECTED OF HAVING KILLED HIM.
ELMIRA, N.Y., Jan. 10. -- "Bill" Edwards, a sporting character of this city, was shot dead in his home this afternoon.

In a sitting room in the rear of the hall sat Mrs. Mary Ellenberger, with whom he had lived. 
--------
1188-> DELANO CANNOT AFFORD IT.
BINGHAMTON, N.Y., Sept. 26. -- The Hon. Milton Delano, Congressman from this district, sends an open letter to the Republican positively declining to be a candidate for re-election, on the ground that he cannot afford another term in Washington. The letter is in reply to a petition of many old soldiers of his district asking him to accept a renomination. He has been Chairman of the Pension Committee in the Fifty-first Congress. 
--------
1189-> THE MODIFIED RAPID-TRANSIT BILL.
The Railroad Committee of the State Senate has at last come to the point of action on the question of rapid transit. It has decided to report adversely the Ives bill and favorably that introduced by Mr. FASSETT; but the latter has undergone material modification, which, however, chiefly affects the manner of constituting the Rapid-Transit Commission. 
--------
1190-> PLATT'S POWER WANING; WHAT THE FISH-GIBBS FACTION HAS ACCOMPLISHED. THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT INTERFERE IN LOCAL PARTY STRIFES -- THE KERWIN-HIRSCH CASE.
According to the statements of Frederick S. Gibbs, the opening scrimmage in the fight between Thomas C. Platt and the Fish-Gibbs faction has resulted in a defeat for Platt. The Administration, he says, has refused to obey Platt's whim in dictating the removal of Henry Hirsch, one of the gaugers in Collector Michael Kerwin's division of the Internal Revenue Department.

1191-> YOUNG BENZON'S SENTENCE.; TESTIMONY THAT THE TRIAL BROUGHT TO LIGHT.

--------
1192-> WELCH PITCHES GOOD BALL.; THE PITTSBURGS HAVE FUN WITH SIR EDWARD CRANE'S CURVES.
The New-York National League team is making a good record on their first Western trip. They took three out of four games from Anson's team. When they struck Cincinnati they had not defeated the team in that city in a single game. They had lost four, and what was more galling was the fact that they immediately lost two more. Yesterday, however, they taught the leaders that there were other teams that could play ball.

1193-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
It is not quite certain how far the changes made in the Silver bill by the Finance Committee of the Senate will affect legislation. They may some of them be surrendered in conference, should they be accepted by the Senate, or, if closely adhered to, they may defeat the bill altogether. The amendments, in any case, are important and are as follows:

1194-> TROTTING AT FLEETWOOD.; THE FAVORITES SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THE RACES.
Neither the weather, the sport, nor the attendance at Fleetwood Park yesterday was equal to the opening day. A high, keen wind from the northeast blew across the track, and just before the start rain began to fall, but fortunately did not continue. David Bonner did not appear in the judges' stand, so his place was filled by Henry Hughes.

PARIS, July 5, -- One of the most active men in France just now is M. Berger, and strangely enough his kingdom still confines its limits to the Champ de Mars. Although the exhibition seems to have closed long months ago, its mission has not yet been entirely filled, for neither diplomas nor medals have been given. 
--------
1197-> GRAIN RATE DIVISION.
CHICAGO, Jan. 26. -- Chairman Walker of the Inter-State Commerce Railway Association to-day decided the appeal of the St. Louis and San Francisco Road for permission to make rates on grain from points in Kansas to St. Louis based on the through rates, to offset the advantage to Kansas City operators gained by the present transit arrangement on grain shipped from Kansas points to Kansas City, and thereafter consigned to St. Louis and Chicago. 
--------
1198-> NEWS ABOUT RAILROADS; TWO MORE ROADS RATIFY THE PRESIDENTS' AGREEMENT. SOME DOUBT ABOUT THE PLACE WHERE THE MEETING OF THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL BE HELD -- CHICAGO, OF COURSE, WANTS IT.
Two more Western railroad companies have ratified the agreement approved by the meeting of railroad Presidents held at J. Pierpont Morgan's house in this city on the 15th inst. This makes ten of the sixteen roads represented at the meeting. The Directors of the Southern Pacific Road met in San Francisco yesterday, and, after unanimously approving the plan, appointed President C.P. Huntington and Vice President J.C. Stubbs to represent the company in the Advisory Board. 
--------
1199-> "DO NOT BE DECEIVED."
Senator HAWLEY'S paper, the Hartford Courant, is annoyed by what it calls the "false statements" about the new tariff that are published "by the free-trade newspapers." It takes to task one of its neighbors, the Hartford Times, for having said that the duty on linseed oil under the old law was 7 cents a gallon, while in fact it was 25 cents. 
--------
1200-> KENTUCKY WHITE CAPS.; THREE MEN TAKEN FROM HOME AND LASHED ON THE BARE BACK.
COVINGTON, Ky., March 11. -- The most serious White Cap raid in Kentucky for years occurred Sunday night on what is known as Buttermilk road, eight miles from this city. At that point is a number of houses occupied by poor and not too honest people. The neighborhood is filled with well-to-do farmers who have lately suffered seriously at the hands of petty thieves. 
--------
1201-> AN UP-TOWN POST OFFICE; PLANS DISCUSSED TO PUT A BUILDING IN CENTRAL LOCATION. THE PRESENT STRUCTURE SUITABLE ONLY FOR A DOWN-TOWN BRANCH -- THE NEED OF A CHANGE.
The attention of Congress at the coming session is likely to be earnestly invited to the fact that this city has outgrown its Post Office. Both the Treasury Department, which owns the building, and the Post Office Department, which operates the labor conducted within it, are fully convinced of the inadequacy of the accommodations for the purposes required of them. 
--------
1202-> GUM TO CHEW IN ENGLAND.; STEPS TAKEN TO POPULARIZE THE AMERICAN HABIT OVER THERE.
That one of the worst habits of American women is gum chewing is an opinion held by the Pall Mall Gazette. It says the habit "seems so innocent and harmless that nothing much can be said against it from outside appearances, but, according to the medical men of America, it destroys the teeth, invites dyspepsia, and brings many small evils in its train that grow to being distinctly inconvenient and unhealthy." 
--------
1203-> PARTY STRIFE IN ILLINOIS; THE DEMOCRATS NOT UNLIKELY TO WIN THE STATE. AND IF THEY DO THEY WILL REDISTRICT THE COMMONWEALTH AND ELECT A UNITED STATES SENATOR.
CHICAGO, May 10. -- For an "off" year in politics this promises to be a very lively one in Illinois. The questions to be decided at the polls next Fall are much more important than is usually the case except at Presidential elections, and the politicians are not the only men who are aware of this fact. 
--------
1204-> A METHODIST UNIVERSITY.; ARRANGEMENTS BEING MADE TO FOUND IT IN WASHINGTON.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 10. -- The announcement by Bishop John F. Hurst of Washington that preliminary arrangements are making toward the founding of a great Methodist National University at Washington has created an enthusiastic comment among the Methodists of Baltimore. The general idea is that the university is to be one where a broad, liberal education may be had without regard to denominational beliefs, the theological department being separate, as in the case of Princeton College. 
--------
1205-> FUNERAL OF BENJAMIN A. BAKER.; A NOTABLE GATHERING AT THE LITTLE CHURCH AROUND THE CORNER.
When the sweet-toned organ of the Little Church Around the Corner, in Twenty-ninth Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, yesterday pealed forth the splendid harmony of Chopin's funeral march, a congregation such as is seldom seen in a church edifice rose to its feet and stood with bowed heads while the body of Benjamin A. Baker, the venerable actor and Assistant Secretary of the Actors' Fund of America, was carried toward the chancel rail. 
--------
1206-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The commission sent to the isthmus last Winter by the liquidator of the bankrupt Panama Canal Company is still making reports and estimates of the cost of completing the proposed waterway. The first report, which we analyzed some weeks ago, was sufficient to satisfy any intelligent French investor that the project could not be resurrected. Those which have followed it only show the hopelessness of the case from new points of view. 
--------
1207-> MR. WINDOM SPEAKS.
For the first time since he submitted in his annual report his very important plan regarding silver, Mr. WINDOM on Monday made a somewhat detailed statement of his views upon the subject, and also met some of the objections that have been suggested. The first of these of which he took note was the liability of the purchase of foreign silver. 
--------
1208-> A MISSING LUMBER KING.; ANDREW BROWN IN ANXIOUS DEMAND BY HIS CREDITORS.
BUFFALO, Jan. 27. -- A king is missing. He is Andrew Brown, known in New-York as the "Lumber King," and his financial troubles have lately made him more widely known than did his operations in lumber. Brown has gone, evidently not on a pleasure tour, but to avoid service of papers in supplementary proceedings by anxious creditors.

1209-> PROFITS OF CANAL TRAFFIC; WHAT A CAPTAIN WHO OWNS HIS BOAT CAN MAKE. LITTLE DANGER OF HIS BECOMING A "BLOATED BONDHOLDER" UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITION OF AFFAIRS.
MEDINA, N.Y., Sept. 10. -- Three hills of lading representing the cargo of the Trailing Arbutus and her two fellow-boats on their last trip from Buffalo to New-York lie before THE TIMES'S correspondent in the cabin of the Arbutus as he writes.

--------
1210-> CHICAGO PRODUCE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 10. -- There was considerable October Pork sold by Hutchinson to-day. It was set down as for the account in all probability of the Sawyer-Wallace assignee. While this was going on all sort of product suffered. In spite of weakening circumstances prices before the close rallied, and although the entire gain was not maintained the final figures in most instances were as good or better than Thursday's. 
--------
1211-> IT IS CAPT. DU BOIS'S TURN NOW.; A COURT-MARTIAL IN THE TWENTY-SECOND REGIMENT.
Charges have been preferred by Lieut. Col. William V. King against Capt. Charles A. Du Bois, Twenty-second Regiment, which will be made the subject of investigation by the court-martial of which Col.

Du Bois with disobedience of orders and conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline. 
--------
1212-> MALICIOUS FERRYBOAT PILOTS.; THEY LIKE TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF YACHTSMEN ON THE RIVERS.
Yachtsmen have recently complained that xvhen guiding their boats up the Hudson and East Rivers pilots on ferryboats have taker a sort of fiendish delight in seeing how close they could make their big craft shave the yachts, thereby causing great annoyance to the yachtsmen and frightening .guests that might be on board.

1213-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
President MICHAEL COLEMAN'S letter to the Deputy Tax Commissioners reproves in temperate language the perpetrators of a gross public abuse.

--------
1214-> AN ENTRY INTO PROVIDENCE.
PROVIDENCE, R.I., July 14. -- It has just come to light that during the past week a syndicate of four gentlemen has succeeded in obtaining a large controlling share in the stock of the Providence and Springfield Railroad Company. It is the intention of the syndicate to turn this control over to the New-York and New-England Railroad, which has already under construction a branch from Woonsocket to the tracks of the Providence and Springfield Railroad. 
--------
1215-> THE FIGHT WILL BE INTERESTING.; GEN. NEWBERRY AND W. G. EWING NOMINATED FOR CONGRESS.
CHICAGO, July 14. -- The Democrats of this city have set a good example to their fellows throughout the country by nominating two men of first rank for Congress in the conventions in the districts now represented by Congressmen Taylor and Adams. Both of these men have been renominated, but their election after to-day's action of the Democracy is not assured by any means. 
--------
1216-> RECIPROCITY BY PROCLAMATION.
There is something rather blind in the amendment in which Mr. ALDRICH, for the Finance Committee, has embodied the latest form of the reciprocity idea. It is, indeed, so obscure and so imperfect that it is not unreasonable to suspect that it is not offered in perfect good faith, but is one of those numerous devices of our present ingenious Republican leaders to give an impression that the facts will not bear out. 
--------
1217-> A CHAT WITH "SAM" SCOTT.; HE TALKS ABOUT THE ALLIANCE AND TELLS A REAL-ESTATE STORY.
Col. "Sam" Scott of St. Louis and Kansas City, whose fame as a "boomer" has traveled across the continent, has been at the Hoffman House several days.

1218-> THE OHIO SPOILSMEN.; BITTER FEUDS IN THE REPUBLICAN CAMP OVER THE CIVIL SERVICE.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 10. -- The debate in the House on the appropriation for the support of the Civil Service Commission has stirred the Republican Party in Ohio to its foundation. It is a prevalent impression in the central and southern parts of the State, where Gen. Grosvenor has many admirers, that McKinley and Butterworth took advantage of the General in that debate and put him "in a hole." 
--------
1219-> THE FUTURE METROPOLIS.
The commission appointed to inquire into the expediency of consolidating the cities of New-York and Brooklyn and the adjacent territory, including Staten Island, into one great municipality, will submit a favorable report at the coming session of the Legislature, together with a bill for carrying out the project.

A statement about the pending Tariff bill's duties on worsted and woolen goods for men's wear has been prepared by EDWARD T. STEEL  CO. of Philadelphia, and is published by the American Wool Reporter. Mr. STEEL, the Reporter says, "previous to the last election had been an almost lifelong Republican."

1224-> A THOUSAND YEARS OF ENGLAND.; THE STORY OF EARLY BRITAIN. By ALFRED J. CHURCH, M.A. New-York: G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS. 1890.
We are so accustomed to the word England in place of Britain that a title like the above leads one to expect a history of Britain under the old British. But the Rev. Mr. Church means Britannia and proposes to tell the story of the island from the earliest times down to the Norman Conquest. 
--------
1225-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
Gen. BUTLER, on his way to inspect his mining property in the West, tells the people of St. Louis that he is "a protectionist from head to heel." We understand that the old politician never looks at that paragraph in the tariff law which relates to bunting without feeling that if he should not adhere to the principles of protection he would be an ingrate. 
--------
1226-> HOPEFUL OF JERSEY CITY; EX-GOV. BEDLE BELIEVES REFORM IS COMING. AN INTERVIEW WITH A DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN -- THE MEASURES OF LEGISLATION FAVORED BY HIM.
Jersey City, despite her unworthy rulers and disreputable "practical politics," contains within her borders a fair proportion of men of high character and genuine public spirit. They seem in danger at times of being lost sight of through the prominence given men of the other sort, but they nevertheless still live and are honored and respected by all whose good opinion is worth having. 
--------
1227-> "STEEL DISPLACING WOOD."
My attention has been drawn to the interesting article in THE NEW-YORK TIMES of the 5th inst., under the heading, "Steel Displacing Wood." It is extremely well timed, and deals with a subject which is occupying the minds of our railroad managers at the present time, and which is of even more importance to the traveling public, if it only knew it. 
--------
1228-> A BIG RAILROAD SUIT.; A MICHIGAN LINE FURNISHES OPPORTUNITY FOR A LARGE CLAIM.

1229-> SOLD OUT THE TICKET.; ESSEX COUNTY DEMOCRATS INDIGNANT OVER THEIR DEFEAT.
ORANGE, N.J., Nov. 11. -- It is probable that the Democratic County Committee of Essex County will shortly be called upon to investigate the cause of the defeat of Messrs. Barrett and Hamilton, the candidates for Assembly and Freeholder-ship in the Ninth Assembly District, of which this city is the centre. The district is Democratic and should give every Democratic nominee on the ticket a good majority.

The Republicans of Maine held their State Convention at Augusta yesterday. They professed to favor an "elective system free from corruption and fraud" and a "free ballot and a fair count in national elections in all the States," but they refused to declare specifically for the "secret system of voting with official ballots."

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 27. -- The steamship Pennsylvania arrived at her dock to-day and reported that the British steamer Falcon, from New-York for Glasgow, with a cargo of staves, was abandoned on the 16th inst., in a sinking condition, with bow stove and bulwarks and sails gone.

ALBANY. Feb. 11. -- The Senate was in session this morning forty-five minutes, and cleared its calendar. The House was in session two hours and cleared up all its work. The General was so much pleased that, in relieving J. Irving Burns, who had presided all the morning, he complimented the House.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. -- Speaker Reed and Secretary Tracy have taken the first steps toward supplying the Democratic majority in the Fifty-second Congress with a case for the election of a member from the First District of Maine -- that is, assuming that the Democrats take the ground that the Republicans in this Congress have occupied, that the function of the Committee on Elections is to elect.

NEWBURG, N.Y., June 27. -- Judge Charles F. Brown of the Court of Appeals will be the referee at the regatta of the Newburg Canoe and Boating Association to-morrow. The firs prize for mainsail yachts will be a silver pitcher, and the second prize a silver cup.

BOSTON, Mass., April 9. -- A special train of four cars left the Old Colony station to-day with a party on board to witness the working of a safety appliance for stopping trains, known as the Rowell automatic safety stop.

1236-> A CYCLONE'S DEADLY PATH; AND THE HAVOC WHICH IT CREATED IN ITS COURSE. A TOWN HALL, A CHURCH, AND FARM WRECKED -- CROPS DESTROYED AND BRIDGES GONE.
AKRON, Ohio, April 9. -- The worst cyclone in the history of this section struck Sharon Township, Medina County, last night, mowed a swath twenty rods wide, six miles long directly toward Akron, but arose above the surface far enough to pass harmless over this city. Six miles east of Akron it again struck the earth in Sweitzer farm and thence combined its course southeast for several miles with unabated fury.

The important addition which was made to the new fleet of armored cruisers that Spain is building to resume her place among the naval powers and to create a powerful squadron of cruisers, gunboats, and torpedo vessels to protect her trade and colonies is the first of three sister vessels which the Spanish Government has contracted for with the new shipyards of Messrs. Martinez Rives and Palmer of Bilboa. 
--------
1242-> CONGRESS AND THE NAVY.
The annual Supply bill for the naval establishment which Congress agreed upon in season for the new fiscal year contains many interesting and some novel features. Among the latter is an appropriation for manufacturing and testing a submarine gun. The invention of ERICSSON is the one meant, and thus that practical recognition of it is at last secured which he long sought in vain.

A war which promises to be to the death has been declared as between the minor race tracks. The preliminary skirmish will be between the Brighton Beach Racing Association and the Hudson County Jockey Club, which owns the Guttenberg (N.J.) track.

A work of no little ambitiousness has been completed by the painter Richard Creifelds. It is an altar piece for St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, on Fifth Avenue and One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Street.

In his "Paradise of Birds," a metrical protest in the nature of a satire is made by W.J.

1252-> THE WATER SUPPLY OF MEMPHIS.
A few years ago sanitarians could justly point at Memphis as" a horrible example." With respect to sewerage and water supply its condition was almost mediaeval.

--------
1260-> PARNELL'S OBSTINACY.
The most contemptible argument yet put forth by Mr. PARNELL'S few remaining supporters in favor of his continued leadership and in justification of their course is that the "independence" of the Irish party would be forfeited if its leader should retire at the demand of the English Liberals.

--------
1268-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
Yale's victory at Eastern Park yesterday ought to go far toward consoling her for last Saturday's defeat, especially in view of its remarkable score of 32 to 0 against such a college as Princeton. It is certainly an ample revenge for last year's triumph of the orange and black, which showed so much smaller a score. 
--------
1269-> SOME ARISTOCRATIC DOGS; THE ANNUAL BENCH SHOW HAS BEGUN. AN EXCELLENT SHOWING OF DOGS AT THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE BUILDING -- AWARDS MADE YESTERDAY.

" PARK" NOT A GOOD NAME. -- It is perhaps a misfortune that all lands set apart for public use should be designated by the name of "park," a word which suggests to most people some attempt at gardening or decoration.

1319-> THE HAWAIIAN CRISIS.
The orders issued to the Charleston to return to Honolulu show the degree of importance attributed by the Government to the political news brought by the flagship from the latter port.

They have only to secure one more victory to be crowned champions of the country. 
--------
1329-> THE HURRICANE IN THE WEST.
The calamity which has devastated the Ohio Valley is one that is by no means novel in the West except for its extent. By reason of its extent the hurricane included one large city and a considerable number of thriving towns and villages. The tornadoes of which we get tidings almost every year are so local and limited in their scope that the chances are much against their striking the site of a town. 
--------
1330-> THE FULL-DRESS JACKET.
Up to the present season the attempts of daring spirits to innovate upon the "dress suit" of modern civilization have been unavailing.

1333-> QUAY'S CLUB CELEBRATES THE DAY.; A BANQUET IN WHICH OPEN DISCUSSION WAS HAPPILY AVOIDED.
PITTSBURG, April 26. -- The Americus Republican Club banquet to-night, in observance or Gen. Grant's birthday, was a brilliant affair, conducted to a successful conclusion under severe strain.

--------
1337-> A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
We do not envy the nature of any citizen of New-York who could read the manly, logical, and eloquent words of Mr. FITCH of this city in the House on Friday without a thrill of sympathetic pride. They were a fitting declaration of independence from a man who worthily represents this great, busy city of commerce, manufactures, and labor. 
--------
1338-> THE TWO TEAMS MET DEFEAT.; " BUCK" EWING'S BROTHER JOHN ESSAYS TO PITCH FOR THE NEW-YORKS.
The game at Washington Park yesterday was of the kind delighted the spectators -- probably from the fact that Brooklyns won. Mutrie's cripples fought desperately to down their opponents, but fate seemed against them. Both teams played good ball, and but five errors were made in the entire game. Glasscock is still unable to play, and that means a great deal to the New-Yorks.

It testified powerfully to the deep hold which the issues involved in this city election have taken upon their minds.

1346-> THIS HAWK IS AN IMPOSTOR.; A NEW BIRD LAYS CLAIM TO THE BRIDGE HAWK'S NOTORIETY.
The hawk, supposed to be the one which has for some time made the top of the New-York tower of the Brooklyn Bridge its happy hunting ground, and which Officer Dooley of the bridge police force arrested Saturday night, as he said, "for chasing pigeons on the bridge premises without a license," turns out to be only a hawk impostor and to possess no claim whatever to the title of "The Bridge Hawk."

Commenting upon the remark of the Court of Appeals in the Sugar Trust decision that "the State seeks to protect individuals rather than combinations," the New-York Tribune, on the 27th ult., pointed out that the court had declared that "this same boasted superiority of power is a fatal objection to Trusts, which makes them hostile to public welfare," and also said: 
--------
1348-> NOTES OF THE STAGE.
The new people introduced by Mr. Tony Pastor last night were in the main merely foils to those prime favorites of the habitues of the cozy little theatre in Fourteenth Street -- the Irish-American Maggie Cline and the English importation, Bessie Bonehill.

--------
1358-> FREE SPEECH AND SEDITION.
The action of Judge VAN BRUNT yesterday in releasing JOHN MOST on bail under a writ of habeas corpus is noticeable in several aspects. One of the most obvious lessons to be drawn from it is that such proceedings tend to bring the courts into public contempt, or at least disesteem, and the more conspicuous the case the greater the disesteem. 
--------
1359-> COPPERSTOWN.
COPPERSTOWN, Aug. 16. -- The arrival this week have been far in excess of any week of the season, and the departures comparatively few. Of course this is largely due to the tennis tournament, which has not only drawn a good number of players from different sections of the country, but has also attracted many of their friends.

Their desire to insure the nomination of Mr. BLAINE in 1892 has led some of our Western Republican contemporaries into a curious error. Immediately after the election the St. Louis Globe-Democrat began to say that the nomination of BLAINE could not be avoided.

1364-> Editorial Article 7 -- No Title
Abundant evidence has been given before the Fassett committee to show that licenses to sell liquor are granted and renewed with very little reference to the character of the persons or places licensed. The "inspection" that is kept up is of the most perfunctory and useless character, and its main purpose seems to be to give nominal employment to a large number of inspectors. 
--------
1365-> ANXIOUS FOR THE HONOR.; RIVAL JERSEY STATESMEN WANT TO FATHER BALLOT REFORM.
TRENTON, N.J., Jan. 28. -- There seems to have been some rivalry between Assemblyman Mullone of Jersey City and Senator McDonald or Hudson County as to who should take the initiative in the ballot reform movement in the Houses.

1373-> COUNT DILLON SICK OF POLITICS.
Count Dillon has been "interviewed" at his abode in the village of Sept-Fontaines in Luxembourg, and, although extremely reserved, he allowed it to be understood that he was not more pleased with Gen.

John James Ingalls sits in the Vice President's chair behind the great polished mahogany desk.

--------
1375-> TWO TUBES EXPLODED.; SUDDEN INTERRUPTION OF THE TEST OF COWLES'S TUBULOUS BOILER.
The series of tests which have been in progress at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on the Cowles tubulous boiler were abruptly interrupted last Thursday by the bursting of a couple of tubes.

--------
1383-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The "secret session" which the United States Senate held yesterday for the consideration of the two Federal appointments in Florda which are so obnoxious to the respectable people of that State afforded an illustration at once of the motives which the Senators have for secrecy and the futility of their efforts to secure it. 
--------
1384-> A BRITISH STUDY OF OUR PROBLEM.
The ever-increasing emigration of negroes from the South is referred to by Mr. De Farblanque, the British Consul at New-Orleans, in his last report.

CHICAGO, Nov. 12. -- It takes something more than a landslide or a tidal wave to crush the spirits of A.L. Conger, the representative of Ohio upon the Republican National Committee. "Why, I see nothing in the last election to discourage the Republicans," he said to-day, "nothing at all. Inspection of the returns show that the voting strength of the Democratic Party has increased? Not at all.

The newspaper organs of DAVID B. HILL would have the public believe that the Mugwumps ardently desire his election to the United States Senate.

--------
1417-> TRYING TO BE AN ACTRESS.; BUT NOT WILLING TO APPEAR AS A SOLDIER.

WASHINGTON, July 2. -- The Secretary of the Navy to-day issued orders for the speed trial of the cruiser San Francisco, which will occur July 25 in Santa Barbara Channel, off the coast of California.

--------
1420-> MIXED POLITICS IN OHIO.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 28. -- The uproar created by the selection of ex-Gov. Foraker to preside over the temporary organization of the Republican State Convention will in all probability have a tendency to cause the State Committee to act with more thought and consideration in the future by at least consulting the desires and wishes of the probable candidates to be nominated. 
--------
1421-> EXPORT DUTIES REMOVED; THE GOVERNMENT PLEASES THE OTTAWA LUMBER MEN. MUCH LUMBER WAITING SHIPMENT TO THE UNITED STATES -- THE M'KINLEY BILL DISCUSSED.

--------
1422-> A DECREE AGAINST BETTING.
The less important betting agencies have yielded to M. Constans's ordinance, which was published in the Journal Officiel to-day, but has not yet been served on those whom it concerns. According to the decree, bets can only be made on race courses, and for sums over 5f. There are 3,000 agencies in Paris, most of which are held at public houses, where drinking and gambling go hand in hand. 
--------
1423-> THE MUNICIPAL INVESTIGATION.
The Senate Committee on Cities will begin its investigation of the methods and results of municipal administration in this State to-morrow, holding its first sessions in this city. The counsel of the committee has formulated a list of forty questions, addressed to the Mayors of the several cities, calculated to bring out a valuable mass of preliminary information, much needed in the study of municipal problems. 
--------
1424-> CHICAGO PRODUCE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, March 13. -- Provisions were active and bullish to-day, especially for Mays Pork and Ribs. Shorts were the principal buyers, and at no time were the offerings liberal. The comparatively few selling orders were a noticeable feature, and for this reason the volume of business actually done in the pit was not heavy, though prices fluctuated over a wider range than usual. 
--------
1425-> TALK OF THE POLITICIANS; MANY THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE TO BE DECIDED THIS WEEK. TWO COUNTY CONVENTIONS TO BE HELD -- WORK OF THE "HARMONY" COMMITTEE -- IN THE ANNEXED DISTRICT.
The fog that now veils the field of local politics in uncertainty will be partially cleared away during this week. Many things will transpire that will put a different light on things that have already become public property, and by the end of the week the politicians will know pretty nearly what the fight is to be, and how and by whom it is to be made. 
--------
1426-> Article 23 -- No Title
THE FITTEST SURVIVE. -- "In the first place," says the Bishop of Carlisle, "objection may be taken to the phrase 'the fittest survive.'" And his objections are these: First, he says, "fitness implies something of moral superiority." But does it? Etymologically, to be fit means to be made; hence, to be suitably made, or adapted. 
--------
1427-> AN OLD GRIEVANCE AIRED; WHY SCIENTISTS MAKE LIGHT OF PROF. COPE'S CHARGES. JEALOUSY GIVEN AS THE REASON OF AN ONSLAUGHT UPON PROF. MARSH AND MAJOR POWELL.
While the American Geological Society was in annual session at the American Museum of Natural History in this city during Christmas week, a long, rambling statement of charges of plagiarism and incompetency against Major John W. Powell, Director of the United States Geological Survey, and Prof. O.C. Marsh, the Paleontologist of Yale University and President of the National Academy of Sciences, was hawked about among the newspaper offices.

J.F. Anderson of Jersey City, the engineer who has been awarded the contract for building the half-a-million-dollar lighthouse off Cape Hatteras, will start in a few days for that tempestuous region to take his preliminary soundings and arrange for the building of his great steel caisson.

1429-> FRANK ARNOLD'S RECORD; THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE TWENTY-FOURTH. THE "TRUST" INVESTIGATION WHICH HE MYSTERIOUSLY DROPPED -- THE FARMERS ARE APATHETIC.
ONEONTA, Oct. 29. -- The Twenty-fourth Congressional District this Fall is considered debatable ground. It was the home of Congressman David Wilber, and he never had any trouble to carry it for the Republicans. If the party was weak at this end of the line Warner Miller could be relied upon from the Herkimer side to swell the Republican majority sufficiently to hold the district firm. 
--------
1430-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The Hatton-Ewart combination had another uncomfortable day yesterday before the committee investigating the Civil Service Commission. They were engaged mainly in trying to show that the commission had failed to observe the principles of the civil service law in the treatment of its own employes, but they ran against the fact that not only the spirit but the letter of the law had been strictly adhered to. 
--------
1431-> THE CONNECTICUT MUDDLE.; A REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE TO MEET -- THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICES.
HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 15. -- The Republican politicians of this State will hold a meeting here this week to devise some plan of action for the Legislature in dealing with the Gubernatorial entanglement.

--------
1434-> Article 35 -- No Title
A TRUE-BRED MAN OF SUSSEX. -- A sketch of the Sussex character could not pretend to completeness in the smallest sense if the question of humor were entirely left out. The South Saxon is, as might be expected, heavy in this as in all else. There is nothing keen or delicate about his perception of the ludicrous; nor is there, on the other hand, much that is ill-natured. 
--------
1435-> THE NORFOLK AND WESTERN.
HUNTINGTON, West Va., May 28. -- The contractors for the construction of the Norfolk and Western Railroad bridge across the Ohio at this point are pushing the work very rapidly, and it is hoped that the bridge can be completed during the present year.

The most valuable stake ever run for in this country certainly, and probably in the world, will be decided at the Sheepshead Bay track this afternoon. It will take but a minute and a quarter for some one of the eighteen horses named below to win the Futurity of 1890 and about $70,000 for the lucky owner of the animal. 
--------
1437-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The appeal to the House of Representatives to validate a charter granted by this State is a proof at once of the futility of this particular charter and of the mischievousness of granting charters promiscuously. It seems that this particular charter is a "strike," not merely against future projectors of a bridge across the Hudson, but against the promoters of a scheme actually and in good faith undertaken. 
--------
1438-> A LOCOMOTIVE EXPLOSION.; ENGINEER AND FIREMAN HURLED LIFELESS THROUGH THE AIR.
BUFFALO, May 11. -- About 2 o'clock this afternoon Lehigh Valley Engine No. 261, George Pearl, engineer, and Henry J. O'Connor, fireman, started for East Buffalo with a string of twenty-seven cars.

SOUTHAMPTON, L.I., July 29. -- The annnal tournament of the Meadow Club was commenced this morning and, as usual, the courts were well surrounded with spectators.

1440-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; WHY ROBERT D. BENEDICT IS A CANDIDATE. AN INTERESTING COMMUNICATION WHICH THE "TRIBUNE" REFUSED TO PRINT FOR A REPUBLICAN.

--------
1442-> GLEASON TAKES A REST; ENJOYING THE BALMY AIR OF A WARMER CLIMATE. SIGNS OF HIS PERSECUTION OF TEACHER BURDICK DRAWING TO AN END -- LAST NIGHT'S HEARING.
The farcical "investigation" which Long Island City's School Board is conducting, with a view to putting Principal A. Hall Burdick of the First Ward School "in a hole," had to be carried on last night without the presence of the leading funny man. His Honor, Mayor Patrick J. Gleason, has temporarily retired from the scene of hostilities. 
--------
1443-> A LEASE RATIFIED.
HARTFORD, Conn., March 14. -- A meeting of the stockholders of the Hartford and Connecticut Western Road was held to-day to act upon a proposition to lease the road to the Central New-England and Western.

--------
1444-> IT VEXES PASSENGERS' SOULS.; NEEDLESS DELAY THE RULE AT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEENTH STREET.
If Col. Hain, Manager of the elevated railroads, would put a phonograph in the elevator building at One Hundred and Sixteenth Street and Eighth Avenue, and after leaving it there for a Week would turn the crank, he would hear a medley of complaint more forcible than elegant from hundreds of the residents in that neighborhood who use the elevators to reach their trains. 
--------
1445-> RULES OF ETIQUETTE.; POINTERS FOR THE PATRONS OF AN EAST SIDE PICNIC RESORT.
The patrons of a certain east side picnic resort have no excuse for not acting with perfect propriety. Rules prescribing the etiquette to be observed in the dancing pavilion are hung about the walls almost as thickly as quills on a porcupine's back. They are for the most part for the benefit of the male patrons, it apparently being taken for granted that the feminine patrons already know how to behave in public.

THE FINE ROLLS. -- The Fine Rolls contain a variety of matter touching the succession to property, with numerous entries relating to the marriage of heiresses and widows, assignments of dower, pardons and forfeitures, aids and taxes, affairs of the Jews, and to similar subjects.

The problem that now presents itself to the financial community, not only in this city but throughout the country, is the gradual retirement of the Clearing House certificates. We see no reason to doubt that this will he accomplished without any serious difficulty.

1450-> LESSONS OF THE BIG RACE; HARVARD MEN HAVE NO REASON TO BE DISCOURAGE. THEIR FORM IS NEARLY PERFECT AND CAPT. COOK SAYS YALE MUST LOOK TO HER LAURELS IN FURTURE.
To everybody who witnessed the aquatic struggle between the university eights of Yale and Harvard over four-mile course of the Thames at New-London last Friday it was patent that Harvard has adopted and is perfecting the principles of what is known as the Cook stroke. The body work, the catch, the finish, and the recover were essentially the same in both boats.

1451-> CHICAGO PLAYHOUSES.
CHICAGO, Nov. 29. -- Thanksgiving week is looked forward to by managers with pleasurable anticipation It usually means for them a gratifying increase of receipts. The past week has been no exception to Thanksgivings in past years. It was rather better than the average. Without a dramatic novelty in the city, every theatre in Chicago has done well, some of them extraordinarily well, and several of them have turned people away. 
--------
1452-> A GREAT WORK WELL DONE.; THE VAST DETAILS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LIGHTHOUSE SYSTEM.
It is not clear to a good many persons why the United States Lighthouse Board is attached to the Treasury Department, and several times the board has been called on to show cause why it should not be transferred from the Treasury to some other department. Once it was proposed in Congress to transfer it to the Navy Department; still later, to the War Department, and finally, by the Forty-third Congress, to the Interior Department.

1453-> THE SIEGE OF SUNDA GUNGE.

LONDON WATER THIEVES. -- The Thames police, one of whose chief stations is under the embankment close to the Frolic, could easily furnish matter for a whole article, seeing that the subject of water thieves or river pirates would come under such heading. And they have many ghastly stories to relate concerning suicides or attempts at it. 
--------
1458-> AMUSEMENTS.
Miss Mabel Stephenson, a young lady who imitates the notes of birds, and who also has a great deal of native humor, easily took the first place in the esteem of the not very numerous audience at Proctor's Twenty-third Street Theatre yesterday afternoon. Miss Stephenson carries you, in mind, to the woods on a June morning.

LONDON, March 29. -- In Russia, all at once, a concerted something has risen to the surface in different parts of the empire which creates wild excitement in the little colony of exiles here and vague unrest throughout Europe.

HAVRE DE GRACE, Md., May 11. -- The fishing season this year has been unusually prosperous. It began early and the catch has been large and lucrative.

The New-York Sun assumes to be the supreme judge and arbiter as to the correct use of the English language.

MADISON, Wis., Nov. 13. -- It is believed by many that if the legality of the recent State election was questioned in court the entire proceedings would be set down as unconstitutional, and therefore void.

The President's choice of a successor to Paymaster General W.B. ROCHESTER curiously illustrates his characteristic inability ever to do exactly the right thing in exactly the right way.

I was pained recently to see Oliver Wendell Holmes climb rather feebly into a horse car, instead of stepping briskly off across the Common as he used to after attending church at King's Chapel.
