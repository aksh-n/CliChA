Having an excellent cast of players and types who seem to fit into their rôles, the film on the whole is an entertaining and charmingly directed work, although at times it lags.It is revealed that the elder Strauss is against his son's determination to study music, even after young Johann demonstrates unusual ability. The father leaves his family because he feels that he is burdened with the necessity of too often replenishing the larder and goes to live at the home of a woman where he hopes for peace in which to compose.His decision hardly makes a better musician of him, but does send his son out into the world in the pursuit of his chosen profession, that of a composer. Young Johann has his début, which his father does not attend for fear of being publicly disgraced. But the boy is a sensation as a writer of waltzes, and his music oon has Vienna and the rest of the world dancing. He is invited to Russia, where he serves the Czar. He returns suddenly to Vienna when he remembers the pastry chef's daughter, with whom he has been in love.He learns on arriving home that the girl is about to be married to another. The picture closes with Strauss playing his favorite composition at the wedding of his former sweetheart.The performance of Imre Raday a the young composer is admirable. He has vigor and enthusiasm and yet his acting is graceful and natural.On the same program is a view of that thrilling melodrama of nature, "Killing the Killer," in which the mongoose destroys the cobra.Other Photoplays."Dangerous Curves," with Clara Bow and Richard Arlen, is the talking film now at the Paramount.The principal attraction at the Mark Strand is "Noah's Ark," with Dolores Costello and George O'Brien."Smiling Irish Eyes," a talking and singing picture, with Colleen Moore, will be presented tomorrow evening at the Central Theatre.At the Hippodrome the feature is "Behind That Curtain," with Warner Baxter and Lois Moran."Piccadilly," with Gilda Gray, is at the Little Carnegie Playhouse.The Film Guild Cinema is offering "Fighting for the Fatherland," a German film."The Power of Darkness" and "Chang" are at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse."Thunderbolt" is at the Rivoli "Bulldog Drummond" at the Apollo, "The Broadway Melody" at the Astor, "Show Boat" at the Colony "Four Feathers" at the Criterion "The Black Watch" at the Gaiety, "Melody Lane" at the Globe.

As in the past, he proves himself to be a master of technical detail and a director who is able to elicit from his players thoroughly competent performances. Never-the-less, this offering is an astonishing mixture, with artificiality vying with realism and comedy hanging on the heels of grim melodrama.Even in the work of the performers, there are moments when they are human beings and then, at times, they become nothing more than Mr. De Mille's puppets. The dialogue is a potpourri of brightness and banality and it was no wonder that the audience in the Capitol yesterday afternoon found humor in scenes that were intended to be serious.Most of this film holds one's attention, but toward the end the incidents become a trifle too bizarre for one's peace of mind.Both Mr. De Mille as the director and Miss Jeanie Macpherson as the author need a restraining hand to guide them, for the result of this audacious adventure becomes a hodge-podge, with characters behaving strangely and conversing in movie epigrams, whether they are at a country club, enjoying the queer series of sporting events, or in danger of death in a coal mine cave-in. The chatter that threads its way through this photoplay can be judged by the avowal of the miner husband of the society woman that he loves her from the top of her silly head to the soles of her feet, and adding that he would like to crown her with a pickaxe. When three persons are presumed to be within a few minutes of death one of the men, a polo player, turns to the girl and asks what she's worrying about!It all begins with Hagon Derk, a coal miner, being sentenced to death for murder. Then it darts to a scene depicting Cynthia Crothers, a society girl, being told that unless she is married and living with her husband on her twenty-third birthday, she will not inherit her grandfather's substantial fortune. Matters become further entangled through the fact that Cynthia is in love with Roger Towne, who "could not set a date for his wedding to Cynthia, because his present wife would not set a date for her diviree."But that is not all for Marcia Towne, Roger's wife, is willing to go to Reno to start divorce proceedings if she receives $50,000 down and $150,000 when the divorce is granted. Cynthia finds herself in a dilemma, being close to her twenty-third birthday. She notices the picture of Derk in a newspaper and is seized by a sudden inspiration. She goes to the jail and there asks Derk whether he will marry her if she pays him $10,000. Derk, a strong character, consents to do so, as he needs the money to save his motherless little girl from being sent to an orphanage.The next turn in the events is the confession by a young man that he committed the murder for which Derk is sentenced to be hanged, and word is sent to the prison warden at the last minute that Derk is innocent.Thus Cynthia finds herself with a hale and healthy husband, but a coal miner instead of a society polo player. Derk invades a party and lets the drunken and excited persons know what he thinks of them. A parrot is heard by Derk to say. "I'm a good girl," and Derk turns to the bird and declares, "You're the only one here!"Derk goes to Cynthia's boudoir later in the evening and flings the package of $10,000 at her and leaves. But the following day Cynthia, having been reminded that she must be living with her husband to inherit the legacy, drives to the mining community and finds Derk. The car in which she motors up to his humble abode is no flivver, but one of the most costly vehicles. She is arrayed in her Fifth Avenue finery, and Derk is ashamed of his rich wife. She, however, has an opportunity to win the hearts of the miners' wives, but, after a thundering browbeating from Derk, she calls up Roger and asks him to come down and rescue her from her unfortunate alliance.The story might have finished then, but Mr. DeMille and Miss Macpherson evidently thought it advisable to have some dynamite brought into the narrative. Hence the scenes down in a mine. Roger goes there with Cynthia, just to tell Derk that he is going to run away with his (Derk's) wife. But fate and Mr. DeMille will otherwise.Kay Johnson shows herself to be an accomplished actress in her impersonation of Cynthia. Charles Bickford gives a splendid performance as Derk, Conrad Nagel, as Roger Towne, does not act up to his usual standard, especially in speaking his lines, all of which is probably the result of direction and the lines given to him. Cecil De Mille's First Talker.DYNAMITE, with Conrad Nagel, Kay Johnson, Charles Bickford, Julia Faye, Joe McCrea, Muriel McCormac, Robert Edeson, William Holden, Henry Stockbridge, Leslie Fenton, Barton Hepburn, Ernest Hillard, June Nash, Nancy Dover, Neely Edwards, Jerry Zier, Rita Leroy, Tyler Brooke and others, an original screen story by Jeanie Macpherson, directed by Cecil B. De Mille; "Bermuda Bound," a stage production, devised by Chester Hale, with Teddy Joyce, "The Runaway Four" and others. At the Capitol.Robert Courtland, who is expected to be the scoundrel of the audible pictorial effusion, "Pointed Heels," ??? at the Paramount, turns out to be a good sport; in fact, a more likable individual than the young music composer who fades out in the end as the winner of Lora Nixon.This "Pointed Toes," named for a show that is produced in the course of the story, is another of those mildly diverting; affairs, with spasmodic bursts of brightness. It is a production in which Helen Kane has an opportunity to sing in her peculiarly inimitable fashion. It has been well directed, with quite a number of impressive camera angles. Florence Ryerson and John V. A. Weaver are credited with the adaptation and Charles Brackett is responsible for the story.There is a faint suggestion that the yarn has been influenced by that unusually successful stage comedy, "Strictly Dishonorable," for Courtland behaves in very much the same manner as the singer in the footlights offering.Frequently the director, A. Edward Sullivan, together with the adaptors, endeavors to steer clear of conventional ideas in this film.During the yarn, Courtland, who is a stage producer, believes that "Dot and Dash," a song and dance team impersonated by Helen Kane and Richard (Skeets) Gallagher, are going to spoil his show by making their act too formal. He, therefore, decides to permit them to indulge in a drinking bout, with the result that "Dot and Dash" come out in their low comedy regalia and make a hit.The story deals with a young composer named Donald Ogden, whose allowance is stopped by his mother because he weds Lora Nixon. Lora goes back to her stage work, and after Courtland has brought about a misunderstanding between Lora and her young husband he prevails on her to accompany him to his apartment, where she drinks far more than is good for her. After that Courtland turns noble, and despite his admiration for Lora he brings her and her husband together again. And what may be of some importance is the fact that Donald's contribution to the show, "Pointed Heels," is the piece de resistance. So all are very happy in the end.William Powell's acting as Courtland is highly commendable. Fay Wray is charming as Lora and Helen Kane is herself. A Noble Scoundrel.POINTED HEELS, with William Powell, Fay Wray, Helen Kane, Richard Gallagher Phillips Holmes, Adrienne Dore and Eugene Pallette, based on a story by Charles Brackett, directed by A. Edward Sutherland; "Now and Then," staged by Jack Partington, with Paul Ash, Charies Withers and company, Ward Sisters and others; Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Crawford, organists. At the Paramount Theatre.

461-> THE SCREEN; A Talking Farce-Comedy. Peace and War.
The intermittent passages of tumult and shouting in "The Fall of Eve," a talking pictorial farce-comedy presented last night at the little Embassy Theatre by Columbia Pictures Corporation, were greeted with loud laughter and stray chuckles. It is a film in which the producers reveal an overwhelming fondness for sound in stentorian volume. And most of the players were equipped with lung power sufficient to meet the desires of the director, Frank Strayer. It is true that this film has a certain quality of mirth, but, how welcome would be an occasional whisper or a soft voice!The dialogue is the work of Frederic and Fanny Hatton, and while it is nothing brilliant, nothing sauvc or subtle, it often opens up the way to ludicrous incidents. The characters involved are not called upon to be especially observant or intelligent. In fact it is their stupidity that results in the blacksmithean type of humor.In this picture, Ford Sterling, long a comedian in silent films, makes his début with a voice. And, allowing for the delicate mechanism of the microphone, Mr. Sterling does far better in this offering than he has in most of his latter-day mute parts, for he has at least been curbed of his tendency to act as though all the other characters were deaf. Here he has a chance to use his voice and nobody will be able to say that he can't be heard, except possibly in a fraction of the film when the sound failed. Whether there is any color to his tones is a matter of opinion. He succeeds, however, in talking as if he meant what he was saying. He is aided and abetted a good deal of the time by Jed Prouty, who also sees to it that those in the rear seats of ???e theatre have their money's worth of voice. Every seat is a front seat with both Mr. Sterling and Mr. Prouty, so far as this production is concerned.Patsy Ruth Miller is sometimes quite good, but now and again she lapses in her enunciation. Betty Farrington, an actress of unusual weight, succeeds not only in being heard, but also in imitating a woman who has spent an evening imbibing freely of alcoholic beverages. Gertrude Astor endeavors to give a portrayal of a haughty wife in high dudgeon. One might say that all the voices, with the exception of Miss Miller and Arthur Rankin, seem to have been tested for carrying power rather than for any tonal nuances.The merriment consists of Tom Ford Sr. making arrangements for his prospective customer. Mr. Mack, to go out with him and Eve Grant (Miss Miller). Mrs. Mack (Betty Farrington) insists, however, on accompanying her husband and therefore Eve is introduced as Mrs. Tom Ford. The real Mrs. Tom Ford is spending a week-end—or intended doing so—with friends, but during a bridge rubber she hears over the radio that a certain selection in a night club has been requested by Mr. and Mrs. Tom Ford, which causes her to be more than slightly disturbed. She decides abruptly to return to her home, and while she is on her way Mr. Ford, his son, Tom Ford Jr., and Mr. and Mrs. Mack experience some hectic moments due chiefly to the persistence of Mrs. Mack.One of the more or less laughable situations occurs in the night club, when Tom Ford Jr., who is in love with Eve, enters with the badge of a revenue officer. Mr. Mack at that moment is emptying his flask into a glass, and as soon as he realizes that the eye of the law is upon him he drops the flask under the table and kicks it as far as he can.The real Mrs. Ford, who is expected momentarily by the audience, arrives during a relatively quiet period of the fuss, Mr. Mack, whom she has never seen, has left his noisy wife to forage in the ice-box. Mrs. Ford observes the shadow of the stranger and adds to the boisterousness of this adventure by calling the police. And the man who answers her call is impersonated by Fred Kelsey, who hasn't the least sonorous voice in Hollywood.It ends very much in the way one expects, and after the "tumult and the shouting" died away the little Embassy Theatre was itself again, for all the voices of the friends of the producers and others did not make anything like the din that came from the screen during the more obstreperous stretches of the picture. A Talking Farce-Comedy.THE FALL OF EVE, with Patsy Ruth Miller, Ford Sterling, Gertrude Astor, Arthur Rankin, Jed Prouty, Betty Farrington and Fred Kelsey, dialogue by Frederic and Fanny Hatton, directed by Frank Strayer; "Falling Stars," a talking short comedy; "Talking Screen Snapshots;" "At a Talkie Studio;" "The Parlor Pest," with Beyco Combe. At the Embassy Theatre.Although the planting of the story in a place that might be anywhere and having a clash of arms between nameless nations rather vitiates the drama of the Ufa silent film. "At the Edge of the World," the individual sequences are invariably interesting. It is an agreeable change to look upon the activities inside an old windmill. Karl Grune, the director, also has contrasted skilfully the prosperity and happiness of peace with the destruction and anguish of war.It is a queer narrative, for the miller and his family, from their manner of living and the way they dress, might be fifty years behind the time, and yet the soldiers introduced during the last half of the picture are clad in what is supposed to be mud-colored uniforms of some future time. These ultra-modern warriors have peculiar steel helmets, weird rifles, and their big guns seem to belch forth poisonous gas after a shell is sent on its way. Then there is a mysterious, saturnine spy, who pretends to be a peddler. He pays money to a poor fool to lay a telephone wire under the old mill.There are times when Mr. Grune's direction is most expert, but during some of the passages he permits the actions of his characters to be so fitful and fast that their movements remind one of the pictures of twenty years ago. His glimpses of the work in the old mill and the preparations being made for the celebrating of the 200th anniversary of the structure are, however, worth all his flashes of symbolism and fighting.The carnival attended by the people from the countryside is nicely pictured, with merry-go-rounds, sideshows and dancing. The holiday spirit, with joyousness and contentment, prevails. It is during this scene that the news comes that war has been declared. Mr. Grune switches from the gay throng to half a dozen black-cloaked riders and soon the smiling faces become dark and solemn.Brigitte Helm, who will be remembered for her clever work in "Metropolis,'" in this current offering, officiates as the romantic miller's daughter. She is not particularly well cast for the rôle, but her acting is capable. Albert Steinrueck is capital as the old miller. Erwin Faber does well as a spy and Victor Janson is impressive as a beefy, scowling army Captain. Peace and War.AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, with Albert Steinrueck, Wilhelm Dicterle, Imre Raday, Brigitte Helm, Camilla von Hollay, Erwin Faber, Max Schreck, Victor Janson and Jean Bradin, a Ufa production directed by Karl Grune; "Bedrock of Manhattan"; "We Faw Down," a comedy.

756-> WILLIAM BOYD IN TALKIE.; "His First Command" Is Shown at the Hippodrome. Other Photoplays.
A slow-paced talking picture with insipid dialogue is "His First Command," a film now at the Hippodrome. William Boyd is a rather passive player, and in this photoplay he scarcely seems to take an interest in what is going on about him. Dorothy Sebastian, too, usually a competent performer, appears to be uninterested in the proceedings.At times the film becomes tedious because the lines, delivered by adults, are like those spoken by youngsters in a Booth Tarkington play. The story seems to be a combination of characters from successful films of several years. The smart aleck technique of William Haines, the swearing of Victor McLaglen, the manliness of Jack Holt and the American young man characterizations of Richard Dix are all rolled into one ineffectual character called Terry Culver.The tale describes a millionaire's son who, while in Kansas, is attracted by the daughter of a commanding officer at Fort Riley. He joins the army to be near her. She secretly loves him, but thinks him too impertinent to be deserving of her affection. He proves his mettle by rescuing little Eva from under the hoofs of the onrushing steeplechasers and wins his commission, the girl and the troop's admiration.Other Photoplays.First National's Vitaphone version of "Sally," featuring Marilyn Miller. will be presented this evening at the Winter Garden."The Lost Patrol," a British production, with Cyril McLaglen, is in its second week at the Cameo.At the Film Guild Cinema the screen offerings are "Metropolis" and "Streets of Sorrow""The Manxman," based on Sir Hall Caine's novel, is now on view at the Little Carnegie Playhouse."The Unwritten Law," a British sound production, will be the film offering for the new Little Picture House, 151 East Fiftieth Street, which opens its doors to the public on Christmas Day."The Royal Box," the first full-length American talking picture to be made in German, will be presented tomorrow evening at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse.At the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse the screen attraction is "Meister-singer," a German film."Tiger Rose," with Lupe Velez, will be presented at the opening of the new Warners' Beacon Theatre tomorrow evening."Seven Keys to Baldpate," the audible pictorial adaptation of the play by George M.

1109-> THE SCREEN; Queer Happenings. A Wise Manikin.
Charles Rogers, that popular young screen performer, is to be seen at the Paramount in an audible pictorial transcription of Arthur Train's story, "Illusion," a production sadly lacking in imaginative direction and in which the dialogue is more often than not open to derision.Lothar Mendes, the director, does not reveal much skill in the filming of his scenes, and as for the lines, they are more distressing than diverting. There is little that is convincing in the episodes, whether they are concerned with the stage act of Carlee Thorpe, who doesn't do much of anything, or in the sight of four men taking aim at a girl with army rifles, loaded, as they suppose, with regulation ammunition.Nancy Carroll gives quite a good performance, nevertheless one wonders in what theatre they could get four men to fire at a girl, even though one of the screen theatre's spectators explains, after the act, that the illusionist is supposed to replace the real cartridges with graphite missiles. And, also, it might seem somewhat dangerous for anybody to stand up against such missiles, considering the short distance the girl is from the rifles.Carlee Thorpe, the conjurer, fascinates a would-be society girl named Hilda Schmittlap, whose family is hindered in its social aspirations through the fact that Jacob Schmittlapp, the father, began life as a truck driver.Carlee, impersonated by Mr. Rogers, plays bridge with the winsome Hilda Schmittlap, and becomes so charmed by her that he neglects the partner in his act. Then comes the hardly inspired idea of the Schmittlaps not knowing that Carlee is on the stage, or that he has a queer act. Claire Jernigan, Carlee's partner, decides to leave him, understanding that the young man is in love with the Schmittlap girl. It seems at first that Claire is much better off, but to lend a bitter touch to her life with another similar performer, this individual browbeats the girl.The dénouement is worked out with all the finesse with which a village blacksmith might accomplish it. A real bullet is in one of the rifles being fired at Claire, and the warning from a woman is too late to stop the pulling of the trigger. But fear not for Claire, for she is only slightly hurt in the arm, and soon the benighted Carlee tells her in the hospital the old, old story and Hilda is cast aside.Another angle to this clumsy piece of fiction is that of having Hilda's wayward brother quite interested in Claire. This idea, of course, helps to bring the silly Carlee to his senses.Mr. Rogers is probably acceptable in the rôle. June Collyer and Nancy Carroll, however, do the best work. Regis Toomey, who portrays Hilda's bibulous brother, gives a performance which reveals that under more natural circumstances he might do highly creditable work.This picture was adapted by E. Lloyd Sheldon, a Harvard graduate, who obviously stoops to conquer his audiences. Whether he succeeds or not depends upon the type of spectators who happen to witness this dull offering. Queer Happenings.ILLUSION, with Charles Rogers, Nancy Carroll, June Collyer, Kay Francis, Regis Toomey, Knute Erickson, Eugenie Beaserer, Maude Turner Gordon, William Austin, Emelie Melville, Frances Raymond, Katherine Wallace, John E. Nash, Eddie Kane and others, based on a story by Arthur Train, directed by Lothar Mendes; Abe Lyman and his "Californians" in "Believe It or Not." At the Paramount Theatre.Although a good deal of merriment was aroused in the Mark Strand yesterday afternoon by passages in "Hard to Get," a Vitaphone production, this feature does not possess any marked originality either in plot or dialogue. It is said to have been suggested by one of Edna Ferber's stories, but one cannot say that the spirit of the author survives.Dorothy Mackaill acts well and talks naturally. She impersonates Bobby Martin, who toils all day as a manikin in a fashionable dressmaker's, but, like quite a number of screen heroines, is somewhat ashamed of her humble abode. She is not averse to accepting rides proffered by young men driving their own automobiles, but she resents any impertinence. One of the chief reasons for the audience liking this effusion yesterday afternoon was the fact that a wealthy philanderer is put in his place by Bobby Martin, and in the end, instead of becoming mistress of a Fifth Avenue mansion, she contents herself by consenting to become the bride of Jerry Dillon.During one episode, Miss Martin is riding in a costly car with Dexter Courtland, who has more money than manners. He asks the girl where she lives, and the dauntless Bobby, bearing in mind the address of a customer in the afternoon, tells her escort a house on Fifth Avenue. This makes matters quite interesting for Dexter, as the address happens to be his own.Bobby has a nice old father and a genial mother, but her brother is an artist in flip phrases, so much so that one would rather close one's eyes and ears to those periods when he is on the screen. He has a harsh voice and bellows at his sister, making fun of her disappointments. Bobby Martin, however, is not the type of girl to go around with tears in her eyes, for she prefers to let this brother and other men know just what she thinks of them. She is at first deceived by Dexter Courtland, but when her eyes are opened to his behavior she is only too glad to leave the screen in the last fade-out in the arms of Mr. Dillon, a rough diamond to whom she does not have to make any pretenses concerning her family or her dwelling.Pa Martin is somewhat disappointed in realizing that hopes of living in a palatial abode have vanished, but he appreciates that he has an honest, hard working son-in-law in Jerry.And so the ending is a happy one, which Quite evidently found sympathy with the early throng of spectators. A Wise Manikin.HARD TO GET, with Dorothy Machaill, Jimmie Finlayson, Louise Fazenda, Jack Oakie, Edmund Burns, Clarissa Selwynne and Charles Delancy, based on a story by Edna Ferber, directed by William Beaudine.

1115-> "ART" STUDENT IN A FILM.; "Half Marriage" at the Hippodrome Was Converted to Sound.
"Half Marriage" is another program picture converted to sound. Its theme concerns the marriage of a wealthy girl to one of her father's poorly paid employes. The ending of the film is a nappy one, its theme song the usual chanson about "clouds rolling by" and the supporting characters include a collection of vaudeville entertainers and former screen acrobats who simulate men-about-town, Greenwich Village artists wearing Windsor ties and other oddities.Olive Borden portrays the rôle of Judy, an art student who toys with men until one of them falls to his death from a ledge high above a street in Greenwich Village where Judy lives, studying art and entertaining her friends with uproarious cocktail parties.Judy's secret husband does the right thing by his wife and takes the blame on his own shoulders, only to be vindicated by the man from headquarters, who proves to be a combination of Sherlock Holmes, a philosopher of the Edgar Guest genre and a "good guy who understands this sort of thing."The picture is occasionally interrupted by Ken Murray, "one of the boys," whose idea of fun is to waltz with another man for a few moments and then throw his partner over his shoulder and on the floor with a thump that surely broke some bones. This trick brought roars of laughter from the film players on the screen and also the Hippodrome audience.By far the most interesting part of the program was a film compilation of the high moments of the greatest boxing matches for fifteen years. Once again Firpo knocks Dempsey through the ropes into the laps of the ringsiders and a slow-motion camera discloses the details of "the Battle of the Long Count."

1128-> CRITICS CLASH OVER MOISSI
THE premiere of Warner Brothers' "The Royal Box," which took place in the Titania-Palast in Berlin toward the end of November, appears to have divided German film critics into two opposing camps. On the one hand, it is asserted that Alexander Moissi, the well-known German actor who plays the part of Edmund Kean, the British actor-hero of the piece, is far below par in the dialogue picture, and that the reproduction is poor, while, on the other, it is averred that Moissi is fine and the machine all right. On the negative side a writer in the Frankfurter Zeitung said:"The technical reproduction is bad; at times nothing can be understood, which is especially distressing because they are talking on the screen all the time. It may be that this defect is partly due to the apparatus, but the two leading players certainly are responsible for some of it. Moissi plays very old-fashioned theatre right along and tries to surprise the spectators, as if he wanted to make a hit at a lecture. Nobody knew that Camilla Horn could talk, and she doesn't prove that she can in this film either. * * * Even the Steglitz public burst into loud laughter several times when Moissi, on the canvas, talked pathetic stuff in a pathetic way. The high 'C' of the older dramatists, especially the simple cry 'Beloved!' simply is not caught by the technical apparatus of the sound films. When in one scene, however, Moissi began to play Hamlet and to repeat the monologue 'To be or not to be,' silence fell upon the audience. With a few words Shakespeare bridged the centuries and imposed quiet. We could have listened to him for hours."Among the approving critics is the writer in the Berlin Vorwärts, who remarked:"Alexander Moissi as Kean dominates the situation. The other players act mechanically in comparison. Moissi, who was a failure in the silent films, because in his case mimicry and gestures only win life and expression through the spoken word, plays here 100 per cent dramatically and develops a wonderful theatrical grace. His intense voice loses hardly any of its charm. This Kean is a really great theatrical accomplishment."
