5-> Observance of the Sabbath.
The Sabbath is for man, and it is for the best part of him, the only part that will endure. It is most reasonable, therefore, to ask him to observe it. It is intended wholly for his happiness.

There is no occasion for any prolonged investigation to find out whether there are such things as trusts and "combines," or to ascertain whether any of them carry on their operations within this State.

The dropping of the free-lunch provision in the amendment of the Raines law affords a fine illustration of the motives that prevail in that kind of legislation.

--------
41-> THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO.
What is the matter with the Sultan of Morocco? Does he think that he is a Turk? Or does he imagine that the United States is a concert of powers which can be put out of tune by a brown-skinned barbarian who lives on the shore of "a tideless, dolorous, midland sea"? The poor fellow never went to a public school, to be sure, and hence has never studied the history of the United States.

--------
162-> OUT OF THEIR OWN MOUTHS.
We trust that every business man among our readers examined the table we published yesterday morning, giving the Dingley committee's estimates of revenue and rates of duty under the new bill. They have set out to increase the revenue by increasing duties, and they calmly assume that the higher duties will not check imports, but will stimulate them. 
--------
163-> IDEAL HOMES ON THE HUDSON.
IF the thousands of sightseers who constantly stream into New York and go away with the impression that the rich men of the city live in dull and dreary-looking mansions, crowded into what is known as the fashionable quarter, few if any take the trouble to go just a little beyond the city limits and see the residences that for picturesque situation and beauty of landscape rival the far-famed manors on the Rhine or Thames.

In Africa alone Germany has nearly a million square miles of colonial possession--an area nearly five times as large as the whole German Empire in Europe.

At a time when Greece is again threatened with annihilation and when the eyes of a sympathizing world are more eagerly than hopefully watching to see whether her people can display to-day that dauntless and stubborn courage which in ancient times so often kept the outnumbering barbarians at bay, Mr. Hogarth's two essays upon Philip and Alexander of Macedon must find a wide and appreciative audience.

184-> AN ANTI-ENGLISH ALLIANCE.; Reported Purpose of Emperor William's Visit to St. Petersburg.
LONDON, Aug. 7. -- The leading question in Continental political circles is. Will the visit of Emperor William of Germany to St. Petersburg result in a German-Russian-French understanding directed against Great Britain?

199-> On the Burmo-Chinese Frontier.
The Kakhyen houses are totally unlike those of the Chinese, Burmese, or Shans. and are very much superior, both architecturally and in interior arrangement to any of the three.

210-> ENGLAND'S FOREIGN POLICY IN VICTORIA'S REIGN.
Under the many Ministers who have served her Majesty in the sixty years of her reign the foreign policy of England has exhibited a remarkable steadiness and fidelity to the settled traditions of the empire.

--------
219-> BOYLE AND HAWAII.
The farmers of Middlesex County, N.J., love their country and their country's flag. But there is an exception. THOMAS BOYLE has put up the Stars and Stripes as a scarecrow in his cornfield. BOYLE degrades the emblem of liberty, the symbol of his country's greatness and power, to the level of those effigies of old clothes stuffed with straw and crowned with battered hats with which farmers are accustomed to people their cornfields.

222-> PITTSBURG PRICES.
PITTSBURG, March 20. -- Our market has displayed a broadening tendency during the past week, particularly in the investment department.

The debate in the Senate over the conference report upon the Immigration bill turned very largely upon the clause which prohibits the introduction into this country of "occasional labor."

--------
227-> NOT A PROTECTIONIST MOVE.
We observe that England's denunciation of her commercial treaties with Germany and Belgium is regarded in some quarters as a protectionist move, a departure from the policy of free trade which she adopted half a century ago. It is just the opposite of that. It is an extension of the principle of freer trade. 
--------
228-> TAKE PROFITS AND WAIT.
William L. Stow: " The market is getting to a point where caution and conservatism are going to be profitable. I am afraid that the pace has been a little too hot. The rise has been a remarkable one in many ways -- chiefly for its rapidity. And there has been hardly a recession since stocks began to go up. This is unnatural.

--------
231-> A STRANGE DELUSION.
In consequence of the unwise restriction put into the State Constitution by the convention on 1894, the State Prison Commission and the Superintendent of State Prisons are at their wits' end for means of keeping convicts employed to the extent necessary for their health and good discipline, to say nothing of the cost of their maintenance and the reformatory effect of industrial habits.

235-> The Castes.
"In India all save the lowest caste, what we call pariahs, can rise in the world, as we Western folk count rising. They can become as rich as they like; they can enter Government service, become merchants, lawyers, anything they please. But caste is religious and social distinction which is self-supporting, self-contained.

--------
243-> Opposed to Kanakas.
The letter of "Old South Sea Trader" in your issue of the 15th inst. calls attention to another phase of the Hawaiian iniquity -mentioning the "fine race." Of what use or benefit has the native Kanaka ever been to civilization except as a "boat steerer" in old style whaling days? (if kept well primed with New England rum.) 
--------
244-> THE NEW CIVIL SERVICE LAW.; Exception Taken to the Tests Applied by the Board of Police.
In the general condemnation pronounced by honest men against the new civil service law it seems that the civil service of the Police Department ought to be included. Is it not the practical application of the present civil service measure? As far as romotions in the department are concerned, it certainly is. The maximum percentage for the mental examination is 35. 
--------
245-> THE COAL STRIKE.
The force of the coal miners' strike seems to be broken by the substantial failure to make it general in West Virginia and in Illinois. The only hope that the leaders of the strike had of being able to enforce their demands lay in their ability practically to stop production and bring the pressure of interests thus injured upon the employers. 
--------
246-> SENATORIAL "BULLS."
It is a pity that the stock gamblers in the Senate of the United States are not better equipped for their vocation as stock gamblers, as well as for their avocation as lawmakers. If they were, they would know that there are two sides to the market, and that money is to be made on the "short" side as well as on the "long." 
--------

--------
255-> THE BENIN SLAUGHTER.
British history repeats itself in the Benin massacre. The familiar procedures by which the blessings of civilization have been conferred upon so many other barbaric communities are here repeated.

The Hazlitt memoirs, which have just appeared in London from the hands of Mr. Carew Hazlitt, with the title "Four Generations of a Literary Family: The Hazlitts in England, Ireland, and America; Their Friends and Their Failures, 1726-1896," have not made a good impression.

--------
261-> PURE BEER BILL.; Arguments Heard For and Against the Measure.

272-> HAS ANDREE CROSSED THE POLE?
While Dr. EKHOLA, who was associated with ANDREE last year, is inclined to frown upon the first of the carrier pigeon stories, that from the neighborhood of Soevda, in Rifylke, the second tale about a second bird, from near Tromsoe Island, in Norway, whence ANDREE started for Spitzbergen, seems to be credited. 
--------
273-> THE PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY.; Decrease in Receipts for Ministerial Relief -- Report on the Presbyterian Building in New York.

--------
274-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
If the remarks of Dr. AUSTIN FLINT, in a discussion of "Disease and Crime," are correctly reported, he declared against capital punishment in the sweeping assertion that "the physician should never countenance a judicial murder, for it is a murder to take a human life." Though we find the statement in marks of quotation, we call hardly believe that a man of such eminent ability and undoubted reasoning power could so "beg the question." 
--------

--------
384-> WHY MOSS?
We are sorry to say it, but the Mayor has made a wretched appointment to the Police Board in place of Mr. ROOSEVELT. What perverse spirit of the air could have guided his mind in selecting Mr. FRANK MOSS, counsel to the Parkhurst Society, as a fit person to be Police Commissioner? 
--------

397-> GOOD FOR ONLY ONE HOUR.; Coney Island's Wave of Reform Begins Bravely, but Goes Out with the Tide.
For an hour yesterday it appeared as if Coney Island was to be reformed, but it was only for that hour, and afterward the good old times prevailed. The temporary purity was due to the fact that at Police Headquarters some one discovered an old law which prohibits everything at Coney Island with the exception of life itself. 
--------
398-> USELESS HOLIDAYS.
We have been glad to note the response which has come to our suggestion that the making of LINCOLN'S birthday a public holiday in the State of New York was an improvident and unwise piece of legislation. That we have too many public holidays, and that we have some of them at the wrong times, is just now brought powerfully to the attention of the business world.

--------
403-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; MANY SALES LAST WEEK FOR SMALL CONSIDERATIONS. The Two Largest Transactions by Brokers -- What the Auctioneers Are Doing -- Latest Sales at Private Contract.
The past week was a quiet one in the brokers' offices, if the information regarding sales negotiated can be relied on. Their transactions were numerous enough, more numerous, in fact, than during any previous week of 1897, but as they included only three in which good-sized considerations are involved, the aggregate investment was a trifle less than it has been during the recent six-day periods. 
--------
404-> DEATH DUE TO FALLING WIRES.; More Persons Killed by These than by Railroad Accidents.
We have recently had an opportunity to examine a batch of newspaper clippings giving accounts of accidents due to the falling of electric wires. These clippings cover the months from May to September, inclusive, but it is not to be supposed that we have found in them reports of all or nearly all the accidents of that character which have taken place. 
--------
405-> THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR'S PLACE; Sir Julian Pauncefote Says He Has Made No Protests.
WASHINGTON, April 22. -- Ambassador Pauncefote has been made the subject of some statements concerning himself that appear to have been without foundation, otherwise than in the minds of those who wrote them.

POUGHKEEPSIE, June 22. -- Yale's freshmen gave their coaches, trainers, and followers a bad scare for a time to-day. Some of the men drank some milk last night which did not agree with them.

Rowing in the Harlem River yesterday was more like hard work than play, from the fact that the high wind which prevailed all day was not only difficult to row against, but it kicked up a choppy sea that threatened to swamp every boat out and did swamp two. Not a boat returned to a float without being half full of water, and many narrow escapes from a swim were recorded.

--------
441-> CORPORATION FINANCE.
If genius were really the faculty for taking infinite pains, Mr. THOMAS L. GREENE, auditor of the Manhattan Trust Company, should be credited with genius. But as a matter of fact the capacity for such intelligent painstaking as he shows in his little book on "Corporation Finance" is nearly as rare as genius and more useful in the field that he has entered and may almost be said to have opened.

--------
453-> McKINLEY'S CABINET CRITICISED.; Republicans Not Pleased with the Present Outlook.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23. -- A tone of regret begins to be heard in all the comments upon the make-up of the Cabinet of Mr. McKinley as it has been announced in the newspapers from day to day. The most conspicuous surprise is expressed about the selection of Mr. Sherman, although it has been assumed from the first that he was to be Secretary of State. 
--------
454-> A POWDER TRUST PROPOSED.; Three California Companies Negotiating for Combination.
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9. -- A morning paper says: "Negotiations for the formation of a powder combine are again very active. It is understood that an agreement has been reached by the Judson, California, and Giant Companies to advance the price of powder in Colorado and Montana 2 cents a pound, and not to enter into any new contracts on this coast for thirty days. 
--------
455-> Suggestion of a Card to be Handed to Those Needing It.
It is very unpleasant when you are traveling in the surface cars or elevated trains to call the attention of a person who may be sitting beside you or opposite you who is spitting to the fact that it is forbidden. I have frequently done it, and sometimes have been insulted and at other times they have apologized. 
--------
456-> LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.; A Blue Jacket's Comments on a Hostile Article Published About American Sailors There.
When the Minneapolis was at Gibraltar, Spain, a clipping from THE TIMES was placed upon our bulletin board, of which we have this to say: 
--------

--------
459-> THEATRICAL BILLS FOR THIS WEEK.
The return of Mr. and Mrs. Taber will be cordially welcomed, and it is not unlikely that their engagement will be prosperous. Julia Marlowe has steadfastly held to a high standard, throughout her stage career, in the new plays she has produced, as well as in the old ones she acts in. 
--------
460-> DANGER OF OPEN STREETS; President Wilson of the Health Board Declares Them a Public Menace. SUBWAYS THE ONLY REMEDY Underground New York a Maze of Pipes Devoid of System -- Gases from Foul Earth Dangerous -- False Economy of Present Methods.
" I am heartily in favor of a system of subways," said President Wilson of the Board of Health yesterday. "If we had these subways now," he added, with a smile, "there would be some means at least of passing along the streets and avenues that have been torn up for repaying so long. But, seriously, I consider the subways an absolute necessity in our advanced state of growth and development. 
--------
461-> MANHATTAN AND THE BEARS.
The reduction in the Manhattan dividend was by no means a surprise to Wall Street. The stock has been sold down on rumors of such reduction for the past two weeks. And it was generally supposed that there was a very large short interest in Manhattan in anticipation of the action of the Directors. The professional element was said to be heavily short of the stock. 
--------
462-> THE GRADUATED TRANSFER TAX.
We doubt if many of our readers understand the scope and effect of the bill which has passed the Legislature and now awaits the Governor's approval, providing for a "graduated transfer tax." Most of them probably do not know how that which started as a "collateral inheritance" tax and afterward became a general "inheritance" tax got transformed into a "transfer" tax. 
--------
463-> Arctic Books and Travel.; EXPEDITION NORTH AND SOUTH THIS YEAR -- THE FAR SOUTH NEGLECTED BY US.
It is admitted to be the prerogative of every person who has passed beyond the imaginary lines that bound the polar zones to write a narrative of his adventures, together with an exposition of his theory as to the best rout to the pole. Almost every expedition has given birth to one book; most expeditions have brought forth two. 
--------
464-> TAMMANY TALK AND PLANS.; Justice Morgan J. O'Brien Spoken of for the Mayoralty -- Committee Meetings Friday.
The last name mentioned conspicuously as a Tammany Mayoralty candidate is that of Supreme Court Justice Morgan J. O'Brien. While Justice O'Brien has in no way intimated that he is a candidate, some of his closest friends have been quietly urging his selection upon many politicians. Supreme Court Justices Dugro and Giegerich have already been mentioned in connection with the Mayoralty. 
--------
465-> SOCIETY; EVENTS OF THE WEEK.
" The rains descended and the floods came." This is the record of New York society, now scattered through all the various inland and coast resorts since last Sunday. From Sunday until Thursday afternoon it rained persistently, continuously, and consistently, and confined within doors the lovers of gayety could only look out upon muddy roads, sodden fields, cloud-covered hills and mountains, or angry seas lashing the dull brown strand. 
--------
466-> THE CITY FAR FROM DRY; No Difficulty Experienced by Thirsty Citizens in Obtaining Drinks. CLUBS WERE NOT MOLESTED. Few Arrests for Violation of the Excise Law -- The Police Say the Statute Is Being Observed Throughout the Precincts.
As far as the possibility of obtaining liquor is concerned yesterday was much the same as the other Sundays have been since the amendments to the Raines law went into effect. There was no lack of drinks to be had, and there were few sections of the city where the thirsty man had to walk many blocks to satisfy his appetite. 
--------
467-> Article 2 -- No Title
THE latest performance of the Elizabethan Stage Society in London comprised the old play, "The Lamentable and True Tragedy of Master Arden of Feversham, in Kent," and a part of "Edward III."

WASHINGTON, April 10. -- About all the information that can be obtained concerning the work of the Republicans of the Senate Finance Committee on the Tariff bill has come so far from those persons who were endeavoring to shape the bill for the Senate. The members of the committee who are doing all the work are Senators Allison, Aldrich, Platt of Connecticut, and Wolcott. AIr. bIorrill has not addressed himself to this work. 
--------
474-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Private Sales Reported -- No Business in the Auction Room.
Jesse C. Bennett  Co. have sold for Henry E. Woodward, to James Livingston, the eight-story apartment house, Orienta, 153 and 155 East Seventy-second Street, 40 by 100.

Mr. Nahan Franko, being about to depart for foreign shores to exhibit himself to the admiring multitudes which there await his coming, gave a farewell concert last night in Carnegie Hall.

477-> EVERY FAVORITE A WINNER; Bookmakers at Brighton Track Dispirited While Followers of Form Were Happy. DWYER'S LOSSES AT SARATOGA Reported that His Winnings on Ben Brush Enabled Him to Settle His Obligations in Full -- Yesterday's Sport Excellent.
It is only at rare intervals that every favorite on a day's racing programme wins, but such was the case at Brighton Beach yesterday, and when the seventh race was over the bookmakers wended their way from the track with wry faces and depleted bankrolls, while the followers of form were happy because they had more of the bookmakers' money in their pocketbooks than they have carried away for a long time. 
--------
478-> LIVES LOST IN A WRECK; Disaster on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in Indiana, Owing to the Heavy Rains. AN EMBANKMENT GIVES WAY. The Engine, Baggage Car, and Smoker Drop into Six Feet of Water -- Some of the Men Are Drowned -- Damage to the Line.

Five men were killed and two seriously injured, as follows: ... 
--------
479-> The Colonial Almanacs.; FRANKLIN'S WORKS AND OTHERS LESS FAMOUS BUT VERY CURIOUS.
The Bible and almanacs, it has been said, formed the chief reading material of our Colonial ancestors, and if with the Bible might be included sermons, religious tracts, and dissertations, the statement contains a large measure of truth. The popularity of the almanac for 150 years was undiminished. Beginning with 1639, the great almanac period continued up to the Revolution. 
--------
480-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
Much talk is heard of what bombastic things Congress may do, or threatens to do this week. Some timid souls are apprehensive that proceedings at Washington may badly affect the financial world. It will be a tribute to the financial world's stupidity if such a thing can be. 
--------
481-> IN EXHIBITION OF SEWING; Progress in the Training of American and Foreign Children Contrasted. FRANCE LEADS THE WORLD. President Hubbell of the Board of Education Speaks on the Value of Industrial Education -- Need for a Better System Here -- Some Colonial Work.
Mrs. Richard Irwin, as President of the New York Association of Sewing Schools, opened last evening the exhibition of work which the association is holding in the American Art Galleries, 6 East Twenty-third Street.

--------
482-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
Very likely Mr. CECIL RHODES could not have done better for himself than by making the frank and cynical avowal which he has made of his purposes and methods in South Africa. Yet he appears in his own recital as a perfectly unscrupulous filibuster, aiming to anglicize South Africa without the least regard to the rights of the previous occupants. 
--------
483-> KAISER'S CABINET CHANGES.; Count Posadowsky-Wehner and Dr. Miquel to Succeed to Dr. von Boetticher's Offices.

LONDON, June 4. -- The English "booking" system extends even to the sale of seats for the Jubilee procession. In all the business streets through which the procession is to pass half the shop windows bear the sign, "Jubilee Procession. Seats Booked Inside for This Wind." The prices paid for seats are so high that the ordinary shopkeeper cannot afford to keep his show window for the use of his family and friends. 
--------
488-> A CHELSEA COURT RULING.; Memoranda Owned by the Prisoner Captured from the Police at the Trial.
BOSTON, May 23. -- An interesting point was ruled on by Judge Fitz, in the Chelsea Police Court yesterday in the case of Jerome Cronin, who was arrested in Revere a few nights ago.

Reardon, after a desperate resistance, on a charge of robbing Richard Wood at Ocean Avenue and Bartholdi Place, where Lincoln was formerly employed. 
--------
494-> THE DEPARTED PATRIARCHS.
The disbandment of the Patriarchs may excite some mournful reflections on the vicissitudes of things, since the formation and maintenance of the association was the lifework of the late WARD McALLISTER. But, apart from that consideration, it is not to be regretted. Of course, the Patriarchs could and would have kept the organization going if they had considered that it continued to serve any useful or agreeable purpose. 
--------
495-> WALL STREET TALK.
Wall Street attributed consequence to the reappearance in Wall Street of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan yesterday. There is no doubting where Mr. Morgan stands. It is amply recognized that he is never at any time a stock market boomer, but his confidence in the quality of the new good times needs no announcement. 
--------
496-> ALL FOR HONEST MONEY; Commercial Travelers' Sound Money League Forms a Permanent Organization. TO FIGHT SILVER ISSUE ONLY Other Subjects Tabooed at the Meetings -- H.W. Dearborn Chosen President -- T.C. Platt, Mark Hanna, and Chauncey M. Depew on Advisory Board.

--------
500-> POLO PLAYING BEGUN.; Meadowbrook Team Defeats the Westchester Country Club -- Coming Tournaments.
The polo season at the Westchester Country Club was opened yesterday afternoon, when the Meadowbrook team administered a severe defeat to the home players. Something was radically wrong with the handicaps of the Polo Association, for the best the Country Club men could do was to score three goals, which, with their handicap of two goals and one received by penalty against their opponents, gave them a total of six. 
--------
501-> SCIENCE OF DERMATOLOGY; Dr. Bulkley's Lecture on "Relation of Diseases of the Skin to General Conditions." SOME SPECIALISTS' ERRORS. Cutaneous Disorders Are Most Frequently Caused by Systematic Irregularities and Do Not Yield to Local Treatment if Applied Alone.

--------

--------
506-> ANXIETY IN THE COMMONS.; English Players Watched with Suppressed Excitement at the Close.
LONDON, June 1. -- The scene to-night in Room No. 12 of the House of Commons, where the British chess team played, was a repetition, in the main, of that of the previous night. The chief difference was in the increasing excitement at the approaching termination of the contest. But the anxiety was more felt than seen, and not an echo of it was allowed to ranch the players themselves. 
--------
507-> IT SEEMS TO BE WAR; Recent Skirmishes on the Thessalian Frontier Now Accepted as a Clash That Must Lead to Hard Fighting. THE BLOCKADE A FARCE AND THE CONCERT OF POWERS ENDED. England Again Floating Along in "Splendid Isolation" and No One Can Tell What Are Lord Salisbury's Plans and Purposes.
LONDON, April 10. -- We assume here to-night that war or the equivalent of war has begun on the Thessalian frontier. Bulletins coming in from correspondents near the scene of actual hostilities all reflect the opinion that what has happened involves formal hostilities between Turkey and Greece. 
--------
508-> HOW ROADS ARE MANAGED.
Mr. F.J. Lisman of the New York Stock Exchange, whose views recently expressed in THE NEW YORK TIMES on corporation mismanagement attracted much attention, pointed out yesterday a striking feature of the present railroad situation. Mr. Lisman said:

GLASGOW, June 2. -- The Yachting and Fisher Exhibition, opened in the Imperial Institute, London, to commemorate Queen Victoria's jubilee, has not created the surprise expected. In the yachting department an extensive assortment of sliver cups, vases, and other trophies won in yacht races have been collected and exhibited, and this department is exceptionally popular, of course, among the ladies. 
--------
510-> BLACK, PARKER, AND HOME RULE.
While the case of Commissioner PARKER was still pending before the Mayor, THE TIMES urged that it did not really present the case against PARKER. An official who knew nothing of the matter except the charges and the testimony taken under them might very well think the case inadequate for removal.

A report has been made to the stockholders of the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway Company by President A.G. Blair. He says: 
--------
513-> PRESIDENT M'KINLEY'S SPEECH; Not Increased Revenue but Economy the Country's Need.
As we have already said, Mr. McKinley has at last officially announced, what Mr. Hanna was enabled to announce unofficially some time ago, that there will be an extra session of Congress. The Weekly has already expressed its opinion on this subject, and we return to it only to repeat that we believe that Mr. McKinley is beginning his administration with a mistake. 
--------
514-> THE LEXOW INVESTIGATION.; Chicago Coffee and Sugar Men on the Testimony.

--------
518-> A Times Correspondent Writes of an Empire of the English Speaking Race.
" In every speech Mr. Laurier makes he seems to take pains to emphasize the individuality and independence of Canada." This is what THE NEW YORK TIMES says, and THE TIMES has caught the spirit of the jubilee speeches. In Mr. Laurier's first speech at Liverpool this characteristic was quite striking, and at Edinburgh and Manchester he seemed to even go out of his way to make it more apparent. 
--------
519-> ENDICOTT DIVORCE CASE.; Mrs. Wadsworth Denies the Charges of Mrs. Endicott -- Mr. Wadsworth Not Estranged from His Wife.
NEWARK, July 1. -- Mrs. Carrie Wadsworth resumed the stand this morning when the suit of Mrs. G.W. Endicott for a divorce from her husband, Dr. E.W.

HAVANA, March 24. -- Gen. Llnares reports that his command of 1,600 men, comprising infantry, cavalry, and artillery, left Songo, in the Province of Santiago de Cuba, and at La Sel ranch encountered several parties of rebels under the leadership of Cebreco, with whom they had a sharp engagement.

602-> As to Economic Fallacies.
You are to be congratulated on giving to New Yorkers a daily paper fit to be read in the family circle, an achievement that, strange as it may seem, deserves particular mention in this era of "new journalism." Your editorial page, in keeping with the tone of the paper, shows careful and intelligent work, and I was therefore the more surprised to see to-day an article on "Luxury and Discontent," which abounded in economic fallacies.

The redwood is the glory of the coast range.

--------
625-> "PROTECTION AND RECIPROCITY."
By far the most puzzling plank in the St. Louis platform was that which dealt with reciprocity. "Protection and reciprocity," it read, "are twin measures of Republican policy and go hand in hand." Every thinking reader of that plank must have wondered what the author of it thought that he meant. 
--------

--------
633-> VICTORIAN RELICS.
The jubilee celebration seems likely to start a craze for collecting relics of the Queen's early days, writes Henri Labouchere in Truth.

--------
644-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
There is nothing thrilling about the expression of opinion upon arbitration which has been extracted from Prince BISMARCK. He is careful to explain that he knows nothing about the pending treaty between us and Great Britain, and that his remarks are purely theoretical or academic. But if he had not made this reservation, and if, moreover, he were still Chancellor, they would commit him to nothing.

--------
660-> QUIGG AS HERCULES.
An anonymous appeal to LEMUEL ELY QUIGG to turn his back on PLATT, repudiate LAUTERBACH, and come out as the Hercules of the righteous government cause would at once be set down as the work of a political wag. Such an appeal is made by our serious Republican contemporary, The Mail and Express. 
--------

687-> GOLF IN 1897.
The growth of public interest in golf and the increase in the number of golf clubs and golfers will make this year memorable in the history of the game in this country.

--------
693-> THE AMERICAN SCULPTURE SOCIETY

696-> French Literature in Our Times; ITS EVOLUTION AS OUTLINED IN THE WORK OF GEORGES PELLISSIER.*
It is quite in consonance with the scholarly and liberal policy of the Knickerbocker Press to be the first to place within reach of the English reading public this magnificent example of the French critic's art, and to have secured for the work of translation one so evidently equal to the task as Anne Garrison Brinton.

728-> DO WE WANT A "LOCAL LEGISLATURE"?
A correspondent whose letter we print elsewhere this morning entirely mistakes the position we have taken regarding the "too great power" to be given to the Municipal Assembly in the new charter.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb. 23. -- The Yale Navy has received a communication from the New London Board of Trade, asking if Yale will consent to row the Yale-Harvard-Cornell race on the Thames, provided the consent of Harvard and Cornell can be obtained.

747-> CYCLE SNOW SOUVENIRS; Last Night Was One of Buttons and Badges, Stick-Pins, Paper Knives, and Novelties. BOARD OF TRADE MEETING. Important Action of the National Body Concerning Future Shows -- Election of Officers and Directors -- Speech of the Retiring President.
Last night was souvenir night at the cycle show, and the fun was fast and furious. A crowd, as notable for its humor as for its size, struggled without cessation for the buttons, stick-pins, badges, paper knives, and other articles given by the various manufacturers. 
--------
748-> "TANNHAUSER" ONCE AGAIN.; Second Night of the Wagner Cycle at the Metropolitan.
"Tannhauser" was given last night at the Metropolitan Opera House by Mr. Walter Damrosch's company. It was the second of the performances in the cycle of Wagner's works in chronological order. The audience was not what it ought to have been in the circumstances; for it is not often that "Tannhauser" is given, and in some respects it ranks with the greatest of Wagner's dramas. 
--------
749-> WHEAT SALES IN CHICAGO.; May Reaches a Price the Lowest Since October -- Rally at the Close.
CHICAGO, March 12. -- The break of 2 cents in wheat and the reported selling out by the bull leaders left the pit in an uncertain state of feeling. To add to the perplexing situation there was no positive news to shape prices. In the morning wheat was hesitating around the Thursday price. Sales for May were 72 1/2c to 72 5/8c and 72 3/4c, and 72 1/8c. 
--------
750-> PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.
The vast expense at which The Journal has engaged the exclusive services of CORBETT and FITZSIMMONS to report for it their coming contest is beginning to be justified. Hitherto their communications have been confined mainly to boasts about the perfection of their respective "condition" and direful threats of what they would do to each other on the fateful day. 
--------
751-> MR. MILLINGTON CONFESSES; The Newark Minister Admits that He Went to Montreal with Mrs. Dickerson, a Parishioner. FOUND BY HIS OWN BROTHER. Had Saved Money for Seven Months in Preparation for the Elopement -- Neglected to Pay Bills in Order to Secure Cash.

--------
752-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Gold is going abroad more largely than anybody in Wall Street has foreseen. Over $1,000,000 per day has been the average export engagement during the week just closed. In high banking circles there is hesitancy in making forecasts as to how far the outgo may reach, but it is not difficult to find bankers of consequence who are willing to put the estimate beyond $25,000,000. Any measuring figures, however, depend upon guesswork. 
--------
753-> ANXIETY OVER THE PLACES; There Are Many Disappointed People in Washington, and Landlords Are Becoming Nervous. THIS WEEK TO BE A DULL ONE Comment on the Official Character of Judge Holman and Mr. Milliken, Two Deceased Cpngressmen -Some Unfit Apartments.
WASHINGTON, April 24. -- The Grant Monument dedication ceremonies in New York promise to turn Washington into a rather dull town for a week. Up to the last day or two the interest manifested here was divided by the accounts of the Turco-Grecian war and the inscrutable business of the Finance Committee with the Tariff bill. 
--------
754-> CAPT. WILLIAM J. MAIDHOF.
Capt. William J. Maidhof of Company B. Twenty-second Regiment, an officer familiar in National Guard circles during twenty-six years of continuous service, has been placed upon the retired list of National Guard officers of New York, to date from July 7 last, at his own request.

Fully twoscore of property owners and lawyers interested in the matter were present. Mayor Strong presided, and all of the members of the board were in their places. 
--------
758-> QUIET END OF THE SESSION.
One effect of the Constitutional requirement that all bills shall be printed in their final form and laid on the desks of members of the Legislature three days before the vote can be taken on their passage has been to put an end to the old scenes of rushing through a mass of measures at the very end of the session. 
--------
759-> BIG FIRE AT ALEXANDRIA.; Large Block Wiped Out and $500,000 Damage Done -- Help Sent from Washington.
ALEXANDRIA, Va., June 3. -- Fire destroyed Bryan's Fertilizing Mill on the river front shortly after midnight, and raged with great fury for about eight hours, causing a total damage of from $450,000 to $500,000, partly insured. The entire block, bounded by the Strand, Duke, Union, and Prince Streets, was almost completely wiped out, only one warehouse with its contents being saved. 
--------
760-> GOV. BLACK'S "IDEAS."
The bill in which Gov. BLACK has "embodied his ideas" of the regulation of the civil service is likely to be very mischievous. 
--------
761-> O.D. MYER COMPANY'S TROUBLES; Cleveland Department Store Involved in Financial Difficulties.
CLEVELAND, July 26. -- Four mortgages were filed by the O.D. Myer Company, running a big department store, in the County Recorder's office to-day.

--------
763-> Travel in Finland.; INTERESTING PHASES OF LIFE IN A LAND NOT YET FAMILIAR.*
The very title of this recent book of travel through a comparatively near, but almost unknown, country will doubtless be a surprise to the average reader, for people in general are under the indefinite impression that Finland is either continually covered with snow and ice or consists of nothing but marshes and waterways. 
--------

The popularity of the Manhattan Beach track among local clubs appears to increase, if anything, as the season progresses.

--------
770-> OPPOSED TO THE EXCURSION.; Proposed Trip to New York of a Richmond Council Committee.

--------
775-> The Palatines.; GERMANS WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND SETTLED IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA -- THEIR MOVING STORY.
Many German Geographical names now scattered along the Hudson, Mohawk, and Schoharie Valleys came from immigrants whom the wars of Louis XIV. had forced out of the valley of the Rhine.

--------
779-> CHARTER COMPROMISES.
The Federal Constitution was the product of compromises, and it would be strange if we could get a charter for the Greater New York which anybody could regard as ideal. Some compromise will have to be made among differing opinions as to what is best for the different districts to be united and for the whole enlarged municipality. 
--------
780-> A WORD TO MR. DEPEW.
President DEPEW during our financial difficulties was so resolutely hopeful and cheerful that he is now entitled to the utterance of a word of caution, if only to give him a chance to be heard in a world where his habitual optimism is now general. Here is his warning: 
--------

ALBANY, July 15. -- Gov. Black has appointed Jacob William Miller of New York Captain of the Naval Militia of the State. 
--------
782-> BROAD-GAUGE NON-PARTISANSHIP.
Those who engage this year in prosecuting a campaign for non-partisanship in the administration of municipal affairs will need to avoid running on a narrow track. They must remember that the main purpose of their contest is good city government -- not political or moral reform, but just plain honesty and efficiency in the management of the public business of the city and the maintenance of law and order for the safety of the community.

--------
787-> The Royal Express Company.
Since 1861 the Queen has governed less than she did before. She has done better in just being a guiding influence in home affairs and a standard of international morality to her Ministers. Nevertheless, she has attended industriously to routine business. In the course of a visit to the chalet she staid at near Lucerne I was taken to a spacious rustic kiosk. 
--------
788-> WORTH'S ADVICE TO PLATT.; Brooklyn's Leader Says that the Senator Must Not Interfere in Local Political Affairs.
Jacob Worth appeared at his office in Brooklyn yesterday morning for the first time since his defiance of the orders of Senator Platt, and after a three weeks' absence up the State.

--------
789-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The killing of a lad of sixteen on St. Mark's Avenue, Brooklyn, on Monday evening by a bicycle rider of the expert type is another warning that the speed of wheel riding in the public streets must be much more narrowly and firmly restricted. The usual notion that the speed allowed to wagons will be safe for wheels is a delusion, since the wheel is noiseless and the bell is often rather confusing than useful. 
--------
790-> John Brown.
I met him in his room at the American House (No. 126) in March, 1858, and saw before me a man whose mere appearance and bearing refuted in advance some of the strange perversions which have found their way into many books, and which often wholly missed the type to which he belonged. 
--------
791-> RUMORS ABOUT THE QUEEN.; London Views Concerning the Abdication "Sensation" and the Blindness Falsehood -- New York Paper Rebuked.
LONDON, July 3. -- The sensational stories circulated by a New York newspaper regarding Queen Victoria's alleged blindness and her alleged intention to abdicate in favor of the Prince of Wales after the jubilee festivities, which have just reached here by mail, are exciting great derision among the few newspapers which have deigned to notice the cruel and utterly unfounded reports.

BEGINNING with scant numbers and in comparative poverty the founders of Trinity Parish established, just two hundred years ago, a church organization, the growth and development of which is an essential part of the history of the City of New York. 
--------
796-> FAITH IN JERSEY CENTRAL.
It is with a natural feeling of temerity that I hazard an opinion which conflicts with the able articles published by your excellent paper, while I have differed repeatedly with statements you have so lucidly published. I shall not for one moment attempt to go into a protracted denial or refutation of those statements. 
--------
797-> LEGS BROKEN BY A RUNAWAY.; Young Man Terribly Injured While Trying to Stop a Frightened Team.
Because he tried to stop a runaway team of horses that was madly tearing along First Avenue last night, H.J. Freyhalter, nineteen years old of 323 East Forty-fifth Street, a picture-frame maker, is now in the Presbyterian Hospital, with both legs broken.

Tea importers in this city are confronted by the prospect of a heavy loss on their importation of 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 pounds of tea, which began arriving in this city about the 1st of July. It was ordered when the general impression was that Congress would put a duty on tea. It is of the first crop, the finest tea of the year, and to forestall the tariff the importers took all they could get.

LONDON, July 15. -- B.F. Hawksley, Counsel for Cecil Rhodes in the South Africa investigation, in the course of an interview with a representative of The Associated Press to-day, said he believed that nothing would come of the Investigating Committee's report.

LONDON, July 15. -- While among the general public here the tone of Secretary Sherman's letter to Ambassador Hay regarding the Bering Sea seal regulations is greatly resented, the correspondent of The Associated Press is in a position to say that, Whatever criticism the British Government may have to make on the phraseology of the communication, the letter has not in any way affected unfavorably the negotiations which Col. Hay has been conducting. 
--------
801-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
If the attack upon the civil service system of this State makes a stanch supporter of it out of such a stalwart Tammany Democrat as Senator CANTOR, on the ground that he will not countenance efforts to evade the Constitution, it will not be without its good effects. There is no manner of doubt about the meaning or the purpose of the Constitution, and Democrats are or profess to be sticklers for its strict observance. 
--------
802-> SECOND-CLASS CITY CHARTER.; Provisions of the Bill for Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, and Troy.
ALBANY, Jan. 13. -- Senator White will introduce the General Charter for cities of the second class, which was introduced last year, upon a report from a commission which drew the charter. It applies to the Cities of Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, and Troy.

--------
804-> BUSINESS MEN AT INDIANAPOLIS.
The convention of business men at Indianapolis consists of 300 delegates from all parts of the Union, but there is among them no sectional feeling and not a sign of political division.

I welcome THE TIMES'S suggestion that the anniversary of Washington's Birthday be devoted to efforts in behalf of the arbitration treaty pending in the Senate. 
--------
807-> THE GERMANS AND THE DICKER.
The impudence of QUIGG is his most interesting quality. He scatters his invitations broadcast on the assumption that he has but to raise the cry of Tammany to bring all the organizations opposed to the Wigwam huddling around his conference table. He takes it for granted that his hidden guests have no memories and are always gullible. 
--------
808-> THE RETROACTIVE TARIFF.; Representative Dalzell's Argument on the Amendment's Validity.
WASHINGTON, April 1. -- Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania, who was a member of the Sub-Committee of the Ways and Means Committee which investigated the question of the power of Congress to provide for the enforcement of the duties of the new tariff bill before its enactment into law, has prepared an argument in support of the validity of the amendment.

--------
811-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
Senator MORGAN was rather more absurd than usual on Tuesday. Especially was he comic when he became pathetic. This was when he deplored the "calamity and humiliation" to which the country was subjected in having to send its wheat for the relief of the starving people of India in foreign bottoms. To avert this grievous thing he proposed to naturalize two foreign-built ships for the occasion. 
--------
812-> A MISSION COFFEE HOUSE; And Hotel, Though Not Called Such, Where Professional Nurses Find Cozy Homes. GOOD ACCOMMODATIONS CHEAP A Clean Restaurant in Which Excellent Food Is Provided at a Moderate Price -- Little Known Here, but Heard of Abroad.
One of the most recent festivities given in New York was an ice cream party.

The Pilgrim Trust Company (Limited) was founded in London, England, July 4, 1618, with a capital of $500,000,000 in gold. One hundred million of this was in gold coin and bullion, and the balance in gold certificates and Treasury notes. This is the historical origin of the $100,000,000 gold reserve. 
--------
815-> AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.
THE half dozen pages which begin the first volume of the Journal of the Continental Congress show beyond a peradventure that the colonists, assailed in their dearest rights and privileges, had no wish to separate themselves from the mother country. 
--------
816-> HISTORICAL NOVELS.; A SON OF THE OLD DOMINION. By Mrs. Burton N. Harrison. New York: Lamson, Wolffe & Co.
Another extended work, of fiction from Mrs. Harrison is sure to be awaited with interest. Her "Sweet Bells Out of Tune," "A Bachelor Maid," and "An Errant Wooing" made impressions that were real The present story Mrs. Harrison has had in mind for several years, but has been actually writing it only during the year just past. It is a Colonial tale, historical in its coloring and its incidents. 
--------
817-> COAL STRIKE SITUATION; Operators Desire the Miners to Win the Advance of Wages Which They Demand. DE ARMITT MINERS WAVERING Nearly All Out at Two Mines, and the Strikers Preparing for a Big Effort to Close the Third To-morrow.
PITTSBURG, July 31. -- A number of coal operators who congregated at the Monongahela House to-day expressed themselves very forcibly on the strike situation.

--------
818-> SITUATION IN OHIO.; Coal Operators in Sympathy with the Miners, but Firm for the Nine-Cent Differential.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 3. -- The General Hocking Coal Company expected a rush of orders from the railroads as soon as the United Mine Workers' strike was ordered, or before, but it failed to develop, which would seem to indicate that a great deal of coal is in stock. There will be no trouble so far as the mines in this pool are concerned. Everything will be shut and a friendly feeling maintained. 
--------
819-> THE JAPANESE NAVY.
We observe that some of our contemporaries show some excitement about a casual remark of The London Globe to the effect that the Japanese Navy could blow the American Navy out of water. The London Globe, so far as we know, carries no weight in its most deliberate statements. This particular statement, however, cannot have been deliberate. 
--------
820-> REFORM -- CHICAGO FASHION.
Chicago puts up with no half-way work. Visitors from the East and Chicago men in New York sometimes bring to us appalling stories of her municipal Government and the evils with which it is honeycombed. But when Chicago sets her broad shoulders to the wheel of reform it moves, moves at once, rapidly, and with effect. 
--------
821-> Mrs. Bradley Martin's Costume.

--------
824-> RAILROADS AND DECENCY.
The "great" prizefight advertised to take place in Nevada next month arouses in certain classes a brutal and vicious sentiment to which some of the newspapers are pandering with all the skill and ingenuity at their command.

--------
831-> "MEFISTOFELE" ONCE AGAIN.; Boito's Unique Opera Performed a Second Time at the Metropolitan.
It is a curious thing that the man who wrote the admirable libretti of Verdi's "Otello" and "Falstaff" should have written "Mefistofele." The two opera books which Arrigo Boito made from Shakespearean plays are notable for their compactness and symmetry, for their dramatic continuity and lucidity. "Mefistofele," on the other hand, is disjointed and episodic.

--------
847-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
Equally discreditable, though perhaps not so important, is the sending of the younger SEWALL to Hawaii.

--------
867-> Summer Reading Past and Present.

--------
875-> TO KILL TRADE.
If Judge PECKHAM could get a crack at the Dingley bill, he might find plenty of chances for a ringing condemnation of many of its provisions as being in "restraint of trade."

--------
894-> "IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE."
The text of the opinion of Justice PECKHAM in the "anti-trust law" railroad case does not remove the unpleasant impression received from the portion first given out embodying the conclusion of the majority of the court.

It now appears, unfortunately, that the court fully recognized two features in the case in a way which the decision as at first reported did not disclose.

--------
900-> DEBS AND DR. RAINSFORD AGAIN.
As I am at present in an out-of-the-way part of the country it was only by accident I saw your editorial in your issue of the 23d of June, I must characterize it as inexcusably unjust and misleading. The writer evidently did not take the trouble to read the proposition made by Mr. DEBS to the workingmen, which proposition the letter of mine you quote referred to. 
--------
901-> FREAK JOURNALISM AND THE BALL.
The ball night before last, or, rather, yesterday morning, at the Waldorf was naturally a great occasion for the freak journals. Inasmuch as the ball did not really begin before midnight, and as the freak journals went to press within an hour or two thereafter, the large and elaborate pictures of "the scene" with which they favored their readers were open to much suspicion. 
--------
902-> Pictures in Berlin.; SOME BY NATIVE ARTISTS, OTHERS AMERICAN -- VERESTCHAGIN.
BERLIN, March 23. -- At the regular Berlin stands are few pictures to chronicle. The Winter's exhibit by the "Eleven" at Gurlitt's is much like that of the year before. Skarbina shows up as usual with clever water colors, and Leistikow represents pretty much all there is hereabout suggestive of the symbolists of Paris. 
--------
903-> NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
All the companies of the Seventh Regiment have voted in favor of making a trip to Boston, the Board of Officers has decided that the trip shall be made, and a committee of arrangements has been appointed, comprising Col.

--------
906-> The Greater New York.
I think it high time that the taxpayers of New York took stock, to see where or how much the Greater New York will leave them. After all the agitation that has been had on the subject during the last three or four years, the really important point of the whole matter seems to be only now receiving discussion.

Col. Jesse E. Peyton, one of the most remarkable men in this country, died at his home, in Haddonfield, N.J., a short time ago.

The Atlantic Yacht Club's regatta, which was sailed yesterday, was very interesting tram a spectacular point of view, but hardly a success as a fair trial of the speed of the yachts that took part in the different contests. Luck entered largely into the races, and there was not a yacht that could be credited with having won on her merits. 
--------
916-> ELECTIONS HELD IN HOLLAND.; Twenty Catholics, 22 Liberals, and 13 Protestants for the Chamber.

--------
918-> WELLINGTON AND QUAY.
Senator WELLINGTON has been called "the Quay of Maryland." The epithet fits his character fairly well; it does not fit his capacity to run his party. The Republican Convention, which he himself called to order and exhorted as to his authority as a boss, practically disbossed him, declared the primaries in Baltimore vitiated by his outrageous management, ordered new primaries to be held Sept. 11, and adjourned to Sept. 15. 
--------
919-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The British purchase of Delagoa Bay is evidently an effective means of putting pressure upon the Boers, according to the immoral programme, to which there seems to be no longer any substantial objection in Great Britain. It is to be deplored upon that account, but apart from that it is a natural and commendable stroke of policy. 
--------
920-> The Carnegie Institute.
The rules and regulations issued by the Trustees of the Carnegie art fund are well considered.

--------
924-> THE KENTUCKY SENATORSHIP.; All Intimation that Gov. Bradley Will Make an Appointment.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 24. -- Gov. Bradley will not go to the inauguration of President McKinley. He said to-night that business complications of an official nature would make it necessary for him to remain at Frankfort, although he was anxious to attend the inauguration. 
--------
925-> THE ALARM OF WATTERSON.
The violent ringing of the alarm bell in Louisville arouses a lethargic people, too late, probably, to a full sense of their danger. WATTERSON is at the rope, and the belfry rocks with the vehemence of his exertions. But it is easy to see that he despairs of the Republic. "Mr. CLEVELAND can never again be President of the United States," he rages. 
--------
926-> FALLING OFF IN THREE STATES.; Crops Not Up to Expectations in Minnesota and North and South Dakota.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug. 14. -- The information is obtained at the office of the Chief Inspector of Grain that the wheat of Minnesota and North and South Dakota would run 30,000,000 bushels short of expectations.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 11. -- There is good Republican authority for the assertion that Judge McKenna of California, who has been selected for Secretary of the Interior in Mr. McKinley's Cabinet, will be shifted from that position to the office of Attorney General, and that a new man, but not New York Republican, will be chosen for the Interior.

If the rainy weather that has prevailed for the past two weeks or more has been a relief to the city man by keeping down the temperature somewhat, it has caused great losses to many farmers, whose crops have been damaged or altogether ruined, while other farmers are praying for a let-up of the downpour and for a gradual rise of temperature lest their drops should rot in the ground before they can gather them. 
--------
935-> THE TEST OF ROYALTY.
In Cosmopolis, Prof. MAX MULLER, who in the tranquil evening of his long and useful life, is giving less heed than was his wont to the Oriental languages and the vedas, and more to subjects within the grasp of common men, describes a test of royalty which seems new and conclusive.

--------
944-> MR. SCHURZ ON "TRAITORS."
Senator GALLINGER of New Hampshire has unwittingly done the cause of honest politics and good government a considerable service.

--------
946-> SHOT A JERSEY CITY CLOCK.; It Continued to Perform Its Public Duty but Inaccurately.
A public clock was erected at Ocean and Linden Avenues, Jersey City, a year ago by the residents of the vicinity. It kept good time until Thursday, when its face was found filled with buckshot that had been fired into it during the night. It was still running, though it was a little slow.

We print in another column a criticism of THE TIMES by that excellent Republican newspaper, The Post-Express of Rochester. We have no complaint to make of it, though it is far from just. The Post-Express has lately done such good work in criticising the mischievous measures and men of its own party that a tilt against an independent judgment of the pet measure of that party may strengthen it with its purely partisan readers.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 11. -- At the meeting of the House Committee on Pacific Railroads to-day, it was developed that expected support for the propositions reported to have been made by Mr. Hubbard of Missouri relating to the settlement of the Government's debt had not been secured and they could not, therefore, be longer considered within the category of possibilities. 
--------
961-> WANTED -- LEADERSHIP.
The almost unanimous vote of the House for the Monetary Conference bill will probably be taken to have more significance, especially in Europe, than it really has. There is, as a matter of cold fact, absolutely nothing essentially new in the bill. It authorizes the President to do nothing of any importance that he could not have done under the law already in force.

LONDON, Feb. 25. -- The Athens correspondent of The Standard telegraphs that it is reported that Col. Smolentz, Minister of War, has renewed his offer to resign.

WALTHAM, Mass., Feb. 11. -- A decidedly stirring scene was witnessed on Moody Street, Waltham, this morning, when the Fire Department was responding to an alarm for a fire. 
--------
966-> CHESS IN CONGRESS.
It is rather odd that Mr. HENNIKER HEATON, M.P., who has made several visits to this country, should have had the notion of challenging the House of Representatives to play chess with the House of Commons. The fact that Mr. HEATON presumably knew the "chess strength" of the House of Representatives has caused chess players upon this side to reproach him with an anxiety for a "sure thing." 
--------
967-> THE CITIZENS' UNION ENROLLMENT.
The people of this city should understand just what enrollment in the Citizens' Union means and how important it is that it should be as large as possible.

985-> The Bushman Hunting the Ostrich.
The Bushman divests himself of all his incumbrances; water vessels, food, cloak, assegai, and sandals are all left behind.

988-> A Western Artist.
Miss Harriet Monroe's "Life of John Wellborn Root," just published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin  Co., is a very interesting record of a man whose importance is generally recognized in his own profession of architecture, and in his own city of Chicago.

Capt. Hinde's volume tells an interesting story, and will, in the future, when Central Africa is occupied by a modern civilization, be a valuable contribution to the history of its savage period.

--------
999-> MR. PLATT'S CHOICE.
Mr. PLATT'S is most unwilling to farm out his large and somewhat hungry party for the election of a Mayor who would refuse to recognize the demands of the Republican appetite.

Are the tables about to be turned? 
--------
1007-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The reported excitement among the Kansas farmers about the importation into their State of poor children from New York is not exactly justifiable, but it is partly understandable. Much of what may be called the "documentary evidence" of New York's social and moral condition that goes out into other States is of an alarming character, and doubtless the Kansas farmers, who are, after all, merely human and therefore gullible, regard this whole town as diseased. 
--------
1008-> Anna Sargent Turner Discusses Diphtheria and Some Other Things.
I had quite abandoned the hope of ever again appearing in THE NEW YORK TIMES as an opponent of vivisection, but as you published, on the 29th ult., an article from the pen of the Vice President of the New England Anti-Vivisection Society I think it may be possible that you will give space to some comments (on your editorial referring to this article) from the Anti-Vivisection Society in your own State. 
--------
1009-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
The purpose of an amendment to the law prohibiting the public appearance of children under sixteen seems to be to give more latitude than is given by the existing. law to youthful public performers. In fact, the present law is all right.

1015-> Apaches and Their Hair.
As with Samson of old, the Indians' wildness lay in their long hair, which the returned, educated Indians wore because, as they boasted, "it made them wild."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. -- Not until after the Attorney General of the United States has given to the Treasury Department his opinion of the meaning of the Dingley tariff law touching the importation of goods in bond through a contiguous country will the people to be affected by it really appreciate the force of a few lines of legislation enacted by the Conference Committee of the last session of Congress.

--------
1036-> An Imbecile Peer.
The Lord Denman this generation knew would be harshly described if he were said to be insane, for he was not violent, and never offended any more than he hurt anybody; but he was certainly of weak, or at least eccentric, intellect.

--------
1105-> Merely "Professing" Christians.
There are some "professing" Christians who are born cross and disagreeable, with shard angles sticking out all over them, and have never subjected these natural dispositions to the rounding and smoothing influences of the Gospel.

Racing men of the New York district have recently had their attention forcibly directed to the necessity of a larger corps of competent track officials to see that amateur racing is kept on a respectable footing.

--------
1116-> BUSINESS CENTRES.
The proposition to make the City Hall Park the southern terminus of the system of rapid transit is probably not very seriously made.

The ostensible reason why an anonymous Frenchman -- one of whose ancestors was a close friend of Lafayette " -- undertook the perils of the sea, and bore the innumerable ennuis of a sojourn in the United States, was apparently to please his sister. Mademoiselle, or Madame, as the case may be, but who prided herself on her good looks, was dying to know whether she "resembled the beautiful Madame R. of New York." 
--------
1124-> GOV. BUSHNELL SURPRISED.; An Enemy Chairman of the Republican County Committee.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Feb. 13. -- The Republican County Central Committee this afternoon chose George Beard, a McKinley-Keifer man, for Chairman. The selection simply dazes the Bushnell-Foraker people, who did not have an inkling that Beard would enter in the race.

1126-> THE LATE MR. FREDERICKSON.
Charles W. Frederickson for many years -- at least twenty -- was one of the most familiar figures, as he was the most picturesque figure, in the book auction rooms of this city.

STATE CAMP OF INSTRUCTION, PEEKSKILL, June 27. -- The most exacting person could not ask for any more charming weather than Sunday brought with it to the soldiers in camp.

1133-> BETTER ABOLISH THE OFFICE.
It would be better and safer to abolish the Insurance Department outright than to intrust the duties of the Superintendency to such foul hands as those of "LOU" PAYN. It is the intention of the law that the Superintendent of Insurance shall safeguard the interests of policy holders. 
--------
1134-> VIEWS OF STEPHEN LITTLE.
Corporation mysteries may not at once go out of fashion, but there are many growing indications suggesting that we are likely from this time forward to have understandable financial statements more intrigue than, unfortunately, has been usually the past.

--------
1142-> The Stolen MSS.
I read with interest the dispatch from Washington in THE NEW YORK TIMES in regard to the valuable manuscripts stolen from the Congressional Library.

1152-> Direct vs. Indirect Taxation.; The Hon. David A. Wells in Appletons' Popular Science Monthly for June.
An instructive comparison of the method and influence of direct and indirect taxation may be instituted by supposing the two systems to be put into practical operation under similar circumstances, for effecting a purpose which all are willing to admit is most desirable or necessary. For example, a town meeting is held to provide means for building a bridge.

--------
1155-> Books -- Divided Skirts -- Women.
Most women -- and I am afraid, a good many men, too -- imagine that book learning is synonymous with education.

1160-> THE THEATRES
MAY IRWIN'S sway is undisputed. She has the sceptre and the tiara and the laurel and all those things.

--------
1165-> MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.
The fusion of Populists and Republicans in North Carolina is practically "off," and MARION BUTLER has become a Middle of the Road Populist, even like unto WATSON of Georgia, who was bound against his will to a kind of fusion with the Democrats.

About a month ago in these columns was given an account of the severe criticism which has been aroused in England by the publication of W. Carew Hazlitt's "Four Generations of a Literary Family."

WASHINGTON, May 26. -- Senator Jones of Arkansas comes pretty near to agreeing with some of his Gold Democratic friends who last November helped to elect McKinley.

--------
1172-> BUSINESS HAS BENEFITED; Low Railroad Excursion Rates Brought Many Visiting Merchants Here. THE PLAN MAY BE CONTINUED. Tradesmen Say that an Effort Will Be Made to Secure Two Such Concessions a Year.
Trade in the dry-goods district yesterday was extremely lively all day. Although this is the slack season, all the firms were kept busy waiting on customers and opening new accounts.

Compared with the activity displayed on Tuesday, yesterday was a disappointment to Stock Exchange interests. The boom which seemed approaching withdrew of a sudden. Buoyancy disappeared; in place of Tuesday's firmness, Wednesday's transactions were by contrast surprisingly weak. Operators conspicuously identified with what was hoped might develop into permanent improvement do not hesitate to express their feeling of disappointment, though many of them still insist that the market's most substantial tendencies are upward.

1188-> The Boy Gladstone.
Sir Roderick Murchison, the famous naturalist, has left it on record that Gladstone was "the prettiest little boy that ever went to Eton."

1430-> The Poetry of Book Auctions.
Should collectors bequeath their treasures to libraries, or should they leave behind them the request that they should be dispersed at public auction?

--------
1437-> EARLY RAILWAY EXPEDIENTS
In the early period of railroading in this country some novel expedients were resorted to in preventing collisions and in otherwise safeguarding the trains. For several years locomotives were without headlights, and it was seldom that trains were run any distance at night. The first method adopted of illuminating the track ahead of a moving train was by building a small bonfire on a platform car, which was shoved in advance of the locomotive. 
--------
1438-> Restoration of the Longfellow Wayside Inn.
The Wayside Inn of Longfellow has today a more real existence than in the lifetime of the poet. At least when he wrote his famous tales the old tavern at Sudbury was no longer a public house, and it was merely the poet's imagination which brought mine host to life and endowed him and his guests with those fascinating story-telling powers. 
--------
1439-> REFUGE ON LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Sept. 7. -- City officials are considering the question of inviting refugees from the infected yellow fever districts to come to Lookout Mountain.

They reasoned that defection in the George camp was certain to result in the election of Van Wyek. The leaders agreed that no man who left Tammany to follow George would swallow the Citizens' Union ticket in the county and districts.

1442-> NEWS OF THE RAILROADS; Decision of the Inter-State Commerce Commission on Alabama Freight Rates Overruled. TARIFFS NEED NOT BE FILED The Supreme Court Holds that Competition Makes the Long and Short Haul Clause Inoperative -- Justice Harlan Dissents.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. -- The United States Supreme Court to-day affirmed the decision of the lower court in the case of the Inter-State Commerce Commission against the Alabama Midland and the Georgia Central Railroad Company and others.

--------
1444-> "BLACKLISTING."
The case of FRED R. KETCHAM of Chicago against the Northwestern Railroad Company is a very interesting one.

--------
1446-> HOW IT WORKS.
Ten men vested with the power to increase or diminish at their pleasure or caprice the burden of taxation imposed upon the people of this State sat about a table in Albany on Tuesday and in a very few minutes "equalized" the assessed valuation of four and one-half billions of dollars' worth of real estate belonging to the inhabitants of the sixty counties of the State of New York. 
--------
1447-> NEW YORK IS THE WORST.
New York is peopled with average sensual men, each bent on money or pleasure, each therefore working for the Nemesis which has overtaken them, of a corrupt oligarchic rule of the most tyrannous order. But it will be said that London and Paris also are full of average sensual men, and yet that, while not free from grave scandals, there is nothing in the experience of either city which compares with that of New York.

1449-> MR. GRACE'S UNFOUNDED CHARGE.
Ex-Mayor WILLIAM R. GRACE makes the charge that the Citizens' Union has formed an alliance with the Socialists. In his apology for supporting the candidates of Tammany he makes this statement:

--------
1454-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- There is something of pathos in the almost constant failure of the Carlisle football players to win from their white antagonists honors more substantial and satisfactory than those incidental to a victor's respect. That sort of glory is, of course, by no means insignificant or worthless, and not a few successes give rewards far less precious, but nevertheless human nature is not content, much less happy, because of it. 
--------
1455-> SPAIN MEANS TO RESIST.; Sagasta Says the United States Will Find Her Prepared in the Event of Intervention.
MADRID, Dec. 9. -- At a Cabinet council to-day, at which the Queen Regent presided, the Premier, Senor Sagasta, outlined the opinions of the European press regarding President McKinley's message to Congress, the majority of which, the Premier said, were favorable to Spain.

1458-> Review 4 -- No Title
Marie Corelli has had her portrait made, the artist being a Miss Donald-Smith.

BALTIMORE, Nov. 20. -- This city is now passing through what might be appropriately called the third stage of the evolution of rapid transit.

1468-> ROYAL BONES MISSING.; Hungarians Very Bitter Over the Wholesale Robbery of the Tombs of Their Ancient Kings.
The scandal-loving Hungarians have a sensation now which is just after the heart of that "paprika" eating nation.

1471-> LET US HEAR FROM THE BOSSES.
Who cares to hear TRACY and VAN WYCK spout their second-hand ideas and inspired opinions? Give us the originals. Let us have the Republican and Tammany policies from the primary source.

--------
1474-> LEGENDS OF AIX AND MIOLAN.
The year 1887 was a very full and gay season at Aix, and memorable to me for many reasons. The Queen Marguerite was at Courmayeur, on the Italian side of the Alps.

Charles Coghlan had a noteworthy "first night" at the Fifth Avenue Theatre. "The Royal Box," his new adaptation of that eccentric romantic drama by the elder Dumas called "Kean" is free from some of the worst extravagance of the original, and while it is not likely to be taken very seriously, it is all thoroughly entertaining.

--------
1482-> SECTION 22 OF THE TARIFF.; Report that the Attorney General Will Not Uphold the Discriminating Duty.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. -- The impression is gaining ground that the occasion of the Attorney General's long delay in announcing his decision on Section XXII. of the Tariff law is due to the positive change of mind on his part since his first consideration of the case. It was then whispered on pretty good authority that he would sustain the duty.

1485-> The Days in the Year.
There is a story in Plutarch which must convince every reader that one myth at least relates to an alteration made in the Egyptian calendar, to extend the length of the year from 360 days to 365.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 20. -- Before the largest crowd that ever witnessed a football game in this city the University of Pennsylvania football eleven this afternoon on Franklin Field defeated the Harvard team by the score of 15 to 6. It was not a "sensational" game. There were but few good runs, the fifty-five-yard dash of Parker and Jackson's twenty-five-yard run being the only ones of moment.
