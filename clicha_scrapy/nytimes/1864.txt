THE CALORIC ENGINE TO PROPEL THE DICTATOR It is quite useless to conceal the fact that no steam power will propel the great ocean iron-clad Dictator on her forthcoming European voyage. The Ericsson caloric engine will be the motive power, and the manner in which its progress at the Delamater Iron Works has been effected, without the slightest intimation on the part of the press that anything mysterious was going on, shows that the contractor attaches undue importance to secrecy. If the engine fails as fail we are assured it cannot the country must know the fact some time or other; if it succeeds, premature announcements cannot impair, but must necessarily enhance, the triumph of genius. The Dictator is now slowly fitting out.The Puritan is not known to have a caloric engine, but it is not unlikely that her moving force will be the same as the Dictator, if that should succeed, as the Puritan cannot
