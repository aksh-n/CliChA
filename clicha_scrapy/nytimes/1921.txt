411-> THE SCREEN
The eternal feminine, with her silk stockings, satin slippers, fluffy negligee and things, is more deadly than the new sportswoman, with her boots, breeches and repeating rifle—according, at least, to "Don't Tell Everything," the photoplay at the Rivoli this week. In a fairly consistent light comedy manner, with a satiric inclination, the story proceeds with the rivalry of two women seeking one man, and the deliberately womanly woman—that is, she of the emphasized feminine charms—wins, leaving the girl who can snoot and fish and ride to bear her defeat as best she can in her woolen stockings and flannel shirt.To the extent that this photoplay is lightly satiric it is highly enjoyable. Whenever it skates dexterously between gay comedy and foolish farce it is unusually diverting. And it is pleasant to report that for a good deal of its length it is thus entertaining. Occasionally it verges on taking itself seriously—every now and then it sags beneath the weight of too much film, and at such times it grows tiresome, but it soon picks up again after each slump and goes on as merrily as ever.As a matter of fact, the picture's chief trouble seems to be due almost entirely to excess footage. Lorna Moon, the scenarist, provided a good idea for the story; Sam Wood, the director, had the wit to see the point of it and the skill to give it sympathetic cinematographic treatment, and the players in the cast were able to suit themselves to the mood and manner of the story—all for a limited period. But the limit was too far from the starting mark. The photoplay had to go five or six reels to meet stupid trade requirements, and neither the idea nor the people working with it could keep going that long; hence padding and ??? stretches, but not enough to bury the bright scenes, so there's much to be enjoyed in the production as it stands.It is especially good to see Wallace Reid get back to farcing. He always seems self-conscious and soon grows monotonous as a romantic or melodramatic hero, but as a farceur he is delightful. And he is agreeably aided and abetted by Gloria Swanson and Elliott Dexter in "Don't Tell Everything."But, why that title? They work it into a caption, it is true, but it really has nothing to do with the story and gives a decidedly wrong impression about it. It may have a certain box-office value, but won't the people who buy tickets expecting that kind of a photoplay he disappointed, or disturbed, when they find something entirely different?The second of the Triart productions based on famous paintings is also at the Rivoli this week, Josef Israels's "The Bashful Suitor" being the subject this time. There has been some disagreement about these pictures, arising, it seems, from differences of opinion about the point of view from which they should be considered. It has been complained, for instance, that "The Reggar Maid," the first of the series, does not give an accurate idea of Burne-Jones or his work, and the same charge may be brought against "The Bashful Suitor." And it must be confessed that in claiming relationship with paintings, the series exposes itself to this criticism. On the other hand, any one is free to take these motion picture productions as motion picture productions, regardless of their origin or the motives of their producers, and it is only as such, surely, that they have, or lack, significance for the screen.What, then, is the screen value of "The Bashful Suitor"? What place does it hold as a motion picture, and nothing else?Well, first of all, it is a finished piece of photography. The pictures by Herbert Blache and Lejaren a Hiller make the eyes feel good, and this is something that every screen production should do Photography, which includes composition, lighting, toning and everything that goes into the creation of a visually pleasing picture, is an essential of cinematography, so, by its photographic excellence, "The Bashful Suitor" achieves high rank as a motion picture. But there should also be a dramatic, or a lyric, quality to any screen production that professes to tell a story, and this quality is derived not only from the story told, but from its treatment. In other words, the story must be essentially dramatic, or lyric, and the pictures in which it is told must be cinematographic as well as photographic; that is, expressive as well as beautiful. And the fault with "The Bashful Suitor," as with "The Beggar Maid," is that its story is too self-consciously sentimental, which is to say, undramatic, and its pictures are often just pictures, without any particular meaning, without the cinematographic vitality they should have as works in narrative, kinetic photography.But "The Bashful Suitor" is not entirely devoid of dramatic quality, only less positively dramatic than it should be; so, with its photographic distinction, it remains an interesting and, more importantly, a significant screen production. It is only to be hoped that to the sincerity and special proficiency with which it has been produced some one will add the dramatic faculty necessary for the true completion of the series, of which, after all, it is only the second. DON'T TELL E. ERYTHING, with Wallace Reid, Gloria Swanson and Elliott Dexter, directed by Sam Wood, written by Lorna Moon; "The Bashful Suitor," directed by Herbert Blache and Lejaren a Hiller, based on the painting by Josef Israels, with Mary Brandon and Pierre Gendron; "Snooky's Fresh Heir," a Chester Comedy. At the Rivoli.Charles Ray's latest production, "R. S. V. P.," is additional evidence that Mr. Ray needs a director other than himself. It is not so dull as "Two Minutes to Go," possessing more of those little scenes that Ray has made peculiarly and delightfully his own, but still it is sufficiently tedious as a photoplay to strengthen the conclusion that when Mr. Ray undertakes to direct one of his own productions he only impairs his work as a player. Where the action ought to be bright, for instance, it is often silly, and many scenes that ought to be brief are prolonged until any wit they had originally is dulled. The story is about a struggling young artist who, of course, marries the girl, who, of course, is wealthy."Footfalls," directed by Charles J. Brabin, with Tyrone Power in the leading role, which was at the Park Theatre last September, is at the Capitol this week, and "Peter Ibbetson," directed by George Fitzmaurice, with Elsie Furguson and Wallace Reid, having ended its engagement at the Criterion, is at the Rialto."Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford," which was at the Rivoli and Rialto last week, went into the Republic Theatre last night.

1253-> THE SCREEN
"Anne Boleyn," the second Ernst Lubitsch production to reach this country from Germany, is at the Rivoli this week. It has been renamed "Deception," as Mr. Lubitsch's "DuBarry" was renamed "Passion" for American consumption, it being the opinion of the distributers, apparently, that such titles as "Passion" and "Deception" are more suited to the American, spectator, who, Mr. Griffith is reported to have said, has "the mind of a child nine years old," than are "DuBarry" and "Anne Boleyn."But though names may be changed, moving pictures may not, and therefore "Anne Boleyn," or "Deception," in its substance, remains as Mr. Lubitsch made it. And he did not make it for anyone with the mind of a child nine years old. That is the most important distinction of the picture, as it was of "DuBarry"; therein lies its fundamental difference from most of the American productions. "While there is excellent photography in both "DuBarry" and "Anne Boleyn," there is better photography in many of the films made in America, and though the settings of the former are impressive and the scenes skillfully composed, they sometimes seem less genuine than the settings in many American pictures.The dramatic material of most of the American pictures, however, is puerile, and their treatment is mechanical, compared, to the material and treatment of a photoplay like "Deception"—it has to be called that sooner or later, so let it go. Here is a real story told so that intelligent people can enjoy it. Here is sturdy evidence that the screen is for adults as well as children, although a number of parents had their babies at the Rivoli yesterday to see the bestiality of Henry VIII and his court. Here is a work that holds the alert interest almost continuously, despite the fact that it is historical. Many people shy at the historical in entertainment, fearing either that they will be bored again or may be accidentally educated, but they needn't avoid "Deception," unless they object to a real story of real people, with an impressive tragic ending. Those who don't will probably be entertained as they have seldom been entertained in a motion picture theatre.Exactly how accurate the history of "Deception" is one who has not made a specialty of England in the time of the Tudors cannot say, but it seems authentic, on the whole, except, perhaps, in the idealization of the character of Anne Boleyn, who is represented as quite a saint. Surely the Henry VIII, of Emil Jannings, as was his Louis XV., is one of the finest pieces of character work ever done on the screen. The licentious old king lives before your eyes. Who says they can't portray character in moving pictures merely because they use mechanical dolls instead of actors as a rule? Go to see His Most Christian Majesty. Henry VIII., and some of the others of his court, at the Rivoli this week.The Anne Boleyn of Henny Porten is also convincing most of the time, though it is to be regretted that Miss Porten seems so heavy sometimes, and is not as personable as she seemed in Henry's eyes. There's no doubt that in some scenes she does finished acting, becoming truly impressive at times, especially in the scenes preceding her execution, but when she tries to be young and gay she misses her mark. As photographed, at least, she is too old and too ponderous, possibly too Teptonic, for "sweet Anne," if not for the tragic Queen.The others in the cast, discreetly unnamed, are well enough suited to their parts, and persuasive in their acting, though in some of them that methodical ponderosity commonly attributed to the Germans is too evident.There is nothing to suggest the quality of heaviness about Mr. Lubitsch, however. He has a Continental touch. Did he ever work in Paris or Vienna? Anyhow, his continuity and his separate scenes are handled with deftness. There is eloquence in almost every picture and in succession the scenes compose a climactic story that marches straight to its ending and stops when the end comes, which it does with Anne Boleyn going to the executioner's block in one of the most effective scenes ever put upon the screen. Mr. Lubitsch is a cinematician, too. He has to be to make such expressive moving pictures. Thank heaven, they have not been overloaded with subtitles, and they do not need as many as they have. Rich, colorful, dramatic, "Deception" is a photoplay for those who want genuine realism and can do without simpering heroines, pretty heroes, mechanical plots, and sentimental happy endings.King Vidor's latest work. "The Sky Pilot" is at the Strand this week, and, despite some obtrusive faults, and an overdone ending, it is a corking melodrama. Pictorially it is exceptional. Mr.Vidor's chief talent seems to be for making magically lighted, atmospheric moving pictures which convey meanings to spectators, though he seems to takespecial pride himself in his moral earnestness. Some will probably find much of the latter in "The Sky Pilot," but others will have to ignore it in order to enjoy the melodrama. It may be added, too, that if Dr. Crafts is successful in barring from the screen all picturesthat "offend the religious belief of any person," "The Sky Pilot" may run into difficulties, for surely there are professed Christians who believe in a spiritual and rationalized, rather than a physical and superstitious church militant. How faithful a translation of Ralph Connor's novel the picture is, the writer cannot say.The best acting is done by David Butler, as a ranch foreman. John Bowers, as the missionary, is satisfactory most of the time, and Colleen Moore does well enough except when her Broadway make-up and cabaret smile are too conspicuous.Ivan Abramson's "Mother Eternal," with Vivian Martin at the head of thecast, opened at the Casino last night; the Rialto is celebrating its fifth anniversary with "Sacred and ProfaneLove," directed by William D. Taylor, with Elsie Ferguson, at the head of its bill, and "Made in Heaven," with Tom Moore, is the photoplay at the Capitol.
