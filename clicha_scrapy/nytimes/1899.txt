88-> ALGER AND THE CABINET.
The present predicament of the Secretary of War is illustrative not so much of his official incompetency as of his personal traits. Of course, his official incompetency is abysmal. But to "stick" for weeks in a place which everybody concerned, including the man who put you in it, wants you to get out of, that is behavior which has nothing to do with your official capacity or incapacity.

89-> WORLD'S FAIRS.
The threats made by a few persons in England, Germany, the United States, and other countries to withhold patronage from the Paris Exposition of 1900 shows that there is a pretty widespread misapprehension of the object and effect of world's fairs.

In to-day's issue of THE SATURDAY REVIEW a correspondent complains that he is satiated with novels, and inquires if any one ever reads a list of "ologies" that evidently delight his particular soul.

" The New Pacific," the subject which occupies Mr. Robert Howe Bancroft's attention, had necessarily to be treated in an extended manner. History does not depend on a single incident.

--------
168-> BEAUTIFUL POSTAL CARDS.; Illustrated Examples Shown at Venice Art Exposition the Work of Celebrated Artists in Italy.
ROME, Aug. 25. -- It has been only a few years since the illustrated postal card became a popular "fad," but since that time it has never lost ground or passed out of favor. On the contrary it has grown and advanced with such strides as to have become at once a separate and important industry and a recognized and permanent branch of useful and decorative art. 
--------
169-> BAUDOUINE BANKRUPTCY CASE.; Lawyers for the Creditors Inquire Into His Gambling Debts -- A Watch Not on the Schedule.
The John F. Baudouine bankruptcy proceedings were continued yesterday before Theodor Aub, referee in bankruptcy. As at most previous hearings, John F. Baudouine, who admits receiving an income of $2,000 or more a month, and that he could pay his debts with it if he wished, was the sole witness. 
--------
170-> DR. CLENDENIN CRITICISED.
To-day's TIMES contains an article which makes it appear that the Rev. Dr. Clendenin and his vestry believe there is a close connection between the burning of their church, St. Peter's, and their refusal to have the ordination of Dr. Briggs take place in the lately burned edifice. 
--------
171-> Sloan Unplaced in Yesterday's Races.
LONDON, Sept. 21. -- At the first day of the Manchester September meeting to-day the De Trafford Handicap of 500 sovereigns, for three-year-olds and upward, was won by Scrivener. Red Queen, ridden by Tod Sloan, was unplaced. Ten horses ran one mile and a half.

FISHKILL LANDING, N.Y., July 11. -- The same feeling which for twenty-five years has prevented the consolidation of the twin villages of Fishkill Landing and Matteawan showed itself in the vote upon the question taken to-day, and the proposition was defeated.

--------
178-> QUARITCH.
When Bernard Quaritch died in London on Sunday, Dec. 17, there passed from the bibliographical world probably the most remarkable man that ever entered it. Coming into the world of rare books a mere errand boy, he left it the prince of book sellers, having revolutionized the trade, which he made a profession, and having encouraged the gathering of books to an astonishing degree. 
--------
179-> INTIMIDATION BY GOEBELITES.; Drive Republican Official in Breathitt County frown the Room and Make the Count Without Him.
WINCHESTER, Ky., Nov. 11. -- After several days' suppression, the facts about the wholesale intimidation practice in Judge Redwine's county, Breathitt, came to light to-day. A man who is a high official came here and told the story. He said it would be as much as his life is worth if it became known that he gave out the information. 
--------
180-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
The details of the coming trip around the world to be taken by Alfred Vanderbilt, Douglass Cochran, William P. Burden, and Adrian Iselin, Jr. which were received from Newport yesterday, recall the fact that when the announcement of this trip was first exclusively published in this column last January, the same newspaper which now gives the story such prominence, vigorously denied its truth.

BRICK CHURCH, N.J., Nov. 11. -- The third Horse Show of the Orange Riding and Driving Club came to a successful close to-night with a fine exhibition of horses in several harness and saddle classes. There was a larger attendance than at any previous time during the three days of the exhibition.

--------
183-> Of Fighting for Glory.
What shall we say of him who fights not simply for pelf, but for worldly honor, that he may be esteemed and valued as such a valiant man, and so on? My answer is: Greed of honor and greed of gold are both greed and one as wrong as the other; whoever fights in such a vicious spirit will gain hell. 
--------
184-> THE REPULSE OF GEN. GATACRE.
It is not a good showing for the British Army, it is not a good showing for modern civilization in consequence, which has just been made by, or more properly of, Gen. GATACRE. That officer thought to make a brilliant stroke by surprising an intrenched camp of Boers, and he has succeeded in making only what the French call a "stroke missed." 
--------
185-> THE GOLD DEMOCRATS.
Somewhat prematurely, as it seems to us, the subject of a Presidential nomination by the Gold Democrats next year has come up for discussion. The Washington Star invites the Gold Democrats to vote directly for the Republican candidates. In that way, it reasons, they will make their votes count double against Bryanism, while an independent candidacy might imperil the sound-money cause by dividing the forces that defend it. 
--------
186-> THE BUILD OF THE YACHTS.
In this morning's TIMES I notice a communication from "An Old Shipowner," which is very misleading. He says, apropos of Columbia and Shamrock: "The British yachtsmen have entirely abandoned their style of build and have adopted our own, (the Shamrock being a close copy of the Defender.")

TITUSVILLE, Penn., Nov. 11. -- Three masked robbers blew open the safe at the D.A.V. and P. Railway ticket office last night, but secured only about $20.

So far as has been ascertained only one man is dead and three are missing. 
--------
192-> REPUBLICANS ARE HOPEFUL.; Assert that Favorable Reports of the Outlook Are Coming In.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22. -- The Committee on Organization and Literature appointed immediately after the meeting of the Republican National Committee, has begun correspondence at once, and already reports the receipt of letters from different parts of the country setting forth the temper and condition of the party. The reports are said to be uniformly satisfactory.

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31. -- The new Russian cruiser Variag was launched to-day at Cramps' shipyards with impressive ceremonies. The religious ceremonies formed a spectacular feature. In addition to passing a gilded cross before the huge hull in benediction the Rev. Mr. Hatovitsky sprinkled the vessel with holy water. 
--------
194-> W.W. ASTOR, OF ENGLAND.
A British bard has in familiar lines inculcated the great general truth that a man's nationality is a matter of accident and not of volition. It could not have occurred to Mr. W.S. GILBERT that a nomadic American would make his words come literally true: 
--------
195-> TO STOP FLATBUSH ROBBERIES.
The numerous recent robberies in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and the failure of the police of that borough to catch the criminals may lead to a shake up in the Brooklyn Detective Bureau, of which Capt. James Reynolds is in command.

Lady Randolph Churchill's son, Winston Churchill, is making a gay and gallant fight in conjunction with his extraordinary colleague, Mawdsley, a Socialist workingman, who has come forward as a Tory candidate. 
--------
203-> THE FIGHT IN THE PHILIPPINES.
It might be interesting to those who write in opposition to our actions in the Philippines to know how one of their common every-day fellow-citizens looks at the question. They quote our struggles during the Revolution as resembling those of the Filipinos at present. The struggle is about the same, but how about the people engaged? 
--------
204-> LENOX.
LENOX, Mass., July 1. -- One of the largest entertainments given in Lenox this season was a dinner given by Mr. and Mrs. John Sloane as a sort of farewell before their departure for Europe. The dinner was given in honor of Capt. Smith of the Majestic and Judge Howland of New York. A large number of the cottagers were invited to meet these guests.

NEW ORLEANS, La., Sept. 21. -- The financial situation in Guatemala is about as bad as possible.

--------
210-> THE COLLEGES AND COMMERCE.
The Presidents of two of the large universities spoke before the Export Congress in Philadelphia the other day on what sort of education the colleges could give that would fit young men for commerce.

The ninety-fourth annual banquet of the New England Society in the City of New York, held in the grand ball room of the Waldorf-Astoria last night, was declared by many old members of the society to be the most elaborate in their recollection. It was remarkable, too, as being made the occasion of a pro-British demonstration on the part of the majority of the 528 members and guests at table. 
--------
212-> An Index to Subjects in Books.
It is considered essential to every book to have a table of contents, and also an index of subjects, and several publishers have advantageously published in connection with their catalogues an alphabetical index of all subjects in all their books, as it increases sales, as buyers generally ask for all books the publisher issues relating to the subject of interest to them. 
--------
213-> GEN. TORAL'S COURT-MARTIAL.; Defense of the Spanish General Charged with Having Surrendered Santiago Before It Was Necessary.
MADRID, Aug. 2. -- The defense of Gen. Toral, on trial by court-martial charged with surrendering Santiago de Cuba to the Americans without having exhausted all means of defense, is that Santiago was not a fortified town within the meaning of the regulations, which fact modified the circumstances from the point of view of military justice. 
--------
214-> Article 8 -- No Title
CHICAGO, Nov. 21. -- Aaron Wolfsohn surprised his uncle, S. Blumenthal, a wholesale liquor dealer, by calling on him while en route for the East. His appearance at the Blumenthal residence was unexpected to the last degree, and his reception was as much a surprise to him as it was to his uncle and aunt.

232-> SAMOA AND THE OPEN DOOR.
That is a very interesting suggestion which comes from London that the real "compensation" for England's acquiescence in an agreement which shuts her out from any share in the "control, disposition, or government" of the Samoan archipelago is to be looked for in China.

317-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Improving Conditions Shown in a Greater Variety of Business. APARTMENT HOUSES IN DEMAND Latest Sales by Brokers -- Auctioneers Preparing for Spring Business -- Only Foreclosures for This Week.
Sales in greater variety, many of them involving good-sized amounts, have contributed to the market's steady improvement during the week and strengthened the belief that there is an active Spring season ahead. The purchase of the southwest corner of Broadway and White Street, a ten-story building, by James B. Haggin, brings the city's main thoroughfare to the front again and in a most gratifying way. 
--------
318-> The Day Celebrated in Rome.
ROME, Nov. 30. -- Thanksgiving Day was celebrated by the American colony in Rome with the usual enthusiasm.

--------
319-> THE BOER CASE REVIEWED.; "No Justification for the Shocking War Between Two Christian Nations."
In your issue of Dec. 20 you publish Mr. Shearman's twenty-six articles against the Boers, but with all the legal ability of the writer he makes out a poor case. His twenty-six articles furnish no justification for the shocking war between two Christian nations, who instead of fighting should at this Christmas season be rejoicing in the advent of the Prince of Peace. 
--------
320-> ROLAND B. MOLINEUX'S TRIAL.; Justice Fursman of the Supreme Court Sets the Date.

321-> PET DOGS, PRIZE WINNERS; Large Thanksgiving Day Attendance at American Club's Show. MRS. HOWARD GOULD'S LUCK Championship Awards Left Over Till To-day, When the Exhibition Will Close.
When the management of the American Pet Dog Club's annual show, now in progress at the Metropolitan Opera House, decided to keep the show open on Thanksgiving Day there were many in the club who predicted that whatever might be the fate of the show on the other days of the exhibition, it would on the holiday get only a frosty reception from the members of the social world. 
--------
322-> The Lyre Bird.
The ground is hidden beneath a mass of Jungle grass, sword grass, and fern, all bowed under a weight of moisture, and this forest is dreary, damp, and cold. It is hilly country, and you hear the notes of the different birds echoing and deceiving you. They are all high, piping sounds, save now and then when a thud-thud like a thunder bolt seems to strike the earth. 
--------
323-> RELIEF FOR A HERO'S WIDOW.; Bill in Favor of Hattie A. Phillips Is Now Pending in Congress.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. -- A bill is now pending in Congress for the relief of Hattie A. Phillips, the widow of John Phillips. Two Congresses have failed to pass on similar bills, but it is believed that the revival of patriotic enthusiasm brought about by the war will ensure the passage of this one, especially as there is a desire to honor heroes. 
--------
324-> CHICAGO, I7; BROWN, 0.; Western Men Have It All Their Own Way.
CHICAGO, Nov. 30. -- The University of Chicago finished her triumphant series to-day by defeating Brown by a score of 17 to 0. Only twice in the game did Brown menace the Maroon goal, and each time Chicago braced with fine spirit and saved her goal from the rushes of the Rhode Islanders. From centre to end the Maroons outpointed Brown, and gave an exhibition of consistent defense which she has seldom surpassed. 
--------
325-> THE GOVERNMENT OF SAMOA.; Germany Seems to Stand in the Way of a Two-Power Agreement.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. -- The negotiations for the partition of the Samoan Islands are proceeding rapidly and officials here would not be surprised if a final agreement were reached in the near future.

--------
326-> THE NEBRASKA SENATORSHIP.; Mr. Hayward Is Sinking Very Rapidly and Speculation as to His Successor Is Active.
OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 30. -- Reports received at the capital this evening indicate that Senator-elect M.L. Hayward has but a few hours to live. He will probably die before morning.

Allen, W.J. Bryan, Gilbert A. Hitchcock, and Gov. Poynter.

LONDON. July 2. -- Our end of the half-year money scrimmage has been got through with comparative ease. Borrowings from the Bank of England have been about as usual -- ten millions -- but now money will be cheap for a month at least. The truth is that your exports of gold have saved the European markets from considerable danger, and if they continue we shall probably have moderate rates for money until Autumn. 
--------
332-> DREYFUS HAS A DAY OF TRIUMPH; Adverse Odds of 10 to 1 Are Suddenly Reversed. MERCIER'S ATTACK FUTILE The ex-Minister Fails to Prove the Prisoner's Guilt. M. CASIMIR-PERIER TESTIFIES Ex-President's Fixed Purpose Appears to be to Refute the Charges. DISORDER AT RENNES Numerous Persons Injured and More Than Fifty Arrested -- Three Duels to be Fought.
RENNES, Aug. 12. -- Until now the chances were 10 to 1 against Capt. Dreyfus's acquittal. To-day the inanity of Gen. Mercier's evidence has reversed the odds. For the first time the President of the Court returned Dreyfus's salute. Dreyfus's final outburst against Mercier converted half of those persons in the courtroom who still believed in the prisoner's culpability. 
--------
333-> GREAT BRITAIN'S ATTITUDE.
LONDON, Sept. 30. -- The Duke of Devonshire, Lord President of the Council, at a public luncheon at the Technical Schools at New Mills, Derbyshire, near Manchester, this afternoon, replying to a toast to his health, referred to the Transvaal situation, saying: 
--------
334-> NEW SENSATION IN PARIS; A Girl Poisoned Because She was Heiress to a Fortune. THE ANTI-DREYFUS PRESS Rochefort's Paper Says All Who Ap proach Dreyfus Have Ill-Luck and Hopes for Jos. Reinach's
PARIS, Aug. 4. -- A "beau crime" always enlists attention the world over. The one that is to have its denouement at Rennes in a few days has a strong rival among French readers at the present moment -- poisoning case, in which the motive for the deed is thought to be the desire to gain possession of an inheritance through the disappearance of the co-inheritor. 
--------
335-> Star Pointer to Race No More.
CLEVELAND, Oct. 23. -- The famous stallion Star Pointer has been taken off the track by his owner, W.J. White. The great pacer's leg will never again be in condition for racing. 
--------
336-> THE PUNISHMENT OF CAPT. CARTER.
It is not without significance, whether the coincidence were accidental or not, that the action of the President confirming the sentence of Capt. CARTER was announced on the day that the army was joining in the tribute of the Nation to Admiral DEWEY. Terrible as is the fate of the faithless officer, his punishment is an illustration of the standard which the United States sets for its soldiers and its sailors. 
--------
337-> NO GERMAN INTERFERENCE.; Disposal of Portuguese East Africa Must Antedate Transvaal War.
BERLIN, Sept. 30. -- The Transvaal situation continues to interest Germany, though th's interest has somewhat flagged, owing to the uncertainty of the situation throughout the week.

339-> MAZET COMMITTEE'S WORK; Councilmen and Aldermen on Municipal Assembly's Abolition. SOME FAVOR IT, OTHERS DO NOT Okie Thinks the Charter the Rottenest Thing on Earth -- Question of Bond Hold-Ups.
The sensations which were expected to result from the appearance of members of the Municipal Assembly before the Mazet committee yesterday did not materialize. Five Councilmen and four Aldermen were examined during the day, and a number of criticisms of the charter and of the results of consolidation were evoked, but there was nothing startling in any of the testimony, and the session was totally devoid of exciting incidents. 
--------
340-> BOERS AND THE BRITISH.
The engagements thus far between the Boers and the British have singularly failed to confirm the indications of the war of 1881. The fight at Majuba Hill, although in the technical language of war only an "affair," was a brilliant victory for the Boers. Not only in the actual fighting, but in the planning it showed them to be clearly superior to the invaders. 
--------
341-> IN THE TEXTILE MARKETS.; Some of the Divisions Are Quiet, but All Display Strength -- Clothiers Cannot Get Samples.
While some parts of the textile markets are quiet now, there is the same underlying strength which has characterized them for the past six months. In fact, they are probably in a firmer position than ever, as far as woolens, worsteds, dress goods, cotton goods, and knit goods are concerned. They are all strongly backed by the conditions in the markets for raw material, which shows not only great firmness, but strong advances. 
--------
342-> THE PRESIDENT'S VACATION.; He Is More Free from Care than at Any Time Since His Election.
PLATTSBURG, N.Y., Aug. 12. -The close of the second week of the President's stay at Hotel Champlain finds both the President and Mrs. McKinley greatly improved in health and spirits.

--------
343-> ARABIAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENT.
At last the French are to have a complete translation of "The Arabian Nights' Entertainment." Dr. J.C.

Brentano's are the first in this country to receive an installment of "Le Livre des Mille Nuits et un Nuit," which in its entirety will include fifteen volumes of about 600 pages each. 
--------
344-> OBERAMMERGAU'S PERIL.; An American Methodist Minister Laments the Loss of the Simplicity and Artlessness of the Past.
A few of the readers of Zion's Herald will next year visit the famous Passion Play at Oberammergau; thousands will read with interest descriptions of the same. The American people are pretty generally acquainted with this strange play, which is given every ten years by these quaint Bavarian country folk. 
--------
345-> DELAWARE COUNTY JUDGESHIP.; Senate Clerk Gleason Says He Does Not Want the Place.
There is a lively scramble for the Judgeship of Delaware County, made vacant by the elevation of Judge A.H. Sewall to the Supreme Court bench. About twenty candidates are in the field.

STROUDSBURG, Penn., Nov. 30. -- The deer season, which closed to-day in Monroe and Pike Counties, has given great sport to New York hunters.

--------
348-> SOUTH ORANGE TROLLEY CAR FIRE.; Underwriters Estimate the Insurance Loss at $200,000.
NEWARK, N.J., Aug. 3. -- The fire which broke out in the big power house and car sheds of the South Orange division of the North Jersey Railway Company, at South Orange, last night, after they had been struck by lightning, proved far more disastrous than at first supposed. When the ruins were in such shape this morning that an inspection could be made, it was found that nearly, eighty cars had been destroyed. 
--------
349-> GOUGED OUT EX-CONVICT'S EYE.; Murphy's 'Victim in a Hospital and May Never Leave Alive.
Mike O'Donald, an ex-convict, got into a fight last night over a game of cards on canalboat at the foot of East Sixty-seventh Street. John S.

LONDON, Sept 30. -- The coming war is the universal topic here. Nobody apparently even thinks of any other question. That there is to be war seems to be the general conclusion. Even the crusted Tories admit that the Government will fall with the suddenness of a lightning flash if it shows the slightest sign of weakness in its dealings with the Boers. 
--------
354-> SCOTSMAN'S CREW ARRESTED.
QUEBEC, Quebec, Sept. 30. -- Under orders from Capt. Skrimshire all members of the crew of the Scotsman brought up this morning by the Grecian were held under arrest to be searched.

--------
360-> THE NEW YORK POST OFFICE.
That was a pathetic letter from a postal clerk which we printed yesterday. Moreover, the writer was entirely in the right. The postal clerks are overworked and still the service is unsatisfactory. The local delivery is especially unsatisfactory in comparison not only with the great cities of Europe, but even with what has been done here in the past. 
--------
361-> WILL OWN THE WORLD'S GOLD.; Col. Treweek Says America Is Likely to Possess It All in Ten Years.

--------
388-> ENGLISH PEOPLE OUR FRIENDS.
It does seem strange that Americans should presume to advise England as to what its duty is toward the Boers.

396-> RAMAPO AND MORALS.
So far as immediate investigation is concerned, the Ramapo incident was closed when Judge TRUAX left the stand, defiantly remarking that he knew a good deal about the matter if Mr. Moss cared to ask him for it. Mr. Moss did not care to. The scheme, Controller COLER says, is not dead. President HOLAHAN insists that it will yet be adopted. 
--------
397-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-----While in Chicago last week, Mr. EDWARD ATKINSON went through an experience little less painful than that to which he was recently subjected by a monster in human form in want of $100. It was the morning after the great anti-expansion meeting, and the eminent Aguinaldian was seated in the breakfast room of his hotel, strengthening himself for further contests with accomplished facts and the progress of events.

--------
406-> REPLY TO SOUTHERN GOVERNORS
You have served our country to great advantage in getting a direct revelation of their minds from so many of our Southern Governors. 
--------
407-> AUTUMN WITH THE POETS.
Feeling strongly as we do that "now comes on the sweet of the year" and that a golden October day is much rarer than the highly lauded day in June, it is with surprise that we find the Autumn with so few to sing her praises. Nearly all writers seem to agree with Bryant's The melancholy days have come, the saddest of the year.

411-> ENGLAND'S RULE BETTER.
It has been a pleasure to note the long view of the South African war taken in THE TIMES of Sunday and Monday. We all lament the apparent lack of tact and patience of Mr. Chamberlain, but he is possessed of more information as to what has been going on behind the scenes than his critics. 
--------
412-> TAXATION OF BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES.
The substantial grievance of banks in this State, so far as they are in competition with trust companies, lies in the difference in the taxation of the two classes of institutions. There are trust companies, mostly those recently organized, which encroach upon the banking field by inviting general mercantile deposits and dealing in commercial paper, but many believe that this will rectify itself. 
--------

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4. -- The Street Cleaning Department of this city has now on file a report of one of its Inspectors on the condition of Thirty-first and South Streets, Georgetown. The report should be ranked as a classic in official literature. Complaint had been made to the District Commissioners that the streets were dirty and that weeds were growing in them. 
--------
414-> SQUABBLING SENATORS.
Possibly there are no two colleagues in the Senate, unless they be representatives of very untutored communities, whose public quarreling would attract less attention than the public quarreling of the Senators of New Hampshire. New Hampshire seemed to DANIEL WEBSTER, according to a popular legend, a good place "to emigrate from," and the present Senators of the Commonwealth have not promoted the notion that it is a good State in which to remain.

--------
416-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
With the international yacht races commanding so much public attention, it is hardly probable that strong efforts will be made to help the security market toward improvement. Matters of the money market will be likely to run their course and exert such influences as the lesser traders of the Stock Exchange may choose to promote -- and most of them are on the bear side.

In your editorial to-day entitled "Latin-American Distrust," you advise President McKinley in sketching out his annual message to Congress not to omit "to provide a paragraph somewhere to counteract the distrust of our intentions that is being cultivated by the anti-imperialist press in those South American republics that have in large part adopted constitutions resembling our own, and have for many years entertained a feeling of fellow-republicanism toward the United States."

The choice for occupants of prominent New York pulpits is narrowing down, so that there is reason to believe that some selections will be made this Fall.

Faunce to the Presidency of Brown University, three men are under consideration by the officers of the church.

LONDON, Oct. 1. -- Last week was one of great tension and excitement destructive to business.

Of all the articles in last week's issue of your splendid SATURDAY REVIEW, the one that pleased me most and that tickled the very cockles of my heart was that on Frederick Saunders.

462-> A Blasphemous Assumption.
I should like to say a word in reference to Mr. Albert E. McKay's comments in the last number of THE TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW on Edwin Markham's "Man With the Hoe."

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 13. -- A private letter received by Edward A.T. Gallagher of this city says that American sentiment in Guatemala against United States Minister W.

LONDON, July 14. -- Shamrock in crossing the Atlantic will have a longer boom than she carries in the trial races. This will increase the spread of her canvas. The first trial with the Britannia will occur on Tuesday. 
--------
473-> THE CAREER OF TAMMANY.
The facts brought out by the career of Tammany Hall in recent years show one feature worth especial attention. I mean the utterly sordid character of our rulers. We live under a despotic Government, which rules us avowedly for the plunder it can get from us. 
--------
474-> HEARD MURDER VICTIM'S CRY.; Jamestown Boys Ran to the Spot of a Brutal Crime as the Perpetrator Made Off.
JAMESTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 23. -- The cries of a woman attracted the attention of three boys in the village of Falconer, near this city, about 8 o'clock this evening. 
--------
475-> THE BRITISH RESERVES.
It is not surprising that the recent reverses of the British arms should have stimulated the British press to call for large and immediate reinforcements. These reverses, by the way, have been entirely confined to the Cape Colony side and the southern border of the Orange Free State. 
--------
476-> INDIANS HOPE TO BEAT HARVARD.; Carlisle Men Ease Up in Their Training for the Big Game.
CARLISLE, Penn., Oct. 24. -- The Indian football team's coach, "Pop" Warner, returned yesterday from Cambridge, where he had been absorbing information on Harvard's work. He seems to think that Harvard's offensive play is not up to standard, and his hopes for a victory are strengthened.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Nov. 2. -- The Government of Costa Rica has definitely refused to surrender Rutherford, the man charged with the murder of the American citizen, Archer unless the British Government guarantees not to inflict capital punishment, to which the Government cannot accede, thus closing the case so far as Jamaica is concerned. 
--------
481-> LUMBER AGREEMENT UPHELD.; Plan of Exporters to Sell Through One Agency Not Designed to Suppress Competition.
A number of corporations and copartnerships, dealers in lumber in Manhattan and Brooklyn, some time ago entered into a contract for the purpose of transacting together the part of their business which consisted of the export trade, and dividing the profits and losses in certain agreed proportions, and for that purpose the Export Lumber Company, Limited was intrusted with that work. 
--------

NEW HAVEN, Nov. 14. -- There are said to be no less than twelve plays planned by the Yale coaches for the game with Harvard. The work to-day was no heavier than yesterday, but was much faster.

--------
486-> PUT CHILD'S BODY IN FURNACE.; Woman Arrested in Philadelphia While Attempting to Dispose of a Little Corpse.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 14. -- Locked up at Police Headquarters in the City Hall is a white woman, charged with burning the body of a new-born infant in the cellar furnace of a boarding house. 
--------
487-> AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL QUARREL.
Nothing is more persistent than archaeological jealousies, and when Assyriologists have a row it always is of a rancorous kind. The English explorers at Susa, in Persia, complain of the "French pin pricks." The old capital of the Chaldean Kingdom, which is Susa, has been given up to a "Delegation Scientifique Francaise en Perse." An archaeological Marchand was there, and arranged a treaty between the French and Persian Governments. 
--------
488-> THE FIGHT FOR MOLINEUX; Handwriting Expert Kinsley Now Under Cross-Examination. ADMITS HE KEPT NO RECORDS Mr. Weeks Endeavors to Show Loose Methods in His Handling of the Exhibits.

Mr. Rowland E. Prothero, in his third volume of "The Works of Lord Byron," presents many letters which have never before been published. The period embraced is between January, 1814, and November, 1816. There are not less than 233 letters, of which 118 are new. 
--------
493-> TOO HIGH.
The cartoon which our contemporary The Herald has published depicting the Island of Cuba helpless in the serpent coils of the Western Union cable monopoly is an impressive composition. The Western Union Company's control of the island seems to be complete and exclusive. 
--------
494-> GOVERNOR ON LIBRARIES.; Mr. Roosevelt in Happy Mood at Oyster Bay Cornerstone Laying -- Reference to Admiral Dewey.
OYSTER BAY, Oct. 2. -- Gov. Roosevelt laid the cornerstone of the new Free Library Building here this afternoon. The Governor was in a happy mood, and talked for a short time. It was not a set speech, and was largely devoted to Oyster Bay affairs. The new building stands on Main street on a hill which overlooks the bay. 
--------
495-> SHAMROCK'S SPARS ARRIVE; Challenging Yacht's Racing Poles and Gear on the Furnessia. GREATEST SECRECY OBSERVED The Pieces Wrapped in Canvas and All Persons Warned Away -- Custom House Has No Jurisdiction.

R.H. Elliot defeated W.C. Fergueson by 7 up and 6 to play. Craig Colgate defeated L.M. Richmond by 3 up and 2 to play. 
--------
497-> "THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG."
At this time, when a few malicious critics have set themselves up to pass judgment upon the private and personal actions of an American gentlemen, it seems that a word of encouragement and sympathy in this matter, that has so unfortunately disturbed the peace of mind of our National hero, should take the form of a personal communication. 
--------
498-> BELIEVES REAL ISSUE HIDDEN.
The characteristic trait of the American public to blow hot and cold with one breath was never better illustrated than in the case of Admiral Dewey. 
--------
499-> YALE TO PLAY A LIGHT GAME.; To Save the Men as Much as Possible at West Point To-day.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 3. -- The practice of the 'Varsity eleven to-day was short and light. It consisted mainly in rehearsing the signals and going through the formations to be tried against West Point to-morrow and was entirely secret. Yale has two men on the crippled list. Thomas, at end, and Stillman, the left tackle. 
--------
500-> YALE UNIVERSITY FINANCES.; Fund Now Nearly $5,000,000 -- Almost $100,000 Donated During the Year -- Returns 5 Per Cent.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 23. -- The Yale University Corporation held its regular Fall meeting in this city to-day. Practically the full membership was in attendance.

--------
501-> Subscriber 899 Writes
" THAT wielder of words who for any reason cannot have access to The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia and Atlas, and who has not yet been tantalized by an opportunity of examining it during an hour or two, is the most-to-be-pitied literary woman or man I know. For the inspection would have convinced him that whatever he could possibly want to know about any English word, is in these volumes. 
--------
502-> BIG TRAP SHOOTING TOURNEY.; Plan for a New York Championship on the New Interstate Grounds.
Several prominent trap shooters are at work on the preliminary arrangements for a big trap shooting carnaval that will be inferior in importance only to the Grand American Handicap and the Annual Amateur Championship of America. The plan is to hold a tournament for the championship of Greater New York the competition to be open to all shooters within a radius of fifty miles of this city. 
--------
503-> "PEACE ON EARTH, GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN."
It seems almost a mockery to transcribe, on the eve of this Christmas, the words which ushered in the birth of CHRIST. The Nativity was hailed as the beginning of the fulfillment of the prophecy that the nations "should not learn war any more." As a matter of fact, so large a part of the population was never, in nominally Christian countries, actively engaged in "learning war" as is so engaged now. 
--------
504-> MORGAN'S "LEAGUE OF THE IROQUOIS."
At a charity sale in Rochester last week, a book turned up of a rarity and local interest that gave to the "find" a dramatic character. And, though this is not altogether unusual, the quality fails, generally at least to arouse as much popular curiosity as has this. 
--------
505-> EXCHANGED HATS AND COATS.; Bellevue Visiting Physicians in a Confusion of Attire.
Drs. Samuel Alexander, L.B. Bangs, and F.W. Jackson, attached to the visiting staff of Bellevue Hospital, were worried yesterday afternoon by the temporary loss of their overcoats and hats.

After the more important matters had been disposed of, Dr. Jackson left the board room hurriedly, seizing an overcoat and hat from a table near him. 
--------
506-> INDIANS' GOOD PRACTICE.
CARLISLE, Penn., Nov. 23. -- The Indians practiced in the gymnasium to-night on account of the inclemency of the weather. All of the regular team were present in their places, and displayed much acuteness in running the signals. Several end plays were practiced, and were found to work with much rapidity. The guard plays also worked successfully. 
--------
507-> WILLS OF HOTEL FIRE VICTIMS.; Husband and Wife at the Windsor Left Property to Each Other.
LAWRENCE, Mass., Sept. 13. -- The case of J.Q.A. Johnson, administrator, versus Richard M. Bourne, administrator, and the Newburyport Five Cents Savings Bank, which will be tried here on Friday before Judge Sherman, is ore of unusual interest. Property worth about $60,000 is involved in the suit, which will recall the fatal Windsor Hotel fire in New York on March 17, 1899. 
--------
508-> TAMMANY'S HAND IN RAMAPO JOB; Corporation Counsel Whalen Pleads for the Contract. MR. CROKER'S CHIEF ADVISER Strong Allegation that He Will Vote for the Proposal. The Controller Declares that Water Rings Honeycomb the State, and Again Illustrates the Power of the Ramapo Plotters. TAMMANY'S HAND IN RAMAPO JOB
All doubt, it is believed, as to the complicity of Richard Croker and Tammany Hall generally in the plot to deliver the city over to the Ramapo Water Company was removed yesterday when Corporation Counsel Whalen, Mr. Croker's most intimate friend and political adviser, said: "This contract should not be condemned by the public until the water company's side has been heard. 
--------
509-> PUT POISON IN HIS WELL.; Mystery in an Attempt to Kill Stage Driver's Family.
KENSICO, N.Y., Dec. 14. -- A sensation was caused in Armonk to-day when it became known that an attempt had been made to poison the family of Robert Cox. He is proprietor of a boarding house in Armonk and operates the stage route from Armonk. 
--------
510-> Books For a Fire Company.
In the column of questions and answers I notice the request of U.F.I from Ansonia. Conn., for a list of ten or twenty best books for a fire company. Having been a member of the fire department in my own town for fifteen years. I feel sure the following list is a good one. 
--------
511-> McCOY TO BOX AT CHICAGO.; Son of a Wealthy Clothier Will Be His Partner.
CHICAGO, Aug. 14. -- Norman Selby, better known as Kid McCoy to folks who are familiar with ring matters, wanted to come to Chicago, and, being desirous of exercising with the padded gloves in a decorous and gentle manner, wired his friends of the Griddle Club that it would give him much pleasure to add to the amusement they had planned for Saturday evening.

--------
514-> THE TRIUMPH OF PEACE; Unexpected Gains the Result of the Disarmament Conference. POINT TO WORLD FEDERATION Dr. Darby Declares the Imperative Needs of Europe and Family Tradition Prompted the Czar's Action.
A meeting held under the Joint auspices of the Philanthropic Committee of the Religious Society of Friends and the Young Friends' Association, to which the public was invited, was held in the Friends' Meeting House at Fifteenth Street and Rutherfurd Place, last evening, when an address was delivered by Dr. W.

--------
515-> ACTOR'S DRAMATIC SUICIDE; Clark Tried to Kill His Wife -- Failing, Short Himself. HOLIDAY CROWDS SAW HIM DIE Tragedy Occurred at Fifth Avenue and Twenty-third Street -- The Bullets Grazed Mrs. Clark's Head.
The holiday crowds surging past the always busy corner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-third Street, in one continuous kaleidoscopic, cosmopolitan parade, were startled just after 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon by the sudden advent of death. Above the tramp of hurrying feet, the clanging of loaded cable cars a buzz of shoppers' chatter, and the hoarse cries of street vendors, they heard three pistol shots discharged rapidly. 
--------
516-> RACES AT BRIGHTON BEACH; Small Crowd Sees Four Favorites Land First Money. AFFECT A DISAPPOINTMENT John Daly's Filly Had a Lead of Three Lengths at the Last Furlong, but Lost to Fluke.
Racing at Brighton Beach yesterday was of the commonplace sort, for there was little inducement offered for the few good horses that remain in the vicinity. The crowd that attended the meeting was one of the smallest since the season at Brighton Beach opened, but those who did make the journey were more successful in picking winners than they had been either Wednesday or Thursday. 
--------
517-> THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THE PEOPLE.
With the campaign in Ohio has begun the first serious discussion of the policy of the Administration before the public. It is noteworthy that the only point in which there is any interest shown is the policy in the Philippines. 
--------
518-> STORIES OF TWO AUTHORS.
A characteristic story of Bjornson is going the rounds of the Parisian press. It seems that the recent Congress of the Scandinavian Press at Christiania was more important than many of the invited authors and journalists imagined. King Oscar and many of the intellectual lights of his Court were present. Ibsen in declining the invitation, which is said not to be particularly attractive or informing, wrote a polite note. 
--------
519-> SUBSTITUTE FOR CELLULOID.; German Newspaper Describes Invention of a New Substance.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. -- Consul Liefeld writes from Freiburg, Sept. 23, 1899: 
--------

CHICAGO, Sept. 13. -- The conference on the uses and abuses of trusts and combinations began here to-day with less than half the delegates appointed by the various States in attendance. New York, headed by W. Bourke Cockran, and Wisconsin were most numerously represented. 
--------
522-> Not "Arguing with You," but "Telling You."
My compliments to Mr. Newberry; he certainly has the courage of his prejudices. A man who can dismiss a genius like Meredith with a lofty wave of the hand and exalt such a lightweight as Anstey to the extent of three solid columns of type and cocksureness recalls Whistler and his "I am not arguing with you, I am telling you." 
--------
523-> RIGHTS OF FAITH CURISTS.; Opinion by Attorney General of Indiana -- They Cannot Treat Patients for Pay or Otherwise.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 4. -- Attorney General Taylor, at the request of the State Medical Board, to-day furnished an opinion as to the right of osteopaths, faith curists, mental healers, and others to practice in the State.

--------
524-> BOERS CONCERTED ADVANCE.
LONDON, Oct. 13. -- Advices received here note the presence of the Boers at Maribogo, forty miles south of Mafeking, which seems to indicate that they are endeavoring to get Col. Baden-Powell between two fires.

NEWPORT, Aug. 24. -- To-morrow evening the much heralded ball to be given by W.K. Vanderbilt will occur at the Newport Golf Club. 
--------
527-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Erected in days when dependence upon the newspapers for information about current events was much less nearly complete than it is now, the old Custom House has looked down upon many great assemblages of business men and financiers, gathered in front of its heavy columns to express opinions or take formal action on matters of public moment. 
--------
528-> MARKET CONDITIONS.
Professional Wall Street devoted energy yesterday in speculations as to what might be the showing of to-day's bank statement. Many gruesome predictions were current, though no bank authority of consequence was quoted as taking any other than favorable views of money market prospects. 
--------
529-> WHAT MR. COCKRAN SAID.
The statement attributed to me in some reports of my speech in Carnegie Hall, concerning the political status of Catholics in England, is so palpably absurd that until it had been made the subject of comment I never suposed anybody could be misled by it, or would consider it other than the result of a stenographic error. 
--------
530-> STATE OF SIEGE RAISED.; Servian Government Relieves the Department of Belgrade.

BOSTON, Aug. 25. -- After an exciting trial at Hingham, Mass., Miss Floretta Vining, the club woman, member of the New York Sorosis, and proprietor of a fashionable boarding house at Hull, was to-day convicted on a charge of keeping liquor for sale in violation of law.

--------
536-> INDIANS RESUME THEIR PRACTICE.; Players Depressed by the Defeat by Princeton, but Get to Work.
CARLISLE, Penn., Nov. 14. -- The Indians took their first practice this afternoon after the Princeton game. The players feel very blue over their defeat, particularly over their inability to score, giving as a prime reason for incapacity the paucity of reliable substitutes. For the first time in the history of the eleven, the players, almost without an exception, returned home badly bruised up. 
--------
537-> PITTSBURG AND GULF PLANS.
The modified plan for the reorganization of the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company, as arranged at the request of a number of stockholders by a committee known as the New York committee, the Chairman of which is Ernst Thalmann, has been made public. The modified plan takes the place of the plan declared operative last August. 
--------
538-> PRINCETON PRACTICING HARD.; Every Member of the 'Varsity Appears on the Field.
PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 14. -- The work outlined for the 'Varsity during the coming two weeks will be hard, thorough, and comprehensive.

HAVANA, Nov. 14. -- At a mass meeting of the Republican Party at Cienfuegos yesterday Dr. Vieta said the war had ceased because God had touched the hearts of a great people and inclined them to aid the Cubans in their distress. He then added: 
--------
540-> CASES OF DREYFUS AND CARTER.
In a recent issue of your paper, a correspondent attempts to draw a parallel between the cases of Capts. Dreyfus and Carter, and the argument he presents, while no doubt logical to his own mind, is hardly substantiated by an analysis of the facts as they really exist. Will you therefore kindly permit me to encroach upon the space of your valued paper to the extent of replying briefly to this champion of Capt. Carter? 
--------
541-> DR. HILLIS ON ST. PAUL; His Conversion the Supreme Victory of the Saviour. WORK FOR HUMAN LIBERTY As Hero, Reformer, and Statesman the Preacher Pictures the Apostle to the Gentiles.
The Rev. Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis, pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, who returned last week from a long stay in the Adirondacks, occupied his pulpit yesterday morning and preached to a large congregation.

--------
544-> GOLFERS AND THE SABBATH; Sunday Games on Staten Island Raise a Protest. SIMILAR TROUBLES IN BOSTON All Right to Play for Fun Is the Common Sentiment, but Not for Cups or Medals.
Shall it be golf on Sunday or not on Sunday has been the question that has given Staten Island golfers more to talk about and think about recently than any other local event of the year. This Sunday question was forced upon the attention of the Richmond County fraternity through the offer by Col. J.R. Branch of a gold medal that should represent the championship of the island. 
--------
545-> A LANDMARK TO DISAPPEAR.; The Suydam House, in Brooklyn, 200 Years Old, to be Torn Down.

--------
546-> LIVES LOST AT A FIRE; Flames Destroy Property in Mott Street Worth $150,000. THE ROLL OF THE INJURED Brave Attempts at Rescues Made by William C. Russell, Unemployed, and a Butcher.

The building and its contents were totally destroyed and there is also every evidence that three men lost their lives in the fire while a number were more or less injured, one fatally. 
--------
547-> Volunteers for Boers to be Ignored.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. -- The State Department will take no cognizance of the party recruited by Gustav Theilkuhl for the alleged purpose of going to South Africa, as the department officials say the British authorities have not called attention to the movement, and it is not looked upon as serious.

--------
549-> THE BANKERS.
There still lingers in the minds of the uninformed and prejudiced so much vague but mischievous animosity toward capitalists, and especially toward bankers, that the following plain statement of fact from the columns of The Financial Chronicle regarding the action of the bankers in the panic of last week on the Stock Exchange is peculiarly timely: 
--------
550-> JOHN SARTAIN.; His Reminiscences as Artist and Engraver -- Poe, Ruskin, and Rogers.*
Nothing akin to "Egotistography" is to be found in John Sartain's reminiscences of his most useful life, which closed in October, 1897. Of his own work, the helping hand and the wise guidance he gave to American art, he wrote in so modest a manner that one almost wishes he had more particularly emphasized them. 
--------
551-> THRASH IT OUT.
The Bryan men have started out to have a mass meeting in this city or at some near-by pleasure resort on Labor Day, at which their leader will plead his cause to the workingmen.

--------
553-> PRICE OF ICE ADVANCED.; Only Small Consumers, However, Will Have to Pay Five Cents More a Hundred Pounds.
Many consumers of ice throughout the city have received an unpleasant shock in the past few days through the discovery that they are being charged 30 cents a hundred for ice instead of 25.

555-> Unselfishness and Chivalry.
The two letters published in THE SATURDAY REVIEW of July 22, signed, respectively, "Deanne" and "Kinahan Cornwallis," and written in response to the article entitled "Literary Women and Matrimony," are both so chivalrous -- so keenly appreciative of what is really admirable in woman -- that it is a pleasure to read them.

--------
559-> WHAT WE OWE TO ALFRED THE GREAT.
A careful reading of the Alfred the Great memorial volume, recently issued in London and noticed in last week's number of THE TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW, shows us how many of our present ideas and customs are really traceable to the most ancient times and how much the English-speaking race on both sides of the water owes to the efforts of this great King.

--------
563-> The Aguilar Free Library.
The man who founds a library or promotes the cause of learning among the very poor earns for himself a long-cherished memory. In one of the most congested localities up town there is such a beneficent institution, which acts as a distributive channel of sunlight and refining influences. Domiciled but lately in a new and more commodious home, there is every reason for anticipating its supplemented and greater usefulness in the future. 
--------
564-> A KENTUCKY COAL LAND DEAL.; Four Thousand Acres Bought for a Proposed Corporation.

I am, and have been for many years, a great admirer of your correspondent Capt. John Codman. I enjoyed greatly his reply to Mr. Alexander Smith's letter, printed in your issue of yesterday. 
--------
566-> BROOKLYN SCHOOL SYSTEM.
Nothing more righteously just was ever penned than Superintendent Maxwell's condemnation of the local committee system of appointing teachers in Brooklyn. If there is an evil peculiar to the management of our public schools in this city that may fittingly be characterized as the bane of the system, this is the one. My last promotion as a teacher in the Brooklyn schools was to a position for which there were other candidates. 
--------
567-> DECISION FOR McPARTLAND.; Hooted by Spectators, Who Thought Owen Zeigler Had the Better of the Fight.
" Kid" McPartland of this city got a decision on points over Owen Zeigler of Philadelphia by Referee "Johnny" White at the Broadway Athletic Club last night in a twenty-five-round bout at 138 pounds.

--------

--------
581-> Nationalities in Peking.
As there is no spot on the world's surface so truly cosmopolitan as London, so there are few spots where specimens of so many different distant nationalities may be seen as in Peking. Besides the native Chinese, Manchus, and Mongols, in their varied and gay costumes, members of embassies from Lhassa, Korea, Turkestan, and Nepaul may constantly be seen in the capital, their costumes further enhancing the brightness of the kaleidoscopic Peking streets. 
--------

--------
583-> VISITING YACHTSMEN DEPART.; Designer Fife Was Carried Aboard the Majestic on a Litter.

--------
584-> CIVIL SERVICE REMOVALS.
If my recollection serves me right, it was that adept in the wiles of diplomacy, Talleyrand, who said that the purpose of language was to conceal thought. The statement of Secretary Gage in regard to the administration of the civil service law in his department, published in your issue of yesterday, causes the writer to believe that, as diplomat, the Secretary would certainly be a success. 
--------
585-> THE ATTACK ON DEWEY.; Believed to Have Had Its Origin in Religious Feeling -- Slander and Rumor Rife in Washington.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24. -- Now that the Dewey incident is closed, there is naturally a good deal of speculation as to the origin and cause of the sudden storm of wrath which came up, apparently from a clear sky, and began to beat on the Admiral's head within an hour after the first report of the transfer was known.

--------
594-> Philadelphia and Protection.
THE NEW YORK TIMES treats with good natured sarcasm the sturdy effort Philadelphia is now making through its Export Exposition to cultivate international trade at the same time it holds its place as the citadel of protection.

--------
595-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD.; Sales by Brokers -- Reported Purchase by John Wanamaker -- Transactions in the Auction Room.

--------
599-> SIZE AND SYMPATHY.
EMILE ZOLA'S account of the forces that shape public opinion on the Continent is not flattering to the intelligence of the French, German, and Russians. M. ZOLA himself, while he is no imperialist, is friendly to Great Britain, as he has good reason to be; but French opinion is on the side of the Boers. He gives the reasons:

--------
602-> PROVISIONING A TROOPSHIP.; Quantities and Varieties of Supplies Required -- How They Are Furnished in English Practice.
The Sumatra, which leaves the Royal Albert Docks to-morrow for the Cape, may be taken by way of illustration, though, as she is conveying not more than about 1,200 men, her supplies represent what those concerned regard as rather a "small" order. To persons unacquainted with these things, however, the quantities will appear formidable enough, especially as the supplies in question refer exclusively to what will be required at sea. 
--------
603-> FORTY YEARS A STAGE DRIVER.; Silas Derby Gives Up the Line He Established Between Greenwich and Banksville, Conn.
GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 2. -- Silas Derby, who for forty years has driven a stage almost daily from Greenwich station to Banksville, a distance of sixteen miles, to-day made his last trip, and will now retire to his home in Banksville to spend the remainder of his days.

--------
607-> NEWPORT SOCIETY CHILDREN.
NEWPORT, Aug. 5. -- Master Vincent Astor, son of Col. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor, is one of the youngest whips here, and can be seen almost any morning driving a red- wheeled basket cart to and from Bailey's Beach.

--------
611-> SUMMER NIGHTS CONCERTS.
A certain number of persons in this town, whose tribe we trust may increase, are glad to know that there is once more a place where they may spend their Summer evenings and enjoy the entertainment they like, instead of having only the choice between the entertainment they don't like and none at all. 
--------

614-> THE WASTE OF WATER.
The City Club, by one of those too rare visions of "actuality" which sometimes visit and illuminate it, was tremendously well inspired, a month or two ago, to produce a publication on "The Ramapo Water Scheme."

--------

--------
627-> MARKET CONDITIONS.
Strength in the financial situation was curiously illustrated in yesterday's stock market. Those who observe that the trading list abounds in minus signs will see how little the changes signify. For the most part they are expressed in small fractions. Declines which involved units affected as few stocks as could well be put into a list. 
--------
628-> THE BASIS OF DIVORCE.
The commission that has been in session at Buffalo studying the question of uniformity in State laws received from its committee a report on the basis of divorce to be recommended to the various States for embodiment in a uniform State law.

--------
629-> A YACHT RACE "GONE WRONG."
We have been so accustomed to assuming that the yachting supremacy of the world necessarily lay on this side of the ocean that any evidence to the contrary is necessarily repulsive. And yet, why not?

It is the fear, based upon many acts, official and otherwise, that the ultimate purpose of Great Britain is to annex the Boer Republic that has produced the present really onerous conditions imposed upon the Outlanders.

713-> MERCIER AND ROGET.
What a wonderful performance that is which passes in France for the administration of justice! Especially of military justice. When we are daily confronted, in the report of the Dreyfus case, with the proceedings of a French court-martial held in the "naked and open daylight," what are we to infer about the previous proceedings of a French court-martial held "in secret"?

The rifle ranges at Creedmoor presented a gay sight yesterday with the 700 uniformed National Guardsmen who competed in the rifle and pistol practice.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn., July 6. -- Indian Harbor yachtsmen sailed their circuit race at Greenwich to-day despite the threatening weather of the morning, mingled with rain, shortly before the start.

--------
737-> THE ADIRONDACKS.
SARANAC LAKE, Aug. 26. -- Much unnecessary anxiety was caused last week by the reports of the forest fires. While the danger to the woods was always great and to some of the camps and cottages, at no time were any lives threatened. The wires have been kept humming with, inquires from anxious friends and relatives of sojourners in the mountains, which caused a smile when they reached their destination. 
--------
738-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- If anything could make the citizens of this country regret their recent manifestations of a new and kinder feeling toward Great Britain it would be the fact that there are Englishmen -- only a few, probably, but a few are too many -- who can misstate and misinterpret facts with the cool insolence shown in the letter from Ottawa which we published Sunday over the most incongruous signature of "Fair Play." 
--------
739-> WYNDHAM'S THEATRE OPENED.; Inaugural Performance Nets u4,000 for Soldiers' Families.
LONDON, Nov. 16. -- The inaugural performance of "David Garrick" at Wyndham's Theatre, Charles Wyndham's new house, at the corner of Cranbourne Street and Charing Cross Road, this evening, furnished ample testimony that his old friends will follow this favorite actor wherever he chooses to lead.

758-> LET US LOVE SNAKES.
In to-day's issue of your valuable paper I notice with satisfaction that finally an advocate has sprung up for the rights of that poor, downtrodden, yet beautiful animal, the snake. Although not a scientist, I have been keeping snakes for years as pets, and know that even the most poisonous ones are no more treacherous than the average dog or cat, and why should they be?

759-> ANXIETY IN SUFFOLK.; Should the Ramapo Company Attempt to Take Water There County Authorities Will Resist.
RIVERHEAD, L.I., Aug. 26. -- The Ramapo Water Company's efforts are being watched with interest in Suffolk County.

760-> GOOD REPORTS FROM KANSAS.; The State Rejoicing in the Promise of Great Crops.
The Crop Bulletin issued by the Secretary of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, the Hon. F.D. Coburn, gives very full and accurate information as to the condition of harvested and growing crops.

NEWARK, N.J., Aug. 26. -- The regatta of the Institute Boat Club on the Passaic. River this afternoon was a big success. The sport was interesting. The feature was a race between shell and gig crews, in which the gig crew, which had a handicap of ten seconds, was beaten only a few inches. Summary:

Nammack of Far Rockaway, alleging that on Nov. 8 the physician punched him in the chest while he was in Miller's Hotel, in Long Island City, and also used abusive language to him. 
--------
765-> CHICAGO WANTS HER MONEY.; Will Employ a Man Especially to Look After Franchise Payments.
CHICAGO, Dec. 16. -- Frequent discoveries that large amounts of money are due the city under different franchises has spurred Mayor Harrison to a decision that a franchise bookkeeper must be employed by the city, either in the Controller's or Public Works office.

767-> LONDON PREDICTS ACQUITTAL.
LONDON, Aug. 18. -- The correspondents of the London morning papers are unanimous in the opinion that the tide has finally turned in favor of Dreyfus.

769-> UNCLE SAM'S STRENGTH?
Mr. L.S. Carlin has evidently made up his mind that "we are the people." Let us hope that he is an American born, and not one who has broken his vows to his native land to act as a sycophant to the country of his adoption. This sentence is great: "We can quickly improvise a navy that would (or will) sweep every European war vessel from the sea and bombard every seacoast town of Europe." 
--------
770-> PARLIAMENT PROROGUED.; After Passing the Appropriation Bill for the War Both Houses Adjourn Until Jan. 15.
LONDON, Oct. 27. -- The third reading of the Appropriation bill in the House of Commons to-day gave the opportunity for further attacks on the Government's war policy.

771-> GENERAL NOTES.
Counterfeit coins, especially half dollars, have been freely passed at the recent camp meetings in Delaware. 
--------
772-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Reviews of what is currently happening in Wall Street may come to have a monotony that is tiresome. Day after day and week after week business conditions improve, bear bugaboos demolish themselves -- prosperity progresses. Such facts carry cheerfulness; but continuing recitation of them, ordinary generalization, is not unlikely to become a chronicle lacking new interest. 
--------
773-> MAY SEND ALL TROOPS TO WAR.; Predicted that Halifax Garrison Will Go to South Africa.
HALIFAX, N.S., Dec. 16. -- The series of reverses culminating in the repulse of Gen. Buller at Tugela River, has had a disquieting effect on the soldiers in this garrison. Officers here freely predict that England will call out every available man, and it is thought that Halifax may be left without a regular garrison. 
--------
774-> CONSIDER WHENCE WE CAME.
Though I am not by calling a foolkiller or a reformer, I take the liberty of answering a letter which appeared in yesterday's TIMES. The writer of this epistle has much to say about the "cruel and causeless war" which England is waging against the Transvaal. Let that pass. What astonishes me in Mr. Carlin's letter are these statements: "As a Nation, we are under no obligation to England. 
--------
775-> CHATTANOOGA RATE FIGHT; Legal Victory Over the Railroads Still Fruitless. COMPANIES LIKELY TO APPEAL Senator Depew and Others Discuss Litigation on Discrimination Between Tennessee Cities.
Eminent authorities on railroad law agree that the far-reaching importance of the recent decision of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of the merchants of Chattanooga, Tenn., upon their claim that they were discriminated against by the railroads, is such that an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States is a foregone conclusion.

776-> THE NEW GOLD CERTIFICATES.
In the United States Treasury at Washington and in its branches there is a stock of gold amounting to $245,000,000. The New York City banks hold $165,000,000 in gold.

780-> TWO NEW ROYCROFT BOOKS.*
One of the most attractive of recent books is "The Ballads of a Bookworm," by the late Irving Browne, which has just been issued by the Roycroft Press. It is beautifully printed on hand-made paper, and appears in an edition of 850 signed and numbered copies. Each ballad has a well-designed initial, drawn by hand, and illuminated in gold and colors, many of which are extremely good, and the colors are very artistically chosen. 
--------
781-> THE FINANCIAL MARKET
Wall Street can begin to-day its Fall campaign -- if Fall campaign there is to be. It has been much predicted. Optimists in the Stock Exchange district count still confidently upon the early establishment of buoyancy, if, indeed it doesn't lead to a duplication of old time "booms." Among some authorities, who are entitled to consideration, however, no show appears of extravagant anticipation.

782-> LONDON TOPICS OF THE WEEK; Many Americans Victims of the "Chancery Money" Swindle. ASTOR ANGRY WITH HIS SON Entire Lack of Interest in the Venezuela Commission. Vernon H. Brown's Experience at the Hotel Carlton -- George W. Lederer's Plans for Next Season.
LONDON, Aug. 26. -- The number of swindles to which unclaimed money in Chancery has given rise can hardly be counted. This particular form of swindling is as ancient as it is lucrative, and no matter how many times it may have been exposed fresh victims are discovered year in and year out. 
--------
783-> Of Owned and Borrowed Books.
About the most pitiable creature in this world, be he embryo or actual millionaire, is the man whose whole mental energy and leisure are devoted to the acquisition and consideration of wealth. For such a man the world-famed books exist but in his library -- never in his thought. They make a goodly array of pretense for his learned friends to see and serve for decorative purposes in the composition of a room. 
--------
784-> ELECTION LAW DEFENDED.; Mr. Goebel Declares the Measure Nececessary to Prevent Republican Frauds.
BENTON, Ky., Oct. 16. -- Mr. Bryan was cordially greeted at Benton by a very large crowd at noon. He was introduced as the "Great Democrat" of the day and took occasion to say in reply that all Democrats were great who lived up to their responsibilities. The defeat of 1896 merely made the party more determined to win. 
--------
785-> DEMOCRATIC ISSUES.
I have read your editorial article of to-day, entitled, "Getting Rid of BRYAN." I presume you desire the Democratic Party, in getting rid of BRYAN, to get rid also of the issues with which his name is associated, the issues, namely, of free silver, anti-imperialism, and trust regulation. The abandonment of these issues seems to me to involve the approval of the general policy, both foreign and domestic, of the present National Administration. 
--------
786-> FINE GOWNS AT NEWPORT.
NEWPORT, R.I., Aug. 26. -- The weekly Casino dance last Thursday was again a beautiful affair, and some of the gowns worn were the handsomest seen this season. Mrs. Oliver Harriman, Jr., wore a simple costume of cream chiffon, hand painted in the design of huge red roses. The lace-edged tunic fell over a flounce of pale green chiffon, and this material finished the bodice, which had long sleeves of lace.

--------
791-> OUR ABILITY TO SUPPLY ENGLAND WITH GOLD.
For reasons that may be partly political the Bank of France does not thus far seem disposed to come to the rescue of the Bank of England in its time of financial need by offering to loan from its own abundant supply of gold to that institution. At the time of the Baring failure, in 1890, it showed a more accommodating spirit and sent 3,000,000 to London to relieve the stress. 
--------
792-> TO WIDEN THE STREETS.
Some ten or fifteen years ago I read an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES advocating the adoption of an ordinance, or law, to compel builders of tall structures in narrow streets to erect these buildings some distance back from the line of the old houses, so that gradually these streets would be widened and become light and broad thoroughfares and not mere gloomy canons, reached by very little light and sunshine.

" No, it is not the people who demand a certain style of furniture," says a woman who knows from A to Z the work of carving, inlaying, painting, and designing in a big up-town furniture house, "it is the furniture which creates the demand.

--------
798-> STRAY TOPICS.; The Great Rejected.
Now that "David Harum" has made such a tremendous hit with the public, after being rejected by several houses, the usual crop of paragraphs derisive of publishers' readers for their lack of perspicacity will doubtless make their appearance, and again will the changes be rang on the old, old story of the difficulty of the unknown writer to secure a fair hearing in the publishing world. 
--------
799-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Wall Street presented last week the spectacle of declining prices in the face of general prosperity, Reports from all sections could hardly have been better.

--------
800-> GETTING OUR MONEY BACK.
When our egregious Municipal Assembly voted $150,000 to receive and entertain Admiral DEWEY, a cold shiver ran down the spine of every New Yorker who was old enough to remember the time when our old "co-ordinate branch" had the power of appropriating money without the assent of a Board of Estimate and Apportionment.

--------
808-> THE HUNT BURYING GROUND.
I read with pain and regret in your issue of Aug. 14 that a street railway is projected through the Hunt burying ground at Hunt's Point. It is doubtless right that no mere sentimental reasons should seriously inconvenience the growth of a city, but I am unable to see that Greater New York needs this ground, hence I plead that it be spared, and not mutilated of its beauty and picturesqueness.

Charles Reade's great novel "Peg Woffington" will shortly be brought out in an elaborate edition by the Doubleday  McClure Company.

--------
812-> Believes He Has Found Him Out.
Mr. Editor, you are a canny man. When you want four columns of selected poems on Autumn what do you do?

--------
819-> BRYAN IN KENTUCKY.
Since he became the candidate and leader of his party W.J. BRYAN has not made a worse political blunder than he is about to make in going to Kentucky to make speeches for GOEBEL. It is an elementary maxim of politics that National leaders must keep aloof from local quarrels.

Conventions of both parties, to nominate candidates for the Assembly, will be held in the thirty-five districts of New York County next Monday night.

864-> ARMED NEGROES HOLD SWAMP.; Situation at Darien Better and Some Troops Return to Savannah -- No Danger of Lynching.
DARIEN, Ga., Aug. 27. -- There have been no hostilities between the blacks and militia today, although the negroes remain armed and the troops are prepared for anything that may occur.

866-> EXPLODES UNDER CHILDREN; Gas Wrecks Thirty-Foot Section of Sidewalk, but No One Is Hurt. DINERS HURLED FROM CHAIRS Boy Hunting in a Crevice for a Penny with a Match Caused the Accident -- Gas Company Blamed.
There was an explosion of gas last night in front of 545 and 547 West Fifty-seventh Street that destroyed at thirty-foot section of the sidewalk and curb and gave three children in particular and the neighborhood in general a scare from which they will not recover for several days. That the children escaped unhurt under the circumstances was considered remarkable by those who witnessed the accident. 
--------
867-> "'INTERNATIONAL' YACHTING."
I read your able editorial of Aug. 9, ult., under the foregoing heading, with much satisfaction. As one of the oldest readers of your valuable journal, starting with its first issue, I would like to say a few words in response to your remarks on the now retired skipper, "Hank" Haft. I will, therefore, confine myself chiefly to the race between the Volunteer and the Thistle, and the few incidentals which naturally flow therefrom.

CHICAGO, Nov. 26. -- Senator R.F. Pettigrew of South Dakota and ex-Congressman Charles A.

A conference of the Executive Committee of the party will be held here Tuesday, at which plans for the coming Presidential campaign will be discussed. 
--------
869-> A QUESTION OF CLOTHES.
Some humorous suggestion may lurk, for the self-satisfied inhabitant of the effete East, in a clever advertisement of their wares by a firm of "men's outfitters" in a far Western city. It seems a very few years ago that either a popular fallacy or a justifiable belief was extant on this part of the Atlantic Coast that you could always tell a Westerner in town by his clothes. 
--------
870-> PHILIPPINE QUESTION DEBATED.; Dr. Lyman Abbott and Dr. A.A. Berle Discuss It at Montclair.
MONTCLAIR, N.J., Oct. 27. -- "Shall America Enforce and Maintain Sovereignty Over the Philippines?" was the question discussed to-night before the Outlook Club in Montclair Club Hall. The Rev.

871-> BOERS REPULSED AT LADYSMITH; Driven from Two Positions with Heavy Losses. ROUTED WITH BAYONETS Reported that 800 Were Killed, Wounded, and Captured. CAVALRY'S GOOD WORK Gordon Highlanders Charge the Burghers and Defeat Them -- Dutch Camp Is Captured in Friday's Fighting.

872-> CHIDED RAINY DAY CLUB.; H.K. Bush-Brown, the Sculptor, Told Members They Lacked Courage -- Attacked Modern Gowns.
The members of the Rainy Day Club yesterday listened to a talk by H.K. Bush-Brown, the sculptor. He astonished them somewhat by the knowledge he displayed of the niceties of feminine apparel.

873-> BULL'S-EYES AT SEA GIRT.; Regimental Team Matches Added to Other Events Make the Day Full of Interest.
SEA GIRT, N.J., Sept. 5. -- The second day of the annual rifle meet was devoted to the first stage of the two regimental team matches and to the revolver team contest, with a continuation of the individual matches, which began yesterday. Lieut. F.C. Wilson of the crack Georgia team created a stir among the shooting enthusiasts by making thirteen consecutive "bulls" at 500 yards in one of these events. 
--------
874-> THE OPPOSITION TO TRUSTS.
Not the least interesting features of the presents public discussion of "trusts" (meaning thereby business consolidations) as a problem in modern economics are the various rational and irrational shades of opposition with which the subject is treated. It seems to me that there are many fallacies in the popular conception of the topic. 
--------
875-> PERPETUATING THE ARCH.
The proposal of a sculptor to "perpetuate" the Dewey Arch, as it was published a day or two ago, must have horrified a considerable number of enlightened citizens. It must particularly have pained the proposer's fellow-sculptors, because the report described him as the "Secretary of the National Sculpture Society," which we believe he is not, though he used to be, and thus seems to give the sanction of that body to his proposal. 
--------
876-> HARVARD'S FOOTBALL PLANS.; Many of the Old Men Likely to be in the Team -- Schedule of Games.
BOSTON, Sept. 16. -- When the Harvard football season opens on Monday it is expected that a large proportion of the seventy-five men invited to attend the opening practice will be present.

CHICAGO, Oct. 27. -- The coming year will be marked by the greatest trade activity the steel and iron interests of the country have ever known, according to the predictions of executive officials in this industry. Every mill in the United States, so is the forecast, will run throughout the year, furnishing steady employment to many thousands of men. 
--------
880-> Article 2 -- No Title
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 27. -- The Berlin cablegram to-night, intimating that the German delegates to the Commercial Congress in this city have complained to the Congress that United States Consuls in Germany "exact illegally high fees" doubtless refers to the report of the German-Austrian-American Commission which has been presented to the Congress, and which awaits action by that body before being made public.

Is an automobile victoria-phaeton a pleasure carriage within the meaning of the Central Park rules? Winslow E. Buzby argues that it is. The Park Commissioners are in doubt about it. Police Captain England of the Arsenal Station declares emphatically that it is not. To clear up any possible doubt upon the subject Mr. Buzby had himself arrested yesterday afternoon. 
--------
885-> CONVENTION FIGHT ECHOES.; Chicagoans Declare that Dr. Jamison's Absentmindedness Gave the Decision to Philadelphia.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17. -- Chicagoans here are still busy explaining why they did not get the Republican Convention. The Chicago delegation came here expecting that the convention would be thrown at their heads, and they have not yet recovered from the shock they received when it went to Philadelphia. The French cry, "We are betrayed," has been raised, and Chicago is looking for a victim.

886-> ON THE BASEBALL FIELD; Umpires Help the Brooklyns to Beat the New Yorks. DECISIONS EXCITE LAUGHTER Game Is Called "On Account of Darkness," While the Sun Shines Brightly on the Diamond.
The New Yorks and Brooklyns played a postponed game at the Polo Grounds yesterday afternoon, the leaders winning out with a timely bast hit by Anderson in the seventh inning. The game, however, was not won on its merits, as the bad work of the umpires deprived the locals of what chance they did have.

887-> SHEEHAN IN A LIBEL SUIT; William Glennon Alleges the Ninth District Leader Slandered Him. WILL ASK $10,000 DAMAGES Action Characterized as a "Pure Game of Bluff" by Sheehan's Friends, and He Laughs at It.
John C. Sheehan has a suit on his hands as a result of the fight for the leadership in the Ninth Assembly District, which he won at the primaries last month, and his enemies in the district do not purpose to let him enjoy his victory without a struggle. One of his strongest opponents after Goodwin, beaten at the polls, now has recourse to the law, and has sued him for $10,000 for slander.

Inspector James Jackson, employed by the Fruit Dealers' Association of this city, had fifteen confectioners and druggists and others before Magistrate Mayo, in the Essex Market Police Court, yesterday morning, to show cause why they should not be punished for violating Section 407 of the Revised Statutes of 1892 prohibiting adulteration of food and food products. 
--------
890-> DEAR MONEY AND A NON-ELASTIC CURRENCY.
Any intelligent banker, any Secretary of the Treasury that we have had for the last fifty years, could devise a system of automatic restraints upon the issue of circulating notes by banks that, while allowing an increase commensurate with the legitimate demands of business, would effectually prevent speculative overissues by reckless bankers. Every currency plan worthy of attention contains such checks. 
--------
891-> REED'S SUCCESSOR ELECTED.
PORTLAND, Me., Nov. 6. -- Amos L. Allen, Republican candidate for Congress in the First Maine District, was elected to-day by a majority of more than 4,600 votes over Luther F. McKinney, the Democratic candidate. With the town of Dayton, in York County, to hear from, Mr. Allen's majority is over 4,657. Dayton will doubtless reduce this, but not enough to bring it below 4,600. 
--------
892-> CANADA LOSES AT CRICKET.; United States Wins the International Match by 33 Runs.
TORONTO, Ontario, Aug. 8. -- Some splendid batting was again seen here to-day, when the annual cricket match between Canada and the United States was resumed. The Canadians concluded their innings with a lead of seventeen runs over the Americans' first innings score. This was brought about by the unlooked for good batting of H B. McGiverin, who hit vigorously for twenty-three, not out.

893-> TALKING FOR VAN WYCK; Intimation that Tammany Fosters the Newly Launched Boom. WILLETT ON CROKER'S POWER Frank Campbell Denies Any Conference with the Boomers -- Repeats His Praise of Bryan.
The Van Wyck Presidential boomers were very much in evidence about the Hoffman House yesterday and numerous cards were followed by callers to the rooms of Joseph J. Willett of Alabama on the first floor. Mr. Willett is the head and front of the boom, and his fearlessness in coming into the Tammany country, where Tammanyites are supposed to be for Bryan, is occasioning a great deal of comment. 
--------
894-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
The last week of August opens with a sense of change in the social atmosphere which well accords with the suggestion of Autumn that yesterday's cool winds brought. The week will be one of preparation for flittings from seashore to mountains, and from mountains to seashore, while the clubs and country houses in the suburbs are being swept and garnished and put in order for the near and expected home-coming of members, owners, and guests.

897-> Neither Dumas's Errors Nor the Translator's.
Mr. Charles E. Homans, in your issue of Sept. 23, this year, believes he finds a "curious blunder" in one of my several translations of Dumas's "Three Musketeers" series -- part called "Twenty Years After" (not "Later.") It is not said that Admiral de Coligny was killed by the Great Duke of Gulse, but that a Coligny and a Gulse fought a duel, being the contemporary heads of those families. 
--------
898-> TILLMAN BELIEVES IN SILVER.; Says "Goldbugs and Traitors" Cannot Alter Democratic Platform.
WASHINGTON, July 18. -- Senator Tillman, who passed through Washington to-day on his way to the National Committee meeting in Chicago, said that "goldbugs and traitors," assisted by Republicans, were trying hard to get free silver omitted from the next Democratic platform. He thought that these goldbugs and traitors would make a very stiff fight when the convention met, but he was sure they would not succeed. 
--------
899-> NO SUNDAY ICE OR SHAVES.; Paterson Barbers and Purveyors of Frozen Water Have Sabbath Laws Enforced Against Themselves.
PATERSON, N.J., Aug. 18. -- White the Sabbath observance blue laws of New Jersey are permitted to rust unused here by the classes who generally insist on their observance, the barbers and icemen, many of them foreign-born or of foreign birth, are insisting that against them those Jaws shall be enforced. The result is that Paterson is now in a position which no other considerable city in the United States shares with her.

901-> WHAT INTERESTS CHICAGO; Woman's Club Will Take Up the Study of the Drama. OFFICERS BUY A "GOLD BRICK" Railways Reduce Rates for Fall Festival -- Salvation Army People Disturb the Peace.
CHICAGO, Sept. 16. -- Study of the drama is to be entered into earnestly by the members of the Chicago Woman's Club this Winter.

CHICAGO, Sept. 28. -- E.J. Brown, who eloped three weeks ago from Toronto with Mrs. Violet Holden, committed suicide here to-day by shooting himself because he could not bear the woman's remorse.

Fire followed the explosion, and it was nearly noon before the residents of the disturbed block recovered from the state of panic into which they were thrown by fear of further disasters. 
--------
904-> NOT ALL OF FRANCE UNJUST.
Is it just to condemn a nation for the crimes of a few individuals? It is true that five of the seven Judges, together with the Commissary selected by the French Government, willfully and knowingly sentenced an innocent man to a punishment worse than death, and a number of its Generals perjured themselves to assist in bringing about this result. 
--------
905-> THE CITY A MASS OF COLOR; Work of the Mural Painters and Private Decorators Finished. SCENES IN FOREIGN QUARTERS The Italians and Chinese Anxious to Display Their Admiration for the American Naval Hero.
Had the old Florentine painter, Piero di Cosimo, set out to view the decorations of New York at the present time for hints on color, as he used to look at a festa in his own city, it is to be feared that he would have wanted to close his eyes, as it was his habit to stuff his ears. New York is not "as brilliant as a Titian," as some of the newspapers say. 
--------
906-> Big Damages for Boycotting.
CHICAGO, July 8. -- For alleged boycotting and blacklisting George Hinchliff, a brick manufacturer, instituted suit to-day for $100,000 damages against the Chicago Masons and Builders' Association, and a number of the largest brick manufacturers here.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. -- While gratifying progress has been made toward the arrangement of a modus vivendi temporarily defining the boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia, and the officials concerned in the negotiations are hopeful that success will attend their efforts, it can be stated that at this moment the negotiations are still pending, and therefore it cannot be said that an arrangement has been reached. 
--------
913-> THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEEMEN.
It is the lawful function of the National Committee of a party to tune up the instrument, but not to strike any keynotes on the same. The present Democratic National Committee exhibits its rawness by the nature of the preparations it is making or permitting to be made for its meeting in Chicago to-morrow, which is to be an advance ratification of BRYAN'S nomination. 
--------
914-> HOW IT WOULD WORK.
The friends of Mr. BRYAN submit to the American people a Philippine policy which deserve a candid examination. Mr. BRYAN might be wrong about silver, but right about the Philippines. In large transactions the safe way is to hear both sides, to consider the matter as a whole and try to determine which is the wiser way. 
--------
915-> WALL STREET DENOUNCED.; Mr. Sheehan, in Opposing Injunction Against Reward, Says Nests of Criminals Exist There.
Argument upon Warner E. Allen's application for an injunction restraining the officials of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company from offering, advertising, or paying a reward of $25,000 for the detection of the person who started the rumor which led up to the raid on the company's stock a few days ago, was heard by Justice Beekman in the Supreme Court yesterday.

BERLIN, Dec. 6. -- The German Government and press almost unanimously welcome President McKinley's message to Congress. Even the Agrarian papers, always opposed to things American, grudgingly admit that the message is fair and honest. The drift of private comment is virtually the same.

A few weeks ago a kind friend in Maine -- Mr. L.T. Haines in Winthrop -- sent me your SATURDAY REVIEW of the 4th inst., containing a notice of John Sartain's "Reminiscences of a Very Old Man."

BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 28. -- The Transcript says users of hemp are confronted now with a possible famine in their material, which nothing but the reversal of the order closing the Philippine ports can avert.

It is not to be supposed that any American citizen is entirely satisfied with the position which we occupy, before the world and before ourselves, with reference to the Philippine Islands.

CHICAGO, July 8. -- This city experienced the quietest Fourth in all its history. Never since any records have been kept is there any comparison with the Fourth of July, 1899.

A very considerable number of earnest men and women in this country have been devoting themselves, apparently with increasing activity, to the presentation of such a remonstrance against the seating of BRIGHAM H.

--------
964-> THE CONTROLLER'S POSITION.; Why Salaries Were Paid Under the Increased May Schedule.
If illegal salaries have Been paid to the teachers of this borough, as the Corporation Counsel implies, is not the Controller of the city responsible?

BANKS OFFER MONEY Proffered Loans of $11,000,000 Aid the Stringent Money Market. Government Now to Give Assistance -- False London Rumors Contribute to the Excitement on the Stock Exchange.

--------
975-> THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA.
Yesterday's dispatches mark the beginning of "serious operations" in South Africa. The temporary advantage gained by the Boers through their prompt declaration of war has now been neutralized. Rather it has been exhausted. It cannot be said that the Boers have worked it so well as might have been expected. 
--------
976-> CUBAN SITUATION COMPLICATED.
When one reads in The Manchester Guardian that "the reported appearance of yellow fever at Key West has had a somewhat depressing effect on the market generally," it gives emphasis to what I wrote you lately on the money value to our Southern States that would be added by stamping out the fever in its garden and nursery -- Cuba.

--------
982-> GERMANY AND THE MESSAGE.
The reception, by official and unofficial Germany, of the cordial language of the President's message in respect to that power, must be as gratifying to Americans as the language itself has been to Germans.

--------
983-> "The Night Before Christmas."
It is not so long ago that Bishop Clement C. Moore's old residence in New York's Chelsea was torn down. I remember it well.

My books: What would my life be without them? They are my meat and my drink. They employ my mind and lift me out of myself. In hours of mental exaltation I forget my miserable body. I have a book for every mood and every condition. When my mind is strongest, and clearest, and freest, 
--------
986-> What, How, and Where to Read.

A great enigma is being peeped at in Rennes. The famous "secret dossier" has been placed before the eyes of the Judges. The ceremony was performed behind closed doors.

Experience derived from the attempt to make old theory meet actual condition has not been without good result in the army, and in the Subsistence Department, which was found to be lamentably unable to meet war conditions, and which does not easily meet peace conditions, lessons have been learned that would have been of great value if Gen.

AS a lover of horses and sport generally, his evident liking for England, and his undoubted power of controlling and keeping subservient to his will an organization like Tammany Hall and its satellites, appeal strongly to my English instincts, and I must confess to some bias in his favor when compared with Tweed, whose clumsy and rude methods of plundering were too much even for the passive boss-ridden citizens of New York to stand. 
--------
1018-> ENGLISH CHURCH AND EDUCATION.
To trim one's sail to catch the passing gale, seems as necessary in writing a letter to a public paper as in sailing a yacht. The writer, however, whether attacking one of Lord Salisbury's manifestos -- his notable Cardiff emanation, to wit -- or in attacking Archdeacon Denison's ritualism, face to face with him on the public platform, uses very little japan, electro plate, or varnish.

A fatelike, awful march; no hope, no halt for man or beast; but on, on, over the spreading billows of biting sands, of glowing, shifting, sinking sands, with overhead the hot sky, blue and hard, and blazing in its midst the scorching eye that burns and blisters with its sight.

--------
1028-> COMMISSIONER SCHURMAN ON THE PHILIPPINES.
There is much common sense and real statesmanship in the recent utterances of President SCHURMAN as to the future of the Philippines. Whether that future is to be reasonably peaceful and prosperous is the problem for us to solve, and its solution is the test of the right or wrong of our whole policy.

--------
1036-> SCULPTORS AND DUTCHMEN.
That "first-class burgher" and robustipus Boer, the Hon. ROBERT B. ROOSEVELT, is extremely disgusted with the sculptors, upon the ground that they are persons of no ideas. Now, most people who have had dealings as clients with sculptors find fault with them on the ground that their ideas are too numerous and too expensive in execution for a committee which is never unlimited.

--------
1039-> MR. ALGER ON MOVING ARMIES.
But for himself Mr. RUSSELL A. ALGER would be regarded by his countrymen with a relief not readily to be distinguished from admiration. When anything occurs to bring him to their minds their amiable impulse is to say: "Oh, what does it matter? He did get out, didn't he? Let the man alone." 
--------
1040-> THE INTERNATIONAL MEET.; Enormous Demand for Tickets for Saturday's Contest -- Americans Are All in Excellent Form.
LONDON, July 19. -- At the Queen's Club to-day J.T. Roche and J.T. Harrington, both of Harvard, contested for the honor of being the partner of C.D.

1048-> THE BANK STATEMENT.
While yesterday's bank statement was not up to some of the favorable forecasts made on Thursday and Friday, it was generally regarded as favorable.

The Prince of Wales Reviews 27,000 Volunteers -- The Peace Conference and How It Is Regarded -- Fourth of July Dinner a Disappointment.
LONDON, July 8. -- Readers of these dispatches who follow British politics will not have been surprised at the sweeping Liberal victories at Oldham. I had no doubt that both Liberal candidates would be elected, but I did not expect such a tremendous change as the transformation of a mean Conservative majority of 605 into a mean Liberal majority of 1,410. 
--------
1050-> THE RACES AT GRAVESEND; Two Horses Owned by Mr. Foster and Ridden by Jenkins Fell. BOTH ANIMALS WERE SHOT The Jockey Not Hurt -- Meehanus, The Pride, Standing, Kilmarnock, Belle of Troy, and Boundlee Won.

1055-> PROFITS OF THE UNDERGROUND ROAD.

She is the wife of a farmer, and was alone when she awoke early yesterday morning and noticed that there was a fire on the railway right of way at a gully near her home. 
--------
1057-> IS IT OUR DREYFUS CASE?
It is very fortunate for Capt. O.M. CARTER, now or lately of the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army, that WAYNE MACVEAGH is his counsel. Because this counsel is as well known for his character as for his ability. "Legal ethics" are often puzzling to laymen, who cannot make out how far they authorize a lawyer to go in pursuance of his retainer. 
--------
1058-> CURRENT LITERATURE.; Selected Extracts in Prose and Verse from Periodicals.
One person of taste will give the palm to the furniture of Chippendale; another will prefer the French style of the period of Louis Quatorze, of Louis Quinze, or of the Empire; and there is an immense amount of furniture, no matter what its style, which all persons of taste will agree in pronouncing intolerable. 
--------

--------
1060-> NOT QUITE DEAD.
No, the money question is not quite dead, but the symptoms of its impending dissolution are so numerous and alarming that public interest in it has narrowed down to the revelations of the autopsy and the ceremonies of the funeral. It is true that the Republican Party will make the next campaign "an open fight for gold monometallism." 
--------
1061-> A REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY; Gains in Kings, Columbia, Putnam, and Erie Counties Increase the Republican Majority to 32.

1066-> WILL OF MR. VANDERBILT.; Report that the Share of Young Cornelius Vanderbilt Will Revert to the Estate at His Death.
The disposition of Cornelius Vanderbilt's vast estate continues to be a matter of widespread curiosity and speculation. Although the lips of the members and counselors of the Vanderbilt family are apparently sealed for a month in consequence of their determination not to make the contents of the will public until Alfred Vanderbilt's return from China, gossip goes on as though some of the provisions of the will were already known outside the family circle.

--------
1068-> Where American Heraldry Is Weak.
Your editorial article on "American Heraldry" displays much humor, perhaps unconsciously. American heraldry is nil. You might as well discourse of American hereditary nobility, or American Divine right of Kings, or any feudal or monarchical institution or custom which was abandoned and discontinued by us in 1776. 
--------
1069-> LONG CALCULATIONS.
We alluded the other day to the unqualified statement of the President of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, Mr. CALLAWAY, that he expected the present state of prosperity in business to last at least three years. The evidence of his confidence and that of the other managers of the great property of which he is the head is found in the investment of $15,000,000 in rolling stock. 
--------
1070-> Sampson Greater Than Dewey.

The Brooklyn health authorities agree with the State Board of Health in the statement that the State law with respect to vaccination is not properly observed in the public schools of the borough.

--------
1077-> REAMERS STRIKE AT CRAMPS'.; Workmen Assert that Over 1,500 Men Are Now Out.

There was quality as well as quantity in the day's programme at Sheepshead Bay yesterday, and both of these have been sadly lacking on the Eastern race tracks recently, but they failed to call out the large attendance it was reasonable to suppose they would. Patrons of the sport could not grumble at the splendid programme held out, but there were more vacant chairs in the grand stand than even on Monday.

--------
1082-> FURTHER FIGHTING LOOKED FOR.; Believed the Boers Will Return to the Attack at Ladysmith.
LONDON, Oct. 30. -- That the heavy guns of the Boers, from which so much was expected, should be silenced so speedily, as indicated in the dispatches from Ladysmith, is a matter of great surprise; but the subsequent advance of the Burgher force on the British left flank shows the attackers were in no way dismayed thereby, and were still full of the same self-confidence and daring they have already exhibited on various occasions. 
--------
1083-> Fourteen Members at Greytown.

--------
1087-> A Robber Baron.*
When you find in a man's name consisting of eight letters not less than six consonants, if you are an expert in novel reading you have a right to expect a very wicked person. And such is the Count Czvargas of Castle Czvargas. "His face was bronzed like an ancient copper coin; a tangled mass of black hair covered his head and a coarse black beard his face up to his eyes."

1090-> Some Books Known to Be Funny.
I have been thought by some people to be wanting in a sense of humor, and it may interest your SATURDAY REVIEW correspondent "Malta" to know what such a person considers "funny." My standard of "funniness" in a book is the amusement it affords me when I read it alone. 
--------
1091-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; A Glance at the Year's Business and Its Important Features. ACTIVITY IN MANY SECTIONS Latest Sales by Brokers -- The Year's Dealings in the Auction Room -- List of Offering for This Week.
Real estate dealing, even at the best, is bound to show so many periods of activity and depression, now in one section, now in another, that any attempt to characterize in a few words the business of an entire year will prove unsatisfactory. It may be better, then, instead of trying to call 1899 successful or otherwise, to go through it, not in great detail, but rather to recall its more important features. 
--------
1092-> THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.; A New Work by Mr. Van Der Stucken Produced Yesterday.
The second public rehearsal of the Philharmonic Society yesterday afternoon at Carnegie Hall was an entertainment which had more than the usual number of attractive features.

--------
1093-> EL INOCENTE; A Story of the Triste Days of Carlota and Maximilian.

LONDON, Aug. 19. -- The Saturday Review of to-day has an article on Europe and Americans, sneering at the proposed Anglo-American alliance, and frankly declaring that it amounts to little or nothing.

WARREN, Ohio, Oct. 8. -- A street car on the Trumbull line, containing twenty-three people, was struck by the Cleveland and Pittsburg train on the Pittsburg and Western Railroad at Niles to-night and badly wrecked.

--------
1097-> IN FOREIGN LANDS.
WAS THERE AN ACTUAL DREYFUS SYNDICATE? -- The anti-Semitic press of Paris have returned to the old accusations begun in the Fall of 1897 that there is or was an actual Dreyfus syndicate. And they quote copiously from the report of the Cour de Cassation, which has been published at the instance of the Ligue des Droits de l'Homme, in which appears some testimony by M. de Grandmaison. 
--------
1098-> TAX ON FEMININE FINERY; Society Leaders Never Question the Import Duties Imposed. GOWNS AT THE CUSTOM HOUSE Experiences of Appraisers Brunjes and Dana -- Tricks of the Dressmakers -- A Costly Handkerchief.
A great deal has been written and said about the smuggling instinct among rich American women, but the honor and patriotism of most of them is very much appreciated in that portion of the Custom House devoted to appraising direct importations of apparel. 
--------
1099-> CAPT. CARTER'S PLEADINGS.
It seems to me that you have been seriously misinformed respecting the case of Capt. Carter, and have given more weight to his counsel's asseveration of his innocence than that asseveration in the circumstances deserves. 
--------
1100-> MILLION WELCOMES HIM; The Shore Greeting in the Admiral's Triumphant Progress. HISTORIC SCENE AT THE END A Hush Spreads Through the Great Multitude as Dewey's Ship Appears Off Grant's Tomb.
There was more life and bustle at Riverside Park and the Claremont Heights at 7 o'clock yesterday morning than is usual at noon on an ordinary day. The placing of the stakeboat St. Mary's off One Hundred and Thirtieth Street made the neighborhood the most interesting of any point of the naval pageant, and, as was expected, the multitudes who turned out to welcome Admiral Dewey home gave it their choice. 
--------
1101-> BUILDER SAID TO BE MISSING.; Mechanics' Liens Filed Against the Property of Peyser Bookstaver.
Twenty mechanics' liens aggregating $21,628 were filed -- yesterday against Peyser Bookstaver, builder, on houses 153 to 157 East One Hundred and Thirteenth Street, southwest corner of Park Avenue and Ninety-eighth Street, and on Brook, Avenue, near Wendover Street, and near One Hundred and Seventy-first Street.

--------
1107-> ONLY FAIR PLAY.
Our correspondent who complains by asking the question "Why THE TIMES upholds SCHLEY and belittles SAMPSON" of a partiality exhibited by this paper for SCHLEY manifestly is affected by a partiality for SAMPSON which prevents him from seeing the simple point that THE TIMES has always insisted upon, that SCHLEY was engaged in the battle of Santiago. 
--------
1108-> SHEEPSHEAD BAY RACES; Sadducee Did Not Prove the Best Two-Year-Old of the Year. MESMERIST AN EASY WINNER Imp Defeated Charentus and Voter in the Ocean Handicap -- Lady Lindsey First at Generous Odds.
Those who have claimed for Sadducee all through the racing season that he was the best two-year-old of the year, simply because he had run through an unbroken string of victories, had their claims somewhat damaged yesterday, for Sadducee was called upon then to meet some of the really good two-year-olds of the year, with the result that he was a badly beaten gelding at the end. 
--------
1109-> DIED AFTER AN ANGRY TALK.; Fate of John J. Jackson of Newark Attracts Police Attention.
NEWARK, N.J., Dec. 8. -- John J. Jackson, a wealthy manufacturing jeweler, whose place of business was at 91 Mechanic Street, and who lived at 521 Summer Avenue, died suddenly this afternoon at his factory.

--------
1113-> "Baldoon" and "David Harum."
As the publishers of Le Roy Hooker's new book "Baldoon," we think it desirable to correct an impression, shared by a number of reviewers, that the work must have been in imitation of Mr. Westcott's "David Harum." Singularly enough, the first accusation came from a newspaper published in Mr. Hooker's home city, The Chicago Times-Herald. Under the conspicuous headline "David Harum Imitated" that paper said in part: 
--------
1114-> MILES WILL REMAIN HERE.; Believes that Officers Now in Philippines Are Competent.
WASHINGTON, July 20. -- Major Gen. Miles was asked to-day what truth there was in a report reaching here from Boston that he desired to go out to the Philippines. He only smiled at the question, and when it was suggested that it seemed to be the wish of some of his Eastern friends he only answered, "All of the Eastern people may not be my friends." 
--------
1115-> IN FOREIGN LANDS.
THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE TRANSVAAL AND PLANS FOR A POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN. -- There is much discussion just now in London over the military strength that the Transvaal Republic might be able to put into the field and the plan of attack or defense she has in view.

NEWPORT, Oct. 8. -- Lispenard Stewart, one of the guests at a dinner given last evening by Mrs. A. Lanfear Norrie, went from his cottage to Mrs. Norrie's on his bicycle, and left it on the lawn.

1117-> GAGE'S CIVIL SERVICE FIGHT.; Discovery that the Commission Cannot Order Non-Competitive Examinations in Revenue Bureau.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 10. -- A circular has been sent to Collectors of Internal Revenue by Commissioner Wilson of that bureau, calling their attention to the fact that the non-competitive examinations required are to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and not by the Civil Service Commission.

1118-> AIR BRAKES IN RUSSIA.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18. -- Consul General Holloway of St. Petersburg has transmitted to the State Department a Ministerial order requiring all standard Russian railways to equip their freight cars and engines with Westinghouse air brakes, at a cost of several million rubles, by Jan. 1, 1903.

--------
1119-> NEWPORT.
Although the programme of coming gayeties here is fairly well filled until Sept. 10, the end of the season is in sight, and with the disbandment of the fleet of the New York Yacht Club on Thursday there were apparent signs of that restlessness which is sure evidence that the social world is preparing for another flight. 
--------
1120-> ALLEGED ABUSE OF CHILDREN.; In Syracuse Home for Feeble Minded They Were Beaten with Rubber Hose, Kicked in the Face, &c.
ALBANY, Aug. 10. -- Controller William J. Morgan has written a letter to the Right Rev. Frederick D.

PONCE, Puerto Rico, Aug. 24. -- The furious storm during the day of Tuesday, Aug. 8, and the exceedingly heavy rains which accompanied and followed the wind, were the most destructive combination of elements that have visited this island since Aug. 22, 1772. 
--------
1122-> PULLMAN-WAGNER MERGER; Consolidation Agreement Effected by the Palace Car Companies. WAGNER INTERESTS GIVE WAY To Go Out of Business in December, Leaving a Clear Field for the More Powerful Concern.
The official announcement will almost beyond doubt be rnade in a short time that Pullman's Palace Car Company and the Wagner Palace Car Company have effected an agreement of consolidation. THE-NEW YORK TIMES is able to make this assertion on statements made yesterday by interests close enough to the Wagner Company to have the utterances considered authoritative that the deal has been actually agreed upon, even to details, and that it is a merger. 
--------
1123-> TO SUCCEED GEN. ALGER; The President Has Not Determined Upon a New Secretary. MANY RUMORS ARE AFLOAT Attorney General Griggs's Name Mentioned as a Possibility -- Senator Platt for Gen. Greene.
WASHINGTON, July 20. -- There were many rumors to be followed to-day about a forthcoming successor to Gen. Alger as Secretary of War, but from the best information obtainable to-night it is possible only to conclude that the President has once more assumed a listening attitude and will hearken to the voice of the country before deciding upon his next adviser on questions of war.

Gen. Thomas Alfred Davies died yesterday at the family homestead, at Black Lake, near Ogdensburg, this State. 
--------
1125-> SAYS McLEAN IS TO BE FEARED.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30. -- Most Ohio Republicans profess to regard the nomination of John R. McLean for Governor as a joke, but there are some Republicans here from that State who consider it a very serious proposition to meet. One of them, a very warm friend of the President, said to-day that it would not do to belittle the candidacy of McLean. 
--------
1126-> THE KALTENBORN CONCERTS.
THE success of the series of Summer night's concerts given under the conductorship of Mr. Franz Kaltenborn at the St. Nicholas Garden, at Columbus Avenue and Sixty-sixth Street, is gratifying to all lovers of good music, as well as to those who have wished for the establishment of some place of resort in the warm weather at which something more artistic than mere vaudeville could be found. 
--------
1127-> SCHLEY TAKES THE CHICAGO.; Rear Admiral's Flag Raising Followed by a Reception -- One Merry Sailor's Comment.
Promptly at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon a blue flag bearing two white stars shot upward on the mainmast of the United States cruiser Chicago as she lay at anchor off Tompkinsville, S.I.

The Kingdom of Roumania, one of the Balkan States, which have been well termed by a historian "the moral and political dykes of Southeastern Europe, damming, as they have at times, the flow of Russian aggression from the north, and again of Turkish ambitions from the south," is only generally known to American readers. 
--------
1130-> SYMPATHY FOR THE BOERS.
In your editorial of Saturday, on a recent speech of Lord Salisbury, this occurs: "But the main source of comfort that Lord Salisbury finds * * * is the sympathy of Germany and the United States, Perhaps it would be more accurate to say in the support of the Government of Germany and of the people of the United States." 
--------
1131-> MAZET FIGHT GETS HOTTER; All Parties Doing Their Utmost in the Nineteenth District. STEWART OPPOSED TO RAMAPO Declares for Municipal Control of the Entire Water System -- Fromme Answers McCullagh.
In the Nineteenth Assembly District, where Tammany Hall, in supporting Perez M. Stewart for Assemblyman, is putting forth herculean efforts to defeat Robert Mazet, the fight waxes warmer as Election Day draws near. Every one of the candidates on both tickets was circulating through the district last night, fighting tooth and nail for the slightest advantage. 
--------
1132-> SAY BOERS CRIED FOR MERCY.; Kafirs Claim the Burghers Showed White Feather at Ladysmith.
DURBAN, Nov. 5. -- Other information confirms the statement of native eye witnesses respecting the severity of the fighting on both Friday and Saturday at Ladysmith. The natives assert that the Boers were so cut up that they howled for mercy on the field and covered their bodies. Ladysmith is crowded with Boer prisoners and wounded, the latter presenting horrible evidence of the swordsmanship of the cavalry. 
--------
1133-> THE WASTE OF WATER.
The very interesting exposition of "The Water Supply Situation in New York," by Mr. J.J.R. CROES, which we printed on Sunday, is in effect an indictment of the present administration of the Croton Water Bureau and therefore of the present administration of the Department of Public Works.

CHICAGO, Dec. 30. -- The Tribune to-morrow will say:

BOSTON, Dec. 30. -- The final session of the Board of Aldermen of 1899 was held to-day, and the occasion became notable from the fact that Mayor Quincy sent to the board a valedictory message of remarkable length. 
--------
1136-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
MANILA, Dec. 8. -- There was considerable relief in Manila when the news was received to-day that Gen. Young's small force had arrived safely at Vigan, Province of South Ilocos, Dec. 6. Anxiety had been felt for Gen. Young and the garrison at Vigan since it was known that Gen. Tino had a large, aggressive body of insurgents operating in the vicinity.

The rapidly approaching Christmas season, with its gifts to be selected for so many varying tastes, brings with it the difficulty of deciding upon what articles will give the most pleasure to their recipients. This is, of course, a matter for personal consideration and decision; the chief qualification being that the gifts selected shall in some way express the individuality of the giver and also of the friends to whom they are to be presented.

For the first time in the trial of Roland B. Molineux for the murder by poison of Mrs. Katherine J. Adams Barrow S. Weeks, as counsel for the defendant, made an admission yesterday. He conceded that Molineux had at one time used blue tinted paper bearing the crest of three intertwined crescents and had written to a patent medicine firm for a remedy. 
--------
1141-> IN THE THEATRICAL WORLD; Miss Lulu Glaser Forced to Speak Her Lines in "Cyrano." HER THROAT IN BAD CONDITION Consented to Appear Last Night, as Her Understudy Is Not Up in the Part -- Speedy Recovery Looked For.
While Miss Lulu Glaser sang the role of Roxane, in the first performance of the opera "Cyrano de Bergerac," at the Knickerbocker Theatre on Monday night, few persons in the audience were aware that she was suffering greatly from a bad sore throat. At the conclusion of the performance she was completely exhausted, and was taken to the Manhattan Hotel, accompanied by her mother, and placed under the attention of her physician.

1142-> Chicago, 5; Cleveland, 1.
CHICAGO, Sept. 8. -- Griffith of Chicago had much the better support in a pitchers' battle to-day. Both of Cleveland's errors counted for runs.

1143-> CAPT. NIBBS DYING AT SANTIAGO
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 10. -- Private information received here from Santiago, where the Earn Line steamship Sutherland now lies quarantined with yellow fever raging among its crew, confirms the report of the serious illness of Capt. Percy Nibbs, her commander. No hope whatever is entertained for his recovery. 
--------
1144-> SOCIAL EVOLUTIONS OF THE DREYFUS CASE.
In France parties are in course of reconstruction. Criminal procedure is being modified. A strictly republican status is being cast for the military. In Austria the old parties, formed on the basis of social inequality and nurtured in the spirit of race animosity, are wrecked or disrupted. 
--------
1145-> A Warning to Baconians.
Under the heading "Convinced that Bacon Wrote the Plays" W.R.W. says: "The absence of testimony in his (Shakespeare's) favor from contemporary witnesses seems to prove an alibi in the authorship of the great plays and poems." I respectfully suggest to W.R.W. that he, or she perhaps, read a very interesting article entitled "Give the Poet a Day in Court," by Mr. Samuel M. Gaines, published in THE TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW June 24. 
--------
1146-> REPUBLICANS LAUD MAZET; Big Rally at Durland's Largely in the Assemblyman's Interest. SOME CONSPICUOUS ABSENTEES Citizens' Union Men Fail to Appear -- Gov. Roosevelt Speaks for the State Administration.
The anti-Tammany fusion county ticket was ratified last night by a meeting held at Durland's Riding Academy, under the auspices of the Republican County Committee. Nearly 10,000 persons, it was estimated, were gathered in and about the hall, and in the volume and vigor of their enthusiasm there were no signs that this is an "off year" politically.

SOUTHAMPTON, July 9. -- Yachting circles in the Solent were never more excited than now over the prospects in the forthcoming race for the America's Cup between Shamrock and Columbia. Yesterday yachtsmen could be seen in all directions, and in Southampton, Hythe, Calshot, and Cowes the keenest look-out was kept for the challenger, which it was known would stretch her sails. 
--------
1148-> HAGUE TREATY IN THE SENATE.; Convention Signed at the Peace Conference Submitted for Official Ratification.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. -- The President to-day sent to the Senate the treaty negotiated by the powers at The Hague last July for the pacific settlement of disputes between nations and the declaration to prohibit for five years the launching of explosives from balloons. The Senate immediately removed the injunction of secrecy.

1149-> ITHACANS BREAK TRAINING; Cornell Football Team Will Get No Work Before Wednesday. MEN ARE IN GOOD SHAPE Trainer Haughton Fears Continuous Practice -- Will Be Ready for Columbia on Election Day.
ITHACA, N.Y., Oct. 30. -- The fact that Haughton of Harvard turned a third-rate eleven into championship form in ten days of coaching is just beginning to sift through the bewildered brains of the Ithacans, as it has perhaps already sifted through those of the Princetonians. 
--------
1150-> ANSTEY HIS IDOL.; And He Would Throw to the Ground the Idols of Many Other People.
A touching appeal has been made to the editor of THE TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW to print the letter that follows here. The author of it would right a great wrong. While this communication is rather prolix, (though not as prolix as when received,) it is conceived in terms so remarkable that it ought not to be withheld from publicity. 
--------
1151-> FUTURE OF NEWFOUNDLAND; Sentiment in Favor of Annexation to This Country Increasing. COLONISTS BADLY TREATED Great Britain Sacrifices Their Interests to Advance Its Own Purposes -- This Year a Critical One.
ST. JOHN'S N.F., July 8 -- Following close upon the movement in Jamaica for annexation to the United States, a similar agitation has lately been taking shape in Newfoundland, the oldest colony of the British Crown. This feeling has been greatly accentuated by the neglect with which the colony has been treated over its two great grievances -- the French shore question and the Atlantic fisheries question.

1153-> BRUSHES ON THE SPEEDWAY; Regulars Were Out in Force with Their Fast Steppers. COBWEBS TO THE FRONT AGAIN Driven by Nathan Straus, the Horse Took the Measure of Creeping Flower -- Other Lively Races.
The threatening weather of yesterday kept many Sunday drivers away from the Speedway, but it had no effect on the regulars, who were out in force with their fast steppers. The roadbed was in excellent condition, and the absence of the crowd gave the pacers and trotters an excellent chance to try their speed, which they did, and the result was many lively brushes between horses with and without records. 
--------
1154-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
Saturday's bank statement will be used by bear speculators this week. Wall Street generally was surprised by the decrease shown in the exhibit of Clearing House figures, few bankers anticipating a material decrease in surplus reserves. Yet the stock market on Saturday refused utterly to go down because of the disappointing showings; in fact, a pronounced rally was their Stock Exchange sequel. 
--------
1155-> IS THE RAMAPO JOB DEAD?
A day or two ago The Evening Post printed in full the record of the attempts of the Merchants' Association to get information from the Commissioner of Water Supply and from the President of the Board of Public Improvements upon the legal and engineering aspects of the project of making a contract with the Ramapo Water Company to supply additional water for the Borough of Manhattan. 
--------
1156-> HEARD ABOUT TOWN.
All this tremendous Christmas buying and incidental Christmas traffic is bringing thoughts of home, of happier days, perhaps, to a lot of people who have become flotsam and jetsam in the maelstrom of city life. It was unconsciously indicated by a conductor on one of the Broadway cars last evening.

1157-> SARATOGA.
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 19. -- The season has reached its height, and fully 30,000 visitors are now being entertained here.

The vast throng is composed of everybody, from ecclesiastic to gambler, and all seem to be enjoying themselves. 
--------
1158-> BELLAMY STORER MAY RETURN.; Minister to Spain's Presence Needed in Administering an Estate.
CINCINNATI, July 20. -- The death of Thomas McDougall, the lawyer, may summon home Bellamy Storer, Minister to Spain. Upon the death of Judge Longworth, in 1890, Mr. McDougall became a trustee of the Joseph Longworth estate, and upon the resignations, in 1892, of Larz Anderson and Julius Dexter, the remaining executors, he became co-trustee with Bellamy Storer to the estate, Mr. Storer having been selected as successor to the retiring executors.

1159-> CHRISTIAN ALLIANCE MEETING.; Rev. Mr. Le Lacheur Preaches to a Large Audience at Carnegie Hall.
The Christian and Missionary Alliance for its closing week held a series of meetings yesterday at the Gospel Tabernacle and Carnegie Hall. The Rev. D.W.

BUFFALO, Aug. 30. -- The American Bar Association to-day adopted a resolution expressing sympathy with M. Labori in his suffering and his struggle for justice in the Dreyfus case.

--------
1161-> CUBA A FOREIGN LAND IN LAW.; Judge Somerville, for the Appraisers, Decides that Goods Imported Thence Must Pay Duty.

NEWPORT, Sept. 8.--This afternoon Herbert Harriman and Mrs. John Jacob Astor won the two cups in mixed foursomes from F. O. Beach and Miss P. Carroll by a score of 1 up. 
--------
1163-> ROW OVER LABOR TICKET; Holt and Dayton Not Indorsed Without Fierce Opposition. MANY CHARGES OF BAD FAITH Central Federated Union Delegates Go So Far as to Say the Independent Party Is Uncalled For.
The nominations made by the County Convention of the Independent Labor Party last week, gave rise to a bitter dispute in the Central Federated Union yesterday. Although they were finally indorsed by a fair majority of the delegates, a previous test vote on the subject tended to show that the nominations have not given entire satisfaction.

1164-> TAYLOR TO BE GOVERNOR; Will Be Inaugurated in Kentucky Without Resistance. GOEBEL'S COURSE UNDECIDED He Declines to Discuss the Question of a Future Contest -- Two Court Decisions Favor Democrats.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Dec. 9. -- The Republican candidates have received their certificates of election and Taylor will be inaugurated Governor next Tuesday without resistance or protest. 
--------
1165-> CURRENCY LEGISLATION PLANS; House Bill Likely to be Sent to the Senate Unchanged and There Await a Conference.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. -- The House Republicans, who are determined to push the Currency bill to passage notwithstanding the remonstrance of the opposition, assume that the Democratic objections to the bill are in part perfunctory, and that they would be urged on other grounds than those made if time were granted to enable the Democrats to examine the question in the light of the provisions of the House bill. 
--------
1166-> FATAL FALL NOT REPORTED; Policemen Saw It, but Arrested No One and Said Nothing. OCCURRED ON PRECINCT LINE Marc Meyer Dying at Bellevue from a Fractured Skull, Caused by Falling from a Car.
An extraordinary case of a probably fatal accident, to which the police did not give sufficient attention either to make an arrest in connection with it or to report it to a police station, occurred at Twenty-seventh Street and Lexington Avenue yesterday afternoon. Marc Meyer, a Frenchman, sixty-six years old, and a veteran of the Crimean war, fell from a south-bound cable car at that point and received a badly fractured skull. 
--------
1167-> FEES TOO FAT FOR HOWE; Register-Elect of Kings Says the Present System Is Robbery. WANTS SALARY FOR HIS OFFICE Also for Sheriff and County Clerk -Feared to Make Public His Views Before Election.
Among the many interesting features which elections in this vicinity have developed the spectacle of a man chosen to fill a fat office and then declaring his intention to reject a part of the remuneration attaching thereto has seldom been afforded. Kings County now presents such a phenomenon, however, in the person of ex-Congressman James R. Howe, the successful Republican candidate for Register, who has beaten John M. Gray, the Democratic nominee, by 168 votes. 
--------
1168-> THE CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH AFRICA.
We pointed out the other day that Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was very unlikely to get any political capital out of the war in South Africa, whoever else obtained any. As Colonial Secretary he would necessarily have been conspicuous, but he has taken no pains at all to preserve the pretense of consulting his colleagues on the preliminary negotiations; he has, on the contrary, taken pains to make it appear that he was doing it all alone.

Lang, twenty-four years old, of 401 Manhattan Avenue, and Montgomery Milbank of the same age, a son of Dr. Robert Milbank, of 154 West Forty-eighth Street, with two other young men, dined in May's restaurant, at 50 West Twenty-eighth Street, last night, and then tried to walk out without paying for their dinners, so it is claimed.

1173-> LONDON TOPICS OF THE WEEK; A Crisis in the Transvaal Expected Within Three Weeks. TALK OF PEACE CONFERENCE It Is Said Its Main Object Is to Create a New Holy Alliance. This Alliance Will Oppose the Spread of Civilization and Array Itself Against England -- The House Resting -- New Home Rule Idea -- Earl Strafford's Death.
LONDON, May 20. -- The House of Commons rose yesterday for the Whitsuntide holidays, fatigued by dull debates and bored by the prospect of duller ones to come. The London Government bill has passed the committee stage, the Government having rearranged the administrative areas of the greatest city in the world in one sitting, which, as Liberal papers remark, is probably the record performance in constitution-mongering. 
--------
1174-> CHIEF BONNER PROBABLY SAFE.; Assemblyman Murphy Will "Kill" the Age Limitation Bill -- Says Mr. Maher Misinformed Him.
ALBANY, March 20. -- Assemblyman Murphy this evening issued the following statement with reference to the bill introduced by him under the terms of which, if it became law, Chief Bonner of the New York City Fire Department would be forced to retire this year, as he reaches the sixty-year-age limitation mentioned in the bill in June next.

1175-> STOLE FOR HIS SICK WIFE; Louis J. Snure Tells How He Robbed His Employers of $20,000. CAUGHT AFTER A LONG CHASE The Prisoner Arrested Practically at the Bedside of His Wife, Who May Not Live Another Day.
Louis J. Snure, twenty-seven years old, formerly confidential clerk for Mandel, Porsch  Wiener, clothiers, of 127 Mercer Street, was locked up in the Tombs yesterday to await trial for stealing $20,000 from the firm.

1176-> WISCONSIN CREW CONFIDENT.; Coming East to Contest with College Oarsmen for Supremacy.
MADISON, Wis., June 18. -- The crew of the University of Wisconsin will leave tomorrow for Poughkeepsie, where they will enter upon final preparations for the contest with Pennsylvania, Cornell and Columbia Coach McConville is in charge. The crew is believed to be the best that ever donned the scarlet. 
--------
1177-> FILIPINOS AGAIN RETREAT; Gen. King's Brigade Repels a Large Rebel Force. NO FURTHER ADVANCE MADE Americans Assume Full Control of the Port of Iloilo -- Filipinos Quarreling Among Themselves.
MANILA, Feb. 16 -- 3:35 P.M. -- A large body of the enemy, presumably reconnoitering, was discovered on the right of Brig. Gen. King's position, near San Pedro Macati, this morning. The entire brigade turned out, and, after an exchange of volleys, the rebels retreated into the jungle and disappeared. 
--------
1178-> A SUGGESTION FOR MR. DEPEW.
Mr. EDWARD MITCHELL touches rather gingerly the question of money given by corporations as "political contributions." He says that if they are given in any large amounts, and especially if they are given to the irresponsible party leaders, they are a great evil. No one doubts that. 
--------
1179-> TALK OF AN EXTRA SESSION.; Nicaragua Canal Debate Likely to Force One by Delaying Action on the Treaty of Peace.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20. -- Although the Democrats do not yet announce their programme for compelling the holding of an extraordinary session of Congress, inquiry among them makes it plain that pretexts have been found for requiring that both the Senate and the House shall be called together before next December, and probably very soon after the Fifty-fifth Congress shall expire by limitation of law. 
--------
1180-> THE PSYCHOLOGY OF KEELY.
It was by a pertinent and fortunate chance that one of the investigators into the subterranean parts of the workshop, or studio, or laboratory, or whatever KEELY called it, should have been a "Professor of Experimental Psychology." Because really the only question that was left, or that had for years been left, about KEELY and his motor, was the psychological question. 
--------
1181-> FIRST FIRE VICTIMS FOUND; Three Headless Bodies Dug Out of the Windsor Hotel's Ruins. ONE A MAN'S; OTHERS WOMEN'S Two Perhaps Those of Frederick A. Leland and Margaret Fuller -- Detached Bones Unearthed.
The smoking ruins of the Windsor Hotel began to give up their dead yesterday. Two headless bodies, one that of a man, the other that of a woman, were disinterred during the forenoon, and many detached bones were dug up during the afternoon. At 1:15 o'clock this morning the third fragment large enough to be dignified by the workmen with the name of "body" was dug up in the southwest corner of the ruins. 
--------
1182-> FIRE AT BRIGHTON BEACH; Blaze in the Big Hotel Causes Temporary Excitement. DAMAGE ONLY A SLIGHT ONE Engine and Dynamo Rooms and Bakeshop Injured -- Joseph Leiter Rescues an Invalid Woman.
The guests of the Brighton Beach Hotel were startled yesterday evening by a fire which broke out in the engine room of the building and put all Brighton Beach for a short while in a turmoil. It was all under control in half an hour, and the damage did not amount to more than $1,000 or $1,200, but there was considerable excitement while the fire lasted.

WASHINGTON, June 19. -- Gen. Otis has cabled the War Department as follows:

1184-> SAINT'S DAY AND CHARITY.; Prominent Washington People Attend the St. Joseph's Feast Celebration.
WASHINGTON, March 20. -- Nearly 200 visitors, many of whom were prominent society people, attended to-day the annual celebration of the feast of St. Joseph by the Little Sisters of the Poor. This is one of the favorite charities of Washington, and the menu was of a much more elaborate character than usual. 
--------
1185-> BLOODSHED AT ILOILO; Two Americans Attacked and One Fatally Wounded by Natives. PREPARING FOR HOSTILITIES Filipinos Barricade the Streets and Threaten to Burn the City. Treasure of the Banks Placed on American Vessels -- Plan for the Landing of Troops.
MANILA, Jan. 8. -- Col. Potter, the special emissary of Gen. Otis between Manila and Iloilo, arrived this afternoon with dispatches from the latter point.

The streets were barricaded, and it was reported that the principal buildings had been "kerosened," the insurgents having threatened to destroy the whole business section by fire at the first shot of bombardment. 
--------
1186-> INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION.; James Barrett Testifies that Usurious Interest Charges and High Freights Injure the South.
WASHINGTON, June 19. -- James Barrett, Vice President of the Georgia State Agricultural Society, was the only witness before the Industrial Commission to-day. He spoke upon the agricultural conditions in the South, saying they were worse to-day than they had ever been in the history of the country. 
--------
1187-> THE LAKE CITY LYNCHING.; Thirteen Men Indicted in a Federal Court for the Alleged Murder of the Negro Postmaster.
CHARLESTON, S.C. April 7. -- In the United States Circuit Court here to-day, Judge W.H. Brawley presiding, a true bill was found by the Grand Jury against thirteen of the men accused of lynching Frazer B. Baker at Lake City, S.C., Feb. 22, 1898. Fifteen men are under arrest, but no explanation of the dropping of two names from the indictment was given.

1188-> GEN. WHEELER'S DEFENSE; Denies that He Fought the Battle of Las Guasimas Without Orders. HIS HISTORY OF THE FIGHT Furnishes Letters from Various Commanders at Santiago to Justify His Conduct in the War.
WASHINGTON, March 20. -- In refutation of the assertions made before the War Investigating Commission that he had fought the battle of Las Guasimas around Santiago without orders, Gen. Wheeler has submitted a lengthy statement which was made public to-day by Adjt. Gen. Corbin.

1189-> THE GOODWINS IN HIGH FAVOR.; "An American Citizen" in London Creates Enthusiasm.
LONDON, June 20. -- A brilliant audience at the Duke of York's Theatre last evening received with great favor the production of "An American Citizen," under the management of Charles Frohman. Nat Goodwin and the Misses Maxine and Gertrude Elliott had unanimous and enthusiastic recalls.

1190-> Review 3 -- No Title
Mr. Marion Crawford is taken to task in The Catholic World for what are called "egregious blunders, * * * enormous, monumental," relative to the marriage ceremonies of the Catholic Church, as shown in "Corleone." Veronica, the heroine, is married. "There are present for the contemplated ceremony only the priest, the two parties, Gianluca and Veronica, and their mutual friend, Taquesara." 
--------
1191-> HEAVY FLOOD AT RICHMOND.; Ice Gorge in the Swollen James River Causes Great Damage to Property in the City.
RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 17. -- The rush of the increased volume of water and the ice from the upper James River, together with the back water from the gorging of the ice below the city, has resulted in one of the heaviest floods ever known here. The wharves at Rockett's, the landing place for steamers, and the streets for blocks around are under water, and the Virginia Navigation Company's wharf has been swept away. 
--------
1192-> GERMANY AND SAMOA.
There can be no further dispute since the last news from Samoa about the responsibility for the blood that has been shed there in repelling the attacks made by the deluded followers of MATAAFA upon the British and American residents and upon the British and American Consulates. 
--------
1193-> GERMANY AND ARBITRATION.; Dr. Zorn, the Delegate Who Was Sent to Consult Emperor William, May Favor the Plan.
THE HAGUE, June 19. -- Dr. Zorn, the member of the German delegation to the International Peace Conference, who was dispatched Friday by Count von Munster, the chief German delegate, after a conference with his colleagues, to inform Emperor William personally of the condition of affairs in regard to the board of arbitration question, returned to Scheveningen to-day from Berlin. 
--------
1194-> Article 4 -- No Title
VIENNA, Jan. 20. -- A quiet tone prevailed on the Boerse to-day. Lombards declined on realizations. 
--------
1195-> A SILLY PROPOSAL.
The bill which Assemblyman HARBURGER has promptly introduced, upon the occasion of the burning of the Windsor Hotel, is a very inadequate piece of legislation. Being inadequate, it is positively mischievous, for it leads people to think that they are protected when in fact they are not. To hang a hotel all around with iron ladders would make a disfigurement that might agreeably testify to the activity of legislators and swell the profits of ironmongers. 
--------
1196-> TEACHERS' SALARIES.
It seems to us that the statement of President LITTLE in regard to the salaries of teachers and the Ahearn bill is a sound one. The Board of Education is capable of dealing with the question, and legislation at Albany is unnecessary. 
--------
1197-> Surtees's Novels Bring $195.
On Monday and Tuesday, Feb. 6 and 7, Bangs  Co. had a book sale of more than usual interest. The highest price of the sale was the $195 paid by George D. Smith for a complete set of the first editions of R.S. Surtees's sporting novels, in the monthly parts as published, with all the original wrappers, advertisements,

1198-> 7TH REGIMENT REVIEWED; Gov. Roosevelt's Inspection of Col. Appleton's Command. DECORATIONS FOR MEMBERS The Governor, in a Speech, Commended Some Seventh Men in the "Rough Riders."

--------
1199-> American Malting Company.
CHICAGO, March 20. -- It was stated to-day by officials of the American Malting Company that the preferred stock would be increased from $12,500,000 to $14,400,000, and the common from $13,750,000 to $14,500,000. 
--------
1200-> Review 11 -- No Title
Lord Kitchener's gift of 100,000 for the Gordon Memorial College at Khartoum Lord Cromer has followed up with his well-known activity, for on the first of the year he had a talk in Omdurman with Sheiks and notables, explaining what was to be somewhat the character of this most remote seat of learning. There is a dramatic fitness in establishing this college at Khartoum which only a maker of romance could have imagined. 
--------
1201-> Loss of a French Vessel Reported.
PENZANCE, England, April 7. -- The fishing lugger Wildflower arrived here to-day and reports seeing a three-masted steamer founder at 11 o'clock this morning, eleven miles northwest of Seven Stones. The crew think the steamer was a French vessel. 
--------
1202-> MAYOR SCORES LEGISLATURE.; Remarks Called Forth by Complaints of Up-Town Property Owners.
Property owners from the upper part of Park Avenue called on Mayor Van Wyck yesterday to complain of the defective pavements and inadequate lighting of that thoroughfare and the noise made by the trains of the New York Central Railroad while passing over the viaduct which begins at One Hundredth Street and ends on the north side of the Harlem River. 
--------
1203-> COLUMBIA MAKING READY; Trial Spin Delayed Because of Failure of Blocks. SHEAVES GAVE WAY IN TEST Riggers and Carpenters Hurrying the Work Along -- Mr. Iselin at Bristol.
BRISTOL, R.I., June 19. -- Up to a late hour to-night there was still much doubt as to the date on which the cup defender Columbia would take her first trial spin. Everything was arranged for a trial on Wednesday, but matters have been disarranged by the failure of the blocks to stand the hydraulic pressure to which they were subjected. 
--------
1204-> THEY WANT DR. DEPEW.; Chicago Railroad Men Postpone a Meeting Until He Can Attend.
Senator-elect Chauncey M. Depew, who has been ill at his home for several days, last night received a telegram from the managers of the Congress of Railroad Employes of the Middle and Western States, which was to have been held in Chicago to-night, saying that the conference would be postponed until Mr. Depew could be present and deliver his speech in person. 
--------
1205-> THE ARMY BEEF INQUIRY; Witnesses Called at the Request of Miles's Representative. THE MEAT MADE TROOPS ILL Strong Evidence Against That Furnished to the Army Given by Illinois Volunteer Officers.
CHICAGO, March 20. -- The principal witness on the list to appear before the army beef court of inquiry to-day, Dr. Nicholas Sena, was unable to be in the city; he will be heard to-morrow evening. 
--------
1206-> JUDGE REBUKES GARDINER; Dead Men's Cases Called Before Newburger in Court. RECORDER GOFF ON A TRAIL An Often-Adjourned Larceny Case Investigated by Him and Bail Increased -- An Accusing Letter.
The trouble between the Judges of the Court of General Sessions and the District Attorney broke out afresh yesterday morning, and there is every indication that at least Judge Newburger and Recorder Goff intend to force Col. Gardiner's hand in the matter and see the trouble through to a finish. 
--------
1207-> NOTES AND NEWS.; Items Gathered During This Week's Tour of the Publishing Houses.
The storm of this week had its effect upon the book trade as it did upon many other industries. But the storm went further than merely keeping people away from the bookstores, it prevented the publication of books. This seems strange, but many of the books formerly announced for this week and for next will not appear for a fortnight. 
--------
1208-> THE CAROLINA'S DOG.
" He knows no more than a good-sized yellow dog," is a proverb denoting great stupidity on the part of a man, but the yellow dog of which Mr. Bergen tells in a late number of THE TIMES certainly forms an exception, and his intelligence has been far exceeded by other canines. In the old Christy minstrel show, for instance, the end man asks: "Bones, what's come o' that big dawg yo' used to had?" 
--------
1209-> THE PEACE CONFERENCE
The appointments by President McKINLEY to the Czar's Peace Conference are excellent. Mr. WHITE, our Ambassador to Germany, is easily the foremost man of our Diplomatic Service in experience, learning, ability, and special training. Mr. NEWEL is our Minister to The Hague, and while relatively a new man, has been entirely acceptable there. 
--------
1210-> Comment on the Senate Debate.
LONDON, Jan. 10. -- The Times, commenting editorially this morning on the debate in the United States Senate, predicts that the expansion potc,y will .nk-e it way, dspite all obstacleP, and that 3is success wn, on the whole,-be for the aavantage oz the world.

PHILADELPHIA, June 19. -- The Westchester Country Club polo team of New York to-day defeated the Rockaway Country Club team, also from New York, on the grounds of the Philadelphia Country Club, by a score of 12 3/4 to 7 3/4 goals. The Westchester team was conceded five goals: thus it will be seen that both teams made the same score. 
--------
1212-> THE DELAWARE SENATORSHIP.; Anti-Addicks Republicans May Help Re-elect Mr. Gray.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9. -- Some of the Delaware Democrats and Republicans in Washington are rather expecting to see the Senatorial contest in that State result in the choice of Senator Gray as a compromise candidate to defeat Addicks and to overcome the difficulties presented by the Republican division, promoted by Addicks and his supporters. 
--------
1213-> GORMAN ANSWERS CRITICS; Denies that He Is Eager to be Presidential Candidate. NOT SEEKING BRYAN'S PLACE Makes a Final Statement Concerning His Opposition to the Treaty -- Senator Allen Explains.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. -- In the last open session of the Senate before the ratification of the treaty, although the real question before the Senate was the treaty, interest centred in that portion of a speech by Mr. Gorman, (Dem., Md.,) in which he replied to the intimation that his position as to the treaty was due to his desire to overthrow Bryan and make himself the Democratic candidate for President in 1900. 
--------
1214-> Spanish Consul General at Havana.
WASHINGTON, June 19. -- Senor Segrario, recently appointed Spanish Consul General at Havana, is about to leave Washington to establish himself at Havana. 
--------
1215-> THE NEW WHISKY TRUST.; Combination with $60,000,000 to be Launched This Month.
CHICAGO, Feb. 6. -- The attorneys of the Whisky Trust announced to-day that the new combination will be launched before the close of February with a capital approximating $60,000,000. The American Spirits Manufacturing Company is thus assured almost absolute control of the entire whisky trade of the country. 
--------
1216-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
A variety of uncertain influences may affect to-day's security market. What is most conspicuous is that an extended short interest exists. It may become further aggressive. It may show nervousness. Its sponsors have not so far accomplished much -- have succeeded in causing no substantial liquidation. 
--------
1217-> EXPLOITS OF TRAIN ROBBERS.; They Stole a Locomotive at Birmingham, Ala., and Went to Meet a Passenger Train.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., June 8. -- This morning before daybreak and about two hours before the Southern Railway north-bound passenger express is due in this city, three white men, evidently bent on train-wrecking, assaulted Henry Herring, night watchman in charge of a switch engine doing duty on the spur track leading to the Sloss coal mines. 
--------
1218-> THE FUNERAL OF MR. THOMSON.; Special Train to Take Friends of the Late President of the Pennsylvania from New York.
PHILADELPHIA, Penn., June 7. -- All arrangements were completed to-day for the funeral services over the body of Frank Thomson, late President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, wihch will be held to-morrow at 11 o'clock, at "Corkerhlll." A special train will leave New York at 7:55 to bring over the many friends of Mr. Thomson from that city, and at 10:30 a special will leave Broad Street Station. 
--------
1219-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- That the newspaper has come to play a decidedly important part in American life is a fact which everybody in the country will readily acknowledge, but this unanimity has hardly prepared us to learn that there is an "American Sunday," distinguished from other Sundays, or at least from the English Sunday, by the appearance on that day of morning newspapers of large size. 
--------
1220-> WORDS COINED IN BOSTON.; Some of Those Which a Citizen Claims as Strictly Her Own.
At the meeting of the Bostonian Society in the Old State House, Mr. C.W. Ernst delivered an interesting talk on the subject, "Words Coined in Boston." Mr. Ernst said that Gov. Andros introduced, among other unsalutary things, the term, "Your Excellency," as applied to the Governor. The speaker claimed the word "boss" was first used by a man named Gardner, who came in a ship from the North Sea in charge of some mechanics. 
--------
1221-> Paymaster General Stanton Better.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20. -- Paymaster General Stanton is progressing so satisfactorily toward recovery that it was stated to-day that his physician had promised that he might come back to his office next week. 
--------
1222-> THE CASE OF CANCER PATIENTS.
Much is being printed in your paper about cancer and the care of its victims. It is unfortunate that unfounded intimations of rivalry or inefficiency on the part of existing institutions should be admitted to the discussion. There is no occasion for this. Substantial harm is done the cause of charity by the formal publication of half-truths which are easily made the basis of false judgments. 
--------
1223-> PRIMROSE DAY IN ENGLAND.; Anniversary of the Death of Lord Beaconsfield Appropriately Celebrated and the Statue Decorated.
LONDON, April 19. -- Primrose Day, otherwise the anniversary of the death of Lord Beaconsfield, (Benjamin Disraeli,) who died April 19, 1881, was generally celebrated here to-day. About two-thirds of the people in the streets wore primroses in their buttonholes. Queen Victoria sent from Nice a large wreath of primroses to be placed on the grave of the statesman, in Hughendon Churchyard. 
--------
1224-> A Query Answered.
In a letter in THE SATURDAY REVIEW of April 1, in which Mr. Harry M. Hanson furnishes some pleasant memoranda relating to Richard Realf's poems, he asks, referring to my article on "Some Recent Verse," if my reference to Emerson's poem "To Ellen" is not meant to be a reference to some lines by Fitz-Greene Halleck. 
--------
1225-> BIG CARBON FIRMS COMBINE.; Three-Fourths of This Industry In the World Included.
CHICAGO, Ill., Jan. 9. -- Attorney Arthur J. Eddy to-day announced that a deal had been practically closed in this city whereby the big carbon manufacturing concerns of the United States had been consolidated under the name of the National Carbon Company.

1226-> THIRTEEN PERISH IN DOUBLE FIRE; Blaze Near Fifth Avenue Caught Victims Asleep. FIREMEN POWERLESS TO SAVE Swift Flames in 67th Street Defied the Bravest Efforts. Andrews Family Lost -- Fatal Spark Borne Two Blocks -- Policeman's Daring Feat.
Twelve lives were lost in the space of an hour in the fire which started shortly before 2 o'clock yesterday morning in the residence of Wallace C. Andrews, President of the New York Steam Heating Company, at 2 East Sixty-seventh Street. Only two of the fourteen occupants of the house escaped death in the flames and smoke. 
--------
1227-> BIG DECLINE IN STOCKS; Steady Attacks by the Bears Weaken the Whole Market. SLUMP IN FLOWER INTERESTS Brooklyn Rapid Transit Falls from 127 3-4 to 120 1-2 -- A General Drop of from 1 to 6 Points.
There was uncommon weakness all along the line in the stock market yesterday, and the most active operators in the Stock Exchange were the bearish brokers who are ordinarily credited with being followers of James R. Keene. As "the Street" interpreted the situation yesterday's slump in prices was the result of a concerted attack by Mr. Keene and his followers on the "bull" stronghold of ex-Gov. Roswell P. Flower and his extensive following. 
--------
1228-> MAY TRY GEN. EAGAN AGAIN; New Light on Embalmed Beef Shed by Armour & Co.'s Letter. FACT OF EXPERIMENTS SHOWN Believed the President Would Not Have Shown Mercy to Eagan Had He Been Fully Informed.
WASHINGTON, April 7. -- Intimations were heard to-day that Brig. Gen. Eagan may be ordered to stand a new court-martial in view of the testimony that has been brought out concerning the negotiations for a supply of processed beef. 
--------
1229-> CITY CIVIL SERVICE RULES.; Municipal Commission Submits Its Regulations to the State Board -- White Bill Is Likely to Pass.
ALBANY, March 21. -- The New York City Civil Service Commission has at last submitted its rules to the State Civil Service Board. Although the Tammany authorities at first insisted that this was not required by the recent decision of the Court of Appeals that the act of 1898 bringing all city commissions under the jurisdiction of the State board superseded the charter, it appears that the municipal commission has come to a different conclusion. 
--------
1230-> CARE OF THE CITY'S WAIFS.; Subject Discussed at Charity Organization Society's Meeting.
Homer Folks, Secretary of the State Charities Aid Association, addressed the Charity Organization Society monthly conference in the United Charities Building yesterday on "The Care of the Dependent Children of New York City." He said that twenty-four years ago the society of which he is Secretary secured the passage of a law requiring the removal of all children from almshouses. 
--------
1231-> ROOT TO SUCCEED ALGER?; The President May Make the Appointment To-day. SENDS FOR SENATOR PLATT Confers with Him for an Hour at the White House -- Mr. Platt Favored Gen. Greene.
WASHINGTON, July 21. -- A successor to Secretary Alger man be named by the President to-morrow. Without an announcement, official or unofficial, from anybody, it is the general belief among interested public men that Alger's successor will be Elihu Root of New York. The assertion that the Secretary may be named to-morrow is justified by the remark made to-night by Senator Platt after a visit to the White House and a conversation with the President. 
--------
1232-> MILES MAINTAINS SILENCE.; Says that to Comment Upon the Beef Court's Report Would Be Unsoldierly Conduct.
WASHINGTON, May 8. -- Gen. Miles again to-day refused to comment upon the report of the army beef court of inquiry. When questioned in regard to his probable action in the matter, he replied: 
--------
1233-> THE NEWS OF NEWPORT.
NEWPORT, July 21. -- The British Legation will be located here for the rest of the Summer, having to-day rented from the Misses Newman their cottage on Catherine Street, known as The Nutshell, for the season. W.G. Max-Muller, the Secretary of the legation, has been here for a week arranging for the transfer of the legation from Washington. 
--------
1234-> AGONCILLO BLAMES OTIS.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Feb. 6. -- Agoncillo, the Filipino representative, arrived in Montreal this morning and found it a trifle chillier than Washington, and many degrees cooler than his own climate. Accompanied by his Secretary, Senor Martia, he drove to the Windsor. 
--------
1235-> SECRETARY LAMONT'S PLAN.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. -- The presence in this city of Col. D.S. Lamont a day or two ago led an army officer who served under him to mention the fact that if the advice the ex-Secretary gave in three of his annual reports had been followed much of the inefficiency developed during the last Summer might have been avoided. 
--------
1236-> VICTORY FOR MR. WIDDEMER.; Asbury Park Church Refuses to Accept the Pastor's Resignation.
ASBURY PARK, N.J., June 20. -- The Rev. Howard T. Widdemer of the First Congregational Church won a victory at the meeting of his congregation this evening. He tendered his resignation before the report of the committee which had been investigating his alleged conduct toward a girl whom he employed as his secretary could be presented. 
--------
1237-> WRECKED IN THE SOUTH SEA.; Schooner Werfa Lost and Eighteen Persons Drowned.
VICTORIA, B.C., May 20. -- The schooner Werfa, which left Dunedin, New Zealand, last September, on an interisland trading expedition, with a party of nineteen, was wrecked and all but one of those who started out on her were lost. The news of the accident reached Sydney just before the sailing of the Miowera, which arrived here to-day.

LONDON, May 8. -- United States Ambassador Joseph H. Choate was the central figure at the annual meeting to-day of the British and Foreign Sailors' Society at the Mansion House. The Lord Mayor presided, and the assemblage was a brilliant one. The Duke of Fife, in introducing Mr. Choate, said: "I ask you to give a warm and vigorous welcome to one of America's most brilliant sons. 
--------
1240-> ADMIRAL SCHLEY'S CASE.
Your leader in your issue of yesterday voices the feelings of many thoughtful men. Is Admiral Schley's silence owing to his high regard for discipline, or does he feel his case is not a flood one? 
--------
1241-> THE FRIENDLY SONS' DINNER.
"Irish Cheer for England" was the remarkable heading of THE TIMES'S report of the banquet of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, and there is scarcely any reason to doubt its correctness, because of the established and reputable character of THE TIMES for truthfully reporting the news of the day, whether foreign or domestic. 
--------
1242-> MASSILLON FIREMAN KILLED.; Fire in a Paint Shop Costs a Life and Destroys Property Worth $500,000.

Mrs. Astor gave last night at her residence, on Upper Fifth Avenue, the ball which she has been accustomed to give for many years during the Winter season. The annual Astor ball has, in fact, become a fixed feature of recurring Winter seasons in New York.

1326-> HEARD ABOUT TOWN.
An incident quite out of the ordinary happened in the performance of "Catherine" at the Harlem Opera House on Monday evening. There had been three or four curtain calls after the third act, in which Mrs. Le Moyne had made the hit of the evening in her scenes, first with Frank Worthing, the Duke of the play, and then with Miss Russell, the young Duchess.

1329-> MR. MARTIN EXPLAINS.
Your correspondent Mr. William B. Clarke is led by a condensed report to a false conclusion about my lecture at Cooper Union on "London Government." Being a teacher myself, I naturally have the highest regard for the profession. There's nothing like leather. 
--------
1330-> The Cape Bustards.
Two of the most beautiful of the lesser Cape bustards are the Vaal and the Blue koorhaans, birds of splendid form and coloring, good equally for sport or for the table. Another very beautiful bustard is the Bush koorhaan, a denizen of bush and forest country, with its notable pinkish crest, its intense black underplumage, and its handsomely speckled black and rufous back.

--------
1333-> THE CHICAGO RESOLUTIONS.
While heartily agreeing with a part of the Chicago resolutions, especially their praise of the gallantry of our troops, I do not think it right to make untrue statements. 
--------
1334-> RUSSELL SAGE VICTORIOUS; No Redress for Laidlaw, Injured in the Financier's Office. WAS NOT USED AS A SHIELD The Court of Appeals Holds that Mr. Sage Did Not Contribute to the Clerk's Misfortune.
ALBANY, Jan. 10. -- The Court of Appeals has reversed the judgment in favor of William R. Laidlaw, Jr., against Russell Sage, growing out of the dynamite explosion in the latter's office in 1891, and ordered a new trial. The case already has had four trials.

CHARLESTON, S.C., May 9. -- In gala dress of bunting and festoons of electric lights Charleston is to-night welcoming the visitors and delegates to the ninth annual reunion of the United Confederate Veterans.

--------
1338-> THE NICARAGUA CANAL AMENDMENT; Chairman of River and Harbor Committee Objects to It as a Rider.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. -- The status of the River and Harbor bill, with the Nicaragua Canal amendment, remained unchanged to-day owing to the action of the committee in adjourning over until to-morrow. Representative Hepburn, who has been most active in advancing the canal amendment, said to-day that he would not credit reports that the committee would hold the bill in order to defeat the canal amendment. 
--------
1339-> Anachronisms in Aranda's "Spanish Pharmacy."
One of the paintings in the Powers collection, recently sold at auction, and which was selected for reproduction in the Sunday supplement to THE NEW YORK TIMES, exhibits notable anachronisms that I have not seen noted. I refer to the "Spanish Pharmacy" by Jiminez y Aranda, an interesting and brilliantly colored study of the interior of an apothecary's shop in the time of Louis XVI., as indicated by the gay costumes. 
--------
1340-> ZOLA TO PAY LIBEL FINES.; Said M. Judet Used Forged Papers In Abusing Zola's Father.

--------
1341-> DUSTING BOOKS -- AND SOMETHING MORE.
How many people are there in the world, one might ask, that know, to its full extent, or, in fact to any extent, the pleasure to be found in dusting books? Not the mere use of a feather duster or the rapid swish of a cloth: that is the housemaid's province. Oh, no, that may be all that is necessary in dusting a room. 
--------
1342-> SOCIETY OF THE ClNCINNATI.; The 116Th Anniversary Celebrated -- Gen. Miles Praised -- Bravery of Troops in the Philippines.
The triennial meeting of the Society of the Cincinnati was held in Sherry's, at Forty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue, yesterday, and in the evening celebrated its one hundred and sixteenth anniversary with a banquet at Sherry's. There was a meeting of the Executive Committee on Tuesday.

Richard Croker, accompanied by several of his associates in the New York auto-truck enterprise, visited the compressed-air equipment plant of the American Air Power Company, at the foot of West Twenty-fourth Street, yesterday afternoon, and spent two or three hours acquainting himself with the practical workings of the motor which is to be applied to his proposed auto-trucks. 
--------
1350-> SERIOUS RUNAWAY ACCIDENT.; Two Young People Badly Injured Near New Rochelle.
NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., May 22. -- E. Hamford Sturges of this city and his cousin, Miss Catherine Leonard of Mount Vernon, were injured in a runaway accident last night. They were driving behind a spirited horse in a runabout along Pelham Bay Avenue in Pelham Manor when the horse became excited. 
--------
1351-> PROTECTING HOTELS.
We did rather an injustice, we find, to Assemblyman HARBURGER in denouncing his bill to make every hotel owner hang his hotel on all sides with so-called fire-escapes as "a silly proposal." Not that it was not a silly proposal. It eminently was. But not pre-eminently. For when it was introduced there were also introduced two other equally silly and in effect identically silly proposals -- one by Mr. GREENE and one by Mr. HOFFMAN. 
--------
1352-> POULTRY AND BIRD SHOW.; Some New Features at This Year's Exhibition in the Garden.
The New York Poultry and Pigeon Association is to hold its annual exhibition in Madison Square Garden, beginning Tuesday morning, Jan. 31, and continuing until Saturday evening, Feb. 4.

--------
1354-> OUR PROTECTIVE TARIFFS.
A history of the various protective tariffs of the United States indicates that at times they have been instituted for the purpose of raising the revenue, and at others with a view to reducing same. This series of explanations certainly covered many possibilities, but, with all its elasticity, it is not sufficient to cover a contingency which has risen and to which, strange to say, no one has yet called attention. 
--------
1355-> EDITOR WARDNER RELEASED.; Purges Himself of Contempt of Court in Boston.
BOSTON, Dec. 31. -- Torrey E. Wardner, editor of The Boston Traveler, who a week ago was committed to Dedham Jail for thirty days for contempt of court by Judge Sherman, was ordered released late this afternoon, Mr. Wardner having purged himself of the contempt.

--------
1360-> THE LOSS OF THE PARIS.
That is a very singular accident by which the liner Paris has been cast away on the British coast. It is the more singular because the spot where the disaster occurred is so near the place where a British steamer has been lost within a few months under circumstances much more tragical. 
--------
1361-> Fire Escapes on Apartment Houses.
Building Commissioner Guilfoyle is still prosecuting his crusade against unsafe apartment houses in Brooklyn. Assistant Corporation Counsel Courtney yesterday obtained orders from Justice Gaynor of the Supreme Court, requiring two owners of apartment houses to show cause why they should not be compelled to place fire-escapes on their buildings.

--------
1365-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
The breaking of Wall Street records has become commonplace. On every day of the week that is accomplished now. In volume of business trading beyond precedent proceeds not only without interruption, but providing evidence that the general public has actually taken control of the security market. In the matter of price the exhibit is just as cheerful. Quotations rise and show in no way any disposition to react. 
--------
1366-> A RUMORED BANK CHANGE; Report that the Seventh National Is to be Sold. PRESIDENT WILL NOT TALK First Assistant Postmaster General Heath and His Brother Said to be Seeking Control of the Institution.

In addition to this report, it was further rumored that they were on the point of assuming control of the bank, as a result of their reported purchases of the stock. 
--------
1367-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Wit and malice are sometimes so closely allied that it is difficult to the verge of impossibility to tell the proportion of each in a given statement. Take, for instance, this one in The Baltimore News: "Gov. ROOSEVELT delivered a lecture on 'Hypocrisy' the other night, and then went to Washington and shook hands with Secretary ALGER." 
--------
1368-> NOT IN THE NEW FLOUR TRUST.; Managers of Big Minneapolis Mills Deny Reports Telegraphed from New York.
MINNEAPOLIS, May 10. -- Managers Henry Little of the Pillsbury-Washburn Company and Manager J.S. Bell of the Washburn Crosby Company, emphatically deny a story telegraphed this morning from New York to the effect that the United States Flour Manufacturing Company has secured control of their mills. They assert that the report is too absurd to be believed by any one who is at all conversant with the situation. 
--------
1369-> A STATE POLICE.
GOV. ROOSEVELT'S plan for a State constabulary to embrace the larger cities is, in our judgment, bad. But the portion of his scheme relating to a mounted State police for the rural districts stands on a different footing. 
--------
1370-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Indicative of the dullness into which Wall Street's security market has lapsed was yesterday's record -- not a single railroad stock changing its quotation as much as one whole point, and in the industrial list only the stocks of two companies changing that much. The easy phrase of "midsummer dullness" finds warrant in a standstill market like this. 
--------
1371-> MISS JULIA ARTHUR'S ILLNESS.; Compels the Cancellation of Her Brooklyn and Harlem Engagements.
Miss Julia Arthur's health will not permit her to return to the stage for three weeks to come, and her manager, A.H. Canby, has been compelled to cancel her engagements to appear in Brooklyn the week beginning Jan. 9, and in Harlem the week beginning Jan. 16. Miss Arthur will probably not again appear until her Boston engagement, beginning Jan. 23.

Gerow, who was with Hartigan, almost lost his life in trying to save his companion. He was saved by Washington Hyde, a fisherman. 
--------
1374-> REACH THE FILIPINOS.
The President must see that it is very desirable, that it is, indeed, an imperative duty, to use all possible means to convince the inhabitants of the Philippines of our friendly and just purpose with reference to them. Briefly, that purpose is to establish order and steadily to develop the highest degree of self-government consistent with order. 
--------
1375-> STREET CAR INSPECTOR SCORED.; Pool Says Indiscriminate Arrests of Passengers Must Stop.

--------
1376-> LONDON THEATRICAL TALK.; Mrs. Langtry's Plans -- A Drama by Guy Boothby -- The Celtic Drama to Have a Show.
LONDON, June 9. -- Mrs. Langtry will return to the stage and produce in London, probably in the Autumn, an entirely new dramatic version, by Sydney Grundy, of "Le Collier de la Reine," by the elder Dumas. Her role will be Marie Antoinette, of course. Henry Hamilton is writing, for Beerbohm Tree, a new play on the subject of "Monte Cristo." So that the Dumas boom in the theatres is not to die just yet.

1377-> THE REFORMED CHURCH SYNOD.; Rev. Dr. F.S. Schenck Elected a Professor at New Brunswick Seminary.
CATSKILL, N.Y., June 9. -- At this morning's session of the General Synod of the Reformed Church the Rev. Dr. Ferdinand S. Schenck of New York City was elected Professor of Pastoral Theology and Sacred Rhetoric at the Theological Seminary at New Brunswick. 
--------
1378-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Most things strike the Bostonians mournfully nowadays, but though, according to their ideas, America is rushing violently down several steep places into several seas and utter destruction, still there are crumbs of comfort to be found in Europe. As one such crumb The Boston Journal records the laying out of a golf course at Rome, "just outside the famous Porta Pia," and surmises that "this must have aroused some thrills of pleasure hereabouts." 
--------
1379-> FRANCHISES IN THE BRONX.; Mr. Grossman Argues for the Enactment of His Forfeiture Bill.
ALBANY, March 10. -- Assemblyman Grossman to-day made the following statement relative to the need of the enactment of his franchise bill, which affects the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company in the Borough of the Bronx:

1380-> MAJOR SMITH'S DEFENSE; He Declares that the 71st's Officers Obeyed Orders. NOT TOLD TO ADVANCE, HE SAYS Alleges that the Judge Advocate General Is Prejudiced Against the Accused Men.
Major Gen. Charles F. Roe of the National Guard would not comment yesterday upon the results of the hearing before Gov.

He took the position that he knew nothing of the report, as it had not been officially announced.

MONTREAL, May 22. -- The Canal Advisory Commission appointed by Gov. Roosevelt of New York completed its tour of the system between Lake Erie and Montreal this evening, and will leave for Pittsburg in the morning. 
--------
1383-> Kennedy Not the Author of a Portion of "The Virginians."
Is the conclusion to which Gen. James Grant Wilson has arrived in his article on "The Virginians" in THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW of 15th inst. correct, and is he warranted in stating in the latest edition of the cyclopedia of which he is editor that John P. Kennedy of Baltimore is the "author of a portion of Chapter" IV., Vol. II., of "The Virginians"? I think not, for the following reasons: 
--------
1384-> FERTILIZER COMPANIES UNITE.; John F. Gibbons of This City to be President of the Combination.
BALTIMORE, May 22. -- The consolidation of twenty-three leading fertilizer companies of the country has been completed. The new corporation will be known as the American Agricultural Chemical Company, and it will obtain a special charter under the laws of Connecticut.

1385-> As to Glory Quayle Again.
In THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW for the last few months I have followed up closely and read with interest the many commentaries and criticisms on Hall Caine's "Christian" and on the escapades of Glory and the ravings of John Storms therein.

1387-> GEMILATH CHASODIM SOCIETY.; The Work Done During the Past Year by the Organization Was Wholly Satisfactory.
The proceedings of the annual meeting recently held in the auditorium of the Educational Alliance of the Hebrew Gemilath Chasodim Association were of interest and wholly satisfactory. The association, which rose from a very modest endeavor made some years ago, has for its purpose the lending of money in small sums without interest to worthy poor. 
--------
1388-> THE COURSE OF THE MARKET.
Though only about half a million shares of stock are traded in daily on the Stock Exchange, there is a wide distribution of transactions. Over 150 issues on the average figure in the daily list, and as a rule a ready market can be found for practically every stock that is listed. 
--------
1389-> CARGOES FROM PUERTO RICO.; May Be Brought Here in Future in Other than American Ships.
WASHINGTON, April 21. -- As a result of the Cabinet meeting to-day, Secretary Alger will issue an order to permit the shipment of cargoes from Puerto Rico to the United States in other than American bottoms. 
--------
1390-> AMERICAN ART.
The success of the Clarke sale of American paintings is adapted to inspire various reflections. Some of these were expressed in yesterday's issue of THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW OF BOOKS AND ART. The sale was not without those surprises which seem destined to attend the dispersal of every famous collection, and not all of these were of the kind agreeable to the collector.

The local delegates who attended the National Assembly in Providence last week still believe that the League of American Wheelmen should have abolished racing. The local delegation wanted no offices, but were willing to sacrifice everything to bring this about. They were beaten, however, by an overwhelming majority, and while they are much disappointed at the way the vote went, it is not their intention to give up the fight against racing.

1395-> DELAY IN THE BOND ISSUES; It Is Seriously Embarrassing the City Administration. MAY APPEAL TO LEGISLATURE Controller Coler Threatens to Have the Municipal Assembly Abolished or Its Powers Curtailed.
The delay in the Municipal Assembly in the matter of authorizing pending bond issues has so seriously embarrassed the administration that it is entirely within the probabilities that the Governor will be asked to call a special session of the Legislature to abolish both houses, or at least to curtail their already limited powers.

1400-> MILES AND THE ARMY.; Reported Effect of the Administration's Attitude Toward Him Upon Reorganization Legislation.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. -- There has been little hope for some weeks that the Senate would agree on an army reorganization bill, and the feeling among the friends of reorganization has been, as has been reported to THE TIMES, that the measure was practically abandoned.

1403-> A Verbal Melee.
Going up on a Cedar Avenue car the other night the passengers were much entertained by a verbal spat between a small citizen of German parentage and a tall native. The trouble all originated from the fact that the car was very much crowded, so crowded that the two disputants were brought face to face in such close proximity that they couldn't make a gesture.

1404-> ISRAEL F. FISCHER APPOINTED.; Brooklyn ex-Congressman Made a Member of the Board of General Appraisers.

The President and Congress have done their part in behalf of seamen by the enactment of the new law for their better protection.

--------

FREDERICTON, N.B., Feb. 18. -- General elections are being held to-day throughout New Brunswick. There are forty-five seats in the Legislature to be filled, and while the result will be close, the chances are thought to favor slightly a Government victory.

--------
1411-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Many readers of THE TIMES, it is pleasant to see, have resented the assertion, made by a person in, if not of, Boston, that dogs are destitute of reasoning power. Anybody who ever owned a dog can refute the theory of the Boston person, and, except for the fact that the refutations are intrinsically interesting, they would not have been worth publishing. 
--------

WASHINGTON, April 21. -- The committee, consisting of Mr. Lyman, Chief of the Appointment Division of the Treasury Department, and Mr. Chance, the Chief of the division of Special Agents, appointed by Secretary Gage to investigate reported violations of the civil service law and rules in the administration of the Appraiser's warehouse in New York, has made its report. 
--------
1413-> POLICE BILL DISCUSSED; Gov. Roosevelt Meets Senator Platt and Chairman Odell. THE MEASURE IS NOT POPULAR Several Senators Say They Will Oppose It -- Governor Does Not Like One Clause.
Gov. Roosevelt had a quieter day yesterday than he usually has on his weekly visits to this city to confer with Senator Platt and other leaders of the Republican Organization.

1415-> HE LOOKED LIKE A SWINDLER.
CINCINNATI, June 21. -- Everything indicates that E.H. Pittman, an aged canvasser from England, who is serving a long sentence at the workhouse, on a charge of practicing a trick game, is innocent.

--------
1416-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Greater Variety, Larger Amounts Shown in Week's Dealings. SALES OF BUSINESS PROPERTY Latest Sales by Brokers -- Big Week Ahead at Auction -- Down-Town Parcels and Other Attractive Offerings.
If the weather and a holiday last week did not facilitate the transaction of business, the showing made by the real estate market is perhaps all the more creditable. The demand for business property, in which there has been a decided lull since the announcement of 1899 tax valuations, again showed signs of revival, and it is gratifying to note that many of the larger transactions of the week involved something besides vacant property. 
--------
1417-> A Feast for Railroad Men.; From The St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
Jefferson City will soon tender a banquet to the officers of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company. The affair will in a measure testify to the appreciation felt by the citizens of the capital city for the handsome new passenger station that the company has built here at a cost of $35,000. The building is practically completed, and it is the finest station on the entire Gould system. 
--------
1418-> DR. R.V. PIERCE'S MEDICINES.
In olden times a leper was stoned out of town; in modern times a sick man is stoned out of all his chances in life by the crowd of busy, hustling men who have no place and no use for him. A man who has bilious turns and tired feelings and frequent "off-days" might as well go out of business. 
--------
1419-> STOCKBRIDGE.
STOCKBRIDGE, Mass., June 10. -- The recent hot wave has had its influence upon Stockbridge as much as upon any of the Summer resorts, and people have been flocking into the village for the past two weeks, delighted to get away from the heat of the city to the cool, shaded streets and the charming country homes of Stockbridge. 
--------
1420-> EMMA EAMES AND HER HOMES.
MME. EMMA EAMES-STORY, the beautiful prima donna, might almost be called "the woman without a country," if she did not consider herself a most patriotic American. If there is any influence in natural environments she should possess a wonderful cosmopolitan nature. 
--------
1421-> NICARAGUA CANAL'S CHANCES.; River and Harbor Bill Sent to a Conference -- House Members Against the Project.
WASHINGTON, March 1. -- The House to-day, in accordance with a report from the River and Harbor Committee, voted not to concur in the Senate amendments to the River and Harbor bill, and sent the bill to a conference, Messrs.

1425-> Jesse Fothergill's "First Violin" -- A Letter to an Inamorata.
In your last SATURDAY REVIEW, speaking of musical novels in your editorial article, "Musical Novels and Books on Music," you referred somewhat cursorily to Jesse Fothergill's "First Violin." The following letter to my inamorata was written a couple of years ago under the spur of a warm enthusiasm for this novel. Its general interest may excuse such intrusion: 
--------
1426-> TAXES IN THE FOREST PRESERVE.; Bill for a Supervisor Introduced in the Legislature.
ALBANY, March 23. -- Senator G.A. Davis introduced to-day a bill providing for the appointment of a Supervisor of Taxes within the forest preserve.

WASHINGTON, July 22 -- Apropos of Gen. Alger's retirement. It is a curious fact that the Secretary of War has never held office as long as Secretaries of other departments have held it. Twenty-five Presidents of the United States have had fifty-two War Secretaries, while the number of Secretaries at the heads of others departments has been much less. 
--------
1428-> FRENCH COMMERCIAL TREATY.; M. Millerand Says Agricultural Interests Will Be Guarded.
PARIS, July 22. -- At the Cabinet meeting to-day the Minister of Agriculture, Jean Dupuy, called the attention of his colleagues to the fact that the negotiating of a treaty with the United States made necessary the safeguarding of the interests of French agriculture.

--------
1429-> SOME BIG GRANITE PILLARS.; How They Were Carried from Quiney to Boston Sixty Odd Years Ago.
The Boston Custom House is one of the most interesting buildings in that old city by the sea. Built of Quincy granite, with its massive dome and enormous pillars, it looks as though it could withstand the storms of a thousand years. Men and women, boys and girls, have looked upon this building and noticed its majestic fluted pillars. 
--------
1430-> MR. WISHER PREACHES AGAIN.; A Policeman Acts as Moderator for the Mt. Olivet Congregation.
The Rev. Mr. Wisher preached to a large congregation at Mount Olivet Baptist Church yesterday morning. Mrs. Minerva Branch was able to be present.

--------
1432-> THE FRANCHISE TAX.
It must surprise a great many readers of your valued journal to note your editorial condemnation of the franchise tax, on the strength of one example quoted, and a very poor one -- namely, the Manhattan Railway Company.

NEWBURG, May 31. -- A resolution was adopted on the evening of Memorial Day by about twenty of the organizers of the Lincoln Association of Newburg, indorsing and upholding the action of the Seventh Regiment during the war between the United States and Spain.

--------
1444-> THE NEW CURRENCY BILL.
We wish that we could regard the action of the Committee on Coinage, in reporting the Hill Currency bill, as good ground for revising our recent expression of opinion that the situation of the sound-money cause is extremely discouraging and in some respects discreditable. But we cannot see that it really changes that situation greatly. 
--------
1445-> "WHERE GHOSTS WALK."
MARION HARLAND, the author of "Some Colonial Homesteads," , collected a few months ago about fifteen essays that she had written concerning the abodes of famous Europeans long since dead, and she called the collection "Where Ghosts Walk: The Haunts of Familiar Characters in History and Literature," and a few weeks ago G.P.

--------
1447-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
"I am visiting China, * * * and from all I have seen out here I am fully convinced that the solution of the China question lies in a strong commercial alliance between those countries interested in keeping the door open in China, as opposed to those countries whose interest it is to close the door, whether by preferential rights, by hostile tariffs, by military domination, or by diplomatic pressure on the Government at Pekin." 
--------
1448-> THE ENSLAVEMENT OF THE FILIPINOS.
According to the statements, of one of the most intelligent of their own race it is AGUINALDO not Gen. OTIS who is fighting to enslave the Filipinos. In an article written for The Independent after the capture of Calumpit Mr. RAMON REYES LALA, a native of the Philippine Islands, but a naturalized American citizen, says: 
--------
1449-> THE EXEMPLARY FATE OF TILLMANN.
Considering that he was a mere worm of a civilian in a land of militarism, Mr. TILLMANN, who has just been killed in a duel with Lieut. SCHLICKMANN of the Bavarian infantry, got off easy. The trouble grew out of TILLMANN'S perfectly absurd notion that he, a paltry civilian, had rights which officers were bound to respect. 
--------
1450-> BRYAN IN THE SOUTH.
The Southern Democrats care more for BRYAN than for free silver. They can give up the Chicago platfom, but BRYAN must be their candidate next year. This is the report brought from the South by men who have good opportunities to learn the sentiment of the people there. 
--------
1451-> STATE TAXATION COMMITTEE.; THE Governor and Mr. Platt Said to Disagree on an Appointment.
ALBANY, May 23. -- Although the Legislature at its regular session authorized the appointment of a joint committee of three Senators and four Assemblymen to study the subject of taxation during the recess, in accordance with the Governor's suggestion, there has been strange delay in the naming of the men who are to serve on the committee.

--------
1456-> CUBA AND THE CRIMEA.; The Similarity of the Experiences of Our Troops at Santiago and Those of England in 1854-56.
Now that the somewhat unreasoning outburst of popular indignation over the inefficiency of our preparations for the care of our troops in the field has had a chance to somewhat subside, it is interesting to note the similarity of experience between our own troops in 1898 and those of England, a nation supposed to be always ready to fight, in the Crimean War of 1854-6. 
--------

There is some prospect for developments to-day in the matter of Controller Coler's fight against the Municipal Assembly on the hold-up of bond issues.

--------

--------

--------
1470-> "Mac" and "O."
"Many Irish names appear strange," writes the distinguished Irish scholar. Dr. Philip MacDermott, "and uncouth to the average English reader, though if their etymology and pronunciation were perfectly understood, they would be found truly beauful and euphonious."

--------
1474-> THE PARIS STILL HANGING.; Effort to Refloat the Vessel Fails -- Will Make Supreme Trial To-morrow or Saturday.
COVERACK, Cornwall, May 24. -- The scene in the vicinity of the steamship Paris was most interesting and animated when, an hour before high water, the American Line steamer and her attendant tugs put on a full head of steam and exerted their utmost power to refloat her.

In order that this work may be started and a section of new cells put in this year, an appropriation of money sufficient for the necessary material and supervision is desired. 
--------
1478-> THE SAMOAN SITUATION.
It will not do to assume that the objections reported to have been made by the German Government to the action of Admiral KAUTZ at Apia are entirely without foundation. The German Government may be in possession of information which justifies those objections. The European and American public, however, is not yet in possession of such information, and if the German press is in possession of such information it does not publish it. 
--------
1479-> Funny Things Said Seriously.
There must surely be something in the atmosphere of the Birmingham Town Hall which is conducive to the production of mixed metaphors. At Mr. Stead's recent meeting there in his crusade against war, a worthy Quaker Councillor described the Czar's rescript as being like "a dove bearing the olive branch of peace which burst like a thunderbolt upon the world." 
--------

1481-> DESCRIPTIVE OF THE HAGUE; Flags of All Nations Wave in Honor of Peace Conferrees. HISTORIC TEMPLE OF PEACE Erected Two Centuries Ago as a Monument to Prince Frederik Hendrik -- Rare Antiquities.
THE HAGUE, May 23. -- The Hague is swarming with strangers, all peaceward bent. The Hagenaar is also very willing to be out of doors, for the fine weather at last has come, although the wind is still a vigorous guest, delaying his departure, I fancy, in order to aid the minority when the conference gets at its hottest.

SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain, March 1. -- "The lazy Spaniard" has passed into a proverb. The wide world knows his picture -- that broad sombrero, romantic cloak and inevitable cigarette. But how about the laborious Spaniard? He deserves not to be ignored. 
--------
1484-> BREACH OF THE SUNDAY LAWS.
While the West Side Sunday Closing Association, of whose committee I am a member, is at it, why does it not at once take steps to put down what to me and, I imagine, to the general public, is a far greater evil, as it certainly is a far greater nuisance than the keeping open of certain stores on Sunday? 
--------
1485-> American Tortured by Filipinos.
SAN FRANCISCO, March 23. -- A letter from Capt. McQuesten, Surgeon of the Twenty-eighth regulars, now at Manila, tells of the release of A.B.

--------
1489-> CHOATE AND DEPEW.
The farewell dinner which Mr. CHOATE'S friends gave him, although it was given at the Union League Club, owed its chief significance and value to the fact that it was so much more human, so to speak, than it was partisan. There is, of course, no dispute that, socially and professionally, Mr. CHOATE stands in the front rank of our citizenship. 
--------
1490-> DISCHARGE OF VOLUNTEERS.; All Those Remaining in the United States Released by Orders Issued Yesterday.

--------
1494-> DRAMATIC AND MUSICAL; A Big Drury Lane Drama on View at Daly's ADA REHAN IN A NEW ROLE A Cordial Reception for "The Great Ruby" -- The Wagner Cycle at Opera House.
Mr. Daly's production of the latest Drury Lane, melodrama in his luxuriously appointed theatre, hitherto devoted to refined comedy and poetical drama, is likely to please a multitude of playgoers and put a great deal of money in his purse, however much the tedious and everlasting "judicious" may grieve. 
--------
1495-> THE PEACE TREATY.
The incorporation of the principles contained in Clause 3 of the Paris peace treaty into the political and moral law of the Republic, as was practically effected yesterday by the ratification of the treaty, will date a new and distinct epoch in American political history, and may or may not have sounded the keynote for the gradual deposing of the old Constitutional Government, or a reconstruction of it. 
--------
1496-> TO ABOLISH FAITH "HEALERS."; President Murphy Advises that Sanitary Superintendents Confer with Medical Societies.
