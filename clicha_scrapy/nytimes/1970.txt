0-> Dutch Protesters Create Random Crosswalks to Fight Development Plan
AMSTERDAM, the Nether lands—In the Netherlands where the put‐on has been developed into weapon of nonviolent resistance, foes of the automobile and the wrecker have come up with a new one. They are painting “zebras” — pedestrian cross ings that give the walker the right of way—where none are supposed to be. The target of the campaign is the Amsterdam City Coun cil's plan to redevelop the old Jordaan quarter, a run down but charming area, crisscrossed by canals, where Rembrandt once lived and many young and poor artists now find cheap housing. The project would raze much of the district to widen streets and line them with office and apaertment. Recently, a group of artists and other residents blocked a street and turned it into a playground for a day. On another weekend, a group laid down a zebra across the Rozengracht, an avenue in the Jordaan that is scheduled to be widened and elevated as a speedway. An unamused Police De partment sent a crew to cover the zebra,but rain washed the new covering off. Mean while, a zebra appeared at another unauthorized cross ing. In response to the protests, the city announced that the development program was not final, and it has scheduled a series of studies and con ferences to determine what the public thinks should be done with the Jordaan.

1-> Earth's Day, Like Mother's, Pulls Capital Together
WASHINGTON, April 22— Conservatives were for it. Lib erals were for it. Democrats, Republicans and independents were for it. So were the ins, the outs, the Executive and legislative branches of Govern ment. It was Earth Day, and, like Mother's Day, no man in public office could be against it. Vast numbers of United States Senators and Repre sentatives, some Cabinet and sub ‐ Cabinet members and everybody on the President's Environmental Quality Council were spread out across the nation today, mostly on cam puses, talking about how to improve a rapidly deteriorating environment. In their wake they left quantities of litter, composed of speech texts and statements distributed across Washington. President Nixon, through Whte House spokesmen, said he had said enough on his con cern about pollution and hoped this one‐day event would be the start of a continuing cam paign against it. There were speeches and panel discussions at the State Department, cosponsored by Christian Herter. Special Assist ant to the Secretary of State for Environmental Affairs, and Philander Claxton, special As sitant for Population Matters. There were speeches and films about the earth, unspoiled and despoiled, at the Agricul ture Department. Screenings of topical films at the Rayburn House Office Building included “what a beautiful bird the pelican was” before pesticides got to it. Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel was in his home state of Alaska at a teach in. Transportation Secretary John A. Volpe, whose bailiwick is highways, airways and wa terways, was taking the heat at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore at another environ mental teach‐in. A spokesman for Mr. Volpe said today: “The past sins of the transportation industry have come to rest on this Adminis tration and on his head.” James Farmer, Assistant Sec retary of Health, Education and Welfare, took the symbolic route and planted a tree at H.E.W.'s main building. Then he recorded a 20‐second in spirational “actuality state ment” that people could dial on the telephone. Dr. Myron Tribus, the Com merce Department's Assistant Secretary for Science and Tech nology also delivered his en vironmental message by tele phone. In a conference call to an Indiana high school he sug gested that the students might monitor the noise pollution of rock ‘n’ roll music and hot rods with acoustical meters. Senators and Representa tives were scurrying from one “clean‐it‐up” speech to an other. “Everyone I've talked to is making a speech somewhere,” said Representative Paul N. McCloskey epublican of California, Jr.,Mr. McCloskey, along with Senator Gaylord Nelson, Democrat of Wiscon sin, thought up the idea for today's nationwide environ mental happening and spoke at three colleges in his home state today. Senator Nelson hopped from the University of Wisconsin to Denver and Berkeley, Cal. Senator Edward M. Kennedy was at Yale. Senator Barry Goldwater was at Adelphi University in Garden City, L.I. Clifford Case was at Prince ton; Ralph W. Yarborough was at Rice University in Houston; and Edmund S. Muskie, one of the Senate's long‐term ex perts on pollution, was at the University of Pennsylvania. Representative John Brade mas, Democrat of Indiana, stayed in Washington but took a swipe at the Nixon Ad ministration by charging “big talk — no action” on environ mental problems. Representative John B. An derson of Illinois chairman of the House Republican Confer ence countered with another paper missile in the battle of the press release. He called on Democrats to “get down to earth” after Earth Day and begin Congressional action on seven environmental quality bills introduced by President Nixon two months ago. “Only one committee—Inter state and Foreign Commerce— in this Democratic‐controlled House has bestirred itself enough to hold hearings op the President's proposals,” he said. Meanwhile, Lawrence F. O' Brien, chairman of the Demo cratic National Committee, issued a statement, too. It wel comed Mr. Nixon's expressed concern with problems of thel environment and went on: “Now we must hope that this concern will be translated into a serious and sustained com mitment to attack these prob lems.” Of those Senators out on the stump, Senator Thomas Mc Intyre, Democrat of New Hampshire, may hold the speechifying record. By tomor row he will have delivered 14 addresses in his state, all on environment, within the week. The Justice Department here was under strict security today, with tours of the Federal Bureau of Investigation can celed. At first it was thought there was some connection with Earth Day. It turned out, how ever, that the department had received its fourth bomb threat in six weeks, apparently not related to the demonstrations.

2-> Sinatra, a Backer Of Kennedys, Plans To Support Reagan
SACRAMENTO, Calif., July (Reuters)—Frank Sinatra, a life long Democrat who campaigned hard for the Kennedy Brothers, today joined the campaign to re‐elect Gov. Ronald Reagan, conservative Republican. The actor‐singer became co chairman of the Californians for Reagan organization, saying he shared “the same desires as the Governor for the welfare of the state and America.” Mr. Sinatra's switch to Mr. Reagan came as a surprise to Jess Unruh, the Democrat who faces Mr. Reagan in the Novem ber election. Mr. Unruh, like Mr. Sinatra, had always played a prominent role in campaigns run by Presi dent Kennedy and by Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Explaining his stand, Mr. Si natra praised Governor Reagan's “guts and fortitude” and indi cated that he supported the tough line taken by the ex‐film star on campus dissent. “We must all work together to end the turmoil on the cam puses and improve the commu nication between the students and what they refer to as the establishment,” Mr Sinatra was quoted as saying by a jubilant Reagan camp. “Those who do not know Governor Reagan and me as we have known each other for more than 20 years may be surprised by the announce ment,” Mr. Sinatra said. “How ever, we share the same desires for the welfare of the people of the state of California and the nation.” Mr. Reagan had personally asked the actor to work for him. Mr. Sinatra said he would remain a registered Democrat despite his new role.

7-> 20 Boat Shows Slated to Open In U.S. and Abroad This Month
The fantastic thing about boat shows is not only how many there are these days, but also how more boats, more people and more records are set each year despite the same amount of space. This month 20 boat shows ire scheduled to open, 16 of them in the United States and Four in Europe. Not counting a Southern California outdoor ;how in Anaheim that began yesterday, four important spec taculars will open their doors this week. They include the London In ternational on Tuesday, the San Francisco National on Friday, the Paris show also on Friday and the Seattle show on Sat urday. All of them advertise as being “bigger and better and more and newer” than before. In London, the first show was held in 1955 with 141 ex hibitors and 120,000 visitors. Last year there were 530 ex hibitors and 329,976 visitors. New Yorkers will get their chance to dream away the win ter starting on Jan. 21, follow ing boat exhibitions at Corpus Christi, Tex., Cleveland, West Springfield, Mass., Cincinnati, ,Portland, Ore., and Fort Worth. The national boat show here continues until Feb. 1. For those who saw last year's show at the Coliseum and believe it is impossible to be bigger, which it will be, here's how it is being done, ac cording to Peter M. Wilson, the managing director. By turning 9,000 square feet of small‐booth space over to boat displays on the fourth floor, more boats can be shown. The exhibitors whc formerly held that space have been accommodated elsewhere Wilson said, although he die not specify how. Hamburg, Germany, on Jan 23, and Genoa, Italy, on Jan 31, are the other two European boat show sites this month. ?? for Detroit, which will ?? two within a week, the ?? ?? the United States shows ?? ?? for warmer climates. Troy include Tulsa, Okla., 21; Los Angeles, Jan. 23; Okalahoma City, Jan. 28, and Amarillo, Tex., Jan. 30. The last‐named show Is also the shortest, lasting just three days. Detroit's doubleheader starts Jan. 23 and Jan. 31. Promotional attractions, be sides boats, are also increasing at these shows. A main feature at London Earl Court will be a re‐creation of France's Riviera, a water sports development that stretches 120 miles from the Pyrenees to Marseilles. Another innovation planned there is the angling center. Not only can you try the latest in reels and lures, but by pressing a button, you can play a fight ing fish from a bucking boat, while girl scuba divers chal lenge experts to “hook” them. But there are also boats at the London show, which seems to incorporate more “entertain ment” than the New York event. As it has done the last few years, 40 craft will float alongside jetties, while hun dreds of others will be dis played on dry land. There is even a sunken ves sel on view—a reconstructed galleon's quarter‐deck contain ing treasure trove, which div ing teams will recover using the new equipment made for that purpose. As sort of a preview of the 1970 shows, the Miami Dinrier Key Boat Show that ended last Nov. 25 set attendance records almost every day of a five‐day run. Exhibitors reported near sellouts of their displays, and a walking catfish claimed a world record by wiggling six feet in 8 seconds flat.

11-> Books of The Times
I seem to recall that Sturgeon's Law states that 90 per cent of everything is junk. (Don't ask me who Sturgeon is or was. For all I know, he was a fish.) Judg ing from the enormous pile I have just pushed off my desk, Sturgeon's law errs on the side of generosity when applied to this year's’ crop of children's book. A hard search through several hundred turned up one superb item and only a handful of others that roused the reviewer from his end‐of‐the‐year stupor. Brief descriptions of the best of these follow: “Shapes and Things,” by Tana Hoban (Macmillan, $4.95), is a book of photo grams, which are “photographs made with out a camera by placing an object directly on photographic paper under darkroom conditions, then exposing it to light and processing it in the same way as a photo graphic print.” The result is a spread of dazzling white shapes on black back grounds depicting everything from alpha bet‐soup letters to butterflies to kitchen utensils. Probably too sophisticated for children, but my one‐year‐old shouted with excitement when she recognized the. white shape of a spoon. “Story Number 2,” by Eugene Ionesco, with pictures by Etienne Delessert (Harlin Quist, $3.95), makes the Ionescean case that “pictures aren't called pictures. They're called pictures.” And that “a chair is a window. The window is a penholder. ...Eyes are fingers. Fingers are eyes.” The book is overproduced, and I'm not at all sure it's really “for children under 3 years of age,” but I seem to remember a stage way back there when this sort of nonsense would have struck me as hilarious. “Tell Me a Mitzi,” by Lore Segal, with pictures by Harriet Pincus (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $4.95). A Mitzi is a small girl who appears in the stories told to her by her mother and father. In one, she takes her brother Jacob to visit their grand mother but forgets to find out her address; in another, she joins her family in a day of sickness (”It's not your turn to be sick,” says Mitzi's father to her mother); in the third, she witnesses a parade in which the President offers Jacob a piece of chewing gum. The figures in Harriet Pincus's bril liantly colorful and inventive illustrations seem uncommonly homely at first, but they grow and grow on one, as do Mrs. Segal's “In the Night Kitchen,” by Maurice Sendak (Harper & Row, $4.95), is .the superb item and was celebrated in a pre vious column. With strikingly original il lustrations and the briefest of texts, Mr. Sendak tells the dreamlike story of a small boy's journey into the Night Kitchen, where he fetches milk for the baking of the morn ing cake. A profoundly engaging fantasy that ought to become a classic. “Life and Death,” by Herbert S. Zim and Sonia Bleeker, illustrated by Rene Martin (Morrow, $3.50), is a low‐key but straight forward discussion of how and why death occurs. A difficult subject treated with just the right dispassionate tone and with illustrations suited to the text. “Red Hawk's Account of Custer's Last Stand: The Battle of the Little Bighorn, 25 June 1876,” by Paul and Dorothy Goble (Pantheon, $4.50.) How Custer's luck ran out is told with dignity by an imagi nary 15‐year‐old ,Sioux Indian who was there. Based on published accounts of both Sioux and Cheyenne participants in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, this immensely attractive book is illustrated in the style of Plains Indian paintings of the period 1860–1900. “Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret.” by Judy Blume (Bradbury, $4.50). I'm not sure if Mrs. Blume has caught the spirit of the contemporary pre‐adolescent, but she certainly makes one feel for Margaret Simon, who has just moved to the New Jersey suburbs, does not know what religion she wants to be (though she car ries on a running monologue with “God”), is in a terrible hurry to “menstroo‐ate,” and tells it all with touching humor. “The Marvelous Misadventures of Se bastian,” by Lloyd Alexander (Dutton, $5.95). Although a little on the slick, me chanical side, this hectic tale of a court musician who loses his job as Fourth Fid dler and meanders into a revolution, bounces along at a breathless pace and introduces us to an amusing princess with the airs of a Lord Chamberlain and the vocabulary of a whiz kid. The more one reads and considers, the more absurd it seems that books should be written especially for this age group. Surely teen‐agers are ready for adult classics, even when they can't understand them completely. The only book here that I can recommend is “Young and Black in America,” compiled by Rae Pace Alex ander, with introductory notes by Julius Lester (Random House, $3.95), an an thology of selections from autobiographical writings by such people as Frederick Douglass, Richard Wright, Malcolm X, Jimmy Brown and Harry Edwards. Fine, but, one hopes that its readers will go on to the books from which these fragments were taken. “The Trumpet of the Swan,” by E. B. White, illustrated by Edward Frascino (Harper & Row, $4.50). There is something ever‐so‐lightly forced about this tale of a trumpeter swan who has a speech defect but conquers it. Yet apparently it is im possible for Mr. White to touch any material without filling it with his magic. I liked the father swan best.

13-> An Author Who Makes Pasta, Cooks It And Writes About
WASHINGTON, Conn. —“This is one of the oddest pasta dishes,” Jack Denton Scott was saying, “but one of the best for summer.” And Mr. Scott, novelist, field naturalist and cookbook author, should know. He is the author of “The Complete Book of Pasta,” one of the best books on the subject. The curious dish he was in the midst of tossing was spaghettini estivi. He ladled tomato sauce, delicately sea soned with herbs and lightly laced with olive oil, onto platter of hot spaghettini. The sauce, reminiscent of well‐made gazpacho, was un cooked and at room tempera ture. “Estivi means summer or summery, and they call the sauce that because it has everything in the garden,” he said, Rolling Estate Mr. Scott, who lives with his wife on a rolling, hun dred‐acre estate here, ex plained that his professional interest in food and his spe cific interest in Italian cook ing came about, so to speak, by marriage. “My wife was born Maria Louisa Limoncelli, and we met in 1942 in Elmira, up state New York. Her mother was a fantastic cook and taught me a great deal about pasta and other dishes. make my own with semolina and roll it out by hand. It's harder to handle—a hell of a job, really—but pasta made with semolina holds up bet ter.” The host, a warm ‐man nered, smiling man who looks like the embodiment of gentle country squire, said that he had just finished a novel and was at work on another cookbook with An toine Gully, a well‐known chef who formerly owned La Cre rnaillbre in Banksville, N. Y. It will be called “Antoine Gilly, Master Chef,” and is scheduled for publication next year. Torrington, Conn., accord ing to Mr. Scott, is a fascinat ing source for many things necessary to an Italian kitch en, including the cheese he uses on his pasta. He uses Asiago cheese almost exclu sively, which he buys from the Frigo Food Products Com pany, 109 South Main Street, in Torrington. “The cheese is made by the Frigo family in Wiscon sin, and as far as I know the only outlet for the cheese is the one I use.” Asiago is a grating cheese similar to Par mesan, and there are two grades, the two‐year‐old vec chio, which means old, and the four‐year‐old stravecchio, which means very old. Both Mr. Scott and his wife are excellent cooks (“Mary Lou,” he declares, “is a much better cook than I”) and that recent summer menu included a terrine of pheasant; roast, boneless quail; cucumbers in cream and a chilled fresh raspberry mousse. They pur chase their game birds from Birdcliff, a game farm in Wingdale, N. Y. JACK DENTON SCOTTS SPAGHETTINI ESTIVI 2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped 1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf Italian parsley 5 fresh basil leaves, chopped Juice of I lemon 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic, finely chopped Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 pound spaghettini Grated Asiago or Parmesan cheese. 1.

Or fail ing this, quickly turn the pasta into a colander and immediately pour the pasta into the hot bowl. Spoon a little more than half the sauce over the spaghettini and toss quickly. Divide the mixture evenly into the hot soup bowls and divide the remaining sauce over the servings. Serve with grated cheese. The use of the cheese is optional. Yield: Four to six servings.

14-> TV Ads Prove a Rich Lode for Actors
Actors, from Off Broadway beginners to Hollywood su perstars, are beating a wide new path to solvency and riches in the 60‐second mini drama called the TV com mercial. Riding in the van guard are their agents, who quickly learned that 10 per cent of a salable face or voice is the next best thing to a stake in the fabled El dorado. It was not many years ago that legitimate actors, not to mention superstars, turned up their patrician noses at the prospect of appearing in commercials. A few still balk at. appearing on camera, but even they are increasingly willing to lend their voices to the audio portion of the highly lucrative ads. And, with acceptance by a star of the magnitude of Henry Fonda, commercial acting ap pears to have successfully negotiated the long climb to respectability. Money Lure Recognized Actors—and their agents—would be the first to admit that the climb was made easier by Hollywood's de cline as a job market for actors. But there is also growing recognition of just how much money there is in those 60‐second spots. Sponsors spent $1,697,420, 500 in network television last year in the top 75 mar kets, according to the Broad cast Advertisers Report. Another $1,115,445,000 was spent on spot commercials on regional and local sta tions. The figures for radio are similarly impressive. With 60‐second television spots now costing as much as $100,000 to produce, ad vertisers and their casting directors are always looking for new faces, special talents and that “something extra” that will quickly capture sleepy viewer's interest. To meet the demand, a variety of talent agencies have made commercial‐casting their ma jor or exclusive domain. Giants Handle Superstars About 15 of the city's 125 licensed talent agencies do about 95 per cent of the re cruiting for commercials. The talent giants—such as the International Famous Agency, William Morris and Creative Management Associates—do some commercial casting and handle most of the super stars. But the bulk of com mercial work is handled by smaller independent agencies, such as Voigts & Fields, Inc., a mid‐Manhattan firm with about 400 actor‐clients, 50 of whom are under exclusive contract, for which they re ceive the tender‐loving‐care reserved for highly profitable talent. “Actually,” said Richard C. Voigts, who runs the agency with Marje Fields, “many actors never even consider doing commercials until some agency approaches them. Mari and I visit the theaters and clubs almost every night, looking for new faces, new talent.” The reward for those who would rather switch and be rich can be substantial. The half‐dozen top people in the field earn between $250,000 and $500,000 annually for appearing in as many as 400 commercials. The average take for a good performer is in the neighborhood of $50, 000. Very few of the top people are marquee names. For a single good commer cial, actors can earn up to $20,000 in one year although the average brings in be tween $750 and $2,000. Strangely, actors generally earn more by doing voice over bits than by appearing on‐camera. The reason is that they can do many more commercials. A major fear of sponsors and commerical acto1s is that the talent's face will become too familiar, or too identified with particular product. One of the top names in the voice‐over field is Joe Sirola, an actor who has had only moderate success on the stage and in films, but who is one of the hot test names on Madison Ave nue because of his raspy, baritone voice. He appeared in 400 commercials last year, among them Scope mouth wash, Vicks Formula 44 and Super Shell. Pear‐Shaped Tones Passe “Sponsors are looking to day for voices with an edge to them,” explained Miss Fields. “Edginess catches your ear, makes you pay at tention. Commercials today are more subtle, more so phisticated, and an actor's voice must have character if he is to grab, the audience. The announcers with the pear‐shaped tones of yester day are as out of fashion as are the faces of most models.” Among the well‐known actors who have specialized in voice‐over for commercials are Alexander Scourby, Geof frey Holder, Nancy Walker, Joel Grey, George Grizzard, Henry Morgan, Barbara Barrie, David Wayne, Arthur Kennedy and, most recently, Orson Welles, for Eastern Air Lines. “Faces also must be dif ferent,” said Mr. Voigts. “Alice Playten has been around for quite a while as an established actress, but her fatty bride role in the Alka‐Seltzer spot has made her famous and a sequel is being planned.” Miss Playten, who recent ly joined the cast of “The Last Sweet Days of Isaac,” was welcomed to the com pany with an ad in The Times that read: “Welcome Alice Playten, our Alka‐Seltzer dumpling.” Henry Fonda, who is in Oregon filming “Sometimes a Great Notion,” a logging story starring Paul Newman, said he took the commercial for the GAF Corporation (maker of photographic, building and other products) after years of turning down similar offers because “the money is out of sight and it offered a possibility for good exposure.” When GAF came up with a soft‐sell script,” the actor said, “I took it. Actors need exposure and I think good exposure in a commercial is better than bad exposure in a film or play. And, as I said, the money is out of sight.” Welles Declines Comment Mr. Welles, reached in Los Angeles, declined to com ment on his voice‐over an onymity for Eastern Air Lines. “I don't care to comment,” he said. “I have nothing to hide, but since I don't ap pear in my own persona just feel comment would be inappropriate.” “We have to be business men and diplomats,” Mr. Voigts said about the agency business. Our biggest prob lem? Discovering that our client hasn't appeared for morning audition or filming session. The rest of it is wrestling with the personal problems of actors.” Miss Fields was asked if she ever handles child actors. “Not if I can help it,” she said. The Mary Ellen White Agency and the Dorothy Lohman Agency are among the four or five top agencies that take children and love the experience. Tom Burke, who manages the White agency's New York office, said that the days when stage mothers were a major headache are gone. Most child actors have four good years, with the best years from 6 to 8. Other good years are those of infancy, between 10 and 11 and between 16 and 18. A few stay in as young adults until they're 25. Because there are fewer commercials for children, a very good year for a child actor might bring him about $20,000, although the average is considerably less. Like the adults, child actors these days are usually chosen for their special quality, rather than for mere good looks. Pretty Faces Shunned “We're looking for regular, All‐American kids, not pretty faces,” Mr. Burke said. Miss Lohman, who has 22 years in the child's talent agency business agrees, but also sees a growing demand for youngsters who look a little different. “Today the sponsors are looking for kids who look Italian, or Greek, or Jewish. That didn't happen even a few years ago.” Agencies specializing in black actors for commercials are feeling another type of competition. In a sense, they are the victims of racial prog ress. For years they struggled as marginal purveyors of black talent for a few choice openings. Then, in the last four years, the demand for black faces on TV ads in creased by more than 75 per cent. The regular agencies began to take on black talent as soon as it appeared. Elaina Brooks, president of the American Model Agency, one of the major black agencies, expressed concern over white agencies siphoning off talent devel oped by black agencies, but added cheerfully: “We're still known as ‘the ethnic agency.’ When some one wants a Greek, an Indian or an Eskimo—anything ethnic—and doesn't know where to find him, they call Elaina. And I know how to yell real loud.”

15-> Gentleness in Handling Urged For Young Owners of Puppies
FOR the new dog owner, few words of warning. Young children should be supervised when it comes to the pet, who probably was a Christmas gift. The youngsters may not be old enough to understand the difference between a live dog and toy. Rough play, squeezing or dropping the pup can cause injury. As for the older dog, a finger in the eye is likely to cause snap ping or biting. There is a temptation for everyone in the family to pick up the dog or to romp with him. Too much exercise will ex haust the pet. A bed should be provided in a quiet, draft free corner, where he can sleep undisturbed. As to housetraining, a pup should be confined, ex cept when someone can keep an eye on him. He won't get in the habit of relieving himself on the rugs and will learn control faster. He should be taken out after meals, play or immediately when he awakes. Since he eats more meals than an adult dog, the pup requires more frequent opportunities to go out. The owners should try to work out a feeding schedule that will synchro nize with the time the pup needs for an airing. • The Gaines Dog Research Center has issued a series of resolutions for the New Year. (¶Keep the dog in the best of health. If over 5 years old, have him given annual check ups. At all times and any age, ask a veterinarian to supervise his good health as well as physical problems. ¶Use preventive medicine” at home, with proper nutri tion from complete and bal anced foods; skin and coat care; periodic teeth cleaning and nail clipping. ¶Develop the dog's per sonality and intelligence by loving attention combined with fair, consistent disci pline. ¶Realistically look at the pet's faults and yours, as a dog owner. Is the young pup destructive? Is the big dog becoming too hard to handle. Obedience training may be the answer. ¶Let the dog have plenty of exercise but not running loose, this isn't freedom for him but almost guarantees trouble. • The Providence Kennel Club will hold its 73d match show at the Cranston Street Armory today. C. Seaver Smith Jr., a well‐known breeder of Great Pyrenees, will select the best in match. Trophies are being offered by Senator John O. Pastore, Senator Claiborne Pell and Governor Frank Licht. • Salt and other chemicals used to melt snow can be harmful to a dog when he walks in the snow, the Amer ican Society for the Preven tion of Cruelty to Animals warns. The chemical may irritate his feet, and to re lieve the pain, the dog may lick his paws and swallow the chemical, which could make him sick. Toprotect him from the toxic effects of the chemical, the A.S.P.C.A. urges the owner to wipe the dog's feet after every walk in the snow. Larry Downey, after 35 years as a handler, showed his last dog as a professional at Cleveland on Dec. 14, tak ing the working group top award with Mrs. G. M. Cowie's boxer, Ch. Salgray's Ovation. During his long career, Downey handled about 60 dogs to best‐in show awards.

16-> Agreement Ends One‐Day Bronx Hospital Strike
A tentative contract agree ment between the Ein stein Medical College of Ye shiva University and the Drug and Hospital Union last night ended a one‐day work stoppage by union members at the col lege and Lincoln Hospital and the Municipal Hospitals Center in the Bronx. A raise of S30 a week, or 23 per cent, is indicated. A spokesman for the City Health and Hospital Corpora tion announced, after a meet ing in the corporation's office that representatives of the medical school had decided “to settle with the union.” The spokesman said that the trustees of the college had studied the new S28‐million contract under which the col lege runs the hospitals for the city and had found ways of meeting union wage demands. Yesterday's work stoppage by more than 1,600 clerical workers and laboratory tech nicians hardly affected patients. except that admissions were halted by the hospitals. The union did not establish picket lines, so that members of other unions worked as usual. Moe Foner, executive secre tary of Local 1199 of the union, said last night: “There is a basic understanding, and the medical college has agreed to the package that formed our contract, signed last week, with the League of Voluntary Hospitals. $30‐a‐Week Raise Due This contract, covering 15, 1000 union members, provided for pay increases over two years of $30 a week or 25 per cent, whichever was greater for each employe. Wages now average $150. Mr. Foner added that there were still some “local” issues to be discussed but that no difficulty was expected. Union members will meet at 9 A.M. today to ratify the accord in the medical college auditorium. and then presumably they will return to their jobs, Mr. Foner said. The medical college's $28 million hospital contract with the city, signed June 30, is an increase of $3‐million over last year and is designed to cover increased labor costs according to the City Health and Hospital Corporation. Mr. Foner estimated that the con tract would add less than $1.5 million to the total labor cost of the medical college in the first year. A spokesman for the college said that it and the corporation had agreed to a “continuing review” of the existing contrac tual and financial arrangements involving both hospitals, “to in sure both quality in patient care and adequacy of the services rendered.”

17-> In Capital, Humor of Will Rogers
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16— The President's Box ac Ford's Theater was empty. But most of the orchestra seats were full of Congressmen at the opening last night of “Will Rogers, U.S.A.” Wisecracks about politics (“I came to the capital to the national joke factory to see what our hired help is doing”) brought down the house—of Representatives. “We asked lots of Con gressmen to the opening be cause we knew they'd get the jokes,” said Mrs. Don Hewitt, president of the Ford's Theater Society. Representative Carl Albert of Oklahoma, the majority leader, and Mrs. Albert were hosts with the society at a reception honoring Will Rog ers Jr., son of the late hu morist, and James Whitmore, the star of the one‐man show. After the show, guests drank Scotch and such, and nibbled on tiny stuffed toma toes and Roquefort‐filled pas try puffs while wandering past the cases of memorabilia in the Lincoln Museum un derneath the theater auditor ium. Mr. Whitmore, shaking hands around, said, “Almost everyone I've met has told me they're from Oklahoma, and they knew Will Rogers.” Mr. Whitmore and Bryan Sterling, the associate pro ducer who did the research for the project, heard from the guests about favorite Will Rogers quips left out of the show. “I don't mean to criticize,” said Representative John N. Happy Camp of Waukomis, Okla., “but I wish you'd put in about the time that Will Rogers won his bet that he could make Calvin Coolidge laugh. When they were intro duced, Will said, ‘I didn't catch the name.’ “ Representative Albert said he met Will Rogers three times “And he never remem bered me any of them. The first time I met him was when I won an oratorical contest when I was a fresh man in college. He put my name in his column in The New York Times.” Mrs. Fred R. Harris, wife of the Oklahoma Senator and an Indian herself, said Mr. Whitmore told her after the show that he had seen her poking her escort in the ribs. “I was so delighted with the line about Will Rogers going to Alaska to warn the Eskimos about the Govern ment and its treaties,” said Mrs. Harris. Her escort was an Alaskan State Senator, Willie Hensley. Mr. Hensley, an Eskimo, is here to talk to the Congress about the Indian water claims. Senator Harris missed the perform ance, but made the party. Mrs. Harris added: “Con gressman Ed Edmondson is on that committee studying the claims. I was glad he heard that speech of Will Rogers about the Govern ment's promising the Indians the land as long as grass grows and water flows— they're moving them to land where grass couldn't grow and water didn't flow.” Representative Edmondson of Muskogee, Okla., said a relative of Will Rogers, David Bushyhead, had run against him in his first campaign. “And then there was another Oklahoman who wasn't even related to Will Rogers who won because his name was Will Rogers.” Will Rogers, Jr., agreed with everyone that it was a fine show. People kept ask ing him why he didn't run again for Congress after serving one term as a Rep resentative from California. “Not me. Not again,” he said, and changed the subject. Secretary of the Interior and Mrs. Walter J. Hickel came. His department admin isters the theater and the museum. Mr. Hickel wore crocheted evening shirt with a striped white and black tie. Mrs. William Cafritz, a member of the Ford's The ater Society, whose full and flaming red hair makes her look spectacular whatever she wears, wore a multicolored midiskirt and dark blouse by Chester Weinberg. Most skirt lengths, except the mini mini, were represented.

18-> Theater: Slice of the Past
LONDON—If any find the classic theater a pain then the English have an undeni able genius for making pains. In New York play restaged after 20 or ?? years tends to have the all of revival about it;. in London even after little more than a decade a new staging begins to take on the gleaming patina of a classic. It is an agreeable, and even useful, habit. The English dote on old plays rather as they dote on old buildings—not slavishly, but with a shrewd eye for their esthetic comforts and economic advantages. Two exquisite examples of the British penchant for in stant classicism are on view in the West End, and both are to be commended to the visitor. The first is W. Somer set Maugham's “Lady Freder ick” at the Vaudeville Thea ter (it soon moves to the Duke of York's Theater) and Noel Coward's “Blithe Spir it” at the Globe. The historic course of the English comedy of manners from the Restoration and Sheridan to Joe Orton is a social history as well as the theatrical one. Just as for years tragedies had to tell of the fall of kings, so were comedies devoted to the up per class. They were, how ever, written by the upper middle class. In this special sense. “Lady Frederick” represents the last of a line. Maugham was the inheritor of Wilde and, I sup pose, Pinero. “Lady Freder ick was his first successful literary work, originally pro duced in 1907. It was just in time. Although Frederick Lonsdale soldiered on, such views of the leisured classes became impracticable after World War I. The play is one of those Edwardian contraptions con cerning a fascinating woman whose reputation might be more subject to improve ment than her beauty. It has repartee and villains, and no one is vulgar enough to work except the comic servants, who enter waving their forelocks in favor of a class system where everyone knows his place. The play's motive force is money rather than sex. Lady Frederick, who is about to go bankrupt, has a suite at the best hotel in Monte Car o, a new carriage, admirers galore, including a black mailing millionaire, an iras cible admiral, a youthful and calflike doting earl, and a former beau devoted to the arts of folly and cynicism as ways of life. Lady Frederick soon re veals herself as a lady of the utmost probity—it is inter esting, this unspoken insight that only the virtuous can afford vices—and eventually gets the man she loves. For tunately he can pay off her mortgages. This is the perfect vehicle for one of those favored all star cast treatments admired by the English theater—and, to be honest, for good rea son. For success they need ideally a movie star of the 40's—a name that is still a household word in precisely those households affluent enough to buy tickets. A few TV personalities help to get the thing going, and other actors assume such roles as have been overlooked by the star‐billing of the stars. “Lady Frederick” has it all. To start with it has as its star Margaret Lockwood. Now apart from connoisseurs of the more arcane of late night movies, Miss Lock wood's name may mean little to Americans. However, dur ing the 40's she was the glam orous wicked lady of Brit ish films. Her looks have changed very little, she is still unusually handsome— but now she can act. Pre sumably she always could, but those old cinematic sagas never required her to do more than cast an eye or heave a bosom. She is supported by a fine company, led by Tony Brit ton as the fading yet still charming rake, who manages to speak Maugham's lines as though they were epigrams, and supported by Malcolm Farquhar's stylish staging. Coward's “Blithe Spirit” is of the all but immediate past. Yet it has come up well— there are few funnier com edies in London. Once more there is former British movie star, this time Phyllis Cal vert, as one of the leads, and the cast is again a Strong one. Here memories—of either the first stage production or the later movie—intrude, and Amanda Reiss, lightly sultry as she is, is no match for the memory of Kay Ham mond as the ghostly Elvira, while Beryl Reid is not a me dium of Margaret Ruther ford's effortless class. Yet this play of a man haunted by first one and then two wives retains its charms and humors.

19-> 'Une Simple Histoire'
Marcel Hanoun belongs to that diminishing company of French directors (including Jacques Rozier, Roger Leenhardt, Alexandre Astruc, and until very recently, Eric Rohmer) whose work is known to American movie lovers by reputation, but whose films are rarely, or even never, seen here. Hanoun, who is 40 years old, has been making feature movies for 13 years, and of these, "Une Simple Histoire," which played last night at the New York Film Festival, is the earliest.Hanoun made "Une Simple Histoire" in 1958, but it looks more like 1938, with its dark, low-contrast photography (it was shot in 16-mm.), its unglamorous realism, and its heroine with her penciled eyebrows and her unstylishly bobbed hair. The heroine (Micheline Bezançon, the only player given credit in the program, although there are several other important roles) is a poor youngish woman who, with her little daughter, comes to Paris looking for a job. She doesn't get a job, and when, eventually, she can't afford a place to sleep she spends a night out of doors. She is discovered by a kindly older woman who takes her in (this is where the movie actually begins), and in whose apartment, in one extended flashback, she tells her story.The telling of the story, the young woman's narrative, is imposed on the action in such a way as to deny each scene any ordinary dramatic interest and instead to substitute a counterpointing between the description (which is very flat) and the actual realization (also very flat—and with dialogue subdued beneath the narrative voice). At first this method seems pregnant with understated tension, but in time you come to realize that nothing more is happening than appears to be happening, and the method begins to seem silly. And at a certain not exceptional moment, when the young woman, very disconsolate, stands by a tunnel and says: "I found a tunnel—a place where cars went in. They came out a bit further on."—at that moment I began to find the simple story rather silly, too.There is an overwhelming temptation to compare Hanoun with Robert Bresson, whose work "Une Simple Histoire" greatly resembles. But Bresson, for all the spare severity of his style, has never professed to tell a simple story, and (for example, in "Mouchette" and "Une Femme Douce") has often tended to make more complex the fictions upon which he bases his films.Hanoun's simplicity—like his almost stationary camera (which is just stationary enough to make for some very fancy corner-of-the-frame interior shots that might have been centered), like his depressed view of Paris, like his leading lady's eyebrows—seems finally less a matter artistic asceticism than of artful calculation. And in the midst of the many deprivations that constitute his style there is a kind of pretentiousness — ostentationsness, really — as if he were taking pride in poverty. The CastUNE SIMPLE HISTOIRE, directed by Marcel Hanoun; screenplay (French with English subtitles) by Mr. Hanoun, based on a true incident; photography by Mr. Hanoun; music by Vivaldi and Cimarosa; distributed in the United States by New Yorker Films.

21-> 207 ABORTIONS DONE IN CITY'S HOSPITALS
New York City's municipal hospitals reported yesterday that during the first week that the new abortion law has been in effect 207 pregnancies had been terminated. A spokesman for the new Health and Hospitals Corpora tion said that 13 of the 15 hospitals in the municipal sys tem reported 57 such opera tions were performed on Tues day. This is below the 100 a day planned for the city hos pitals. The municipal hospitals have registered 2,111 women seeking abortions under the liberalized law. Statistics for private institu tions were unavailable, but number have scheduled 10 op erations a day. A spokesman for Park East Hospital reported that “close to 40” abortions were performed there yester day. Upstate, at least 100 abor tions have been performed, in cluding 30 at the Albany Medi cal Center, about 25 in Buffalo and 14 at Strong Memorial Hos pital in Rochester. Spokesmen for Planned Par enthood agencies in Albany and Syracuse reported receiving be tween 20 and 50 inquiries day, up to half of them from out of state, asking for infor mation on the new law.

22-> On L.I., Planning Is Showing Results
HE relentless march of suburban growth toward the tip of Long Island is arousing new interest in comprehensive planning in communities long suspicious of professional planning guidance. The aim is to tend off the worst consequences ?? unplanned development as they have emerged in Nassau County and western Suffolk, and there is some confidence on the part of county officials that this can be done. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Nassau Suffolk Regional Planning Board, points to cluster development in Brookhaven and East Hampton, and the planning of a 10,000‐acre new town in Brook haven, as hopeful signs. And County Executive H. Lee Dennison, an ardent planning advocate, voices optimism. “The towns have been waking up,” he said. In a shopping center on Jericho Turnpike in Com mack, two residents spoke of some of the very quali ties of unplanned suburban development that the planners hope to avoid. “I'm in my car all the time chauffering the children around,” said Mrs. Robert Marceau. “And it seems though the only place you meet people is when you're shopping, and you have to drive for everything.” “There's hardly anything for the children to do,” Mrs. Phyllis Phillips said. “There's an ice‐skating rink, and that's all. Commack turned down a swimming pool for the school. And there is just no sense community. These laments reflect some of the interrelated ills of runaway, haphazard growth in postwar suburbia— commercial sprawl, a lack of balance between resi dential, commercial, industrial and recreational land use, overcrowded schools, improperly located public facilities, a squandering of natural assets of the en vironment, and a society lacking the spice of variety. If many of these characteristics are present in Com mack, they are conspicuously absent in neighboring Hauppauge (pronounced HOW‐pog) where a compre hensive plan was adopted 10 years ago and, far more unusual, has been implemented with a high degree of fidelity in the years since. Each of the 10 towns of Suffolk County, the eastern most Long Island county, is actually a regional politi cal entity governing a large number of unincorporated communities that usually correlate with school dis tricts. Sometimes these communities incorporate, tak ing over various town functions, but for the most part they remain unincorporated and under town jurisdic tion while developing a community character center ing in the schools. In Hauppauge—part in Smithtown and part in Islip —civic activity in the fifties focused on an effort avoid the unstructured growth evident to the west. In Commack, for instance, “development by subdivi sion” was proceeding apace, and has now reached its logical conclusion: one‐family houses on quarter acre lots saturate the community; industry, with its tax‐base support, is insignificant; haphazard commer cial development is strewn along the main highway, and the “community center” is a shopping plaza. The terrain in Hauppauge is rolling and wooded, and in this respect its development potential ex ceeded that of Commack, which had largely been farmland. But in other respects, such as general income level and the selling price of housing, the com munities are similar. In contrast not only to Commack but also to many others of its suburbanized neighbors, Hauppauge has a balanced mix of residential, commercial, industrial and recreational land. Residen tial zoning along Veterans Highway has preserved the scenic quality of that major route. Commerce has been concentrated in a single area. Six hundred acres have been set aside as county park land, and 115 acres for town parks. These goals were set forth in a plan drafted by Mr. Koppelman as a Hauppauge civic leader and adopted in 1960. A few years later the plan was updated with the aid of a broad spectrum of civic groups in Hauppauge and finally incorporated as a whole into the bylaws of Smithtown. Islip as a rule was cooperative also. “Too often,” County Exec utive Dennison said the other day, “plans got mislaid, for gotten or revised.” In Haup pauge a community ‐ wide Planning and Zoning Council was formed to stand as a united community front on zoning requests submitted to the Islip and Smithtown boards, and thus insure that the land‐use aspects of the plan were observed. “We never believed you should go to a zoning hear ing with a lot of women and babies,” Harold Haar, a school teacher and civic activist ob served. “We'd always send two or three well‐informed individuals and try to per su??e the board with logic.” This worked better in Smithtown than in Islip, he said, because of another ele ment helpful to a logical case —political weight. Haup pauge's population is about 18 per cent of Smithtown's but only 5 per cent of Islip's. In the plan, Hauppauge also provided comfortably for its future tax base by set ting aside 15 per cent of its undeveloped land for indus try. It also adopted relatively high, if diverse, residential zoning requirements‐25 per cent in one‐acre zones, 27 per cent in half‐acre, 10 per cent in one–third‐acre and 9 per cent in quarter‐acre—that some would contend stressed single family development toe exclusively. In what proved to be some thing of a financial coup, the plan provided for the advance acquisition of school sites, 10 in all. The average cost per acre then was $3,000. Commack, which had to ac quire school land as needed, has found itself paying $15, 000 to $25,000 an acre. The long‐term Impact on the tax rate of industry of advance acquisition of school sites, and of the choice of sites in places where school bus use could be minimized has turned out to be drama tic. In Hauppauge the school tax rate is $11.867 per $100 of assessed valuation; in Corn mack it is $15.221. This means that on similar houses purchased, for example, for $20,000 and assessed at $5.000, the annual school tax rate for a Hauppauge resi dent would be about $590 and a Commack resident $760. The expectation is that as time goes on this tax gap will widen. The tax factor is highly important in molding com munity attitudes. In Haup pauge voters approved a $9‐ million high school with a swimming pool. But Com mack voters rejected a pool in recent years, and twice last year defeated a proposal for a new secondary school. Commack also rejected the first school budget offered last year. In the one it finally passed, educational services were cut and school buses reduced so that there is no busing for third to sixth graders living under a mile from school, seventh and eighth graders under a mile and a half, or ninth to twelfth graders under two miles. All of which means a lot‐ more chauffeuring for mothers. For Suffolk as a whole, it is clear that successful plan ning cannot proceed on a local level alone. Individual towns already have or are preparing plans, and the county is at work on a com prehensive plan that will soon be previewed before the new county legislative body. Mr. Dennison's aim for Suffolk in the decade is self sufficiency (“I want employ ment here for everybody who lives here—I'm sick of fid dling with the Long Island Rail Road”), and he advo cates a coordinated transpor tation system, conservation of the shorefront and water resources and rational land use policies. As for Mr. Koppelman, he says that areas still unaf fected by major growth— Brookhaven and towns far ther east—have the opportun ity to plan in a total sense be fore growth is thrust upon them. “The basic problem is governmental determination,” he said. “It is encouraging that the eastern communities are beginning to move in this direction.”

23-> New Medal Is Awarded to Wheeler
WASHINGTON, July 9 (UPI) — President Nixon today awarded a newly created military honor, to be known as the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, to Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, who has retired as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Nixon said that General Wheeler “has been known as a soldier and is proud to be known as a soldier, but I know him as a statesman as well.” The general served six years, a record, as head of the Joint Chiefs. The new medal is to be awarded to a military officer who performs “exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility with the office of the Secretary of Defense, the organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a specified or unified command, a defense agency or such other joint activity as may be designated by the Secre tary of Defense.” The medal will be the third highest military honor, after the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Crosses. It will be one grade higher than the Distinguished Serv ice Medals of the armed forces.

24-> Most of the Presidents from Washington to Monroe sat for him
Peale—Charles Willson Peale, to distinguish him amidst that early Am erican dynasty of painting Peales is one of those artists so locked into history that it hardly seems relevant to discuss him in purely artistic terms. That, certainly, is the tack that his biographer, Charles Coleman Sellers, a Peale descendant and au thor of an earlier two‐volume bio graphy of the subject, has taken in his present study. It is a long book, providing not only a thorough and detailed account of Peale's life and lively artistic ad ventures, but encompassing a whole age in American life — the American Revolution (in which Peale served as a resourceful lieutenant), the estab lishment of the American Government (he was a disappointed office‐seeker for the post of Postmaster General in Washington's Administration), the growth of American commerce and industry (both of which engaged him in activities as varied as itinerant portrait painter and textile‐mill own er)—and a broad range of national figures, including the American Presidents from Washington to Monroe, most of whom sat for Peale. Their likenesses were enshrined in the por trait gallery of eminent men that formed part of the project closest to his heart, the Peale Museum in Phila delphia. Mr. Sellers's book, although long, is as long and eventful as Peale's long and eventful life requires. Peale was born in 1741 and died, reluctant ly, at the age of 86. Until the very end he was full of expectations and plans for the future; in search of fourth wife (he had already buried three loving women), hoping for the nationalization of his museum as public institution. If not expecting the full 200‐year life span he had previously thought a man might achieve by sensible diet, regular activity, judicious morals and proper frame of mind, he was still looking forward to at least another quarter‐century of industrious life. As a writer, Sellers has several vir tues; a fine, old‐fashioned, leisurely style, a wonderful sense of the social life of the period, and a gift for in cisive character vignettes that pro vides the reader with a gallery of crisp portraits, ranging from the thor oughly punctual George Washington through each of Peale's wives and prospective wives—including the ad mirable Miss Stansbury, the 54‐year‐ old teacher of deaf and dumb chil dren who, in order to dissuade her 85‐year‐old suitor, pleaded “spasmod ic affections” which would, she was sure, soon carry her off, her father having died of the same complaint. (Miss Stansbury did accept Peale's offer of a new set of porcelain teeth, but felt obliged to turn down his proposal of lessons in both the arts of painting and making false teeth because she lacked sufficient “genius” for such pursuits. In the meantime, she was prepared — hastily, one gathers—to give Mr. Peale the name of another, perhaps more willing lady.) In essence, Sellers's book is a biog raphy of the irrepressible Peale clan: sons, daughters, grandchildren, in laws and close friends. It is full to the brim with births, marriages, great national events, business successes and failures, illnesses, marvelous recoveries and, in the nature of things, deaths. Since the Peales were an incurably busy and gregar ious lot, with fingers in every pie, they have provided the material for one of the liveliest histories of early American society that I have yet had the pleasure of reading. Like one of Peale's group portraits, the book brings its subject marvelously to life. Peale was, indeed, an exemplary if not a great painter. In any collec tion of early American art, his paint ings are among the first to catch one's eye with their freshness and clarity. But equally often, it turns out to be a picture by one of his sons—Rembrandt, Raphaelle, Titian, Rubens—whose names Peale sought out in the “Gentleman's and Con noisseur's Dictionary of Painters.” The entire family, daughters and nieces alike, took to painting with re markable proficiency. And when one of them successfuly engaged Wash ington to sit for a portrait, a host of Peales — including brother James, the miniaturist — arrived to take advantage of the opportunity and the profit to be had from the then‐brisk trade in Washington memorabilia. So vivid was the image of the Peales stationed around the long‐suffering father of our country that rival paint er Gilbert Stuart felt it necessary to warn Martha Washington that her husband was in danger of being “Pealed all around.” Peale was a man of many talents. He was a skilled naturalist and taxi demist, a sometime poet, a perennial inventor who devised a portable steam‐bath and a patented wooden bridge, a part‐time farmer who de veloped a milk wagon with a non spill milk tub derived from the prin ciples of the mariner's compass, an occasional dentist and doctor (with his unorthodox remedies, he managed to pull family and friends through several sieges of the dreaded yellow fever; his prescription for cold was a fast run uphill with mouth agape). He was also an archeologist: he conducted the first organized sci entific expedition in the country, ex cavating the skeleton of a mastodon in upstate New York and then mount ing the bones as a feature attraction for his museum, where it was con sidered the “ninth wonder of the world.” A product of the literature of the Enlightenment (Pope, Jean‐Jacques Rousseau), Peale was a firm believer in Nature as the great teacher. That was the purpose—aside from his dis creet taste for showmanship and his ambition for making money — behind his incredible museum. That was the motivation for his cases of stuffed birds and mammals (the freaks, like his six‐footed cow and two headed calf, were set aside for those who might be interested in such abnormal ities) and for his well‐tended zoo of bears, elks, rattlesnakes and eagles. It was even the reason for the embalmed trigger‐finger of the mur derer Broliman. Broliman had decid ed, one day, to commit suicide by getting himself hanged for mur der. Determined to kill the first likely victim, he passed up his industrious landlord, the friendly doctor who had greeted him on the street, and the pretty girl he had also passed—beauty being its own excuse for living. In stead he stepped into the nearest bil liard room and shot one of the idlers at the pool table. Great moral lessons, Peale deduced from even this some what ambiguous example, were to be discovered in the world around us. His museum, like his career, would embody them—stuffed and embalmed if need be. At an advanced age, he sat down to write his autobiography, mounting his personal experience, the good and the bad, as if they were choice speci mens from the moral order of things, capable of instructing future genera tions. And when he came to die, with the children not quite having lived up to his expectations —Raph aelle, dead from too much drink, Rembrandt and Titian having proved troublesome about the management of his museum—he still believed; op timistically, in the natural perfecta bility of man. ■

25-> 35‐CITY TV NETWORK IS PLANNED BY G.E.
The General Electric Com pany previewed yesterday via closed‐circuit television in Chi cago, Detroit and the Hotel Biltmore here the forerunner of a permanent, closed‐circuit cus tom color TV network. G. E. spokesmen said the new service, called the Command Perform ance Network, will be avail able for use in 21 cities next Oct. 1. It will be expanded in 1971 to 35 cities. Network the will be sold to users in blocks of one hour or more with a basic cost of $35,000, including origination facilities with tape equipment and crews and the 21 meeting rooms and operating personnel. Spokesmen said they felt the new service would be especially attractive for annual stock holder meetings, business con ferences and educational and other gatherings. It was also suggested that companies spe cializing in closed‐circuit tele casts of various sports events might be clients. The initial network will in clude facilities in Atlanta, Bos ton, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleve land, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Jacksonville, Los An geles, Memphis, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Francisco, Seattle, Syracuse, Washington and New York City.

26-> Study Links Car Size and Risk of Injury
WASHINGTON, March 17 (AP)—Atito buyers who choose small, low‐priced cars for econ omy reasons run a higher risk of death or serious injury in a collision, a Senate subcommit tee was told today. That conclusion, based on a University of North Carolina study listing auto models ex periencing the highest and low est death and injury rates, was presented after Under Secretary of Transportation James M. Beggs testified that the Govern ment could not produce such information now. The university reported that riders in Volkswagen buses were killed or seriously injured at a rate more than twice the average, in the 270,697 cars studied. A death and serious‐injury rate just half the average was suffered by riders in 1968 standard and large Pontiacs, 1967 large Buicks and 1966 large Oldsmobiles, according to B. J. Campbell, director of the university's Highway Safety Re search Center. General Motors manufac tured 12 of the 14 models cred ited in Mr. Campbell's report with having injury death rates “significantly lower than aver age” and five of the 15 models showing “injury rates signifi cantly higher than average.” Regarding the high number of G.M. products in both cate gories, Mr. Campbell said. “There are simply more Gen eral. Motor cars on the road and any sample tends to reflect this fact.” Other makes had safety trends similar to those for G.M., Mr. Campbell said, “but the trends for these several other makes were not based on large enough samples to be specifical ly significant.” “Larger cars are associated with lower incidence of serious or fatal driver injury and small er cars with greater incidence,” Mr. Campbell told the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Sub committee. He emphasized that the report dealt only with in juries resulting from accidents and did not deal with automo bile makes as a factor in the cause of a crash. Dr. Robert Brenner, deputy director of the National High way Safety Bureau in the De partment of Transportation, called Mr. Campbell's report “a tremendous contribution to the body of knowledge on the sub ject.” A spokesman for Volkswagen of America said the company would comment on the North Carolina report after seeing a copy of it. He noted, however, that in the Volkswagen bus the driver sits at the extreme front of the vehicle and said that the irijury rate was probably com parable to that of other vehicles with this feature. Other companies could not be reached for comment.

29-> Ford Asks Douglas's Ouster
WASHINGTON, April 15— The House Republican leader, Gerald R. Ford, touched off an angry floor debate tonight by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had tics with gambling and underworld figures. Declaring that Justice Doug las “is unfit and should be re moved,” he told the House: “I would vote to impeach him right now.” Angered by the far‐ranging accusations, one Democratic liberal, Andrew Jacobs Jr. of Indiana, marched to the well and dropped into the hopper resolution calling for impeach ment of the 71‐year‐old Justice. Mr. Jacobs's move was in part tongue‐in‐cheek. But he was also attempting to frustrate bipartisan efforts, supported by Mr. Ford, to investigate whether there were ample grounds for impeachment of Justice Doug las. A resolution creating a special House committee to investi gate the Justice and report within 90 days will be intro duced tomorrow by a group of 40 to 60 Republicans and Southern Democrats. Liberal Democrats charge that the sponsors want to use the investigation for “headline,” without running the risk of baying an outright impeach ment resolution blocked by Emanuel Celler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Celler, to whose commit tee any impeachment resolution would be sent, joined 40 other House Democratic liberals to night in protesting the proposed investigation as “an attack on he integerity and the indepen dence of the United States Su preme Court.” Principal sponsors of the res olution are Louis C. Wyman, Republican, a former Attorney General of New Hampshire and one‐time chairman of the American Bar Association's committee on jurisprudence, and Joe D. Waggonner, Demo crat of Louisiana. Mr. Wyman told the House tonight that he, too, would favor immediate impeachment of Justice Douglas but felt that other members should decide for themselves on the basis of a bipartisan investigation. The Wyman‐Waggonner res olution is expected to go to the House Rules Committee. It was uncertain tonight if it would ever emerge for floor action. As Mr. Ford began speaking, just at dusk, a large number of House members were in their seats, although some of the 325 members who had an swered a quorum call minutes earlier had drifted away. For more than two hours, Mr. Ford detailed findings of what he described as a study he “quietly undertook” nearly year ago. He accused Justice Douglas of writing for pornographic magazines, of espousing “hip pie‐yippie style revolution” in his writings and of ties with Albert Parvin, owner of Las Vegas Gambling enterprises, and possible links with some of Mr. Parvin's underworld as sociates. As he spoke, some members pored through copies of Ever green Review, a magazine con taining both a Douglas article on rebellion and a layout that Mr. Ford described as “hard core pornography.” Justice Douglas declined com ment today on Mr. Ford's ac cusations, other than to say that he had no knowledge of inclusion of his latest book “Points of Rebellion” in Ever green Review. He said that the book's publisher, Random House, had sole and exclusive rights over post‐publication of excerpts. Both Mr. Ford and a White House spokesman denied that the Nixon Administration was involved in any way in the move against Justice Douglas. However Mr. Ford said ear lier this week that when he first suggested impeachment proceedings against Justice Douglas last fall, he had dis cussed the matter with Clark R. Mollenhoff, a special coun sel to the President and a for mer investigative reporter. Today, Ronald L. Ziegler, press secretary to President Nixon, said that Mr Mollen hoff was not involved in Mr. Ford's investigation, and that Justice Douglas's tax records were not among those being examined by Mr. Mollenhoff. Mr. Ziegler also denied in volvement by others in the White House or the Justice De partment. Asked if the President had taken a position on the pos sible impeachment move, Mr. Ziegler replied: “There is no involvement and no con centration on this matter from the White House.” He said that Vice President Agnew was speaking on his own when he suggested several matter ago that the Douglas matter should at least be ex amined. The move for possible im peachment follows Senate re jection last week of Judge G. Harrold Carswell of Florida, the second consecutive Supreme Court nominee of President Nixon to be denied confirma tion. It was during Senate debate last fall over confirmation of Judge Clement F. Havns worth Jr., of South Carolina, who also was rejected, that Mr. Ford first suggested im peachment of Justice Douglas. In renewing his impeach ment call today, Mr. Ford sug gested that the Justice might have sought to “shock and out rage us” by writing for porno graphic magazines and espous ing far‐left causes to divert attention from possible ties “with some of the most un savory and notorious elements in American society.” Mr. Ford accused Justice Douglas of having been a “well paid moonlighter” for the Al bert Parvin Foundation “whose ties to the international gam bling fraternity have never been sufficiently explored.” Justice Douglas helped to set up the Parvin Foundation in 1960 and later became its paid president, receiving $12,000 a year plus expenses. He resigned the post last year. Mr. Ford charged that Mr. Parvin had long been connected with underworld figures, such as the late Bugsy Siegel and William Israel Alderman. Mr. Ford also sought to link Justice Douglas with Robert G. Baker, a former Senate aide later convicted of theft, fraud and tax evasion as a result of accusations first made in 1963. Mr. Ford said that in 1962, Baker's bill at a Las Vegas hotel had been picked up by Edward Levinson, a Parvin associate. He said that a nota tion on the registration card stated that Baker was with Justice Douglas.

30-> A Policeman's First Reaction Was ‘I Hope Nobody Got Hurt’
“I disbelieved it at first,” said a sergeant at the desk in the 18th Precinct station, at 306 West 54th Street. A Tactical Patrol Force po liceman on duty at 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, said: “My first reaction? I said, ‘I hope nobody got hurt.’” A rookie pounding his beat outside the gaudy bars at Eighth Avenue and 48th Street, said: It's typical— they're after the Establish ment, and you can't stop them.” The reactions of policemen to the bombing of their head quarters varied in the midtown area at about 10 P.M. yester day. Some described their ini tial emotion as one of shock. Some were hypercautious and declined to be interviewed. All appeared calm. None expressed outrage. Most of the men in the precincts and on the streets were still awaiting details, even though it was three hours after the bombing occurred. “How many were hurt?’ they asked. “Was there much dam age?” At the 18th Precinct station, Lieut. Paul Maltby, 14 years on the force, was taking it calmly. “Officially, I haven't been notified yet,” he said. Then he added: “I guess you kind of expect something like this to happen sooner or later.” Sgt. Joseph Benson walked up to the desk beside the lieu tenant. “Would you say your atti tude is one of philosophical ac ceptance, sergeant?” a reporter asked. “Acceptance? Why should you accept a thing like this— why?” he responded. “Because we live in a permissive society and people go around doing things like this?” “Are you angry then?” the reporter persisted. “Anger?” he said. “Anger doesn't get you anywhere.” Sergeant Benson paused. “Per haps a little disgust,” he added. Ordinarily the 18th Precinct has three men on duty guard ing the station—“one man in side, two men outside, around the clock seven days a week,” said Patrolman Warren Neal, who was pulling an outside tour last night. Usually the out side man walks around the building about five times in an hour. But last night? “It's been double that,” Pa trolman Neal said. “We've got a lot of gasoline stored in the back there, and there are motor scotters and other equipment that could be damaged.” The precinct wasn't taking any chances. “There are some sick people in this world,” Patrolman Neat said, “I have no idea what they're trying to prove.” At the 20th Precinct station on 68th Street off Broadway, two lieutenants maintained a tight‐lipped calm. They declined to comment. But in a squad room, Sgt. Harvey Perlstein said: “I think it's a terrible thing that we've got to live an age of violence.” Patrolman Phil Pincus, seated next to him, said with a shrug: “I'm surprised it didn't happen before.”

37-> Survey Praises and Criticizes Broadcast Journalism
Broadcast journalists in the United States were applauded for their saturation coverage of sweeping national and interna tional events during the 1969 1970 broadcast year, but chas tised for often reacting with timidity to outside criticisms such as those offered by Vice President Agnew. These judgments of electronic reporting were made in the sec ond annual Alfred I. duPont Columbia University Survey of Broadcast Journalism, “Year of Challenge, Year of Crisis,” re leased yesterday by the Colum bia School of Journalism. The survey is issued ‘annually in conjunction with the duPont Columbia Awards in Broadcast Journalism. Television and radio journal ists during the period from July 1, 1969 to June 30, 1970 were “brilliant” in reporting man as an astronaut and as a polluter of his environment; and, at its best, TV journalism was “deep ly humane, told by men in creasingly able and willing to penetrate the subtleties of life in America in the last half of the 20th century.” On the other band, the sur vey found, Vice President Ag new's criticisms of television's “instant analyses,” and of what he called the “concentration” of power “in the hands of a tiny, enclosed fraternity of pri vileged men” in broadcasting, had “placed in the hands of broadcasting cynics and cow ards a formidable excuse for not covering the crises that most thinking Americans ack nowledged the country faced.” The survey found that al though the Vice President “sen sitized America as it never had been before to the enormous importance of electronic news, this awareness was linked in too many minds to a denial of the industry's most impres sive accomplishment, the awak ening of Americans to the so cial and political issues of the day.” The report is the result of a year of research in news and public affairs broadcast ing, supervised by the graduate School of Journalism at Co lumbia. Sixty correspondents across the country and a board of six jurors, led by Elie Abel, dean of the Journalism School, collected and judged the ma terial. The report was edited’ by Marvin Barrett, director of the duPont‐Columbia program.1 The jurors, besides Mr. Abel,’ were Michael Arlen, critic; Richard T. Baker, professor of journalism at Columbia; Ed ward W. Barrett, former dean of the Columbia Journalism School; Marya Mannes, critic, and Sig Mickelson, former president of News for the Columbia Broadcasting System. The survey noted that “at its most devastating, broadcast journalism was at its most hopeful.” The report discusses Presi dent Nixon's use of television; the broad question of television as an influence in political cam paigning; several alleged Gov ernmental attempts at intimida tion of TV; whether reporters, should be forced to divulge sources of their information; the efforts of the networks in the broadcasting of Earth Day; and broadcasting of consumer information. Kenneth A. Cox, former Fed eral Communications Commis sioner, contributed a section implying that attacks on the F.C.C. are not, only coming from the public, but from the executive branch of Govern ment. The survey .notes that “network shows devoted exclu sively to the black predicament were fewer this year.” In summation, the survey found that “reporting skills and resources had grown impres sively, particularly on the local level,” yet it posed several crit ical questions to broadcasters. “Why did the networks with their enormous wealth and skill so frequently let a less af fluent associate outstrip thein? Why, when they did something admirable, did they so often give it low visibility, limit its circulation, or place it in direct competition with the principal ornament of a rival's schedule? “Why, with essential pro graming fighting for air time, was the schedule left open to projects which — although su perficially innocuous—could be justly described in the useful parlance of pornography‐as ‘t0 tally without redeeming social value?’ “Why did so many.local sta tions with towering incomes plow so little of them back into activities that would serve the public? ... Why, finally, when ever broadcasting sustained heavy criticisms or saw a pos sible decline in revenues, was its first response to threaten to lobotomize itself—to cut off what it did best (broadcast journalism) and what was most vital to American society?” On Dec. 16 the duPont‐Co luinbia awards will be made to Mr. Cox; to Frederic Wiseman at National Educational Televi sion; to John Laurence at C.B.S. News; to Fred Freed and the National Broadcasting Com pany; and to stations WCCO TV, Minneapolis, and WOOD TV, Grand Rapids, Mich., for their programing. Clay T. Whitehead, director of the new Office of Telecom munications Policy at the White House will make his first ma jor address at the award cere monies.

41-> In Mediterranean, a Delicate Balance
ABOARD U.S.S. SPRING FIELD, in the Mediterranean, Dec. 17—The continued west ward movement of Soviet naval power has brought to the Medi terranean what Atlantic alli ance planners view as a pre carious naval balance. Ten to 12 Soviet submarines are reported deployed in this inland sea, with the western most Soviet submarine anchor age in international waters off the Spanish island of Alborán. At the moment, the total So viet naval force in the Mediter ranean is reported to be down to 41 ships, compared with a high of 73 in October. This re duction, according to United States sources, reflects a with drawal into the Black Sea for servicing during the winter months. However, this naval force, commanded by Vice Admiral V. N. Leonenkov, is expected to have more than 60 ships again next spring. The United States Sixth Fleet, with the guided ‐ missile light cruiser Springfield as flagship, now comprises between 35 and 40 vessels. It includes two air craft carriers, at present the John F. Kennedy and the Inde pendence. In view of the strong Soviet presence in the Mediterranean, Vice Adm. Isaac Kidd Jr., the Sixth Fleet's Commander in Chief, has commented that the United States is walking. “the tightrope” of adequacy in the area. In an emergency, it is as sumed, the fleet would have to rely more on allied navies in the Mediterranean—British, Ital ian, Greek and Turkish—than was the case before the arrival of the Russians. Part of the Soviet move westward is the construction of a major naval base at Mersa Matruh, 155 miles west of Alexandria in the United Arab Republic. Submarines on station there, 135 miles east of the Strait of Gibraltar and 40 miles north of the Moroccan coast, are in a position to keep watch on the movement, of Western ships into the Mediterranean. Since 1967, Mersa Matruh has had a Soviet air base, through which squadrons of the Egyptian Air Force have been rotated for training by Russian instructors. The harbor is now being deepened to ac commodate vessels of the So viet squadron in the Mediter ranean. The Soviet squadron has three established bases in the Mediterranean's eastern basin— Alexandria and Port Said in Egypt and Latakia in Syria. In addition, its ships have access to port facilities in Al giers and, it is believed, at Bone in Algeria. But its submarines and surface ships also use an chorages in international waters off Greece's Kythera Island, in the Sicilian Channel between Sicily and Tunisia, and in the Gulf of. Hammamet off Tunisia's east coast. The Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean are diesel‐pow erect attack craft. Some are equipped with missile tubes that could fire short‐range and medium‐range ballistic missiles in the event of war. The Soviet squadron's surface ships usually include a Kresta class guided‐missile cruiser. Either of Russia's two anti submarine cruisers, Moskva and Leningrad, is customarily on station. From their flat after decks each can send off 20 helicopters for antisubmarine attacks. The Soviet naval force also includes Kynda class guided missile ships and a number, of destroyers armed for antiair craft and antisubmarine opera tions. As for the Sixth Fleet, its major strategic element is an attack carrier strike force con sisting of the two carriers with their attendant cruisers, frigates and destroyers. The fleet also has a landing team of 1,800 marines, tanks, artillery, guns and trucks, all transported by a group of am phibious ships. Another part of the fleet is a task force consisting of the attack submarines in the Medi terranean. Thee lone American ballistic missile submarine in the Mediterranean constitutes a separate task force.

43-> Murder, Family Style
SAMUEL GOLDWYN JR. is deter mined to make crime pay. “Cotton Comes to Harlem,” the young pro ducer's cops and robbers comedy, will open soon, and now he has an nounced his plan to film “The Bloody Benders,” Robert H. Adleman's not‐so comic book about an actual murder case, which Stein and Day will publish May 29. “'The Bloody Benders' dramatizes the careers of the notorious Benders, a fami ly that opened an inn in Kansas around 1870 and, during the next three years, proceeded to rob and murder more than 15 unsuspecting, prosperous guests,” said Goldwyn. The gory tale is told through the eyes of the young suitor of Kate Bender, the 20‐year‐old beauty who led her father, mother and brother on this shocking spree. It just goes to show you that even then kids were out to shake up the over‐thirties set. Burton's back and Taylor's still got him. Richard Burton, a loser—but not sore one — in the recent Academy Awards race, will play a slippery C.I.A. agent in the movie version of Charles Collingwood's novel “The Defector,” and the much‐bejeweled Mrs. Burton will be seen in the part of a hard‐working femme fatale. Actually, both roles are on the smallish side. Gregory Peck will star as an American correspondent whc persuades a North Vietnamese leader to defect. Perhaps the biggest Burton news of all is that the actor will also direct “The Defector.” And write the screen play. And co‐produce with Peck. And anyone who saw him on stage in “Came lot” shouldn't be surprised if he decides to warble the title tune, as well. Jack Smight, the director who treated us to “No Way to Treat a Lady,” bizarre adventure‐comedy about a mar who dashes about murdering women is about to start work on a movie deal ing with a different, but equally offbeat kind of ladykiller. Smight has been assigned by M‐G‐IV to direct “Cabot Wright Begins,” hasec on James Purdy's 1964 novel. The here of this very modern comedy is de scribed by Smight as a man capable o “solving the problems of ecology, war: and economic depressions—a man whc has been a model husband and stocl broker.” He is also a man who wind: up in the clink for having assaultec approximately 300 women. Wait till Women's Liberation hear: about this Renaissance Man. Monte Hellman is about to surface Who's Monte Hellman, you ask? He's the director of “The Shooting” am “Ride in the Whirlwind,” two meld dramas that have enjoyed enormous un derground success. Jack Nicholson co starred in both films with Millie Perkins and he wrote the screenplay for “Whirl wind.” Now Hellman is set to direct “Two Lane Blacktop” for the ultra‐above ground Cinema Center Films. Michae Loughlin will produce Rudolf Wurlitzer's original script. What's it all about's Three crazy‐for‐kicks autn racers and one girl. Easy does it, riders.

44-> Times Mirror to Get Control of Newsday
LOS ANGELES, April 15— The Times Mirror Company, which owns The Los Angeles Times, announced today that it would purchase a controlling interest in Newsday, the pros perous Long Island paper pub lished in Garden City. The company, the nation's third largest publishing con glomerate, will buy the 51 per cent of Newsday stock owned by Harry F. Guggenheim, who is 79 years old and ailing. The proposed sale has been fiercely opposed by many of Newsday's employes and the paper's minority stockholders, who own 49 per cent of the stock. Some have said that the sale would severely hamper Newsday's independence. Roth Mr. Guggenheim and Franklin P. Murphy, chairman of the board of Times Mirror, sought to quiet those fears to day. In a statement issued here, Mr. Guggenheim said that by selling his interest, “I believe will assure the complete inde pendence of Newsday and that all Long Islanders will con tinue to have a newspaper of which they can be proud.” In New York today, the six minority stockholders issued a statement that said: “As heirs and trustees of the late Alicia Paterson, the archi tect of Newsday's greatness, we are glad that the Times Mirror Company has committed itself to continue the same tradition of journalistic inde pendence Newsday has always followed. “We intend, as minority stockholders, to cooperate with the Times Mirror in carrying out its peldges to maintain Newsday's independence, and to participate with the em ployes of the paper in serving Long Island.” The statement was signed by Joseph P. Albright, Blandina Albright, Adam M. Albright, Dorothy J. Holdsworth and Mrs. James F. Hoge Jr. All are heirs of Mr. Guggen heim's late wife, Alicia Patter son. Mrs. Hoge is the wife ofi the editor of The Chicago Sun Times, and Joseph Albright is, the chief of Newsday's Wash ington bureau. Miss Patterson, who was the daughter of Joseph Patterson, the founder of the New York Daily News, started Newsday in 1940 with Mr. Guggenheim. Dr. Murphy, a former chan cellor of the University of Cali fornia campus here, said: “We are indeed fortunate that Mr. Guggenheim has entrusted to The Times Mirror Company the responsibility for carrying on the great independent tradition of. Newsday, one of the finest newspaper organizations in this country.” The terms of the sale were not announced, pending prepa ration of a final agreement, but it has been speculated that The Times Mirror had originally been prepared to offer about $75‐million for all the stock, but only $33.15 million for Mr. Guggenheim's 51 per cent, Which would make the total price about $65‐million. The Offer for the remaining 49 per cent is open until June 1. The Sale must also be ratified by The Times Mirror board. Newsday has grown steadily over the last 30 years and now lias a daily circulation of 440, 000, the largest of any suburban paper in the country. Drawing heavily on the tremendous growth of suburban shopping centers for its advertising, the paper regularly publishes 160 pages a day. There has been talk that un der the Times Mirror, Newsday would move into the lucrative New York City market, which now has only one afternoon paper, The New York Post. A spokesman for Times Mirror would not comment on those reports. Another unanswered question today was the fate of Bill D. Moyers, the publisher of News day, who is a former aide to President Johnson. Mr. Moyers has said that he will work only for a newspaper he considers “genuinely independent.” Newsday employes have also been concerned about the poli tics of the Times Mirror com pany and its principal owners, the Chandler family. Norman Chandler, chairman of the executive committee of the Times Mirror Company, for many years exerted a strongly conservative influence over the company and its principal prod uct, The Los Angeles Times. But in 1960, Mr. Chandler turned over considerable con trol to his son, Otis, who be came publisher of The Times. Otis Chandler, who is also vice chairman of Times Mirror, has slowly moved The Times to a more middle‐of‐the‐road posi tion. For instance, several weeks ago the paper called for the defeat of Senator George Mur phy, a hero to California con servatives, after it was re vealed that Mr. Murphy had been serving as a consultant to Technicolor, Inc. Last spring the paper en dorsed Thomas Bradley, a Negro city councilman, in the Los Angeles mayoral race against Samuel W. Yorty. The paper has supported Mayor Yorty, an other leading conservative, in many of his earlier campaigns. The sale of Newsday comes at a time when a number of Government agencies and offi cials, including the Federal Communications Commission and Vice President Agnew, have voiced concern about the in creasing concentration of own ership of the nation's news media. Times Mirror has been one of the most vigorous companies in the publishing field. In addi tion to The Los Angeles Times, which has a daily circulation of 970,000, the company owns the New American Library, World Publishing, smaller com panics that produce medical, law and art books, a commer cial printing company, and a large forest products operation. It also owns an interest in a cable television company, Only Time Inc, and McGraw‐Hill are larger than the Times Mirror Company in the publishing field. In addition, Times Mirror an nounced recently its intention to purchase The Dallas Times Herald and the paper's televi sion station in Dallas, KRLD. That transaction is subject to the approval of the Federal Communications Commission. Almost no one looked up as the executive editor of News day threaded his way, through the city room with a sheet of white paper in his hand just before 5 P.M. yesterday, and even after he tacked it onto the bulletin board, he had to stop at a few desks and tell people to go and have a look. The paper had been sold. The sale of the afternoon suburban paper was no sur prise to its employes, but they clustered around the rear‐wall bulletin board to read the of ficial announcement, addressed “To the Employes of Newsday” and signed by Ernest Levy, vice president and associate pub lisher. There were perhaps 30 peo ple in the cluttered city room, and David Laventhol, the ex ecutive editor, called them around the rectangle of plastic topped desks that form the news desk. He read the an nouncement, his listeners gen erally silent except for a single snort of laughter when Mr. Lav enthol read Mr. Guggenheim's statement of belief that the Bile would “assure the complete in dependence of Newsday.” While many on the staff felt that, as one said, “it could be worse,” meaning that the paper might have been sold to a chain that would insist on tight cen tralized control, the mood of the city room after the an nouncement yesterday was de scribed as glum. “There's no great wailing and gnashing of teeth,” said one reporter, “but there is no joy in Newsday tonight.”

45-> Pro‐Business Hands Shape Regulatory Policy
WASHINGTON — When President Nixon was elected a little more than a year ago, one of the changes in the Government that business men generally hoped for was in its attitudes and policies toward business itself. The hopes or the business community have, in general, been realized, particularly in those areas where the Gov ernment directly regulates ousiness conduct. Perhaps the one exception has been antitrust policy, where the new and otherwise generally conservative Attor ney General, John N. Mitchell, has given what appears to be unwavering support to the vigorous, even innovative, en forcement policies of his As sistant Attorney General, Richard W. McLaren. Elsewhere, however, the signs of Republican pro‐busi ness hands shaping policies are plain. At the Federal Power Com mission, for example, new attitudes prevail toward both the natural gas and electric power industries. The former is finding the commission, under its Republican chair man, John N. Nassikas, high ly receptive to the argument that substantial increases in rates are needed if the indus try is to earn sufficient prof its to provide incentives for exploration for new gas de posits. And the electric power in dustry is encountering a willingness to let it attempt to resolve, on its own, the inherent and difficult con flicts between the nation's growing needs for electrical power and the environmental considerations that can slow the meeting of those needs. Since Mr. Nassikas took over the Power Commission, most of its major decisions have been unanimous. The commission had a preponder ance of conservative commis sioners in the final years under its former Democratic chairman, Lee C. White, but Mr. Nassikas has put an end to the delays that Mr. White was able to impose on doing the things industry wanted. The Securities and Ex change Commission is an other regulatory agency where the transformation to Republican domination has been complete—and marked —in the first year of the Nixon Administration. There, President Nixon's choice as chairman, Hamer H. Budge, a former member of the com mission, has continued the major regulatory projects that were under way when he took over. There has, how ever, been a noticeable slackening of the pace, which may have been dictated more by the mass exodus of experi enced staff members follow ing Mr. Nixon's election than by any major policy changes on the part of the new chair man. A couple of recent develop ments at the S.E.C. raise some questions for the fu ture, however. The first is the simple fact that hard‐core enforcement activities against fraud seem to have relaxed, perhaps because of the loss of manpower. The key piece of evidence for this is the commission's decision, in the now‐famous case that led in to the office of the Speaker of the House of Representa tives, to lift a stock suspen sion before its original com plaints had been fully satis fied. On the other hand, Chair man Budge suddenly seemed to show a backbone of steel in the case of the mutual fund industry, when he re newed his request for addi tional regulatory authority after negotiations for a scheme of self‐regulation broke down. Among the other regula tory agencies, the situation of the Federal Trade Commis sion is the most interesting. Mr. Nixon's new chairman, the California lawyer and politician, Caspar Weinberg er, is just starting on the job. His instructions from the President will presumably be to revitalize the agency along the lines suggested by the special study that was under taken by a commission named by the American Bar Associa. tion at Mr. Nixon's request. That would mean greater em phasis on protection of con sumers at the retail level, and in the urban ghettos, in par ticular. Mr. Weinberger moved in to a commission that is bit terly divided, full of personal feuds, low morale, and ques tionable competence. What to do with the traditional antitrust activities of the trade commission—a matter over which it shares jurisdic tion with the Justice Depart ment—is one of the key deci cions Mr. Weinberger will have to niake. Meanwhile, the word con tinues to circulate in political circles in the capital that Mr. McLaren, the Justice Depart ment's antitrust chief, is the subject of unending com plaints by businessmen who say that his antitrust suits— particularly those attacking traditional business practices such as reciprocity—are no proper response to their cam paign contributions. The complaints heard earlier last year that he was filing suits only against corporations run by Democrats (as many of the big conglomerates are) have largely disappeared. Mr. McLaren himself says only that he decided at the outset that he would not stay on the job unless he had all the support he felt he needed from topside—and that he hasn't quit yet, “and I ain't contemplating it.”

46-> MOBS IN JORDAN SACK U.S. OFFICES
AMMAN, Jordan, April 15— Nearly 1,000 students, led by uniformed Palestinian com mandos, set fire today to the United States Information Cen ter here and another mob stormed into the United States Embassy compound. The rioters tore the Ameri can flag from the embassy flagpole, hoisted the flag of Palestine, smashed windows, burned four embassy cars and destroyed office equipment. American officials estimated the damage at $100,000. The mob carried placards with such slogans as “Sisco Go Home” and “The Commandos Will Never Surrender.” The main purpose appeared to be to protest the visit here of Joseph J. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. He is due from Israel Friday and is ex pected to seek Jordanian ap proval of proposals for a politi cal settlement of the Arab Israeli dispute. King Hussein sent a message this evening to Ambassador Harrison M. Symmes expres sing regret and apologies for the attack. No Americans were hurt but three Jordanians were reported injured. One of them was struck when a submachine gun was accidentally fired. The Embassy Is only a few blocks from the offices of Ai Fatah, the major Palestinian commando group, and As Sai qa, a Syria‐backed guerrilla or ganization. Students who participated in the attack said that the dem onstrators had been provoked by American personnel at the embassy who were taking pic tures of the demonstrators. This was denied by an American spokesman. Meanwhile, the second mob stormed the I2‐story building at Jebel Amman that contains the offices of the United States Information Service. It set fire to two stories, burning some private Jordanian offices as well as the American facilities. No commando group has het officially claimed to have or ganized the demonstration, but the “Unified Commond,” which comprises 10 major guerrilla organizations, has condemned the Sisco visit. In a statement here, the Unified Command charged that the visit “is part of a conspiracy to enforce sub missive solutions on the Arabs and liquidate the Palestinian Revolution.” Last night, Al Fatah radio, broadcasting from Cairo, said that the “Sisco mission should be countered by revolutionary violence.” Palestinian commandos have rejected the United Nations Se curity Council resolution of Nov. 22, 1967, calling for peaceful settlement of the Mid dle East impasse. The comman does call for dismantling the state of Israel and for replacing it by a secular state in Palestine in which Moslems, Christians and Jews can live together. Special to The New York Times JERUSALEM, April 15—Mr. Sisco ended his first full day of talks with Israeli leaders to night during his tour of Middle Eastern capitals, which may have to be altered drastically as a result of the demonstra tions today in Amman. The decision on going to Amman will be made tomorrow after officials in Washington assess the situation in Jordan. Mr. Sisco has been dodging questions here and, apparent ly, in Cairo. He has said that the is seeking first‐hand im pressions of the Arab‐Israeli conflict and intends to do lot of listening. Meager reports from some of the sessions that he has had so far indicate, however, that he has been speaking as much as he has been listening. Both sides have been explaining their perspective positions at some length. Mr. Sisco met with Foreign Minister Abba Eban and his aides for nearly two hours this morning and with Defense Min ister Moshe Dayan later in the day.

47-> Exodus Seen as Threat to the System on Eve of Integration Move
JACKSON, Miss., Jan. 4—On the eve of widespread class room desegregation, a mass ex odus of white students to pri vate schools is posing a serious threat to Mississippi's public education system. “What we're going to wind up with eventually,” a state leg islator said here today, “is pri vate schools for the white kids and a state‐subsidized system for the niggers.” The increased emphasis on private schools results from or ders of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir cuit, implementing a Supreme Court ruling, requiring that 222 schools in 30 districts be inte grated by last Saturday. The deadline's effect will be felt to morrow, when pupils return from the Christmas‐New Year holiday. Tensions in many of the dis tricts are great. Because of this, those who were willing to discuss integration problems asked that they not be iden tified. Local and state officials, including Gov. John Bell Williams and the Mississippi School Su perintendent, Garvis Johnston, have made public appeals to white parents, asking them to cooperate in the transition from generations of segregation to a unitary school system. But the private school business is booming and will probably im prove in the coming months. Confronted with Federal court orders for immediate integra tion in every public school in the state, thousands of white parents are making a final at tempt to avoid integration by enrolling their children in seg regated and privately operated institutions. Some of schools recently or dered by the Supreme Court to integrate immediately “may have nothing but Negro stu dents,” a lawyer for the De partment of Justice speculated last week. Many local educa tors and other officials agree with this view. Here in Jackson, whose sys tern was not part of the Su preme Court decision of Oct. 29 that erased “all deliberate speed” from compliance with the desegregation ruling, en rollment in private schools operated by the White Citizens' Council exploded last month from slightly less than 500 stu dents to substantially more than 3,000. In Amite County, one of the districts ordered to integrate immediately, nearly all of the 900 white students at one school have registered, in a newly founded private school or in an older but similar insti tution in nearby Louisiana. In Hattiesburg, an organiza tion called Citizens for Local I Control of Education is organ izing a boycott of the public schools in Forrest County when they open on Wednesday and promoting enrollment in the private school, which is com pletely filled, according to a spokesman, and “overenrolled” with about 1,000 students. The Governor's appeal for an absence of violence has been quietly joined by leaders of the state's business community, who have started a campaign of phone calls and letters to civic and business figures in various communities, warning that violence will bring eco nomic ruin to Mississippi's commerce and industry. “We're pretty well convinced that there won't be any vio lence,” a prominent Jackson banker said today. “Everybody's hurt by violence, including the banks. And besides, the private schools are solving that prob lem.” His opinion is shared by many others who believe that white parents are choosing the private schools as an alterna tive to violence. But law enforcement agen cies and officers are not so confident. Federal marshals and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be on hand tomorrow when nine of the dis tricts begin their second semes ter, and the Mississippi High way Patrol will be on alert in those areas. Schools in Kemper, Madison, Noxubee, Wilkinson, Lawrence, Marion, Quitman and Enter prise Counties ;sill open to morrow, as well as those in the consolidated system in North Pike and South Pike Counties. Schools in four other dis tricts begin Wednesday, in two others on Thursday and in three others on Friday. Schools in the remaining districts are scheduled to open next week. According to some sources, there are private schools al ready in operation or about to begin classes in all of the counties included in the Su preme Court decision. But nowhere in the state has the impact of resistance been greater than in nearby Can ton, Miss., where Negro stu dents outnumber white students by nearly 3 to 1 and more than 93 per cent of the 1,300 white students have enrolled in a private school. For the last week, parents and students have been saw ing, hammering and cleaning in an old factory once used to produce tents and now destined to serve as classrooms for more than 1,000 young white stu dents. The white people of Canton, a teacher there said, “have de cided that the battle with the Federal Government is over and that there is nothing left to do but either let their kids go to school with the coloreds or pay tuition to keep them apart.” readily available to all white citizens in the state who oppose integration. Many of them are poor and they “probably will just keep their kids out of school,” the teacher said. “They can't afford whatever it costs to put them in a pri vate one.” Since the Legislature, which convenes here Tuesday, has already repealed the compul sory school attendance law— a requisite for closing public schools to avoid desegregation —the parents who keep their children out of school will not be pressed by the authorities and truancy laws. “These are the folks I'm worried about,” said the teach er. “They have no alternative except no school or integrated school—and they're just the ones who might start trouble.”

48-> 68 MISSING IN ALPS AFTER AVALANCHE
SAINT ‐ GERVAIS, France, Thursday, April 16—Sixty‐eight persons — nearly all of them children — were missing today after an avalanche engulfed three buildings of a tuberculosis sanitarium near this French Alpine center, the police said. The police said that six in jured had been pulled out of the wreckage of the three build ings struck by the avalanche of snow. The avalanche crashed down shortly after midnight as about 60 children were sleeping in two of the buildings for tuber cular patients, the police said. The other building held about 10 staff members. The sanitarium is in the village of Passy, a short distance from Saint‐Gervais, which is about 35 miles southeast of Geneva, Switzerland. Cries of Trapped Heard The cries of people trapped in the snow were heard as policemen, firemen, mountain rescue experts and volunteers dug into the snow. The three buildings were an nexes of a sanitarium called the Rocfiz. They were up to four stories high, with large balconies and windows to take advantage of the sun. The road to the area was closed to all traffic except am bulances taking the injured to hospitals. The avalanche recalled the disaster on Feb. 10 at the French ski resort of Val d'Isere in which 42 persons were killed.

50-> DOW LOSES 5.34, CLOSES AT 780.56
The stock market continued its losing ways yesterday with only a slight afternoon recov ery taking some of the sting out of an earlier broad de cline. Price declines on the New York Stock Exchange led ad vances by a 3‐to‐1 ratio at the close. The final tally of 1,023 losers against 319 winners was one of the broadest setbacks of the year. This indicator has been on the losing side for 11 of the last 12 trading sessions. Stocks that posted new lows for the year rose to 253, the highest level yet for the 1970 figures, from 175 on Monday while new highs slipped to 15 from 18 a day earlier. The Dow‐Jones industrial av erage was down more than nine points in the second hour of the session, but worked its way up to a closing figure of 780.56, down 5.34 points. The slide put the average back where it was before the late March rally that followed cuts in the prime lend ing rates of major banks. The Big Board's composite index, the broadest measure of price performance, slipped 0.39 point, to 48.07, which put it only 0.53 point above the year's low of 47.54 on Jan. 30. The New York Times com bined average closed at 451.42, down 3.51 points. Trading volume rose to 10.84 million shares from 8.81 mil lion on Monday, with the bulk of the increase occurring in the first three hours of the session, when prices were at their low est levels of the day. The only period in which activity trailed the day‐earlier pace was the final hour, when prices were showing a slight improvement. Factors that contributed to the slide included the deterior ating technical condition of the market itself, the expected drain on equity and debt funds from the huge American Tele phone and Telegraph Company financing, today's deadline for 1969 income tax returns and lackluster first‐quarter earnings reports from some major cor porations. The troubles encountered by the Apollo 13 moon flight, abruptly reversing its earl ier success, was another psy chological depressant for trad ers. Actively traded issues fared somewhat better than the rest of the list, but nine of the 15 most‐active stocks closed with losses, compared with six that rose. And the losers were down more than the winners were up. A. T. & T., whose record financing is a dominant con sideration in the current market was the second most‐active stock with trades of 174,400 shares against 207,800 shares on Monday, when the utility announced the terms of its debenture and warrant offer ing to stockholders. The stock, which was trading without rights for new buyers to sub scribe to the offering, closed at 50⅜, down ⅝, afte moving in a range of 49¾ to 50⅝. The rights can be bought in the open market and they clos yesterday at 43‐64, down 2‐64 for the day, on trades of 2, 138,000 rights. Telephone war rants, whicr, like the ights are trading on a when‐issued basis, closed at 12⅜, down ½, on turnover of 244, 0 war rants. Each warrant entitles common share of Telephone at 52 between next Nov. 15 and May 15, 1975. Seaboard World Airlines topped the most‐active list with trades of 229,900 shares, most of which moved on a block of 166,200 shares at a 1970 low of 8. Shearson,Hammill handled the big block in the freight carrier's stock, which closed at 8¼, down 1¼, Three other blocks totaling 45,000 shares traded at 8¼. Other big blocks included 124,400 shares of Becton, Dick inson at a new low of 46 and 101,500 shares of American General Insurance at the day's low of 18¾. Goldman, Sachs handled both sides of the big trade in Becton, Dickinson, which closed at 46¾, down 2¾ while Bache & Co. was the broker on American General, which finished at 18⅞, down ⅛. Fairchild Camera was the largest loser on the active list, sliding 3½, to 64⅝. Sperry Rand dropped 2 points, to 30½, while Xerox dipped 1⅞, to 84⅛. Some of the weakness in Xerox was attributed to reports that International Business Ma chines is about to unveil an entry in the copying‐equipment field. Rumors about such a de velopment have been circulating for years. O.NE Wall Street broker said last week that an I.B.M. direc tor had told him the company would make an announcement on April 22. A source familiar with Xerox said it was expect ing the announcement on April 25 and would counter with an earlier announcement of some of its own developments. The reports did not help I.B.M. stock, which slipped 2¼, to 324¾. A score of other, issues also showed declines of 2 to 3 points. Among the larger losers were Mohawk Data, down 3⅛, to 50; Memorex, down 2¼, to 110¼; H. & R. Block, down 3, to 49; Bausch & Lomb, down 3, to 53, and Zurn Industries, down 3, to 24¾. An article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday said some analysts were expecting Zurn, a pollution‐control com pany, to report disappointing earnings, Westinghouse Electric was one of the few sources of strength in the blue‐chip issues. It rose 1⅝, to 68¼, on the strength of its report of an 11 per cent rise in the March quarter and a prediction of record profits for the entire year. RCA, however, fell 1⅛ to 27⅞, on its report of a 36 per cent decline in March‐quarter results. The company attributed the slide to weakness in color television sales. Other televi sion set makers that posted losses of more than a point included Motorola, Magnavox and Zenith. Other major issues that de clined a point or more included General Motors, General Elec tric, Eastman Kodak and du Pont. Procter & Gamble, which proposed a 2‐for‐1 split and raised the dividend on the pres ent stock, closed unchanged at 107.

51-> Fire Burns Police Station In Suburban Jersey Town
CAMDEN, N. J., June 9—A fire, attributed to arsonists, de stroyed the suburban Stratford police station early today. Mayor Salvatore Mansi esti mated damage to the two‐story frame building at Union and Kirkwood Avenues, at $30,000. Nearly all the records and several thousand dollars worth of police equipment were ruined. Police Chief Francis Washart said, “It looked like some sort of flammable liquid was used to start the fire,” which broke out about 5:45 A.M. Nearly 150 volunteers from Stratford, Laurel Springs and Hi‐Nella fire units brought the blaze under control about 7 A.M. They were hampered by exploiting 38‐calibur car tridges. Chief Washart said the 12‐ man police force would set up temporary headquarters in Borough Hall.

SAIGON, South Vietnam, Monday, Jan. 5 — The United States command today reported a “significant increase” in enemy activity in the northern most military region yesterday and Saturday, including three, ground attacks that saw two Americans killed and 18 wounded. The South Vietnamese Gov ernment reported that 12 Viet namese civilians were killed and 72 injured when enemy soldiers fired 35 mortar rounds into two refugee camps near Anhoa, southwest of Danang. In the Mekong Delta near Camau, an Army UH‐1 heli copter was struck by ground fire and crashed Saturday afternoon, killing all four United States crewmen aboard, according to the United State's command. The crash brought the number of American heli copters downed in the war to 1,433. The reported intensification of enemy activity in the north ernmost military region, com prising five provinces extend ing southward from the demili tarized zone and known as I Corps, follows a period of relative calm attributable most ly to the seasonable bad weath er, which is now beginning to clear. In one of the three ground at tacks reported by the command, enemy troops were said to have fired about 20 rounds of 82‐mm. mortars into the night bivouac position of troops from the 198th Brigade of the Americal Division near Quangngai. The command said the shelling, which came at 2:30 A.M., was followed with small‐arms and automatic‐weapons fire and explosive charges. The attackers were unable to penetrate the camp, the United States command said, and were beaten off by the de fenders and helicopter gunships after an hour's battle. United States casualties were put at one killed and seven wounded, five of whom were hurt seri ously enough to require evacu ation. Five enemy soldiers were reported killed in the fight. American headquarters said it did not yet have identifica tion of the enemy units, wheth er they were Vietcong or North Vietnamese. In another reported ground attack in the I Corps area, troops of a tank battalion of the First Marine Division camped for the night near Da nang were said to have been hit by about 30 rounds of 82‐mm. mortar fire followed by a ground assault. Six ma rines were reported wounded in the three‐hour battle, which ended when the enemy force withdrew. The extent of enemy, losses was unknown. The iden tity of the enemy unit was also not given by the United States command. These two reported attacks brought to five the number or assaults on United States night positions in the last week. In the three widely separated pre vious attacks 22 Americans were reported killed. One United States marine was killed and five were wounded yesterday afternoon when enemy troops opened fire near. Anhoa, the American command said. The command reported that the enemy sol diers withdrew with unknown losses after the marines re turned the fire. The command said two other American camps in the I Corps area were shelled Saturday night, resulting in some un specified light casualties but no fatalities. It reported that in Quangtri, the northernmost province, four‐hour clash erupted a mile from the Laotian border near Khesanh when United States helicopter gunships were shot at by a group of 50 to 80 North Vietnamese soldiers the heli copter crewmen had spotted. American air strikes were called in, reportedly killing 19 soldiers. No United States casualties were reported. The reported shelling of the two refugee centers, Godua, and Locquy, is one of about four such attacks since the fall. The inhabitants were moved out of villages under Vietcong con trol in order to deprive the enemy of food and support. It is thought that the Vietcong, by attacking the refugee centers, are trying to warn other vil lagers not to move away to the refugee camps. Throughout Saturday, the United States command feport ed 34 enemy shellings, 16 of which were directed against United States units or installa tions. Two Americans were re ported killed and. 12 wounded. The command did not say where the casualties occurred.

55-> LINDSAY ASSAILS NIXON ON HOUSING
WASHINGTON, June 9— Mayor Lindsay assailed the Nixon Administration's pro posed Housing Act of 1970 to day, provoking a sharp counter attack from George W. Rom ney, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In an unusual news release, Mr. Romney called the Mayor's testimony this morning before a House subcommittee “irre sponsible and inaccurate,” and added that he thought Mr. Lindsay was “doing a great disservice to the cities of the nation by so grossly misinter preting the provisions of the Administration's proposed leg islation.” Mr. Lindsay criticized the Nixon bills on the following grounds: ¶That the legislation would require public housing tenants to pay 20 per cent of their in comes under $3,500 and 25 per cent of their earnings above that “in the form of a mini mum rent,” a figure the Mayor said was too high for many families. Mr. Romney said this description of the bill was “just wrong.” ¶That the measure would create such severe limits on how much could be spent to build new public housing that the quality of new projects would stiffer, perpetuating a “double standard” of housing for the poor on the one hand, and the well‐to‐do on the other. Secretary Romney denied this, contending that cost limitations would actually rise from their present levels. ¶That the Administration bill would “freeze out” many fa milies now eligible for public housing by redefining the in come limits within which ten ants must fall. Mr. Romney would “make as many people eligible as are now eligible.” Mr. Lindsay made his re marks before the subcommittee on housing of the House Com mittee on Banking and Cur rency, which is considering the Nixon bills among others. The Mayor was flanked by two top housing officials, Albert A. Walsh, Housing and Develop ment Administrator, and Simeon Golar, chairman of the city's Housing Authority. He apparently relied for much of his analysis of the Nixon bills on Mr. Golar, who had started an attack on the legislation a month ago, calling it “an epitaph for low‐income, housing.” Mr. Lindsay's rhe toric, by comparison, was low key. He was caught in something of a policy conflict by a ques tion from Representative Wil liam B. Widnall, Republican of New Jersey, who, having heard the Mayor criticize 25 per cent as too high a portion of in come for most poor families to spend for rent, asked Mr. Lind say what maximum rent‐income ratio was contained in his pro posal to revise the city's 27‐ year‐old rent‐control law. Under the Mayor's rent‐con trol program, certain non welfare families of four or more persons would be exempt from paying rents that exceeded 25 per cent of their incomes. For three‐person families the ceiling would be 30 per cent and for households of one or two it would he 35. The differences between these rents and the rents that would be paid without such ceilings would be made up to the landlords by a combination of tax relief and higher rents for other families in their build ings. Paradoxically, Commissioner of Rent and Housing Mainte nance, Benjamin Altman, reply ing to charges from tenants in New York that the percentage ceilings were too high, justified the figures on the ground that they were the figures used by the Federal Government. Today, Mr. Lindsay passed Representative Widnall's ques tion to Mr. Walsh, who said the public housing situation dif fered from the rent‐control plan, which “does not attempt to fix the rent of these families at this level.” Secretary Romney took note of New York rent‐control sit ation, observing that “as Mayor Lindsay is discovering in his attempts to deal with the arti ficial situation caused by 27 years of rent control, there will he some pain involved in re storing good sense to the New York housing situation. He said that while Mr. Lind say had called for “substantial increases in rents in controlled private apartments,” the Mayor was opposing the Federal mea sure that “would result in rent decreases for 60 per cent of the nation's public housing tenants.” Mr. Romney was apparently referring to newly enacted Fed eral rent subsidies that would aid many residents of public housing. This was not discussed in Mr. Lindsay's testimony. The Mayor registered his strong support for a bill spon sored by Representative Thomas L. Ashley, Democrat of Ohio, and opposed by the Nixon Administration, that would create a Council on Urban Growth in the executive office of the President to help plan the de velopment of metropolitan re gions and would establish a Federal agency to finance new towns, both inside and outside city boundaries. Currently, Mr. Lindsay said, cities and suburbs are involved in “unnecessary competition” with each other. “Instead of formulating a na tional policy for metropolitan area growth,” he said, “the Fed eral Government has watched these developments with a neglectful attitude for more than 25 years. We have no na tional guidelines and no na tional policy for cooperatively shaping urban and suburban growth.” He called upon the Federal Government to develop national planning policies that would forge an alliance between the cities and the suburbs. Mr. Lindsay also praised a bill announced last week by Secretary Romney that would bar towns and cities from using zoning laws and building codes to exclude low‐income housing construction within their bor ders. He also urged Congress to ap propriate the full authorizations for various housing programs, asserting that New York's con struction was being delayed by insufficient funds. After his testimony, the Mayor was surrounded by about 35 “squatters” who have moved illegally into condemned build ings on the West Side of Man hattan, and who had come here's by bus before dawn to tell Mr. Lindsay they were being “harassed” by city officials who wanted them out of the apart ments they had taken over. Mr. Lindsay refused to talk to them, but said he would set up a meeting within the next few days.

56-> ROBINSON TO DELIVER SOME OF SECURITIES
Certain customers of Robin son & Co., a brokerage house involved in bankruptcy pro ceedings,’ will receive their holdings as a result of a ruling in Philadelphia yesterday by Thomas J. Curtin, Federal Court referee in bankruptcy for the concern. A spokesman for some of the :ustomers, whose accounts have been frozen since Sept. 1 because of the bankruptcy action, said the fully paid cash accounts of 700 to 800 persons with securities registered in their own names would be de livered under the order. It was also announced that applications would be made to free 2,000 additional accounts, mainly involving fully paid se curities held in Robinson's name rather than in the customers’ own names. These would in clude only accounts with no cash balances owed. The remaining customers of the firm, possibly several thou sand, are those having margin accounts with balances owed to Robinson. Efforts are under way to let these individuals se cure their accounts later, prob ably in 1971,

58-> Bill Easing Antitrust Curb On Newspapers Advances
WASHINGTON, June 9—The House Judiciary Committee ap proved today, 13 to 8, legisla tion that would immunize from antitrust prosecution existing agreements for joint publication of separately owned newspa pers and would permit addi tional agreements under looser standards than apply to other businesses. Such joint operations are al ready in effect in 22 cities, and one in Tucson, Ariz., has been declared illegal, under existing antitrust laws, by the Supreme Court. The legislation would permit this joint operation to continue, along with the others. The chairman of the House committee. Representa tive Emanuel Celler, Democrat of Brooklyn, did not participate in the vote. He said the bill should come before the House within a few weeks. A similar bill has passed the Senate.

60-> 2 Kennedy Cargo Handlers Indicted in $200,000 Theft
A Federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted two cargo handlers yesterday on charges of theft and possession of $200, 000 from mail sacks at Ken nedy International Airport. The pair, Steven W. O'Sul livan, 24 years old, of 87‐44 115th Street, Richmond Hill, Queens, and Walter Miranda, 19, of 870 Riverside Drive, were arraigned in Federal Court Monday after their arrest Sun day. Mr. O'Sullivan was held in lieu of $50,000 bail by Federal Judge Matthew T. Arruzzo. Mr. Miranda was released in per sonal bond of $15,000, and then immediately taken into custody as a material witness in an in vestigation being conducted by Bronx District Attorney Burton B. Roberts. Mr. Roberts is investigating the alleged disappearance of $100,000 of the money which was said to have been turned over to two patrolmen in the Morrisania Precinct station.

61-> A Shaky Balance
The jury is still out on the question of the likely pace and direction of economic activity in 1970. Pending an official verdict, my own judg ment is that the economy is moving through a period of precarious balance. Inappro priate policy actions — either monetary or fiscal — could adversely tip that balance, setting in motion a domino like chain of undesirable eco nomic events. An impressive assortment of evidence now indicates that the long‐awaited slow down in economic activity is under way: ¶Growth of real gross na tional product has slackened considerably. ¶lndustrial production has declined for four consecu tive months. ¶Personal Income has in creased only modestly in re cent months. ¶Retall sales are no higher than they were last spring. ¶Employment has shown clear signs of slower growth. These developments, and others, are producing a pat tern that would be consistent with an economic slowdown of modest proportions. At this stage, it is, of course, vir tually impossible to be certain about the nature, extent, and general direction of the slow down, unless one holds a monistic view, which I do not. Uncertainty, about the eco nomic outlook reflects, to a considerable extent, the fact that In the past year or so the economy has not behaved as many experts had expect ed it would. It also reflects, it seems to me, a general con cern that monetary and fiscal policy in the period ahead may not be matched in the most effective and desirable way. Why are these two fac tors so significant in current economic analysis? It is no secret that in 1969 the economy — particularly prices — failed to respond to monetary and fiscal restraint in terms of either expected degree or timing. Thus, seri ous inflation and strong in flationary expectations re mained matters of primary concern throughout the year. There was more latent strength in the economy as well as more optimistic ex pectations than many observ ers believed. Not until the closing months of 1969 did there appear convincing signs of moderation of economic activity, indicating that the policy of restraint was work ing. Why is it taking this long? During the second half of 1968 and through much of 1969, the public seemed to doubt that national economic policy really would do more than skirmish with inflation, a doubt that I believe is now in the process of being dis pelled. There were also mistaken expectations among the ex perts about how quickly re strictive policy actions could become effective and about the magnitude of the policy actions that might be needed. Looking back, we can see that an excessive easing of monetary policy in the sec ond half of 1968 neutralized the fiscal restraint of the in come tax surcharge. That eas ing also allowed financial in stitutions and spending sec tors to replenish liquidity, which later proved difficult to drain. As a result, spending sec tors and financial institutions we able to insulate them selves somewhat from fiscal and monetary restraint. As a case in point, in reaction to the 1968 surtax, consumers maintained spending by re ducing the percentage of in come saved in the first half of 1969 to the lowest level in five years. If I had to say in one sen tence what went wrong in the assault against inflation, I would have to blame it on good old American ingenuity, obviously misapplied. The ev idence is incontestable that the resourcefulness of busi nessmen, consumers, and fi nancial managers, coupled with earlier mistakes by pol icy decisionmakers, tended to blunt the cutting edge of tight money and fiscal re straint. With the public uncertain that the Washington inflation fighters meant business, in flationary expections remain ed virile even after signs of economic slowdown first be came visible. As a result, the rate of price increases mod erated, but only modestly. With the President's Budget Message and Economical Re port to be transmitted to the Congress in a matter of weeks, it would be inappro priate for me to spell out a detailed economic scenario for 1970. Nonetheless, some personal observations may be made without divulging any official secrets. The pace of economic ac tivity is expected to be rela tively slow in 1970, with the second half likely to be stronger than the first. This pattern implies some rise in unemployment as the year progresses and a further squeeze, during the year, on corporate profits. Within reasonable limits, these are not excessive costs if the rate of price increases moderates significantly as the year unfolds, which is the official expectation. The long er and better balanced the period of economic adjust ment, the more likely it is that there will be significant success on the price front without high costs in unem ployment. An appropriate mix of mon etary and fiscal policy is in dispensable to this type of adjustment. On the fiscal side, it is important to have at least a balanced budget in fiscal 1971. This will be a Herculean task (and a Solo mon‐like task, as well), main ly because of increasing de mands on Federal resources from a wider array of claim ants. But a balanced budget should be a primary goal in order to achieve responsible management of the nation's financial affairs. Equally im portant, it would represent sound fiscal policy.

62-> Builders Seek Air Space Over Entrance to Tunnel
The Metropolitan Transporta tion Authority is talking with developers about erecting a large office building over the Manhattan entrance to the Brooklyn‐Battery Tunnel. Confirming published reports about such a project, an M.T.A. spokesman added: “Two devel opers approached us about developing the air rights over the tunnel entrance and there have been extensive discussions but no firm commitment on construction yet.” One of the developers, it was learned, is the Uris Buildings Corporation. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, an M.T.A. subsidiary, owns the air rights over the tunnel entrance. The M.T.A. is very interested, its spokesman said, in developing air rights possibilities to bring in more revenue for its subway and transit operations.

63-> Mrs. Kinsey at 73: Some Topics Taboo
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — it's cold bright and snowy in Bloomington, and the blue jays, screaming in the sunlight, wheel through the blue sky. The tree branches are lumpy with tight buds. The crocuses are purple and yellow blossoms against the snow. According to Mrs. Alfred C. Kinsey, “It's getting to be that time of year again.” To Mrs. Kinsey, widow of the pro fessor of zoology who pioneered the study of human sexual behavior, spring Means a visit to those special places where the Hepatica, shooting stars, blue bells, dogtooth violets and Trillium grow wild. It means a renewed friendship with the birds that went South for the win ter, the return of the insects she has studied since she was 7 or 8 years old, and the joy of spending even more time out‐of‐doors. “If you ask why I am this way, cannot explain,” she said, shaking her head. “I've always loved nature. I took a bird course in college so what wanted to do on Saturday mornings was what I was supposed to do. We went on bird field trips.” At 73, Mrs. Kinsey is a vigorous and dedicated naturalist. When the temper ature is sub‐zero and her less hardy neighbors are indoors beside their fire places, she is out hiking cross‐country, grabbing for bushes to pull herself over the steep places. “We go out for a couple or hours or more once a week,” she said. “We start up about the first of October and stop toward the last of May.” Besides hiking, Mrs. Kinsey's winter days include musical events at Indiana University (her alma mater and the school where her husband taught and did his research), studying Spanish (“Last year I took ‘Don Quixote’ but I never had to sufrir los examenes”), or reading such scientific works as “Nightshades: The Paradoxical Plants” by Charles B. Heiser Jr. “The tomato, potato and eggplant be long to the nightshade family,” she ex plained. In the summer, Mrs. Kinsey teaches lifesaving and water safety, hikes at the Girl Scout camp she directs (“I always tell people I'd rather be the nature con sultant”), and tends the flower garden in the woods around the comfortable red brick house she and Dr. Kinsey built in 1927. The house centers about a living room strewn with rag rugs and rustic furni ture. Among other things, it contains wooden duck decoy, pottery lamps, potted palm tree, a picture of an Egyp tian woman, several mementos of a Mexican trip, an upright piano and the fragile nest of an indigo bunting. In no visible way does the house re flect the celebrity, notoriety or the ago nies that attended the Kinseys after 1948, the year “Sexual Behavior in the Human Male” was published. Nor will Mrs. Kinsey discuss her husband's sex ual research or what his classic works may have meant to manners and mores over the last 22 years. “My husband had three things he wouldn't discuss,” she said. “Politics, religion and what people should do sexually.” She believes people shouldn't talk about subjects they don't know very much about and that people who are authorities should stick to discussions of their specialties and not go off into miscellaneous comments on the world at large. “The publicity was hard on my hus band,” she conceded without emotion. “It wore him down. The mail poured in. Lots of reviews were unkind. “A Sunday magazine of a well‐known newspaper refused to publish an advertisement for the male book,” she con tinued. It was The New York Times. If the criticism and ridicule that met what she calls “the male book” and the later “Sexual Behavior in the Hu man Female” (1953) rankles, Mrs. Kin sey gives no Indication of it. But she did say that William H. Mas ters and Virginia E. Johnson, whose “Human Sexual Response” was pub lished in 1966, had publicly said their work would have been almost impos sible without Dr. Kinsey's earlier re search. What she does talk about, and with some enthusiasm, is her own and her husband's interest in entomology. He was the world's foremost authority on the gall wasp, a minuscule winged in sect that thrives in oak trees. “The whole family went on field trips to study the gall wasp,” she said. “One year, we took a picture of our son, Bruce, carrying bags of galls. We used it as a Christmas card.” As a child in Brookville, Ind., Mr? Kinsey stood by her grandparents' phlox garden, collecting butterflies. She kept a killing jar at the corner drugstore in case a cecropia moth happened by. And at night, she would wait for moths by the street lights. “We even advertised for caterpillars in the weekly newspaper,” she said. When it came time for college, she enrolled at Indiana University, where she majored in chemistry and took the bird courses. In her senior year, she wanted to take the insect course but was somewhat unhappy to learn that a popular professor had been replaced by a new young instructor. He was Dr. Kinsey, who had taught at Harvard. “I met him in May of my junior year and started going out with him in No vember,” she said. “We were married in June. I didn't take my trunk home or attend my own commencement.” The Kinseys' honeymoon was a two‐ week hike in the White Mountains. Af ter that came such other adventures as Colorado for gall wasps and Peru for the erotic pottery. Mrs. Kinsey also proofread parts of her husband's books. Of course, it was an interesting life,” she said as she put the finishing stitches to a tiny purple wool dress for a grand daughter's Barbie doll. “It still is.”

65-> On the Hill, ‘Responsibility’ vs. ‘Priorities’
WASHINGTON‐ — Con gress enters the new decade torn between the constraints of “fiscal responsibility” im posed by the Nixon Adminis tration and a desire to re order national priorities by spending more on domestic programs. Between those competing forces is the making of a ma jor political confrontation be tween a Republican Admin istration and a Democratic controlled Congress that re turns for its second session on Jan. 19. The political fuse igniting the confrontation may well turn out to be the fact that Congress will be meeting in an election year in which the Administration hopes to cap ture Republican control of at least the Senate. The closing weeks of the first session of the 91st Con gress undoubtedly was a pre lude to the squabbling over economic policy and the po litical posturing that lies ahead in an election year. The stage for a confronta tion was deliberately set by the Senate Democratic lead ership with a $19.7‐billion appropriations bill for the De partment of Labor and the Health, Education and Wel fare Department that provides $1.1‐billion more than re quested by the Administra tion for such domestic pro grams as education, medical training, health research and pollution control. Because of the budgetary increases, President Nixon, emphasizing the need to hold down spending in an inflationary period, threatened to veto the bill. The response of the Senate Democratic lead ers was to postpone action on the bill until the start of the new Congressional ses sion. The Senate undoubtedly will pass the overdue appro priations bill early in the new session, and the expectation is that President Nixon will veto it. With that the battle lines wlll be drawn. It is doubtful that either the House or Senate can mus ter the necessary two–thirds majority to override the veto. But even in defeat the Senate Democratic leadership be lieves it will establish the po litical point with the voters with it. To a certain extent Con gress is responsive to the Ad ministration argument that in the battle against inflation it is imperative to hold down Federal spending. But the re sponse of at least liberal and moderate Democrats who con trol the Senate is that the White House can make room for more domestic programs and still hold down spending if it will only reduce the mil itary budget. In the past session, Con gress cut nearly $6‐billion from the defense appropria tions requested by the Admin istration. But as the Admin istration points out, Congres sional actions there and in other areas added almost $3‐ billion to total Government spending in the present fiscal year. The next Congressional session undoubtedly will see a fresh assault on the de fense budget. Congress is seeking to press the Adminis tration to cut defense spend ing by proposing increases on domestic programs. With much of the. Admin istration's legislative pack age left untouched by the past session, Congress in the coming year is expected to be preoccupied with domes tic legislation. Administration legislative proposals for dealing with organized crime and sale of drugs should be approved with little difficulty. The Sen ate then probably will be come bogged down in an other civil rights filibuster over whether to extend the 1965 Voting Rights Act as wanted by the liberal moderate coalition — or to replace it with a “nation wide” law dealing with voter registration, as proposed by the Administration and ap proved last session by the house. In all likelihood the major legislative controversy in the coming session will develop over the Administration's proposal to reform the wel fare system by providing a minimum Federal payment of $1,600 a year to families on welfare and by establish ing a program of Federal standards and payments. In another welfare area, Congress, having voted a 15 per cent increase in social security, will be faced with the issue of whether to reform the basic social security sys tem. Among the proposals to be considered are an increase in the taxable wage base, an increase in the minimum pay ments, and an automatic cost of‐living adjustment of social security benefits.

66-> In the beginning there was ‘Little Bear’
The best approach to Har per's I Can Read books is to forget that they are part of a series. Parents are too often be wildered by the gaggles in this genre that waddle and honk in unison, look‐alikes that goose step down the road to the Land of Ultimate Boredom. Small children who have sud denly discovered the glory of reading will find no look‐alikes in the I Can Read books. Not since 1957, when Ilse Minarik's and Maurice Sendak's “Little Bear” came ambling over the horizon, the smiling scout for an expedition that would save an eager audience from those two horrendous bores, Dick and Jane. Ninety and nine I Can Read books have been pub lished since then. Not all of them are as delectable as “Lit tle Bear.” But all of them can march as individuals — they don't need to wear the uniform or a Series Club to hold their place in the parade. The ninety‐nine are as varied in subjects as the authors and illustrators who created them. Parents scouting for books that an early reader can read for himself, (or, more important, can reading for himself will find titles to match his child's individual enthusiasm: science titles for a young Ra chel Carson, mystery tales for a young Sherlock Holmes, stories for easy laughers.

67-> M'GRATH REPORTS DROP IN PRISONERS
The number of prisoners in local detention houses awaiting trial has dropped from 8,000 last summer to fewer than 6, 200 now, the Department of Correction reported yesterday. This was one of several im provements in the prison situa tion outlined by Correction Commissiener George F. Mc Grath yesterday as he submit ted an $85‐million budget re quest for fiscal 1971‐72. Commenting on the continu ing downward trend in the number of prisoners awaiting trial, Mr. McGrath peered over his black‐rimmed spectacles at city budget officials and said: “I just hope this isn't a flash in the pan.” Spokesmen for both civil and criminal courts at the budget hearings told of reduced backlogs of cases. The Civil Court system, chronically af flicted with delays lasting years, reported its backlog cut from 140,000 to 60,000 cases this year. The Criminal Court, which handles cases less seri ous than felonies, reported its pending caseload trimmed from over 80,000 last December to about 65,000 now. With cases moving faster in the courts and with the pros pect of new facilities in the next two or three months, Commissioner McGrath was able to give a much more op timistic report than he had just 10 months ago. He said he was especially pleased at the reduction in prisoners awaiting trial be cause an independent, survey some months ago had indicated a rise in the figure to 8,500 by now. Mr. McGrath's, proposed budget for the fiscal year start ing next July 1 is $12.5‐mil lion larger than the current one, primarily, he said, because of the cost of staffing and op erating new facilities. The new Women's House of Detention on Rikers Island, a facility with single rooms and some dormitories, but no barred cells, will open early next year. The present women's, facility in Greenwich. Village Will be come an annex for men, Mr. McGrath said, and a new wing to the Correctional Institution for Men on Rikers Island will open in March or April. Mr. McGrath said that the result would be an increase of 1,268 in capacity, bringing the city wide total up to 9,168. “With that bed capacity we will be in pretty good shape for the year,” he said. In October Mr. McGrath had estimated that even with the opening of additional facilities in 1972, the combined jail cen sus would be more than 135 per cent of rated capacity be cause of a rise in caseloads. The current figure, he said, is 119 per tent of capacity, compared with figures in ex cess of 140 per cent a few months ago, and by late 1971 he hopes to see a reduction, to 112 per cent, But the real goal, he went on, is to achieve the national average for municipal jails of just 80 per cent ca pacity. Another reason for improve ment in the chronic overcrowd ing situation in city jails is the transfer of more sentenced pris oners—currently about 2,800— to less crowded upstate state prisons. As of last Monday there were 9,500 prisoners in jail or detention here, of whom 6,178 were awaiting trial. Of the 6,178, there were 1,818 adoles cents, detained in an old build ing on, Bikers Island. In 1972 the Correction Department ex pects to complete construction of a new adolescent shelter with a capacity of 1,080. During other hearings yester day on expense budget requests for the fiscal year starting July 1 the following major points were made: ¶The Criminal Court, asking for a budget of. $22.4‐million compared with $21.9‐million in the current year, reported that citywide arrest cases had in creased 18 per cent in the first nine, months of this year com pared with the same period in 1969—from 185,000 to nearly 218,000. But the citywide back log of arrest cases awaiting dis position has been trimmed, ac cording to court figures, from more than 80,000 last December to about 65,000 now. ¶Supreme Court Justice Edward Thompson, administra for of the 120 parts of the Civil Court system, asked for a $17 million budget ($320,000 more than the current one); and reported the following reduc tion in “delay time” for civil cases: Manhattan, from 26 to 14 months; Brooklyn, 62 to 20 months; Bronx, 39 to 14 months, Queens 43 to 26 Months, and Richmond, from 12 months to tevittually no delay at all. ¶Economic Development Ad ministrator Ken Patton request ed a 9 per cent Increase in his buagett for 1971‐12, to $8.8 mil lion. The additional funds, he said, were needed for promo tion of the city as a tourist and business center and to hire 17 more specialists for the agen cy's program of developing in dustrial parks and business centers. The City University urged restoration of $28.5‐million al ready trimmed by the Budget Director from its projected $465‐million budget for fiscal 1971‐72. Deputy Chancellor Seymour C. Hyman said that the open‐enrollment plan had produced more new students than expected, and net gain of 22,000 could be expected in 1971‐72. The current budget is $328.5‐million. The city and state currently share the costs 50‐50, but the city has asked the state to as sume two‐thirds of the burden. Most of the hearings yester day were informal affairs be fore Assistant Budget Director John Lanigan in the Municipal Building.

68-> Consumers Are Wooed In Capital
WASHINGTON — Hesi tantly but with ostensible conviction, the Nioxn Admin istration has moved to iden tify itself with the viable and politically potent national force known as “consumer ism.” Consumers Are Wooed In Capital Protection of consumers' rights in the market place— preferably by voluntary ac tion but if necessary by legis lation — is now an avowed goal of the year‐old Admin istration. But this does not necessarily mean that the rights of merchants and man ufacturers are being down graded. Some of the most influen tial voices in the Administra tion are wary if not fearful of the consumer movement. They evidence a firm deter mination in high quarters to prevent any imbalance of rights in the consumer's favor. Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans, for exam ple, has asked publicly “whether we are going to let the wave of consumerism move too far and destroy the freedom of choice of consum ers and limit the competitive freedom of producers.” Mr. Stans was particularly concerned over the possibil ity of legislation setting Fed eral standards covering the performance and durability as well as the safety of con sumer products. Yet his re marks reflected a business oriented philosophy that is shared by others with consid erable influence in the Ad ministration. For 1970 and subsequent years of the Nixon Adminis tration, the likely effect will be to temper the promises of such activists as Mrs. Virginia Knauer, the President's spe cial assistant for consumer affairs, with performances more to the liking of busi nessmen. This pattern began to emerge last year as Mrs. Knauer was set back on at least three issues in deference to business and banking in terests. The setbacks involved legislation dealing with fish inspection, consumer law suits, and unsolicited credit cards. Mrs. Knauer favored con tinuous Federal inspection of all fish processing plants, with at least one inspector on full time duty. She was over ruled in White House staff conferences. The extent to which Con gress may be restrained by the Administration, however, is another matter. After three years of grinding out major legislation to protect consum ers, Congress took a breather in 1968 and enacted only two new measures — one to re quire the recall and replace ment of unsafe automobile tires and the other to broad en Federal authority to bar dangerous toys from the market. But scores of other con sumer bills were introduced, hearings on several were held and one measure — to bar cigarette advertising from tel evision and radio — was in the final legislative stages when Congress adjourned. Democrats led by Repre sentative Benjamin S. Rosen thal, Democrat of New York, meanwhile will be driving for enactment of legislation to create an independent Fed eral consumer protection agency with centralized legal and administrative powers. The Rosenthal bill is support ed by Ralph Nader and oth er consumer lobbyists. At the same time, Sena tors Philip A. Hart of Michi gan and Frank E. Moss of Utah, two other leading Dem ocratic consumer activists, will be pushing a bill by Mr. Hart for the creation of an in dependent consumer council with branches throughout the country to represent consum er interests and mediate buy er‐seller disputes.

69-> CLOSER CHECK URGED ON MEDICAID IN CITY
WASHINGTON, June 2—The deputy head of New York City's Health Department, Dr. Lowell E. Bellin, told the Senate Fi nance Committee today that medicaid was paying for much of the substandard health care in the city. For example, departmental spot checks of the quality of dental care under Medicaid showed that 37 per cent of the sets of false teeth provided were unsatisfactory, he said. In describing checks on the services of podiatrists, Dr. Bel lin said the percentage of un satisfactory foot moulds in various age groups ranged from 29 to 42. “There is no other place in the country that has statistics such as these,” Dr. Bellin said. Three years ago the Health Department began what is be lieved to be the only investiga tion of the quality of health care services under medicaid. Dr. Bellin said “there is no question in my mind that enor mous savings are possible” un der Medicaid if the program, which uses Federal, State and local funds to cover the health needs of the poor, is monitored more closely. Dr. Bellin estimated that “only 5 to 10 per cent of prac titioners neea to be watched,” but that this group “is milking the Medicaid program and bringing discredit upon it.” Un til his promotion to First Depu ty Health Commissioner earlier this year, Dr. Bellin headed the city's Medicaid program.

71-> A Panel Will Screen Marshal Nominees
Balked in his attempt to abolish the city marshal sys tem, Mayor Lindsay named a screening committee yes terday to suggest nominees for the fobs. Mr. Lindsay said at swearing‐in ceremony at City Hall that he would continue trying to persuade the legis lature to scrap the system, but that “meanwhile we have the problem — the business has to be attended to.” The Mayor, Investigation Commissioner Robert K. Rus kin and’ other officials who had helped fashion the screen ing apparatus indicated that they wanted the nominee list to include members of minor ity groups. Of the 69 incum bents, according to William Rubin of the Department of Investigation, which super vises the marshals, there are eight blacks and no Puerto Ricans. Marshals, the men who serve summonses, eviction notices and other papers in Civil Court judgments, have been a required part of the city legal system since 1655, when New York was still a Dutch colony. They collect fees for their services, ranging from $1 to $7.50, a system that Mr. Lindsay said yesterday “has an aspect of legalized vigi lantism about it” and a po tential for corruption. Over the years there have been complaints of “sewer service” by city marshals, in which court papers are dumped into sewers or other wise not served although the marshals swear the papers have been properly served. Mayor Lindsay, said his policy of not appointing mar shals — which has brought about 14 vacancies and 29 hold‐over marshals among the 83 authorized slots was providing a “windfall” of extra work for the 69 cur rent marshals. Michael Dontzin, the may oral assistant who will be liaison officer on the com mittee, said that the screen ing process would begin as soon as the chairman, Ber nard H. Jackson, former ex ecutive director of the Civil ian Complaint Review Board of the Police Department, re cuperates from an appendec tomy that was performed on Tuesday and that it would be “a few months” before the first suggested nomina tions were made. Incumbent marshals who want their names considered for reappointment to the six‐year term will be interviewed by the committee, Mr. Dont zin said, along with those suggested by any other source. The Mayor picked six of the members of the screening panel and the Presiding Jus tices of the Appellate Divi sions in the First and Second Departments of the State Su preme Court—Judges Harold A. Stevens and Marcus G. Christ—picked the other six. The members chose Mr. Jack son as chairman. David Arens, former staff attorney for the Legal Aid Sbciety, will be executive di rector. ??

72-> After Vietnam, What? Industry Has Optimistic View
If the longest war in the history of the United States, the war that has helped po larize the nation into two camps and radicalize the young people, came to an end tomorrow, the impact on industry and business with little or no direct connection with the war effort would be minimal. That is the conclusion drawn from responses to questions that, in effect, posed the problem of “After Vietnam, What?” All of the companies re sponding envisioned benefits to themselves and to the nation. Some predicted shifts in emphasis; a few expected minor short‐range disloca tions, followed by advances that would wipe out any loss in war‐oriented business. A surprising number spoke of the social benefits the country would derive from peace. But despite the over‐all optimism, hopeful viewpoints were not offered by defense industries, and it is here that the nation will face momen tous problems when peace finally arrives. The conver sion of war production to peacetime uses, and the prob lem of what to do with the people involved in such pro duction, has plagued the United States after each con flict. Vietnam is no excep tion, and the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Commit tee has already begun wide ranging hearings on the subject. The committee's chairman, Senator Ralph W. Yarbor ough, Democrat of Texas, in his opening statement esti mated that the United States was spending $36‐billion year, or $100‐million a day, on the war in Vietnam. He then took up the question of what would happen to this money: “Obviously, the military contractors will wish to spend the money on other vast military contracts; some people will want the bulk of the money used for tax reductions; others will want to use [it] to solve some of our more pressing problems at home—problems of health, education, housing and ur ban unrest. Then there are the workers presently em ployed to produce war goods, and in the case of Vietnam especially, munitions. Will there be jobs for these work ers? Where and in what in dustry?” One of the first witnesses before the committee was Walter P. Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers of America. Mr. Reuther presented a long, de tailed proposal “to absorb the human and economic im pact of ending the war, with drawing the troops, cutting back on military production and reducing the size of the military establishments.” With 3.8 million workers estimated to be involved in direct defense employment alone, Mr. Reuther warned “that the anvil on which peace is hammered out” should not be “the heads and backs of demobilized service men and displaced defense workers and their families.” Mr. Reuther proposed that 25 per cent of each defense contractor's profits after taxes be set aside as a “conversion reserve” in Government trust fund. In addition to helping finance conversion, the money woulc be used for retraining pur poses and to “pay certain types of benefits to minimize hardships” to the workers during the transition period. Whether Congress will ap prove all or any part of Mr. Reuther's proposals, or any other reconversion plan, is difficult to predict. The resis tance of defense contractors to change is a historic fact, as Mr. Reuther noted. On the other hand, two industries with some war‐related prof its — the railroads and the airlines—are looking forward to peace with optimism. The Association of Amer ican Railroads, while con ceding that the war has ex panded business by about per cent, contends that it has also contributed to the current financial difficulties of the industry because of the inflationary spiral it has helped generate. The association expects some decline in traffic to come with peace, but it ar gues that benefits from a halt to inflation could com pensate for it. Railroads such as the Penn Central, Seaboard Coast Line, Southern Pacific, Norfolk & Western, Chesapeake & Ohio, Baltimore & Ohio, Frisco and Great Northern all stressed that war freight on their lines was insignificant. The Southern Pacific, with 3.5 per cent of its freight rev enues deriving from Govern ment traffic, some of it do mestic, does not believe it will suffer if peace comes to Vienam. “To the contrary,” the rail road said, “a change from guns to butter economy, a reversal of inflation and high interest rates, should permit a resurgence of homebuild ing that would give a needed boost to movement of forest products and construction material, and these are im portant elements in Southern Pacific's traffic mix.” All of the airlines ques tioned were involved with Military Airlift Command flights, but only two, Pan American and Flying Tiger, did a substantial amount of passenger and freight busi ness. Pan Am estimated about $72‐million in revenues in 1969, or 6.7 per cent of its total for the year, and $50‐, million in 1970. Flying Tiger listed $50‐million in 1969, with a predicted drop to $35‐ million in 1970 and $20‐mil lion in 1971. Nevertheless, both airlines were confident of recouping earnings in other ways. Trans World, United., East ern and Continental said that their involvement in airlift business was minimal, and that peace would not have an adverse effect on their op erations. Eastern said it expected to “benefit from any concen trated attention on the urban agonies of the metropolitan complexes we serve. That judgment, while reflecting mainly our belief that new buisness traffic would be generated, also takes into ac count the belief that success ful efforts to relieve pov erty will produce in time a new generation of air travel ers. Major chemical producers, with 5 per cent of their sales generated by the war, were unanimous in welcoming peace. The Dow Chemical Company, long a favorite target of young protesters because of its role, until this year, in the production of napalm, derives about 5 per cent of its $1.7‐billion annual sales from Govern ment contracts (napalm rep resented less than 0.5 per cent of this total). H. D. Doan, president of Dow, of fered this view: “A dramatic end to the Vietnam war — which we would certainly welcome— would cause some temporary dislocation in the economy as a whole, which would in turn have a slight effect on our own business. The final effect, however, would be to help our business in general. What seems more likely from present indications is that the conclusion of the war will come about gradually during the next few years. This would have no particular economic impact on Dow.” Charles B. McCoy, presi dent of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., after noting that the war's end would help du Pont's earnings, said: “Any slowdown in the gen eral economy during a period of readjustment from war to peace should be tempor ary and but a prelude to a major effort to meet the housing, transportation, ur ban development, education al and other pressing needs of the nation. Our products are required to fill such needs.” The retailing and soft goods industries predicted stabilizing effect on their activities with the end of hostilities. The statement by Alfred Eisenpreis, vice presi dent of the Allied Stores Corporation, one of the coun try's largest retail organiza tions, typified the reaction: “There should be no abrupt change in whatever are the prevailing sales trends at the time of the end of hostilities. Depending upon the speed with which troops are returned, home goods sales will be spurred by new‐home formations, but shortages of available hous ing may stretch out this in crease.” Mr. Eisenpreis touched on another aspect of peace, the return of young men to civil ian life. He said this would offer an important new source of manpower and ex ecutive development. The same manpower ques tion is of prime concern to Wall Street executives. The securities industry, just emerging from an operational crisis whose long‐range solu tion emphasizes large in creases in operations person nel, is hopeful that the war's end will release a flood of manpower. The converse side of the manpower problem—the re moval of hundreds of thou sands of young men from the consumer market and the psychological damper on mil lions of draft‐eligible youths (somewhat softened by the draft lottery)—has seriously disrupted the sales of men's apparel. Industry leaders, therefore, expect a signifi cant upsurge in sales when the war ends.

73-> U.N. and Citizens Group Join in Narcotics Fight
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y. June 16—United Nations of ficials and an American citi zens' group are planning a new worldwide fight against illicit traffic in narcotics. Vladimir Kusevic, director of the United Nations' Division of Narcotic Drugs, said today that an offer of financial help for the undertaking had come from the United States Peoples Fund for the U.N., a private civic group that raises money in the United States for United Na tions activities. Mr. Kusevic, a Yugoslav, na tiarial, says he hopes to raise $15‐million for the first year of, operations. The pro gram would have a fourfoldpiir pope: tb support pilot projects to encourage opium‐growing canaries to switch to other crops; to rehabilitate addicts, to train police and customs of ficials spot traffickers, and to for the international organiza Until now the United Na tions' Main Oreoccupation in the narcotics area has been drawing up treaties under which governments undertake to control dangerous drugs such as opiuni, morphine and heroin, cocaine and Cannabis, or Indian hemp, and to report each year on their seizures of illegal Stocks. These reports are reviewed by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which can try to per suade governments to tighten enforcement. But in practice, the effectiveness depends large ly on the ability and willingness of the authorities in each coun try to stop the illegal trade. A small budget, recently raised to $100,000 from $75,000, also goes for training, police and other enforcement person nel, for provision of experts and for seminars concerned with addiction and related matters. Mr. Kusevic came here from Geneva, where the United Na tions division has its headquar ters, for consultations yesterday and today with representatives of the Peoples Fund. Luther Evans, former director general of the United Nations Educa tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization, is president of the organization, which has set up offices nearby at 777 United Nations Plaza. The Peoples Fund was set up last year and solicits con tributions for the humanitarian activities of the United Na tions. Contributions are tax de ductible. Dr. Evans said the Peoples Fund selected the narcotics program as its first fund‐rais ing effort because of the ur gency of the problem and also because it had significance for the American public as well as for the international organiza tion. Huntington Hartford has been a supporter of the Peo ples Fund effort. An appeal to business groups is being initi ated. The drive is directed against narcotic derivatives of the poppy, such as opium, morphine and heroin, aid does not in clude amphetamines or halluci nogens such as LSD. Dr. Kusevic indicated he had no illusions that a financially modest program could make an immediate or widespread im pact in a field in which crime, political issues and economic considerations, complicate the attempts at enforcement. But “it is at least a start,” he says. The United Nations last year offered assistance to 14 coun tries now cultivating the opium poppy and other narcotic plants in shifting to other crops. Only Thailand promptly accepted. A United Nations mission went to Thailand in 1966 to study conditions and reported that eliminating opi um‐growing would be difficult — almost impossible. The opium poppy is grown in remote regions by hill tribes in areas where few other crops will grow and where there are no roads for getting such alternative products to market, the mission reported. United States authorities say 80 per cent of the illicit nar cotics reaching this country originate in Turkey. The Unit ed States has been pressing Turkey to reduce cultivation and also tighten control and Turkey has responded by lim iting the cultivation of poppy, to certain areas.

76-> 2 Sides in Dispute At Washington High Returning to Court
State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Dickens will hear op posing legal motions this morn ing by the Board of Education and a group of parents in a dispute over a proposed students' grievance table at George Washington High School. Last Tuesday the board ob tained an injunction, prevent ing the parents from manning such a table at the school, at 193d Street and Audubon Avenue. Yesterday a parent group went into court to obtain a cross injunction against the board and also Robert Miller, chairman of the United Fed eration of Teachers' chapter at the school. The parents con tend that Mr. Miller is hinder ing classes at the school, which has an enrollment of 4,000. No classes were held yes terday, and the school was closed Monday after a series of disorders and seven small fires. Four students were ar rested on various charges and three policemen reported in juries during scuffles. Some parents have wanted to set up a table in the school's lobby to hear complaints and to advise students. Most of the faculty members have opposed the table, saying it would dis rupt “professional and guidance functions.” The dispute has re sulted in disrupted classes for several weeks. Yesterday the school's newly appointed principal, Sol Levine, met with faculty members, par ents and representatives of other groups. Mr. Levine succeeds Carl Cherkis, an acting principal who has returned to the Boara of Education headquarters for reassignment. The new princi pal is 37 years old and a H censed high school principal. He had been chairman of the social studies department at Canarsie High School in Brook lyn, and an administrative as sistant there.

77-> Francis Law Dies
HOUSTON, June 2—Francis Marion Law, president of the American Bankers Association during the Depression, died today. He was 93 years old. Mr. Law had been president of the First National Bank of Houston and chairman of the board of Texas A.&M. Univer sity and of the Houston Sym phony Society. The years 1933 and 1934, fol lowing the Bank Holidays that shut down the nation's banks, were a grim time to be the head of the American Bankers Asso ciation. That was Mr. Law's term, and most of the stories he figured in at the time were somber. One item, however, printed around the country on October 27, 1934, was not. “Law Borrows a Quarter; ‘Begging’ Says Roosevelt,” was the headline over it in that day's New York Times. The banker, said the story, had found himself short when he arrived at the White House for one of his frequent confer ences with the President, and had to ask a reporter for a quarter to help pay for his taxi. When the story reached Mr. Roosevelt, he accused Mr. Law of “begging from the White House steps.” Elected president of the banking group in September, 1933, Mr. Law backed Mr. Roosevelt strongly from the outset, in the President's effort to put the nation's economy back on its feet. Working closely with the Administration, he defended the banking system's fundamental health, helped revise the Na tional Banking Act, and draft ed the charter of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He campaigned for easier credit conditions, and—oppos ing “sound money” advocates —supported the Administration on revaluing gold. He said of Mr. Roosevelt in May, 1934: “He has without doubt proved his grasp of what the financial and industrial system of the country requires.” Mr. Law started as a clerk in the bank in his home town, Bryan, Tex., after attending the University of Texas. He later got a job as cashier of the First National Bank of Houston, eventually becoming its president, and president of the Texas Bankers Associa tion.

78-> ADDONIZIO'S TRIM OPENS IN TRENTON
TRENTON, June 2—Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio of Newark went on trial here today in Federal District Court with seven other defendants on 66 counts of conspiracy to extort $253,000 from Constrad, Inc., a company that builds sewers for Newark. Severances were granted to four other defend ants. Seven of the eight defend ants, among them the 56‐year‐ old Mr. Addonizio and Anthony (Tony Boy) Boiardo, reputed Newark area Mafia chief) were also charged with income‐tax evasion. Of the 15 men indicted by a Federal grand jury last De cember on these charges, which involve interstate commerce, two have since died. The cases of four others were severed to day and another one was sev ered yesterday. Judge George H. Barlow, who is hearing the case, spent most of, the morning in his chambers with lawyers for four of the original defendants, Calvin D. West, Irvine I. Turner and Frank Addonizio (a distant cousin of the Mayor), City Councilmen who face run‐off elections on June 16, and Lee Bernstein, a former Council man. The judge then severed the cases of the first three from the main trial because their laisryer, Raymond Brown, had not yet concluded work in a trial in Jersey City, where he is defending three Black Panthers accused of machine‐gunning and bombing a police station. Mr. Bernstein's case was severed because of illness. A fifth defendant, Newark Public Works Director Benjamin Krusch was severed yester day from the main trial. Mayor Addonizio, who has accused the prosecutor, United States Attorney Frederick B. Lacey, of political motives in opposing a trial delay, faces a run‐off election June 16 against Kenneth Gibson a Newark civil engineer. The Mayor, who left for Newark to campaign at 5 P.M. when Judge Barlow adjourned the trial until to morrow morning, said he had been warned to make no more comments on the case until the jury was empaneled. Judge Barlow began selection of the jury this afternoon. He had already excused some 200 persons from jury service this morning. By the end of the day he had questioned 24 persons chosen by lot and seated a panel of 12. Each defendant will be allowed two peremptory challenges and the prosecution will be allowed six.

79-> A MULTIMEDIA ‘YES’ FAILS AT PREMIERE
The first performance of “Yes,” a multmedia work by David Cope presented at Car negie Recital Hall on Tuesday night, will have to be reviewed with a firm “No.” The 29‐year‐old teacher at the Cleveland Institute of Music mixed together purposely sonnambulistic piano music, uninventive percussion sounds (played by Mr. Cope himself), a tape score synthesized on a Moog, and a few amateurish color slides, and padded out his remarkably few ideas to unrealistic lengths. The event, half of which this reviewer managed to last through took place in a darkened hall, and promised to go on for 2¼ hours without intermission. It would have been like having to sit through the complete works of Rod McKuen, and one chose not to. What Mr. Cope thought he was doing can only be con jectured. Portentous voices and Delphic messages projected by slide machine suggested that “Yes” was intended as an af firmation of the universe, a re jection of nay‐saying. Much as one wanted to go along with these sentiments, the senseless monotony of the event itself kept denying its own premise. Besides Mr. Cope, partici pants in his self‐indulgent mar athon included Mary Cope, piano; Paul Hoffman, projec tions, and Marc Katz, tape playback.

80-> Washington: The Student Invasion
WASHINGTON, June 2—The capital is full of university students these days, lobbying the Congress for peace in Southeast Asia. Potentially, they are a powerful new politi cal force in the nation—there are 7 million college students and half the population of the country is under age 25—but they are inexperienced and disorganized and sorely in need of leadership. With it, they can undoubted ly have some effect in some close Congressional elections next November, but without it, they could easily fail — even nourish the already powerful anti‐student faction and help the candidates they have come to oppose—and thus encourage the radicals who argue that it is hopeless to try to work inside the present system. Most candidates for re‐elec tion on Capitol Hill are watch ing this student invasion of Washington with cautious at tention, but mainly with cau tion. They listen to anybody who has a chance of electing or defeating them. But they are also listening to all the other factions in their districts—in cluding those who oppose the student peace movement—for they are trying to make up their minds at this point wheth er embracing the student peace movement will help or hurt them in November. The weakness of most of the student ‐ lobbyists who come here seems to be that they haven't done their homework. They waste a good deal of their limited time in the capital talk ing to Congressmen who are already on their side or irrevers ibly committed against them. They have not picked out the candidates in the swing dis tricts, where a little more per suasion or organization might make the difference between victory and defeat. Candidates are not imper vious to philosophy, but they are more interested in votes. They have to deal with a great many issues fundamental to the interests, convictions and prej udices of their constituents. Most of the visiting students have one issue—peace now or tomorrow at the latest—and while they want the candi date's support, they have not yet learned the first rule of effective lobbying, which is to put themselves in the candi date's place and make their objective relevant to the man's main aim of re‐election. This is not surprising, for this is a new adventure for most students; but what is surprising is that these intelli gent young men and women have paid so little attention to the most fundamental facts. For example, it is astonishing that so many of them who have come here to persuade Senators to vote for the Church‐Cooper amendment on ending the Cam bodian invasion haven't even registered to vote in the No vember elections themselves, or organized to get the other peace advocates in their dis tricts to register. The student peace movement at this point is existing in the realm of ideas and ideals. Peace on earth and good will toward all men, except the President and the Vice President. It is concentrating on absolutes, general principles and national policies, but in a Congressional election, the candidates have to deal with ambiguities, nar row prejudices and local inter ests. This is the gap the visit ing students in Washington have not yet bridged. They came here with a single issue—peace—and are trying to deal with it as a national student movement, and in some ways they have succeeded. They have made their point on the national scene. Thomas J. Watson Jr., the head of I.B.M., illustrates their success. “The longer the war continues,” he told the Foreign Relations Com mittee, “the more it broadens the gap between the elder gen eration . . . and our young men and women, who will soon be responsible for the leadership and destiny of this country.... I don't think we can afford n?? to heed the dissatisfaction of our youth.” The problem now is a prob lem of practical politics and power. It is a very complicated problem, different in each con stituency. Students have to deal with it in their own home districts in terms of local issues and with an understanding of the diverse and contradictory problems of local candidates. Accordingly, it will be inter esting to see what the students do over the summer. They can separate and philosophize, or they can think through their problem, and register, and or ganize, Congressional district by district, with local young men and women in charge. On that basis, with some general themes from the center and good leadership from the young lawyers at home, they can put force behind their idealism. But they cannot do it merely by visiting Washington and argu ing general principles and noble ideals with distracted Congress men, who have to listen to all the voters and not just to the students home from college.

81-> Chess:
URING the recent 10‐ board quadruple round chess match between the So viet Union and players front the rest of the world, Sammy Reshevsky of Spring Valley, N. Y., a seven‐time United States champion, was paired on Board 6 with a former world champion, Vasily Smysloy. Reshevsky's task was dif ficult. Smyslov is a tough opponent, slyly cunning, and talented in the technique of the end game, where he has a flair for squeezing out victory by the narrowest of margins—sometimes just a tempo. Nowadays, with Smyslov not overburdened with pres tige, he is even sharper. In the first‐round King's Fian chetto Opening between him and Reshevsky, a series of tactical feints ruled the play. Each hoped to cajole the other into a premature breach in the pawn skeleton, but neither was willing to part with the logical or even psy chological balance. ?? The draw was justified. If Black varied with 26 ... QxBP; 27 R‐B1, Q any; 28 R‐B7 would grant White a good edge. oldest competitor, Miguel Najdorf of Argentina, who established a 45‐game simul taneous blindfold record many years ago, was Black against Mikhail Tal, a former world champion. ?? Cleverly, Tal increased his first‐move initiative and threatened destruction after 24 Q‐R5. Black's collapse was based on the advance of the knight: 25 N‐B6ch, etc., forcing mate. Black's only save, 24 ... Q‐R3, allowed White the bet ter ending owing to his su perior pawn structure. From here on in, Najdorf defended all points with skill and counter tactics. In the finale, the Argen tine's majority of pawns compensated for Tal's ex change plus.

82-> The Friendly Chateaus Along La Route Jacques Coeur
BOURGES, France—During the Ren aissance, the wealthy of France de veloped country life to a splendor that had never been known before. The stern‐looking medieval chateaux forts, or fortified castles, went out of style when gunpowder made their fortifications obso lete; the aristocracy then started to build chateaux de plaisance, huge country houses designed for lavish living. American tourists see some of these cha teaus in the Loire Valley. But almost with out exception, they miss others nearby that are just as beautiful and often more interesting. In recent years, the owners of several chateaus have opened their homes to the public. By letting outsiders look at treasures that for centuries have been hidden from everyone but family and friends, they pay lower taxes. And when their buildings need repairs, they receive financial help from the state. Ten of these chateaus are grouped around Bourges, a city 140 miles from Paris. To gether with a medieval abbey, they stretch along a network of country lanes called La Route Jacques Coeur, which was named for a leading 15th‐century citizen of Bourges. Most of the Loire Valley chateaus are not inhabited, but nearly all of those on La Route Jacques Coeur are homes as well as museums. Although filled with museum pieces, the chateaus are far livelier than museums. These are the friendly chateaus of France, quite different from the stately mansions of the Loire. They have more variety, too. The Loire museums are Renaissance chateaux de plaisance. Along La Route Jacques Coeur, the visitor sees medieval chateaux forts as well, and at one of the estates— Meillant —he observes the transition from one style to the other. All of them have magnificent parks and gardens, antique furniture, and splendid tapestries and paintings. In addition, each has one or more attractions that distinguish it from the others. Besides being beautiful, La Route Jac ques Coeur chateaus stand in an easily reached part of the country that is one of the loveliest in France. Linking them to gether are tranquil, traffic‐free lanes that run through forests, rolling fields and pastures where pure white cows, a special breed, graze placidly in the sun. At times, a small river, the Cher, follows the route, which is almost always lined with trees and wild flowers. It is rich, green, quiet country, and the tourist can really see it. No billboards mar the view, a though now and then, along with other road signs, there is a small arrow that points the way to the next chateau. The best place to begin a visit to La Route Jacques Coeur is Bourges, where there are a number of memorable sights. Prob ably the most outstanding is a gothic cathedral; Aldous Huxley called it “the most fabulously beautiful building in Europe.” It has one of the largest collec tions of stained‐glass windows in the world, its central nave is the widest in France and the carved statues that decorate its five doors form one of the country's best collections of gothic art. Across from it, on the corner of rue Moliere, is the 13th‐century Grange des Dimes, where the grain paid to the church was stored. Scattered along the narrow streets of the old town are many other medieval half‐timbered buildings, their walls made of cream‐colored plaster and wide red beams. One of them is the modest house, where, it is believed, Jacques Coeur was born in 1395. Close by is the palace he built after he had made a fortune as an export‐import merchant. The palace, curved like the street it fronts on, formed part of the defense wall of the city. Tourists who wander through, it see im mense fireplaces, some with the castle carved in has relief on them, and the heads of Coeur and his wife carved near the windows, looking out at the world. They also see a balcony on which musicians played when entertaining the family, a gothic chapel and a kitchen with four big ovens built into the wall. Not far from the palace is a smaller building, the Hotel Lallemant, with several curiosities of its own. In the Lallemant family were a number of alchemists, and, like all good alchemists of the time, they tried to turn lead and other base metals into gold. In one of the rooms where this operation was attempted, the ceiling is decorated with symbols that the Lallemants hoped would do the trick. One of its walls has two magic letters, R and E, arranged in a sequence that was no more successful than the symbols on the ceiling. The drawing room contains another curi osity: three handsomely decorated porcelain vases, Each one is about a foot high, is on rollers and has two handles on its sides for moving it about. The women of the house put live coals in the vases, sat on a chair and then wheeled the vases under their long, wide skirts. This, of course, pro vided truly central heating. Bourges is also noted for two formal gardens with sculptured hedges and flowers planted in geometric designs. One is next to the cathedral; the other, Pres‐Fichaux, is close to the railway station. Leaving the city southward by way of La Route Jacques Coeur, the tourist comes first to Chateuneuf, a gray‐stone Renais sance mansion with round towers guarding the entrance and a high, steep, black‐slate roof. Like all the other chateaus, it stands at the edge of a small village of ancient houses and in the midst of a vast, shady park. Inside, one of its major sights is a serv ice of Saxe porcelain for 50 people. It was given to Tallyrand by the King of Prussia, and not a piece of it is broken. The road from Chateauneuf passes through a small town called Bruere. In its main square, a Gallo‐Roman column topped with a French flag marks the geographical center of the country. At the monument, La Route Jacques Coeur turns right to Noirlac Abbey. There, visitors see the ruins of a gothic church, a line of monks' cells filled with antique fur niture and a medieval cloister with rose bushes growing up its walls of gray stone. From the abbey, the road goes to Meil lant, largest of these country palaces. Meil lant began as a chateaux fort, but during later centuries it was transformed into a splendid Renaissance building. One of the fireplaces there has 12 gold L's and 12 gold fleurs de lis on it, a re minder of the fact that Louis XII once visited the mansion. In the medieval part of the castle, the wall is almost 12 feet thick; small corridors lead through the wall to each of the windows in it. Twelve miles from Meillant is Ainay‐le Vieil, one of the most picturesque chateaux forts in France. A single road leads across its moat, still filled with water, into a circular courtyard entirely surrounded by walls and towers. Visitors can walk around the top of the wall, where warriors kept watch and, de fended the castle during sieges. Above the entrance gate, they see the fireplace where oil was boiled and the narrow rectangle in the floor through which it was poured upon people trying to force the gate below. In the residential section of the building is another imposing fireplace with gold L's and fleurs de lis upon it. Another room there houses a case containing a gold harp like instrument about two inches high it plays a tune when wound up — and a piece of amber with a spider inside it. Both belonged to Marie Antoinette. The amber was supposed to be a goodluck piece; in Marie's case, the good luck failed. Last of the chateaus south of Bourges is Culan, where Joan of Arc once stayed. Every summer, its owner arranges an im portant art exhibit that runs to. Sept. 15. Last year, the show featured paintings by Dali, Miro and other surrealist artists. The chateaus are all close to each other and close to Bourges. The visitor can easily see them in a day and return to Bourges, where there are good hotels. The total round‐trip distance is about 100 miles. The following day, it is possible to see the chateaus north of the city, going first to the medieval castle of Boucard and then to a Renaissance mansion called La Ver rerie, which stands in a magnificent park. After it comes Blancafort, built of rose colored brick in the 15th and 16th cen turies, and the chateau in Gien, a town on the Loire River. The latter is now a hunt ing museum. Seven miles outside the town is La Bussi ere, another pink‐brick Renaissance man sion. Its most interesting attractions are fully equipped antique kitchen, a vast col lection of books, tapestries and pictures about fishing and fishing equipment collect ed over the centuries. There is also an aquarium. From La Bussiere, visitors can drive to Paris in about two hours or return to Bourges. En route, they can stop at Mau pas, a 14th‐century castle; however, it is open only in the afternoon from Easter to the end of September. A beautiful mansion, it is noted for its rose gardens and its col lection of 88 porcelain plates, each differ erent from the other, which line the walls of its central stairway. The Bureau National de Renseignements de Tourisme, 127 Avenue des Champs‐Ely sees, Paris, provides a folder in English about La Route Jacques Coeur. It contains a brief description of each chateau, the hours when it is open and a small map of the route that links them all together. The folder and a road map of the area are useful to anyone who visits these homes. In each chateau, the guide speaks only French, but there is a project under discussion to prepare pamphlets that trans late every guide's comments into English. Entrance tickets to each chateau cost 60 cents. The Syndicat d'Initiative (Tourist Office) of Bourges organizes occasional tours to some of these country houses. Prices range from $4.50 to $10 and reservations must be made in advance.

83-> Woman, 20, Dead in Car, Friend Tells of Kidnapping,
A 20‐year‐old woman was found dead yesterday in a car at the bottom of a cliff near Grandview, N. Y., in Rockland County, and the police here were questioning a man who said he was her fiancé and that they had been kidnapped by two armed men. The woman was identified as Patricia Reilly, of 2494 Morris Avenue, the Bronx. The police said that William Lam phear, 21, of 2636 University Avenue, the Bronx, told them that he and Miss Reilly had been kidnapped Friday night while they were parked in Van Cortlandt Park and that he was locked in the car's trunk while the men drove off with the girl in front. The police said that Mr. Lamphear said he escaped, from the trunk after the car was pushed over a cliff near Route 9W and he then found Miss Reilly dead in the car.

84-> FILION RETURNING NO LONGER ANGRY
WESTBURY, L. I., July 8—When Herve Filion left here June 27, he was harness racing's last angry man. That was after the $94,335.42 Reali zation Trot had been staged at Roosevelt Raceway and Filion had stormed out in a huff aft er Harness Racing Commission officials had declined to take an additional test of Crain Han over. Crain Hanover, owned by Fi lion's Capital Hill Farm of La chute, Quebec, had been medi cated for colic well in advance of the 48‐hour deadline, but traces of the analgesic re mained, and the horse was or dered scratched. Filion maintained his horse surely would have won, so he obtained a court order that temporarily enjoined Roosevelt Raceway from disbursing the purse money. Horsemen's groups also got into the act. In one instance, the suspension of John Cash man, the presiding judge, was demanded of the Racing Com mission. Someone else sought to have a rerun of the race. When Filion returns for to morrow night's $32,300 one mile United States Harness Writers’ Association Trot for 3‐year‐olds, he will be in a more docile frame of mind for his assignment behind the Marlu Stable's Marlu Pride. Marlu Pride Favored Marlu Pride, the six‐length winner of the $111,514 Dex ter Cup here, is the 5‐to‐2 fa vorite to beat the likes of John Froehlich's Gil Hanover, the Nevele Acres’ Nevele Rascal, the Fury Stable's Victory Star, Clayt Hanover from the Stan ley Dancer barn and others in the field of 11. Marlu Pride will leave from the No. 5 post. Filion was at Richelieu Park Pointe aux Trembles, Quebec, last night for the Canadian Trotting Championship, in which Crain Hanover switched from a trot to a pace before breaking and finishing last. Duncan MacDonald's mare, Fresh Yankee, won and be came the Canadian representa tive in the forthcoming $125, 000 Roosevelt International. “While I still feel someone made a mistake in the recent case of Crain Hanover at Roosevelt Raceway and I still am seeking a part of the purse I am not angry with anyone,” Filion said. “I don't expect the race to be rerun and certainly I am not out to get anyone's job in New York, despite reports or rumors to that effect.” “I'm returning to Roosevelt for the U.S.H.W.A. trot, which I expect to win with Marlu Pride.” Dayan, Noccalulu, Extra Bonus, Grandpa Jim, Earl Laird Argo Port, Ulysse Mab and Trinidad Hanover will start in the $50,000, 1¼‐mile American Trotting Championship race Saturday night. The winner and possibly a second horse will move into the July 18 Inter national.

85-> Books of The Times; Sociology (2): Rent a Liberal Technologue, Cheap
The crisis of Western sociology enters its second day. Next month, almost as though the professors had been reading Alvin W. Gouldner's book, Harvard will re‐establish an independent department of sociology, ending 24 years of interdisci plinary group‐grope (sociologists, psy chologists, anthropologists) under the “social relations” umbrella. One reason for the change, as reported by Robert Rein hold in The New York Times on Monday, is that American sociology is shifting its emphasis away from “micro‐scale” anal yses of individual behavior, toward urban and racial problems instead. Sociologists will thus have more in common with economists and political scientists than with psychologists and anthropologists. Presumably, graduate students have been nipping at their heels. And yet, as Dr. Gouldner says, the growth of the Welfare State makes such a shift inevitable. Parsonsian Functionalism took the social system (with its existing power arrange ments, property relationships and institu tions) as a given, and took “equilibrium” (order, stability) as an ideal. So long as citizens conformed to an agreed‐upon moral code (divine sanction, caste niche), or so long as they got a sufficient number of gratifications (consumer products, prestige symbols), there was no reason why the social system wouldn't last for ever. Power had a way of becoming “au thority”; authority was somehow always “legitimate.” Alas, the system has proved in many respects to be “dysfunctional.” The Great Depression required a lot of tinkering with the social machinery to keep those grati fications rolling off the assembly line without altering basic power arrange ments and property relationships. A black minority threatens to bring the ideological wars of 19th‐century Europe to 20th century America. A psychedelic “counter culture” lacks respect for authority. Women want to be liberated and students refuse careers and farm workers live brutish half‐lives and too many citizens derive no pleasure from either their work or their regimented leisure and a war goes on and on because no one knows how to stop it. For sociologists, one result of this dys functionalism was an impulse to pump a little Marx into their paradigms. Dr. Gouldner documents the “convergence” of academic sociology and Marxism in re cent years, even as he sketches in various recent departures from Parsonsian theory (Erving Goffman's “dramaturgy,” Harold Garfinkel's “ethnomethodology,” George Homans's “social exchange”). A sense of precariousness is loose in the land, which perhaps explains the substitution of “games” theories for the old hydraulic model of an input‐output social system. Another result is that sociologists have been hired by the Welfare State to fix things. The Federal Government spent $200‐million on social science research in 1964, and the subsidy goes up each year. Washington's assumption that it can do something specific about civic turmoil, if only sociologists tell it what to do, almost directly opposes the Parsonsian assump tion that, since “everything influences everything else,” adaptive mechanisms will emerge “spontaneously” to restore equilib rium. The theory had to change, then, not only to accommodate the fact of disorder, but to accommodate the men with money as well. And so a new Rent‐a‐Professor agency opened with headquarters in the nation's capital, to which sociologists on credit cards and consultants' fees and tax deduc tions shuttled from their college campuses. Leaving aside the binge of counterinsur gency and riot‐control scenarios such shuttling inflicts on a luckless world, is there anything wrong with sociologists trying to solve social problems, instead of just studying them? Dr. Gouldner argues convincingly that there is something wrong if . . . if the sociologist hides behind a mask of “ob jectivity” to avoid seeing facts about power arrangements and property relationships that would inspire a moral qualm or two; if he conceives of his methodology, ever so scientific, as a substitute for values with discrete weights; if his theory is simply procedural, uninformed by a private vision of what ought to be; if he refuses to face up to his own complicity in a system of uni versity and governmental rewards and punishments; if he is merely “the liberal technologue who produces information and theories that serve to bind the poor and the working classes both to the state ap paratus and to the political machinery of the Democratic Party. . .” “Theory,” he says, is really just “an ef fort to make sense of one's experience . . . to locate and to interpret the meaning of what one has lived.” He proposes a “reflex ive sociology,” necessarily radical: “Radi cal, because it would recognize that knowl edge of the world cannot be advanced apart from a sociologist's knowledge of himself and his position in the social world, or apart from his efforts to change these. Radical, because it seeks to transform as well as to know the alien world outside the sociologist as well as the alien world inside of him. Radical, because it would accept the fact that the roots of sociology pass through the sociologist as a total man, and that the question he must confront, there fore, is not merely how to work but how to live.” Not the least of the marvels of Dr. Gouldner's extraordinary book is that what he says of sociologists is true of all of us. We need a reflexive humanity.

86-> Europeans Ask U.S. Assurance On Keeping Joint Space Effort
VENICE, Italy, Sept. 23—American space officials were asked today for assurance that, if the West European nations scrapped their space programs in favor of a joint effort with the United States, the latter would not, in an economy move, back down. The misgivings of many Euro pean industrial leaders and Government officials here re garding such a joint venture were expressed by Val Cleaver of Britain at a conference on cooperation in the years fol lowing the United States Apollo manned spaceflight pro gram. He argued that a recent vote in the United States Sen ate was “Ominous.” Mr. Cleaver cited the intro duction, by Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, of an amendment to the appropria tions for the National Aero nautics and Space Administra tion. Mr. Mondale proposed de leting all funds for preliminary design and model testing of the projected space shuttle, which is slated to be the key element in the next generation of manned space vehicles. The amendment was narrowly de feated, 32 to 28. The Europeans are being asked to make a significant contribution to the shuttle proj ect and are studying the pos sible development of a tug to go with it. The shuttle would lift payloads from the earth into a low orbit. The tug would then haul them from there to the higher, specially oriented orbits needed for satellites serv ing such practical ends as com munications, navigation and earth‐resources study. What will happen, Mr. Cleaver asked, when the cost of the shuttle project jumps from $100‐million a year dur ing the study and design phases to $1‐billion a year for devel opment? Will Congress then kill the project, leaving the Europeans with their own space programs in ruins and no prospects that their tug (or whatever components they pro duce) will get off the ground. This afternoon two NASA officials responded. Dale Meyers, associate administrator for manned flight programs, said that while no one could predict Congressional action, voting in the Senate had gen erally been strongly in favor of the shuttle program. Absentees Cited The vote cited by Mr. Cleaver, he said, took place close to the July 4 holiday with 40 Senators absent. It may also, he said, have reflected opposition to the more ambi tious program devised by the Space Task Group, which called for a space station in lunar orbit and a base on the moon. This plan was consid erably reduced in scope. Mr. Meyers outlined current thinking on the shuttle. He said the 50,000‐pound payload en visioned for it a few months ago had been halved. The rea son, he added, was that recent studies had shown that only by using the most exotic tech nology could the projected booster stage lift such a load off the ground. The booster will have an initial thrust of 3.5 million pounds, roughly half that of the Satern 5 booster used on manned moon missions. In the shuttle system, both the booster and the upper stage will be manned by pilots so that each can be flown back to earth for re‐use. The upper stage will carry the payload into orbit 310 miles above the earth and inclined 55 degrees to the Equator. The cargo space will be 15 feet in diameter and 60 feet long as now conceived. This, it is hoped, will be enough to carry the tugs into orbit and, perhaps, bring them down again when they need repair. The meeting, which is run ning all week at the Excelsior Hotel, was organized by Euro space, an association of Euro pean space industries, and by their American counterparts.

87-> Funds for Neediest Increase
With the frantic shopping behind them, many New Yorkers will relax at parties or at home with their fami lies tonight as they did last year and the year before that. But thousands of people are not part of that scene. The G. family, for exam ple, has hardly enough mon ey for essentials, let alone presents. Tinsel would hard ly enliven their rat‐infested tenement. Mrs. G.'s husband has left her. One day, after finding her 3‐year‐old son screaming, with rats in his bed, she at tempted suicide, but a neigh bor found her in time. With the aid of a counse lor and a caseworker, the 27‐year‐old mother is begin ning to overcome her deep depression and give more attention to her three chil dren. But she will need con tinued assistance if she is ever to break the pattern for herself and the young sters. As a result of gifts to the New York Times. Neediest Cases Fund, the G.'s and other troubled poor will be helped. Among the 302 donations recorded by the fund yes terday were anonymous gifts of $500 and $1,500. A small er contribution—$1.05—was designated for the G. family from a 9‐year‐old boy who apparently identified with some of their problems. A note from his mother ex plained that his father also had deserted his family. The children of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Beer in Wood mere, L.I., sent $20 of their Hanukkah gift money to the Neediest Fund. A note from ?? Mrs. Beer explained that they had found The Times case summaries “heartbreaking” and “realize that these peo ple need our help more than we need another new skirt or toy.” A Westfield, N. J., mother sent a $100 check represent ing money earned by her son, who is at the Univer sity of Pennsylvania. She wrote that he wanted to make the donation “in lieu of gifts for his friends and family 7 who are more fortu nate.” There were other, gifts “in memory of a beloved sister and three brothers,” from “an Englishwoman in grati tude and affection, to Ameri ca” and from a, Bronx wom an who wished she were able to send a check for each of the cases summarized in The Times.. This year The Times is making a contribution to the fund instead of publishing lists of donors. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and forwarded to. P. O.

88-> PRISONER TORTURE IS LAID TO GREECE BY 15 COUNTRIES
STRASBOURG, France, April 15 — Fifteen Western European Governments asserted jointly today that the Greek military junta engaged in “torture and other ill treatment” of its politi cal prisoners. The Governments also made public a 40,000‐word report detailing alleged mis deeds by the authorities in Athens. The allegation of torture came in a resolution adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which met at the council's modern headquarters here. Of the 17 member nations— all of them parlamentary de mocracies — all except France and Cyprus voted for the reso lution. Greece, anticipating expulsion, by the council, withdrew last December and has already dis missed the report, the sub stance of which was disclosed in November, as null and void. Gaston Thorn, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, who was chairman of the meeting today, said at a news con ference after the morning ses sion: “Now the matter is in the hands of the people. They have the report.” Opponents of the three‐year‐ old Greek Government hope the ministers' action will further arouse public opinion against it. Optimists among them also hope that the Greek authorities may be dissuaded from taking further harsh measures against dissidents. The report, drafted last year by the European Commission on Human Rights, says that torture and ill treatment of prisoners were an “administrative prac tice” officially tolerated by the Government of Premier George Papadopoulos. Among the accounts it gives is the testimony of a 26‐year‐ old woman, Mrs. Anastasia Tsirka, who said she was tied down, gagged and beaten on the soles of her feet while pregnant. The report says the commis sion heard allegations of torture or ill treatment of more than 200 detainees. It examined 30 of the cases to “some substan tial degree” and concluded that in 11 of them “torture or ill treatment has been established” and that in 17 others there was other evidence corroborating the complaints. The commission indicated that the Greek police liked to beat prisoners on the soles of their feet because the practice is intensely painful but leaves no lasting marks if skillfully done. Another criticism of the junta was voiced separately today by the Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, who was released from detention this week and flew to Paris for medical treat ment. In a message read here, Mr. Theodorakis said that the prison and concentration‐camp system in Greece was “inadmis sible in any of our European countries, and not only for my country but for every man who is civilized and free.” The message from Mr. Theo dorakis, who wrote the music for the films “Zorba the Greek” and “Z,” was read at a news conference conducted by Jean Jacques Servan‐Schreiber, the French editor‐politician, who criticized the French Govern ment for not voting for the re port. The principal conclusions of the 1,200‐page document and some of its details were pub lished in the press after be ing leaked by officials opposed Ito the Athens government. It concluded that contrary to contentions of the Greek author ities, there was no danger of Communist takeover at the time they came to power in military coup d'etat. The report of the resolution adopted today asserted that the military government had vio lated provisions of the Euro pean Convention on Human Rights. The Greek authorities have denounced the conven tion, but the Council of Europe contends that they are still bound by its provisions. The French Government has not ratified the convention and said that was why it did not vote. The delegation of Cyprus, which has close ties with Greece, made it known that it did not vote because it took exception to the resolution. The delegations that voted in favor were those of Austria, Britain, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, the Nether lands, Malta, Luxembourg, Italy Ireland, Iceland, West Germany, Denmark and Belgium. The resolution called on the Greek Government “to abolish immediately torture and other ill treatment of prisoners, to re lease immediately persons de tained under administrative or der” and “to restore without delay human rights and funda mental freedoms.”

89-> Particle of a Human Cell Produced in Laboratory
The first man‐made part of a human cell, the lysosome, has been produced by two New York University scientists. The development, which was reported Monday at a scientific symposium in Michigan, was said to open the way to more detailed study of the body's natural response to dis ease and, particularly, to the inflammatory process that lead to such painful and crippling diseases as arthritis and rheu matism. Biologists who specialize in the human cell described the word as “interesting” and “a good thing,” but emphasized that it represented only a small step in efforts to reproduce the cell in the laboratory. Like the exploration of space in the nineteen‐sixties, the ex ploration of the human cell is in this decade one of the biggest challenges to scientists. Their efforts were encouraged two and a half years ago by the laboratory synthesis of DNA, the substance that carries the genetic code and, thus, dic tates the shape and function of any given cell. The laboratory creation of a lysosome was reported by Dr. Gerald Weissmann and Dr. Grazia Sessa of the New York, University School of Medicine. They described the achievement at a symposium of the Inter national Inflammation Club, which was held in Kalamazoo, Mich., under the sponsorship of the Upjohn Company. A detailed report on the work will be published in the July 10 issue of the Journal of Bio logical Chemistry. Lysosomes are present in most living cells. They contain powerful enzymes that usually protect the cell against bacteria or viruses but that can be come dangerousy destructive. When a cell is attacked by a virus or other foreign par ticle, the invader is met by the lysosome and destroyed by the enzymes, which are protein substances that stimulate chem ical reactions. This is the proc ess that protects the body against disease. But when the cell is over whelmed by undigestibie mat ter, injury or violent infection, the lysosome releases its en zymes into surrounding tissues by mechanisms that are not yet understood. This causes the de struction of other cells, lead ing to pain, swelling and other effects of inflammation. Dr. Weissmann said that the artificial lysosome had been produced from fatty substances called lipids. These tend to form thin membranelike layers. The enzymes live in the watery spaces between those layers. It took five years of work by Dr. Weissmann and Dr. Sessa to reproduce the membrane layers and enzymes in such way that the artificial lyso some behaves in a test‐tube environment exactly as its natural counterpart does in the human body. “The artificial lysosome—the liposome—is made with com mercially available purified lipids and enzymes,” Dr. Weissman said. “This means can be reproduced in any laboratory in the world.” The significance of the work, the scientists said, is that it permits the laboratory study of the effect of drugs and hor mones on the cell. This, in turn, helps in the study of the body's natural means of fight ing disease. Dr. Weissmann said that he was working on capturing other enzyes within the lysosome. There are 25 different enzymes for different functions found in Lysosomes. Lysozyme, the one used in this experiment, is responsible for digesting bac terial cell walls. One outgrowth of the re search, Dr. Weissmann said yes terday, could be the formation of artificial red blood cells. Commenting on the develop ment, Dr. Alfred E. Mirsky, biologist at the Rockefeller Uni versity here, said that the ly sosome was probably the simp lest part of the human cell. He called the work “a good thing” but said that the most difficult cell synthesis involved creating the cell's nucleus and its chromosome, the long threads in the cell that con tain its hereditary material. Major advances have already been made, Dr. Mirsky said, in duplicating ribosomes in the la boratory. Ribosomes are the structures within the cell where the protein compounds found in all living matter are manu factured. The existence of the lyso some in the cell was first dis covered with the electron microscope in 1955 by Dr. Christian de Duve, a Belgian scientist who now is associ ated with the Rockefeller Uni versity. Calling the new development “interesting,” Dr. de Duve was guarded, however, in his inter pretation of how important the advance was in the efforts to reproduce the human cell in the test tube.

92-> Congo Art Yields Its Magic to Harlem Youngsters
Ten Harlem youngsters who won a brief reprieve from classes yesterday to at tend a press preview of a Congolese art exhibition to be held Sunday quickly dis covered that, like most of us, they knew what they liked. The youngsters — all of them either sixth grade stu dents or younger members of the Head Start Program at the Mary McCleod Bethune School—Public School 92— at 222 West 134th Street, where the exhibition and auction of the paintings will be held—had all volunteered to attend the preview. They did so possibly as a socially acceptable ploy for cutting classes, but they were soon happilly scurrying around the school gymnasium from painting to painting and voicing decided points of view. Most of the paintings deal with familiar African themes the building of a house, women washing in a river, an open village market, the splash of African color against an encroaching dark jungle, wild life, masks and portraits. But the youngsters obviously favored the color ful works of an artist named Thango. Thango's paintings are either brightly colored masks, with the colors forming ab stract designs, or nightmarish dream sequences—one was titled “Mombaka et ses reves” (“Mombaka and his dreams”) — in which masks and serpentine figures inter twine in highly colorful ab stract designs. “I like the colors,” said Sandra Williams, an 11‐year old student. “I like the snakes. They look like they could eat you up,” commented Kevin Staf ford, also 11. “I like the background,” said another girl as she moved on to the next paint ing. “It reminds me of death,” a small girl said. Asked why they had vol unteered to attend the pre view, Kevin and two of the girls exchanged sheepish looks and giggled, but Sandra had a reason. “I wanted to come and see for myself what Congolese art was like,” she said. “I've read about it, but I never saw it except in magazines. think we should know about African art.” There will be 400 paintings on exhibition Sunday, from noon to 4 P.M., and 100 of them will be put up for auc tion, the proceeds going to the sponsoring Afro‐Ameri can Arts Cultural Center, which has its headquarters at P.S. 92. It is believed to be the largest collection of Congo lese paintings ever to be ex hibited in this country. Most of the works were executed in the last 20 years—many since the Congo won its in dependence from Belgium in 1960. Simon Bly Jr., executive director of the center, said he hopes to raise $50,000 from the auction. The money, he said, will be used for the center's daily educational program and toward the $5 million needed for a new center. The auction will be con ducted by State Senator Basil A. Paterson, the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor in the recent elec tion, and Ossie Davis, author, actor and playwright. Senator Paterson, who at tended the preview, noted that the center had been in existence more than 25 years and was one of the first to deal with Afro‐American cul ture. “And what's remark able,” he said, “is that the center doesn't get a penny from the city, despite the fact that is has an in‐service pro gram for teachers on Afro American studies that is ac credited by the Board of Education. I think it's some thing the city should think about.” The center, which Is run in cooperation with the Board of Education's Bureau of Con tinuing Education, is a non profit organization and is open daily from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. and all day weekends. It conducts classes in all the cultural arts—drawing, paint ing, sculpture, the performing arts, the literary arts and photography.

94-> BIG BOARD REPORTS CAPITAL RULES MET
The New York Stock Ex change said yesterday that all of its top 25 member firms, ac counting for over half of ex change commission business, were in compliance with the exchange's regulations on cap ital. Robert H. Haack, president, issued the statement in re sponse to what he called “ru mors” that at least two major securities firms with known financial difficulties were “floundering.” A story in Mon day's New York Times reported that a number of Wall Street firms were experiencing severe financial difficulties. In his statement, Mr. Haack asserted that the exchange's continuous monitoring on a monthly, weekly and daily basis keeps constant check on the financial condition of member firms and particularly “whether they are in danger of violation of our capital requirements.” Mr. Haack's statement was restricted to the present capital positions of exchange members and did not refer to any poten tial Withdrawals of capital from member organizations, or pos sible future violations of cap ital rules, nor did it refer to any member concerns smaller than the 25 largest.

95-> Milton Steinbach Is Dead at 67; Led in Creating Medical School
Milton Steinbach, an invest ment banker and philanthrop ist, died yesterday in Mount Sinai Hospital after a short illness. He was 67 years old and lived at 150 Central Park and on Rockledge Road in Rye, N. Y. Mr. Steinbach had been a partner since 1933 in the in vestment banking firm of Wer theim & Co. At Mount Sinai, where he had been a trustee since 1956, he was a leader in the establishment of the af filiated School of Medicine of the City University of New York, which graduated its first class last June. He was presi dent of the school's trustees from its organization in 1963 until his death. Mr. Steinbach was born in New Haven, where his father established the printing busi ness of A. D. Steinbach & Sons. He prepared at Phillips Acad emy, Andover, Mass., for Yale University, where he received his B. S. in 1924 from the Shef field Scientific School. He started working in the family business in New Haven, but then came to New York to enter the financial world. He became a partner in the New York Stock Exchange firm of Hilson & Neuberger, joining Wertheim & Co. on his first firm's dissolution at the end of 1932. Mr. Steinbach served as Governor of the New York Stock Exchange from 1964 to 1969. A tall man with a command ing presence, Mr. Steinbach brought a manner of quiet firmness from his business ex perience to the councils of philanthropy in which he be came increasingly active. He was elected assistant treasurer of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in 1954. In May, 1969, Mr. Steinbach, a trustee of each of the Mount Sinai corporate bodies—Hospi tal, Medical Center and School of Medicine—was named chair man of the executive commit tee and first vice chairman of all three. He served Phillips Andover as a charter trustee and Yale as a member of the executive committee of its development board and Commission on Alum ni Affairs. He was president of the Class of 1924 of the Shef field Scientific School and re ceived the Yale Medal in 1965. He was also a recipient of the Yale Engineering As sociation Award. He is survived by his widow, the former Ruth Adler, whom he married in 1925. A funeral service will be held in Temple Emanu‐El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street, at 2:30 P.M. tomorrow.

96-> Strikebound Shows to Try Broadway
Two strikebound Off Broadway shows have an nounced their intention of transferring operations to the Broadway area later this month. Producers of the two stage productions emphasized yes terday that the moves did not have anything to do with the 16‐day‐old strike of actors and managers, which has temporarily closed 16 pro ductions and another perma nently. The decision to change theater locations will permit the Off Broadway showmen to resume interrupted runs of “The Me Nobody Knows,” at the Helen Hayes on Dec. 18, and “Happy Birthday, Wanda June,” at the Edison Theater, 240 West 47th Street, on Dec. 22, under reg ular Broadway contracts. Told last night of the thea ter development, Paul Libin, president of the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers, commented: “If the answer to Off Broadway is to move to Broadway then Off Broadway is dead. Off Broadway is the life blood of the theater. The solution to its problems is not a Broad way production contract.” Mr. Libin said that the transfers did not represent a breach in the league's united position in the strike. Jeff Britton, producer of “The Me Nobody Knows,” which won the Obie (Off Broadway) award as best musical last season, and whose composer and lyricist, Gary Willam Friedman, and Will Holt. responsible for the book, won the Drama Critics’ citation as the most promis ing musical team, said that he “always had had Broad way in mind.” The producer said that the complete original cast will move to Broadway. Meanwhile, both sides in the dispute were summoned last night by Meyer Drucker, director of the State Media tion Board, to meet at the agency's offices, 270 Broad way, starting Friday at 10 A.M. The summons for new talks came after a day of counter‐picketing by dissi dents differing with Equity over the merits of the strike. The rebel demonstration, moving from one struck thea ter to another during the afternoon, involved several dozen actors, actresses, di rectors and playwrights idled by the strike. They were led by Tom Eycn, author and director of “The Dirtiest Show in Town.”

100-> Art Faker Says Work Keeps Real in Greece
ATHENS, March 17—A 43‐ year‐old sculptor, found guil ty with 23 others of counter feiting and selling supposed 3,500‐year old antiques, told a court at Herakleion, Crete today that some of his best works were on display as genuine in foreign museums, including the Louvre and the Munich Museum. Constantine Fthenakis also argued that if it were not for the existence of skilled fak ers, there would be more smuggling of genuine Greek antiquities abroad. The pro spective buyer's knowledge that he might be getting a counterfeit at a high price acted as a deterrent to illicit trafficking in antiquities, he said. Fthenakis, identified as the organizer of the ring, was sentenced to 33 months in prison. His accomplices were given lighter sentences and fines. The sculptor and his asso ciates specialized in statu ettes and jewelry of the Minoan civilization that flourished in Crete 3,500 years ago. Their works sold from $500 to $7,000.

102-> For Lovers of Wildlife, There Is Still a Haven in Botswana
MAUN, Botswana — Much of the old Africa is gone, and what is left is disappear ing fast under the wheels of tourist‐filled micro‐buses and the plows of land‐hungry populations. One vast corner of wilder ness remains in northern Botswana, and it still has the power to delight the senses and to evoke the wonder that early African travelers felt. Almost untouched by tour ists before 1962, it is at tracting wealthy sportsmen eager to hunt big game. Along with a national park only two years old and an other new game preserve, it will probably evolve slowly into a general attraction for travelers. At the heart of the area is the life‐giving Okavango River Delta, popularly called the Okavango Swamp. The waters tumble down from Angola through South‐West Africa and then spread out into a 7,000‐square‐mile dead end. To the north and northeast is savannah and brush coun try teeming with kudu, sa ble, elephant, buffalo, lion and common game. It is still infested with the tsetse fly, so there is no present dan ger of pressure from human habitation or domestic stock. The first professional white hunters began to bring clients to Botswana from East Africa in 1962. In 1968 six safari companies renewed exclusive long‐term agreements with the Government on access to huge hunting concessions. Although a safari costs a client $154 a day for a min imum of 21 days — not in cluding stiff license and taxi dermy fees — most of the companies are booked far in advance and must turn away applicants. One of the best‐known companies is Ker, Downey & Selby, with headquarters in Nairobi. Harry Selby, a fa mous name in African hunt ing, runs the operation in Botswana, assisted by five white hunters. The company has a concession area of about 4,500 square miles, larger than many African na tional parks. Mr. Selby was taking 40 hunters a year into the area, but last year he voluntarily cut the limit to 30. “We pre fer to undershoot,” said Mr. Selby, a shy, quiet man of 45 who has retained an al most boyish look. The number of lions is dwindling; otherwise hunting offers no real danger to wild life populations. The controls that afford the protection mean, however, that sports hunting cannot be much in creased. The safari companies have grossed more than $800,000 annually in recent years and the Botswana Government earned more than $260,000 in fees from hunting, but as Mr. Selby remarked, “the real fu ture will be in nonhunting tourism.” He recently opened a lodge on the Kwhai River, and other investors plan to de velop lodges in The now‐al most‐inaccessible Chobe Na tional Park, which drew only about 4,000 visitors last year and is one of the least crowd ed wildlife areas in Africa. The game in Botswana should last for generations, although there have been few restrictions on how much is killed by the population of only 600,000. Recently they have been hunting for meat to sell commercially and for hides, and some observers be lieve that such practices are a great threat. One charm of northern Botswana is its inaccessibili ty. The metropolis of the area is Maun, a sandy, sun drenched town of 6,000 peo ple on the southern fringe of the Okavango Swamp. The traveler can fly to Maun five days a week in a nine‐pas senger plane, but the rough road from the rail line in eastern Botswana is 310 miles long — without a gas oline pump, garage or bill board. Big herds of wildebeeste and zebra, gray with dust, scatter across the road, and dainty duiker leap into the bush. From Maun a traveler can begin to explore the hun dreds of miles of waterways of the delta. Unlike the usual conception of a swamp, it is a delicate network of flow ing streams, with the water perfectly clear and pure to drink, although it is now tinged a light bottle green from the annual grass fires. The heart of the swamp requires days to reach by ca noe, but a few hardy tour ists are taking such trips with guides. “When you get deep in, it is some of the most beauti ful country in the world,” said one of them, Lloyd Wilmot, “full of game and unchanged.” South of Maun lies the northern section of the Ka lahari Desert, another great African phenomenon, which supports such tenacious forms of life as the rapier‐horned gemsbok antelope and the Bushman. The Bushmen, a non‐Ne groid people with Mongoloid characteristics, were the ori ginal inhabitants of southern Africa but fled into the des ert before the invading Ban tus. Only about 30,000 survive in Botswana and only about 5,000 continue to live the wild desert life, sustained by what may be the most skillful wilderness craft in the world. When necessary they can live without water, squeezing moisture from roots and using the body fluids of animals. They are hard to find be cause centuries of abuse have made them frightened and shy of other races, whom they call the Dangerous Peo ple. One clan, the Kung, give themselves a name that can be translated “the Harmless people” or “It's only me.”

103-> CREW OF SOYUZ 9 SWITCHES ORBIT
MOSCOW, June 2 (AP)—The Soviet Union's manned Soyuz switched orbit today and suf fered fouled portholes, appar ently as a result of the ma neuver. Tass, the Soviet press agency, said” that Vitaly I. Sevastyanov, the civilian flight engineer, had “analyzed the soiling of port holes, caused by the work of the propelling engine,” after a manual maneuver and course correction performed by the flight commander, Col. Andrian G. Nikolayev, a veteran of the manned flight program. The report indicated that the incident happened after the fifth orbit in an otherwise trouble free flight that began with an unusual night launching yes terday. Tass said that after 14 orbits and 20 hours in space Soyuz 9 was circling the earth every 89.05 minutes at 132 to 166 miles above the earth. “The cosmonauts have ful filled the program of the first day of the flight,” the agency reported. It did not indicate how long the space craft would stay up. As the two Russians circled the globe, Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin had a cordial meeting with Neil A. Armstrong, the United States astronaut, and re ceived from President Nixon fragment of the moon brought hack on the Apollo 11 voyage. Mr. Kosygin was also given small Soviet flag carried on the moon voyage last July. The Premier said to Mr. Arm strong: “Please convey to the American President my pro found gratitude for this won derful gift. We will always cherish this gift as a symbol of a great achievement. “The Soviet Government and Soviet people are second to none in admiring your great courage and knowledge. We are happy to have this great man among us.” The Premier showed great in terest in the moon and asked many questions about condi tions there. Tass said that in their first working day aloft the Soyuz crewmen carried out “observa tions and photographed geolog ical objects on the earth's sur face.” MOSCOW, June 2 (UPI) — The Soyuz 9 crew said before their launching that their geo logical observations from space could discover uncharted mineral deposits, spot flood danger from snow cover and fulfill other major tasks for the national economy.

105-> MOSCOW SAYS U.S. IS TORN BY CRISIS
MOSCOW, June 9—The So viet Union, in an analysis of the world revolutionary movement, described the United States to day as torn by internal crises and rapidly losing influence in Western Europe and Latin America. A 5,000‐word editorial in Pravda, the Communist party newspaper, said the last year was marked by “a favorable di rection for the revolutionary movement” and setbacks for the United States, which was called “the main danger for the cause of peace, freedom and security.” The analysis, keyed to the anniversary this week of last year's Moscow meeting of world Communist parties, was a basic party document, certain to be referred to by Soviet propagandists in coming months. Western diplomats said the parts devoted to the United States seemed to reflect the in terest the Kremlin leadership takes in domestic development in the United States. Leonid I. Brezhnev, the party leader, in two speeches in the fast six weeks, has referred to a crisis in the United States and many Communist theorists are thought to be interested in prospects that might open up around the world if the United States reduces its overseas commitments. The United States was the only “imperialist” nation cri ticized in the analysis, under scoring Soviet efforts to isolate Washington in the world arena and erode American influence. The editorial, presumably written by the party's Central Committee staff, said that in the last year “new masses of people have joined the struggle against imperialism, people who but recently were far re moved from politics.” “Vivid evidence of the in creasing opposition to the imperialist criminal policy is the situation that has now arisen in the United States itself,” it said. “American society is ex periencing a profound crisis. The biggest imperialist power demonstrates a conflict be tween the heights of technical development and the deaths of a social system in which the leaders of the propertied class insolently disregard human lives and the interests of the people,” Pravda said. It said “broad masses” of Americans were being drawn into “the movement of protest, which assumes ever greater political acuteness.” “The United States Govern ment has never before been confronted with such a stormy mass protest of millions of Americans against its policies,” Pravda continued. “A serious division has arisen also among the ruling circles, many of whose influen tial representatives have been shocked by the adventurist actions of the United States Government,” the editorial said. Soviet policy has been marked by an effort to im prove ties with West European countries, while seeking to weaken the bonds of the North Atlantic alliance. The analysis reflected this effort. “Everyone is aware of the unprecedented unanimity and determination with which the public in NATO countries de manded that their governments openly and unequivocally dis sociate themselves from Wash ington's policies and condemn Nixon's decision to invade Cambodia,” Pravda said. The editorial said that “even the governments that formerly slavishly proclaimed their soli darity with every gambit of Washington now prefer either to dissociate themselves from this decision or to resort to various ruses and maneuvers, to camouflage their pro‐Ameri can stand.” West Germany, which until this year had been linked to American imperialism, was was praised, reflecting the suc cessful preliminary negotiations so far between Bonn and Mos cow on a renunciation of force. Pravda said there had been “a growth or realistic and pro gressive forces” in West Ger many. This, it said, “is another fresh symptom of the change in the political situation in Western Europe.” In Latin America, the edi torial found “serious cracks” in the support for American policies. “Growing in many Latin American countries is an under standing of the need for a reso lute resistence to the Yankee imperialists and for providing opportunities for independent and free national development of these countries, for genuine economic and social progress,” it said. In the last two years, the Soviet Union has followed a more active policy toward Latin America while improv ing its relations with Cuba. Diplomatic ties have been es tablished with a number of South American countries. Around the world, Pravda said, there are grounds for en couragement in the support for the Arab and Vietnamese causes, and in such develop ments as coups in the Sudan. ?? and somalia that put leftist governments in power.

107-> Television
CHARLES J. CURRAN, the new Director‐Gen eral of the British Broadcasting Corpora tion, is a man with a refresh ing outlook on many familiar problems of television both here and abroad. During a recent stay here. Curran, who succeeded Sir Hugh Greene as active head of Britain's noncommercial broadcasting organization, naturally es chewed dabbling in the af fairs of the country in which he was a visitor, but his opinions clearly had an inter osting domestic applicability. In an interview recently, Curran advanced the view that conservative political leaders of many nations often are at a disadvantage in the effective use of television. “The philosophy of the right is in the guts and in the feel ings of the individual and these can't be presented over the air in persuasive visual terms,” he said. “Liberals have a way with words that simply get across. I have told the Conservatives at home any number of times that if they had men of intelligence who also knew how to speak on TV, their troubles would be over. They need an Ed mund Burke.” Curran's judgment is inter esting on this side of the Atlantic because it may go a long way toward explaining the frequent TV appearances here of William F. Buckley Jr., a man of the right who certainly does know how to write and speak articulately and with wit and who at tracts even those members of the younger generation who disagree strongly with his political position. One could legitimately muse over whether the same theory might not explain the obvious acceptance by this country's “silent majority” of the assorted speeches of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. Whether his speeches are ghostwritten or essentially his own literary creations is immaterial. A phrase such as “effete snobs” catches the ear of those who dissent from his philosophy even as it ex presses the “gut” emotions of those who with him. Noting that both British and American television come under a steady stream of criticism from all sides, Cur ran said that anyone who was professionally engaged in a branch of communica tions, be it the printed word or electronic journalism, nec essarily had an obligation to be articulate and critical of the general drift of events in society. In the case of the BBC, Curran said, the organization is regularly caught in a cross fire of conflicting opinions and that he envisions his role as a stimulus to such argu ments. Otherwise, he ob served, TV and radio could not produce a provocative dialogue resulting in con structive decisions for country's future. Curran said that he was not thinking in terms of the familiar provisions of “equal time.” “Bertrand Russell could kill an argument in one sentence.” he noted. He agreed that the appearance of balance was an important factor in avoiding charges of cultural or informational bias and said he rode herd on his staff to make sure that an exceptionally intelligent individual was not paired off with a dull one, which would make a mockery of equal time. It was Curran's guess that elections would be held in Britain in October, though he did not rule out the possibil ity of June. He said the Con servative and Labor parties would each receive five hours of free time on the BBC, and the Liberals two hours. No politician is allowed to buy time on either radio or tele vision during the three weeks of formal campaigning after the dissolution of Parliament. He also said there was a mistaken impression in the United States that Great Britain did not condone po litical campaign expenditures simply because there was no charge for use of TV or radio, a point advanced in Wash ington by some politicians who complain of the high cost of video campaigning here. In their advance in formal campaigning, Curran said, it was a fair guess that both the Conservative and Labor parties spend close to $5‐million for rental of halls, pamphlets, rallies and plac ards, But, he added, neither party had a significant emo ?? other because the Conser vative support came from party sympathizers or corpo rations while Labor was aided by a check‐off of trade union dues. “A man of modest means has a good chance to become Prime Minister or a Member of Parliament,” he said. Of interest to Americans concerned over the financing of public television was Cur ran's observation that the noncommercial BBC opera tion is now about $16‐million in debt despite annual taxes on radio and TV sets in household use. It has been suggested that a tax on the sale of new receivers could provide an economic base for noncommercial TV and radio in this country. Curran said the corporation hoped to work off the deficit through an extra tax of $12 a year on use of color TV receivers. “Color could be our salvation,” he said. In Brit ain the majority of sets are rented rather than bought outright, the consumer's solu tion to the repair and main tenance problem. There is a commercial TV service in Britain but the BBC has never subscribed to the belief that it should relegate the equivalent of public broadcasting to some elec tronic ghetto. Rather, the cor poration believes that cultu ral or specialized program ing should be part of the over‐all television mix on its two channels, and Curran said that giving the majority of viewers popular entertain ment underwrote the cost of giving selective viewers what they wished. But traditionally the BBC has preferred to treat a cul tural undertaking simply as one more program. Curran said that viewers often stay with the more highbrow presentation simply because it is not defined as such. If not, he noted, they try either the other BBC channel or the commercial service. To meet the economic fears of trade unions and the cul tural fears of Britons who do not wish to be devoured by American culture, both the BBC and its commercial counterpart, the Independent Television Authority, impose a programing limit of 12½ per cent on imports from the United States. “We select only the best of what you have to offer and rarely more than two shows of the same kind,” Curran said. Which perhaps is why so many observers believe the BBC ranks with the finest in global TV. According to Cur ran, BBC research shows vir tually a 50–50 split in audi ence preference between commercial and noncommer cial TV. However, he added with a smile, the commercial program contractors in Brit ain would probably insist they were a bit ahead. But that statistical footnote en couraged the strong suspi cion that Curran relished the competition between two TV systems following different managerial orientations.

109-> LAY TEACHERS JOIN NATIONAL UNION
The 2500.lay teachers in the Roman. Catholic schools of the New York Archdiocese have joined an independent local of the American Federation of Teachers. The federation, with 210,000 members, is the second largest teachers’ organization in the country. The National Educa tion Association has more than 1,000,000. The teachers, who were or ganized as the Catholic .Lay Teachers Group, are now char tered as the Federation of Catholic Teachers, Local 2092. They received their charters Monday night at the Warwick Hotel,‐ 65 West 54th Street, from Albert Shenker, vice pres ident of the American Federa tion of Teachers and president of the Federation of Teachers, a local of the na tional body. The Catholic local union covers Manhattan, the Bronx’ and Staten Island along with seven upstate counties of the archdiocese. It claims to rep‐, resent lay teachers in 300 ele mentary and high schools ex cept the 10 high schools op erated directly by the arch diocese. The other schools are operated by parishes or relig ious communities. Last winter the group threatened to strike the Cath olic schools unless its demands’ for higher salaries and better working conditions were met. It won increases, putting starting pay at $6,100 a year for elementary teachers and $7,200 for high school teach ers. The respective maximums are $9,100 and $13,200. Barry T. Ryan, president of the new federation, said the affiliation was “a giant step forward.” He said that,’ as local of the A.F.T., “we will join the ever‐growing number of affiliated teacher unions now located in the dioceses of Chi cago, Philadelphia, Toledo and San Diego.” During contract negotiations that ended last January, the teachers had the local United Federation of Teachers’ support including legal advice and strike preparations. The new group will now have the .sup port of the national body and of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O.

110-> SAIGON UNITS RAZE BASE IN CAMBODIA
SAIGON, South Vietnam, April 15 — South Vietnamese troops, operating with a token force of Cambodians, destroyed a North Vietnamese base camp inside Cambodia yesterday in the first major combined oper ation reported in the war, informed sources said today. South Vietnamese headquar ters said that 179 North Viet namese had been killed, 30 persons detained and 550 straw huts and bunkers destroyed. It said the assault had been made half a mile on the South Viet namese side of the border, 42 miles northwest of Saigon. [In Pnompenh, the Cam bodian Foreign Minister, Yem Sambaur, informed chiefs of foreign diplomatic missions, including that of the United States, of the appeal made yesterday by Premier Lon Nol for arms assistance to enable his country to resist an invasion by Vietnamese Communist forces.] President Nguyen Van Thieu denied, as did the military headquarters, that South Vietnamese troops had crossed the border. But witnesses said that a joint task force of more than 2,000 South Vietnamese soldiers and 100 Cambodians had push ed at least a mile inside Cam bodian territory south of High way 1. The witnesses said that the Cambodian troops, clearly dis, tinguishable by their uniforms, had been under command of the South Vietnamese. Some were riding on tanks and armored personnel carriers. Most carried Soviet AK47 as sault rifles, but some were said to have had American‐made carbines and to have drawn their ammunition, mortar shells, food and water from the South Vietnamese. The witnesses said they had seen no U.S. advisers cross the border with the South Viet namese units. Instead, the Americans observed the oper ations from a South Vietnamese border post on the main Saigon Pnompenh highway that was wrecked by North Vietnamese rockets and assault troops in an attack Monday night. The action yesterday raged over a five‐mile front in the Cambodian region known to the United States military as the Parrot's Beak. Special to The New York Times SAIGON, South Vietnam, April 15—Allied troops have greatly intensified their oper ations near the Cambodian bor der west of Saigon in the last three weeks, with South Viet namese forces occasionally crossing over to battle North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops in their border sanctu aries. These operations across the border, like most of those carried out by South Vietnamese troops in combat areas, are ad vised, supplied and supported by the American military com mand. South Vietnamese soldiers have crossed the border at least four times in the last three weeks to battle enemy forces. Artillery barrages and air strikes across the border have become routine, and meet ings between Cambodian and South Vietnamese military men have become common. The United States Embassy in Sai gon has granted authority for United States advisers to con duct similar meetings with Cambodians. Although United States ground troops have not been seen crossing the border, they have been seen within a few hundred yards of it in the last few days. By all appearances, the hug ging of the border by allied units from Binhlong Province southwest to the Gulf of Siam has made enemy units there at least uncomfortable and nerv ous. Allied field commanders near the border say that reports of fighting between the Vietna mese Communitst forces and the Cambodian units on they other side are an indication of the effectivness of the border effort. “They're threshing around over there because they must be under some pressure and need some elbow room,” one American military intelligence officer said. The hope of the allied com mander near the border is that the Cambodian Army has seri ous intentions plus the ability to push eastward against the enemy units in a kind of squeeze play. That hope, how ever, is not shared by those who have seen the Cambodian troops and judged them no match for the North Vietna mese and Vietcong regulars. Reports from Cambodia have indicated in recent days that, the Communist‐led forces have pushed westward into Cambodi an towns and over Cambodian military outposts with minor re sistance. by South Vietnamese troops. South Vietnamese soldiers crossed the border at two points yesterday in battles with the Vietcong as American newsmen watched. In Chaudoc Province north of Anphu, local‐force sol diers and neighborhood militia men men were seen by a reporter on the Cambodian side of a nar row canal that separates the two countries. In southern Tavninh Province, west of Godauha, meanwhile, another reporter said he had watched South Vietnamese troops inside Cambodia help ing Cambodian troops rebuild an outpost hit by the Viet cong the night before. The Cam bodian forces also came into South Vietnam to get supplies from allied troops. Special to The New York Times PNOMPENH, Cambodia, April 15 — Informed sources re ported indications today of an impending major Vietnamese Communist offensive in the rub ber plantation region along the South Vietnamese frontier north of the Parrot's Beak region, now largely in Communist hands. After the fall of the frontier village of Krek, confirmed to day by Information Minister Trinh Hoanh, the more impor tant center of Memot is now menaced. The plantations are owned largely by French interests and managed largely by Frenchmen.

112-> A wait Selling Climax To End Market Drop
The stock market's retreat is now more than a year and a half old and pessimism reigns on Wall Street. Where the tailspin will end nobody knows, but an in creasingly prevalent view is that an old‐fashioned selling climax is the needed ingre dient. Such a climax would rep resent the final, gasping purge of all the excesses that went into the bull mar ket of the nineteen‐sixties. It would have to come at a time when the mood of stockbrokers is blackest, when the growling of the bears has all but obliterated the final bleating of the bulls. “I'd feel much better about this market if we had one,” said Robert H. Stovall, part ner in charge of investment policy at Reynolds & Co. It is perhaps ironic that a spate of heavy selling would be considered a positive sign and that many analysts ac tually are hoping for it to happen. They are disillusioned by the steadiness of the decline in share prices, by the in ability of the market to sus tain a worthwhile rally, by the slowness of turnover, by the repeated failure of in dividual stocks to react to good news and even by the sorry state of the bond mar ket, where record yields are providing powerful attrac tion away from stocks. There is no unanimity about what will be needed to make up a selling climax, but some market pundits feel that it will have to dwarf the plunges of 1929 and 1962, both in terms of vol ume and price change. This could mean several 20‐mil lion‐share sessions, with the Dow‐Jones industrial average nosediving through a psycho logical support level such as 700 and posting daily declines of 20 points or more. The trigger probably would have to be an item of bad news—“something as bad as Cambodia,” says one broker —and it would have to be equally unexpected. “This is what makes predicting the timing of a selling climax al most impossible, because if it were predictable it wouldn't happen,” the same broker observes. Ralph A. Rotnem, an ex pert on crisis merkets who advises Harris, Upham & Co, noted that the market seldom in history has stayed in an oversold condition for as long as it has recently. “Such action,” he said, “has usually preceded selling cli maxes in the past.” Mr. Rotnem's statement was made prior to the Fed eral Reserve Board's an nouncement Tuesday of a re duction in margin require ments from 80 to 65 per cent, which sparked a market rally Wednesday. Analysts note that changed margin rules do not by themselves alter major market trends and that it is possible that the Fed's action merely de layed the inevitable. Although the Federal Re serve's past cuts in margin requirements in the post‐war era tended to come within a few months of a market bottom, last Tuesday's action did not actually change the investment outlook. It had no bearing on corporate profits or the state of the economy or the American involvement in Cambodia or the bombing of North Viet nam. “The margin cut is obvi ously welcome, but one would feel better if it did not come while the market was in the throes of a steep decline and at its lowest level in almost seven years,” said Newton D. Zinder of E. F. Hutton & Co. “The timing of the cut naturally raises the suspicion that the monetary authori ties are trying to shore up the market here.” Howard Stein, president of the Dreyfus Fund, thinks it may be another month before the market bottoms out. “I hate to see this purge taking place,” he said, “but I think it's happening. Maybe we should have a pessimism index. It would have to be at an all‐time high.” Like Mr. Rotnem, he be lieves some remnants of spec ulative fever still are present in the market and that they will have to be squeezed out in a few tumultuous sessions before the foundation can be laid for a worthwhile ad vance. Mr. Stein is not convinced, however, that the bear mar ket must die with a climax. “This purge could just keep oozing down,” he says. “It could finally reach the point where there's nothing left to be sold and nobody to sell it to. Then it could just end very quietly.” The Dreyfus president be lieves there will he little basis for a market rally until some fundamental changes have been made in the avail ability of corporate cash. “This market won't stabilize until the pressure is taken off the bond market,” he says. “and the only way to do this is for the Federal Reserve to pet the commer cial banks to remove the pressure form corporations to refinance their short‐term loans.” ?? customers hack to their cornmercial banks to tell them they are unable to raise short‐term debt. The last technical selling climax occurred Aug. 30, 1966, and after a few weeks the market began moving up ward in the bull phase that lasted until late 1968. The Dow‐Jones industrials cur rently are slightly beneath the lows they reached during the tight money period of 1966, but other major indi cators of non‐blue‐chip stocks are still relatively high. For example, the price level on the American Stock Exchange, where the list gen erally is much more specula tive, recently was 83 per cent above the crisis low of 1966 and the over‐the‐counter price index stood at 72 per cent above its 1966 bottom. This implies to some analysts that plenty of froth remains. What happens after a sell ing climax? Mr. Rotnem has figures showing that the Dow industrials rose 33 per cent in two sessions following Black Tuesday in 1929. The gain was 13 per cent in 10 sessions after the 1937 break, 4½ per cent in one session after the 1946 drop and 7 per cent in two sessions after the 1957 climax. Following Blue Monday in 1962 the Dow soared 12 per cent in one session and it rose 9½ per cent in 12 ses sions after the credit crisis in the late summer of 1966. The average gain following each selling climax since 1929 was 13.2 per cent and it lasted an average of 4 2/3 days. Following these emotional spasms, however, the market tended to drop again, usually losing somewhat more than had been gained. In only one case—in 1957—did the mar ket make its low on the day of the selling climax. “Climax days seldom pro duce the final low,” Mr. Rot nem reports, “but they usu ally offer quick traders ex cellent trading opportunities and often signal the begin ning of the end of important declines.”

113-> HANOI BIDS U.S. SET A WITHDRAWAL DATE
PARIS, Dec. 23—The North Vietnamese called on the Nixon Administration today to agree to withdraw American forces from Vietnam by next June 30 or to suggest another date. They offered to help the United States meet the deadline if need be. Xuan Thuy, head of Hanoi's delegation to the Parts peace talks, appeared to modify the priorities of his peace proposals, but a United States spokesman voiced doubt that the remarks represented any change. The re vision, if such it was, came in a sentence inserted into the prepared text of a statement read to the 96th session of the talks. “If the GOvernment of the United States acts in this way,” Mr. They declared, “the parties can also enter immediately into discussion of the total cessation of the cruel war that is now going on in Vietnam and of the respect of the fundamental na tional rights and the right of self‐determination of the Viet namese people. A North Vietnamese spokes man later affirmed under ques tioning that the rights implied the replacement of the “puppet” regime in Saigon, as the Com munist delegates repeated sev eral times today. In previous meetings the Communists have coupled the pledge of American withdrawal with the ouster of the Thieu‐Ky regime as condi tions for a cease‐fire. “I see no change,” Stephen Ledogar, the American spokes man, said at a news conference. “If there is a change intended, then it remains to be seen.” He emphasized that the United States would not accept any “preconditions to the beginning of negotiations.”

114-> T.W.A. Sees Loss of Up to $65‐Million
Top management of Trans World Airlines conceded to its creditors last night that the troubled carrier was going to suffer a doss this year of be tween $60‐million and $65 million. However, the airline sought to reassure the creditors that rumors that the company faced collapse “are completely unfounded.” In a 90‐minute meeting in the Biltmore Hotel, to which representatives of 150 leading lending and banking institu tions were ‘invited but from which the press was barred, Charles C. Tillinghast Jr., chair man and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement that the worst was behind the company. He told the forum that a substantial improvement would occur in 1971. Mr. Tillinghast forecast’ mar ginal results for next year and moderate profits for 1972 and 1973. In 1969, the company had a net income of $19.9‐mil lion, of which $11.9‐million was derived from airline opera tions and $7.9‐million from its Hilton International Company subsidiary. T.W.A.'s current cash posi tion stands at about $30‐mi1 lion, the meeting was told. While the airline's 1971 cash requirements for capital ex penditures, debt retirement and working capital will exceed $350‐million, the company ex pects to meet this through de preciation charges and “finan cial arrangements which cur rently exist or are to be final ized shortly.” Since July 1, the airline has drawn down $75‐million of a $250 ‐ million revolving bank credit. It is expected to draw down an additional $25‐million by the end of the month and, the bulk of the remainder dur ing 1971. The company also is trying to arrange a $30‐million leasing credit for hangar and related ground facilities at Los Angeles International Airport and a $13‐million Kansas City. airport facilities credit. Depre ciation reserves next year are expected to .run about $125 million. Through the Chase Manhat tan Bank here, T.W.A. is try ing to arrange a $100‐million Eurodollar revolving credit. It is understood that $65‐million of such a credit appears firm for drawing down in 1972. This borrowing, if needed, could be used next year. The airlines executives said that $1‐billion of anticipated capital needs through 1973 could be met within the bor rowing limitations contained in the company's existing fi nancial agreements. Over that period, they assured their lend ers and potential lenders that T.W.A. was sure it would not violate any of the restrictive clauses of its borrowing agree ments. Continued on Pg. 103,Column 8 cast results and to the long run financial viability of the entire domestic trunk airline industry. The company's spokesmen at last night's meet ing in addition to Mr. Tilling hast were F. C. (Bud) Wiser, president; Wayne G. English, senior vice president‐finance, and M. A. Brenner, vice presi dent‐marketing. Meetings with the principal lenders are held at least once a year by T.W.A. Newspaper reporters were told that the meeting that normally would have been held next month was moved up to yesterday in an attempt to dispel adverse ru mors regarding the ‐company's financial condition.

116-> His Doctor Says Pope Was Struck, in Manila
ROME, Dec. 23 (Reuters). —Pope Paul's personal physi cian, Prof, Mario Fontana, said today that the Pope was struck twice during an at tempt on his life in Manila last Nov. 27, according to ANSA, the Italian news agency. The doctor was comment ing on Italian press reports that the Pope's assailant, Benjamin Mendoza y Amor Flores had wounded the 73 year‐old Pope. According to the Italian agency, Mr. Fontana said, “The Pope was struck twice, but I am not in a position to say by whom and how.” Dr. Fontana told ANSA he had not personally witnessed the attack and had nothing further to say. According to a report yes terday in the Bologna news paper ?? Resto Del Carlino, the Pope was struck twice on the neck and slightly wounded when Mendoza, a Bolivian painter, lunged at him with a I2‐inch dagger.

117-> 1,000 JAM PARKd FOR METS’ GAME
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., March 3—For the first time since they won the World Se ries last Oct. 16, the New York Mets played a baseball game today. It was a kind of choose tip, seven‐inning scrimmage in which the Yogis defeated the Pigs, 5‐1, with the help of three straight hits by Ron Swoboda, the unhappy employe. Despite the informality, the game attracted one of the most remarkable crowds in recent years. A throng that over flowed the grandstand, sat on beach chairs and stood behind ropes ringing the Outfield grass. No count was kept and the estimates ranged from 1,000 up, which is big for a weekday workout. They were an enthusi astic bunch that cheered Red Garrett and Jerry Koosman just as crowds in a distant spring time here used to cheer Babe Ruth and Stan Musial. Excitement Is Catching That is, the, excitement that the Mets stirred last summer has stretched into the Gulf of Mexico resorts this spring. They don't play a formal ,exhibition game until Saturday, but long lines formed outside the box office when tickets went on sale yesterday and a citizen's campaign has been started to relay Mets radio broadcasts into Florida during the regular season. In past springtimes the Mets, occasionally played in solitary splendor, relieved by Casey Stengel's humor and reflections by critics that they were so bad they couldn't even beat themselves in an intramural game. But on this sunny after noon, on a minor league field, the Age of the Mets thrived. Four students from a nearby school for umpires kept order in the game, and the rules were waived so that they sometimes skipped the pitcher in the bat ting order. On the mound, each pitcher was limited to 30 throws to protect the arms that carried the Mets to the top. The rival managers, Yogi Berra and Joe Pignatano, coached the bases for both teams while the supermanager, Gil Hodges, watched like a hawk from the community bench. Eight Pitchers Work In this festive setting, eight pitchers worked: Nolan Ryan, Jesse Hudson, Ron Taylor and Fred Reahm for the Yogis and Danny Frisella, Jon Matlack, Cal Koonce and Koosnan for the Pigs. The first quartet allowed only two hits, the second was jostled for 11. And the best bat was swung by Swoboda, who was a bitter holdout a week ago, before—and after—signing for $40,000. The first Met run of the spring was produced off Ryan by Jerry Grote, his roommate and fellow Texan, with a triple to left center. That was scored for the Pigs in the second inn ing. In the fifth, the Yogis rallied behind a two‐run double by Swoboda, who already had hit two singles. Later, he walked and scored on a delayed steal plus a wild throw by the pitch er—the only flashback of the day to the Mets frantic years. “I should have held out a lit tle longer,” Swoboda observed later.

118-> U.S. Is Pressing Suits in the North to Eliminate De Facto Segregation
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4—While tomorrow will bring the newest in a series of school desegrega tion deadlines in the South, Tuesday will bring a milestone of a different, rarer sort—in the field of desegregation of Northern and Western schools. Tomorrow's deadline is in Mississippi, where 30 school districts were ordered to de segregate by the Supreme Court last October. Far from Dixie, a Federal trial begins Tuesday to weigh charges of racial segregation of schools in Pasadena, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, and site of the Rose Bowl game and parade last week. That trial is in one of seven cases involving non‐Southern school desegregation already pressed by the Department of Justice. The total, department officials say, is likely to in crease. These “Northern” cases dif fer markedly from more familiar desegregation actions in the South. There, until recently, school segregation was ordained by state and local law. De segregation suits challenged denial of equal protection of the laws on the basis of race. Outside the South, however, there were no such segregation laws, civil rights authorities note, making legal challenge to segregation more difficult. “We are working on this problem,” Attorney General John N. Mitchell has said, “be cause in many areas, de facto segregation caused by housing patterns is just as difficult to handle and just as unreal as the de jure segregation that ex isted in the South.” In the Pasadena case, the city board of education is charged with more than pas sively tolerating de facto seg regation. The civil action ac cuses the board of taking de liberate steps to maintain racial segregation. The suit was filed in August, 1968, by parents of three schoolgirls, two of them white, and joined in by the Depart ment of Justice in November, 1968. The school district contains 81,000 students in 37 schools in Pasadena, Altadena and Sierra Madre. About 30 per cent of the students are black. The school board, the suit charges, has adjusted student assignment zones to concen trate black students in certain schools. Is is also alleged to have discriminated against black teachers in hiring and has assigned such teachers predom inantly to schools with black majorities. In addition, the suit says, the, board has limited black enroll ment at predominantly white schools to quotas of 30 per cent. The case, to be tried in Unit ed States District Court in Los Angeles, is somewhat parallel to the first of the seven “Northern” cases involving the. Department of Justice. That case concerned a suburban dis trict outside Chicago and re sulted in a strong court order requiring desgregation action last fall. The Government lost the only other Northern school case yet tried, in Tulsa, Okla. An appeal of that defeat will be heard this week in Denver by the United States Court of Ap peals for the 10th Circuit. In another case, school offi cials in East St. Louis, Ill., settled with the Government out of court. Three other cases are awaiting trial. These con cern Indianapolis, Madison County, Ill., and Waterbury, Conn. Only two of the seven cases have been brought in the Nixon Administration, but Justice De partment officials say extensive work is going into the prepara tion of other potential actions. In one of these, the depart ment is negotiating with school officials in Chicago concerning what it believes is discrimi natory assignment of teachers. “These are all relatively easy cases,” says David L. Norman, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for civil rights. “There are zone lines drawn around Negro areas, or other specific things done which look very much like discrimination. The hard question hasn't beer raised yet, either baldly of boldly.” He identified this as whether a school board—even one that has not taken discriminatory steps—has a fundamental re sponsibility to act against racia isolation of school children irrespective of residential pat terms. “In time,” Mr. Norman says “that will be the frontier of the law on this subject”

119-> DRAFT CHIEF BARS EXEMPTION BASED ON PERSONAL CODE
WASHINGTON, June 16— The Selective Service Director, Curtis W. Tarr, announced to day stringent new standards to be applied by draft boards to determine if young men can qualify for exemptions as con scientious objectors under yes terday's Supreme Court deci sion. The Court ruled that draft registrants are entitled to con scientious objector status ever though they deny holding re ligious beliefs as long as theft opposition to military service is based upon “deeply felt” moral or ethical beliefs. At a news conference this morning Mr. Tarr described the substance of guidelines that will require young men to prove that their views are not only deeply felt but are also the product of “some kind of train ing” and consultation with a “system of belief” beyond a purely personal moral code. Mr. Tarr also announced that the new lottery to select draft sequence numbers for men born in 1951 would be held on July 1. He added that a mandatory order was being issued to all draft boards, instructing them that they must reconsider the classification of any draft reg istrants, including those already classified 1‐A, who present new facts in a claim for reclassifi cation. This order states the essence of a second decision handed down yesterday by the Supreme Court. Mr. Tarr stated in his own words the substance of four standards that each applicant for conscientious objector sta tus will be expected to satisfy if he is to be granted an ex emption. They are: 1. There must be “no question” that the applicant's belief is sincere. 2. The applicant must be op posed to war in all forms, and not just to the war in Vietnam. 3. The applicant's belief must be something more than a personal moral code. He must have taken into account the thoughts of “other wise men” and must have con sulted “some system of be lief” beyond the scope of his own thoughts. 4. The applicant's views must be the product of “some kind of rigorous training.” Mr. Tarr conceded that these criteria would operate to the disadvantage of uneducated men who might be unable to point to studies or training as the foundation of their opposition to military service. “The better trained a man is and the more sharpened his in tellect in the matter of religion and philosophy,” the better his chances of gaining draft‐ex empt status, Mr. Tarr said. He added that uneducated men were already at some dis advantage in applying for draft exempt status. The new system only “augments to some degree the burden” on an uneducated man, Mr. Tarr said. He ex pressed the hope that the sys tem could eliminate as many of these inequities as possible. In its ruling yesterday the Supreme Court held that con scientious objector status should have been granted to Elliott A. Welsh 2d, a Califor nian whose beliefs were based upon readings in philosophy, history and sociology. Asked today if Mr. Welsh could qualify as a conscientious objector under the new criteria, which require proof of “rigor ous training,” Mr. Tarr replied that Mr. Welsh could qualify because the Supreme Court has said that he qualifies. The draft chief expressed confidence that the new ruling would not be applied retroac tively to affect the status of men ordered to report for in duction. It is also not expected to help any of the men who have fled to Canada to escape the draft. Mr. Tarr said that ruling would be unlikely to free nu merous men from military obli gation because it would be difficult for many applicants to convince their draft boards that their views were sincere or based upon “rigorous training.” However, he conceded that the number of applications would probably increase, plac ing heavy pressure on draft boards and appeal boards. “It certainly would make our job easier,” he said if Congress would amend the Selective Service Law to reverse the Court's decision. There are two classifications of conscientious objectors, 1‐A‐O and 1‐O. Men classified 1‐A‐O must, if they are drafted, serve in the military in a noncombatant role. Selective Service System officials do not know how many have this classification, but military experts estimate that there are about 4,500 such men, a substantial number of whom are serving as combat medics. Ven classified 1‐O must, if their draft lottery number is reached, perform two years of “alternate duty.” Such duty in cludes civilian work in an ap proved socially useful occupa tion, such as a hospital orderly. A review of Selective Service figures today suggested that draft officials had understated the impact of conscientious ob jectors on the draft system in their initial reaction yesterday to the Court decision. It was said that there were only about 40,000 objectors, out of more than nine million draft‐age men. When conscientious objec tors beyond draft age are sub tracted from the total, there are only about 36,500 men of draft age who have conscien tious objector's status. Howev er, such status is assigned only when a man would otherwise be drafted. For instance, men with student deferments or physical disabilities would not be classified as C.O.'s, even if they qualify. Therefore, the 36,500 men with conscientious objector classifications must be com pared with the 895,500 men who are classified 1‐A and are eligible for the draft. This means that more than 4 per cent of the men qualified for the draft are conscientious ob jectors. This is a substantial increase over 1965, when the Supreme Court announced another draft ruling, United States v. Sieger, which began the process of opening up conscientious objec tor status to nonreligious men. In that year there were about 20,000 C.O.'s compared with 1.1 million men classified 1‐A. The new Supreme Court rul ing does not apply to Cassius Clay, the former heavyweight boxing champion. He based his claim for C.O. status upon his asserted religious beliefs as a Black Muslim but was not be lieved.

121-> Independent Rumanians' Spines Stiffened by Disasters and Soviet Pressure
BUCHAREST, June 5—Ru mania continues to proclaim a policy of purposeful independ ence despite disastrous floods that have weakened her eco nomically and new pressure from Moscow. Nicolae Ceausescu, head of state and party chief, who has been touring the country, has been saying over and over in speeches to flood victims that the principles of his policy re main unchanged—national in dependence and sovereignty, noninterference in the internal affairs of other states, equality between governments and be tween Communist parties, and the right of each party to shape its own policies. The reassuring speeches, for eign diplomats here believe, were necessary because Mr. Ceausescu's sudden trip to Mos cow at the height of the flood disaster surprised and worried many Rumanians. The uneasi ness was increased a week later when his Premier, Ion Georghe Maurer, also flew there. The Soviet leaders have been making strong efforts to tight en the Eastern bloc militarily, economically and politically. The pressure on the Ruma nians is believed to be strong. Now, it is felt, Mr. Ceauses cu's speeches have cleared the air. It has long been his stra tegy at moments of crisis to issue unequivocal statements and thus to commit himself to positions from which he would find it hard to retreat even if the pressures to do so were great. Rumanian officials are sure enough of the Government's stance to tell visitors that it will not give on any of the three major points at issue, with Moscow. The issue of Warsaw Pact. maneuvers, which would bring Soviet and other Eastern European armed forces onto Rumanian soil, is believed to have been shelved for this year after the Rumanans repeatedly and strenuously opposed them. The second issue was the Rumanians' refusal to partici pate in a new Eastern European investment bank set up by the Russians and their partners two weeks ago in Warsaw at a meeting of Comecon, the East ern European organization for economic cooperation. Rumanian sources say that their country's refusal was prompted chiefly by Soviet in sistence that the bank's decisions be made by a two‐thirds majority of the member coun tries instead of unanimously. Third, the Rumanians make it clear that the terms of the recently concluded Soviet Czechoslovak friendship treaty could not possibly apply to them, even though Andrei A. Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, declared that it should become a model for all Eastern European states. The Rumanians object to two features in the Prague docu ment. The Czech Government implicity agreed to have its soldiers fight alongside the Rus sians if the Soviet Union were attacked from the east—in other words, by the Chinese— while under the Warsaw Pact, to which Rumania is a signa tory, the commitment was limit ed to aggression from Europe. The Rumanians have good relations with the Chinese, who have just given them the equiv alent of $400,000 in flood relief, by far the largest single con tribution. There are rumors that Premier Chou En‐lai may be planning a visit. Furthermore, the Soviet Czechoslovak treaty formalized the so‐called Brezhnev Doctrine of limited sovereignty by giving the Russians the right to inter vene in Czechoslovakia without invitation whenever they felt they had to do so to counteract “antisocialist forces.” The Rumanians stand by a draft friendship treaty that con tained none of those features and was initialed by the two Governments two years ago but never signed. Under these circumstances Western diplomats here find it difficult to imagine why, as is persistently reported, Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet party chief, and other leaders plan to visit here this summer for the first time since 1966. Mr. Brezh nev was scheduled to come last year, according to informed sources, but called off his trip so as not to appear on the heels of President Nixon. The flood disaster seems to have strengthened the determi nation of the Rumanians to per sist in their course. They have been buoyed by the aid they have received from all over the world and by the feeling of not standing alone. Rumania is the only Eastern European country that has dip lomatic relations with Israel, and the first relief plane came from there, with aid from the United States and the Nether lands close close behind. The Soviet Union waited a week before sending a message and an offer of aid. I Western concerns have of fered to repair or replace in dustrial equipment they had furnished that has been dam aged.

122-> Gov. Farrar Wins Renomination in South Dakota
SIOUX FALLS, S.D., June 2 (AP) —Gov. Frank L. Farrar won renomination in the South Dakota primary tonight over his Republican opponent, Frank Henderson. State Representative Dexter Gunderson of Irene swept by four opponents to capture the G.O.P. Congressional nomina tion to meet the Democratic candidate, Frank Denholm, in November. Mr. Denholm was unopposed. Four Republicans were vying for their party's nomination for the state's other Congressional seat, while three Democrats were competing to be their party's nominee. The incumbent Representa tives, Ben Reifel and E. Y. Berry, did not seek re‐election. With nearly 70 per cent of South Dakota's precincts re porting, Governor Farrar had 29,059 votes to Mr. Hender son's 20,640. The Democratic guberna torial candidate, Richard Kneip, was unopposed. The 41‐year‐old Governor, serving his first term, was pressed hard throughout the campaign to explain how he became a millionare while serv ing as attorney general and Governor. Late in the campaign Mr. Farrar disclosed that he had borrowed heavily in recent years to build a business enter prise. Most of his investments are in banks and real estate. Mr. Farrar said he believed in borrowing money for invest ments during inflation and urged others to do the same. DES MOINES, Iowa, June 2 (AP) — Republican Representa tive Fred Schwengel, the only Iowa Congressman with pri mary opposition, easily won re nomination today in a primary that generated few issues and little voter interest. In the only statewide race, former Lieut. Gov. Robert Ful ton held a mounting lead over the State House minority lead err, William Gannon, in the Democratic race for Governor with more than half the returns counted. Their combined total, how ever, was far short of the vote run up by Gov. Robert Ray, running unopposed in the Re publican primary. With 81.4 per cent of the precincts reporting, Represen tative Schwengel had 20,046 votes to 16,060 for a former State Senate majority leader, David Stanley. JACKSON, Miss., June 2 (UPI)—Dr. Ray Lee, a small town physician and backer of the private school movement, [apparently defeated State Sen ator James Arden Barnett to day in a rare Republican Con gressional primary in Misissippi. The winner will oppose Repre sentative Charles Griffin of Utica, a Democrat, in the No vember general election. Unofficial returns showed Dr. Lee with 3,570 votes to 2,015 for his opponent with 239 of the 302 precincts reporting in the 12‐county 3d Congressional District. Senator John C. Stennis and the state's five Congressmen, all Democrats, advanced to the November general election without primary opposition. HELENA, Mont., June 2 (AP) —Mike Mansfield, the Senate majority leader since 1961, easily overpowered two Demo cratic primary challengers to day to win renomination for a fourth term. From almost the start of un official vote counting, the 67‐ year‐old Mansfield held a 5‐to 1 lead over his closest oppo nent. In returns from 142 of 1,014 precincts, Senator Mansfield had 12,195 votes to 2,579 for Tom McDonald, 35, Flathead Indian from Arlee, and 2,292 for John Lawlor, 31, Havre rancher.

124-> Argentine Junta Pledges A Return to Civilian Rule
BUENOS AIRES, June 9— The three commanders of the Argentine armed forces who deposed President Juan Carlos Ongania, pledged today that they would give Argentina a civilian Government through elections. But they gave no date. In the meantime, they said, they would move to quiet the widespread discontent aroused by the stringent economic poli cies of the Ongania regime. Lieut. Gen. Alejandro Agustin Lanusse of the Army, Adm. Ped ro J. Gnavi of the Navy and Brig. Gen. Juan Carlos Rey of the Air Force signed a military decree this afternoon making their take‐over official 16 hours after they had forced Lieuten ant General Ongania to resign. The three commanders, who have pledged to name a new President in 10 days, made their promise of an elected government in both the decree and on an appearance on radio and television. Speaking on behalf of the junta, Admiral Gnavi criticized General Ongania for having re fused to move toward re‐es tablishment of civilian rule in Argentina. General Ongania himself was installed as Presi dent four years ago when the then heads of the armed ser vices deposed President Arturo Umberto Illia. But at the time there was no mention of any elections or a return to civilian rule. In the decree, the junta lauded the economic attain ments of General Ongania, who cut the annual inflation rate to 6.6 per cent last year from around 30 per cent when he assumed power in 1966. During his regime, the Argentine peso became one of the strongest currencies of Latin America. While his hard‐peso policy attracted foreign investment, there was mass discontent over rising prices and lagging wages, and this the junta promised to correct. In the aftermath of the coup, which came last evening, banks and money‐changing shops were closed to prevent specula tion. Everything else seemed normal on this chilly and gloomy autumn morning. Argentines had listened through much of yesterday to a “radio war” between the junta and Ongania supporters, in which the President was re peatedly called upon to resign. And so the take‐over came as no surprise. What does puzzle the aver age Argentine is the role, if any, in the coup of former President Pedro E. Aramburu, who was kidnapped May 29 and who has not been heard of since. Many close observers of Ar gentine politics believe that General Aramburu, who was President from 1955 to 1958, was removed by Ongania sup porters who believed he was plotting to oust the increasing ly unpopular president. There are equally strong views that hold that he hid himself to embarrass General Ongania and to point up the president's inability to cope with a rising tide of terrorism. The mystery was compound ed by frequent phone calls to newspaper offices saying that General Aramburu would re turn from Montevideo, some 80 miles across the Rio de la Plata in a day or so. And there also have been assertions pur portedly from a terrorist group that it had executed General Aramburu. General Ongania had been under pressure since the labor riots in May of last year. The fear of renewed violence prompted the military chiefs to ask his resignation last week end. These requests were turned down by the dour and conserv ative General Ongania, who had mounted a campaign in compliasant newspapers and magazines to popularize him self since early this year. The campaign failed and as Argentines heard the radio calls for his resignation, they crowded Plaza de Mayo before the pink Government House Monday afternoon to shout: “Go Away! Go away!” When the radio demands failed to move General Ongania, officers from the military head quarters, which is across the street in the Buenos Aires fi nancial district, called for the Army to surround the building. General Ongania's aides then said that he would resign and he did. For many Argentines, a major fear is that the new regime will grant wage in creases in excess of pro ductivity and allow a return to severe inflation. But all appeared pleased by the first moves of the junta, in dismissing the nation's two top policemen: The Minister of the Interior, Gen. Francisco Jose Imaz, and the chief of federal police, Gen. Mario Fonseca. All Cabinet and provincial, municipal and other officials were asked to continue in their posts. WASHINGTON, June 9 (AP) —The State Department said today its lawyers were studying what effect the change on the Argentine Government would have on diplomatic relations. A spokesman said at a news briefing, that the study was being made with a view toward “whether the question of diplo matic recognition arises.”

125-> Undercover Agent Recalls How Role Was Almost Discovered by Black Panthers
A detective who pretended to be a Black Panther testified yesterday that his undercover role was nearly discovered when a Panther came close to touching electronic equipment under his shirt while taping a heart‐shaped target to the gar ment. The agent. Detective gene Roberts. said in testimony in State Supreme Court that his role as an infiltrator had nearly been discovered by a member of a class devoted to weapons training conducted by the Panthers. The class member, William E. King, Jr., is one of 13 Black Panthers at whose trial Detec tive Roberts has been a pros secution witness. The defendants are accused of conspiring to bomb public places and shoot policemen, and of possession of dangerous weapons and ex plosives. A recording of the training class, transmitted by Detective Roberts and taped by another detective in an automobile in the area the evening of March 13, 1969, is part of the evi dence presented by the prose cution to the jury. Detective Roberts also trans mitted conversations allegedly held among some of the de fendants on March 11, 1969, during which plans were dis cussed for bombing department stores and shooting policemen. This recording was also intro duced at the trial and played for the jury. However, Detective Roberts testified yesterday, after. the frightening experience of near discovery in the gun class, he wore no more electronic trans mission equipment to Panther meetings. The electronic equipment worn by Detective Roberts in cluded a tiny microphone at tached to his chest with ad hesive tape and a tiny trans mitter under his belt. Detective Roberts said the class had been held at the home of a defendant, John J. Casson, also known as Ali Bey Hassan, for the purpose of learning, through practice with out bullets how to operate guns. The Panthers were divided into teams of two who alter nated as targets for each other, he explained. While the detective's partner, Mr. King, was taping the target on the policeman, “he placed a portion directly over the microphone cord leading from the transmitter up onto my chest,” Mr. Roberts testified. Assistant District Attorney Joseph A. Phillips asked how close Mr. King had come to touching the microphone. “To me it seemed like an eighth of an inch,” Detective Roberts replied. The March 11 tape of con versations allegedly transmitted by Detective Roberts was the subject of sharp argument for nearly two weeks at the trial. When Supreme Court Justice John M. Murtagh first listened to it, he stopped after half was played and declared it too in distinct to present to the jury. Mr. Phillips argued that it was of extreme importance to his case. He persuaded Justice Murtagh to listen again with better equipment and ear phones, and obtained a reversal of the ban despite strong de fense opposition. Yesterday the playing of the March 11 tape for the jury, begun Monday, was com pleted. During it, the jurors ‘heard voices, identified by the prosecution as belonging to several of the defendants, dis cuss plans for bombing depart ment stores, shooting policemen and waging guerrilla warfare in New York City. They also heard a discussion indicating that one of the per sons involved had doubts about, Alex Rackley, a New York Panther who was found murdered in “Connecticut in May, 1969. At the time of the dis cussion Rackley was a karate instructor for the New York Panther chapter. The trial will resume at 2 P.M. today at 100 Centre Street.

126-> Complete Synthesis of Gene Reported
A team at the University of Wisconsin reported yesterday the first complete synthesis of a gene — the inherited, coded “message” that tells a cell how to perform a certain chemical function. While others have used a natural gene to make a new one, in this case a giant yeast molecule was pieced together, link by link. The gene in ques tion consists of 77 such links, or nucleotides. The synthesis was achieved by Dr. H. Gobind Kharana, who won a Nobel Prize in 1968 for his earlier work in this field, and his colleagues at the uni versity in Madison. It marks new step along the road to ward manipulation of the he reditary material in plants, an imals and, perhaps, man. How ever the road, as noted by the announcement, will probably be a long one. For example, whereas the newly synthesized gene has 77 links, the genetic material with in a human cell is estimated to have six billion such units, al though not all are functional. Last November, a group at Harvard reported another major development, the first isolation of a gene. Isolated at that time was the gene that controls the ability of a bacterium, Escher ichia coli, to use its sugar fuel. The term “gene” was devised lat the start of this century by William Bateson at Cambridge University in England. He rec ognized that heredity is not transmitted in an amorphous mixing of material contributed by both parents, like paints on a pallete, but in discrete units, or “genes,” contributed by each. From this evolved the science of genetics. Some 25 years ago it was discovered that the genes con sist of long molecules of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acide) formed of links, or nucleotides. Just as a computer does all of its “thinking” in terms of a binary code (one with only two num bers), so there are only four chemical “signals” within the DNA links. They are paired, two to a link, in such a way that when the links are mated they form a twisted structure or double helix. Dr. Khorana made use of the fact that Dr. Robert W. Hol ley, now at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., had deter mined the structure of another substance within yeast, known as alanine transfer RNA (ribo nucleic acid). Transfer RNA is a substance that is manufactured by DNA as a sort of template for the mass production of proteins that perform a needed function in the cell. Just as one can deduce, from the shape of an automobile body, the structure of the stamping machine that pro duced it, so it was possible to deduce, the 77‐link DNA mole cule that made the substance deciphered by Dr. Holley. With this knowledge, the Wisconsin group first assem bled short strands formed of half‐links of the projected chain. These strands of half links were then mated with matching strands to form seg ments of the complete, twisted structure. Finally, using a nat ural enzyme (DNA ligase) as chemical aid, they joined the segments into the full molecule. The scientists felt reasonably sure of their results because each of the half‐links (contain ing one of the chemical “sig nals”) would only mate with a half‐link containing one of the three other “signals” of the DNA code. Thus, if there was mistake in the sequence, this would tend to become apparent. Specialists in the field, com menting on this work, said Dr. Khorana's ingenuity in manipu lating these strands in the face of various side reactions and other difficulties, was a major achievement. One likened it to figuring out how to assemble the many interlocking parts of an automobile. The next step is to see if the artificial DNA manufac tures its proper daughter prod uct (alanine transfer RNA). The ultimate test would be to insert the DNA into living yeast cells to see if it worked properly. Preliminary chemical tests are already under way. The Wisconsin group is also working on a new synthesis, that of the tyrosine transfer RNA that functions in E. coli. This was selected because there are strains of E. coli (a very common intestinal bacterium) that lack this substance, provid ing a ready means of testing any synthesis product. The report said synthesis of the segments was almost fin ished and that the job should be complete within a few months. Meanwhile, Dr. Khorana hopes to use his technique to manipu late the link sequences in transfer RNA. This could lead to a better understanding of how this substance plays its vital role in all living cells.

127-> U.S. Completes an Inquiry Into G.I.‐Looting Charges
SAIGON, South Vietnam (AP), June 2—The United States command has completed an in vestigation into charges of looting lodged against American troops who captured the Cam bodian town of Snoul last month. Any disciplinary action that may be taken will be car ried out by the units involved, a spokesman said today A motorscooter has been re turned to its owner and a small back‐hoe tractor will be re turned when its owner is found, the command said. Other than the theft of those items, the spokesman said, in vestigators found that the looting that followed the virtual destruction of Snoul on May 6 was limited to “several, per haps five or six, cases of soda pop, which were consumed.” The tractor was taken apparently because it had been used by North Vietnamese soldiers to dig trenches and foxholes, the spokesman said.

128-> Nuclear Workers Strike At Two Oak Ridge Plants
OAK RIDGE, Tenn., April 15 —About 4,400 workers went on strike today for higher wages at two of the three big nuclear plants in Oak Ridge, where to tal employment is more than 13.000. Production of nuclear weap ons components was halted at the Y‐12 plant. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a research facility, 1,200 were out. The workers out are all mem bers of the Atomic Trades and Labor Countil, whose president, B. W. Hensley, said the mem bers voted 2,511 to 588 to re ject what he called a substand ard wage proposal by Union Carbide Nuclear Division, opera tor of the plants for the Atomic Energy Commission. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Dif fusion Plant, which ships en riched uranium for fuel to new nuclear power plants in the United States and abroad, was unaffected.

130-> Soviet Believed Having Trouble Drafting 5‐Year Plan
MOSCOW, June 2—The So viet Union appeared today to have encountered difficulties in drawing up a final draft for the next five‐year plan for 1971–75, which was due to be announced later this year. Tass, the Soviet press agency reported a high‐level meeting “a few days ago” in which Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin and Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Communist party leader, ad dressed leaders and ministers of the national government and of the various Soviet repub lics. According to Tass, Mr. Kosy gin reported on “the main trends” in the plan, and Mr. Brezhnev made a “lengthy speech” on the same topic. Tass said Mr. Brezhnev made an other “lengthy speech” yester day at a meeting of the Govern ment of the Russian Republic, the largest and most important of the 15 states that make up the Soviet Union. The press agency's emphasis on Mr. Brezhnev's “lengthy speeches,” seemed to underscore his personal interest in economic problems, which he has said are now crucial for the Soviet Union. The profit‐oriented economic reform begun in 1965 has ap parently not produced the pro duction upsurge that had been sought. In recent speeches Mr. Brezhnev has been critical of the nation's economic perform ance and of a low level of labor discipline and has called for unspecified approaches to give new life to a sluggish economy. The fact that Mr. Brezhnev's latest remarks were not made public caused speculation among Western diplomats that the contents were critical of preliminary plans drawn up for the neizt five years. The Tass announcement said that the Soviet Government had “instructed” the State Planning Commitre, which draws up the plan, and the various central and regional ministries and governments “to do additional work to make the most efficient use of ma terial and financial resources and insure further growth of the national income and create the necessary reserves.” Although the language was apparently deliberately vague, Western diplomats said Mr. Brezhnev was probably dis satisfied with the requests for funds for the next five years from the various central and regional bodies and reiterated what he has said on other oc casions—that there will be tight control of funds avail able for new projects and that ministries and regional gov ernments will have to get more value from their rubles than they have up to now. Mr. Brezhnev has said that the economy will have to make more effective use of planning mechanisms and technological advances, primarily in the computer field. From articles in the press recently, the impression has been left that the Soviet budg et in future years will be tight, and that heavy industry will get priority over the consumer sector, reversing a trend start ed a few years ago in favor of light industry. Mr. Brezhnev, whose pre eminence in the leadership has been underscored in recent months, made a still unpub lished speech to the party Cen tral Committee last December whose main points, highly critical of the sluggish state of the economy, were revealed by Pravda, the party paper, in January. In a speech made at Khan kov in mid‐April, Mr. Brezhnev told the Soviet people frankly about their problems. Mr. Brezhnev's critical words have not been matched in recent days by his Politburo and Cen tral Committee deputies. Pyotr Y. Shelest, head of the Urani: Ian party, for instance, at tacked Western journalists for asserting that Soviet industry faced a “crisis.”

132-> Stranger in a Brutal Paradise: On the Trail of the Cheetahs
HAT animals do you hope to see today?” G. G. Mbuyanda, our Kikuyu driver, asked my wife and me as he guided the Toyota across the vast, pottery‐colored plains of the Masai Amboseli Reserve in southern Kenya. Cats, we answered, we wanted to see cats. Perhaps a maned lion striding imperiously through the low grass, or a leopard crouched in a tree at the foot of Kilimanjaro, that movie‐set mountain now gleaming above us. However, command performances are rare in Africa. Game reserves are a kind of theater: You pay your admission fee and you enter, knowing you will see a spectacle with a cast of thousands, but never sure, as the scenery changes, what actors will move to the center of the stage. But every member of the au dience is lucky at some time in Africa, for sooner or later everyone sees some thing wondrously beautiful or terribly sad. So we were not too disappointed when no cats crossed our path that February morning in Amboseli. There was anticipation with every bend in the dusty road. At one turn, we encoun tered a truculent rhinoceros which, in its insistence on privacy, chased a but terfly and then decided to chase us. Charging rhinos are not as danger ous as Stewart Granger movies have led us to believe. They are really quite blind, and if we had stood our ground our self‐righteous challenger probably would have pulled up short or missed us entirely. But it was that “probably” that compelled G. G. to slam the car into reverse when he saw the rhino lumbering after us. The photographs came out blurry, but we recall the charge of that snorting leaf‐eater more with a smile than a shudder. We also spent time pursuing a long legged secretary bird that was stalking the grass in search of rodents, the crest of feathers behind its head resembling the quill pens tucked behind the ear of a Victorian clerk. Our car lurched after herds of Thomson's gazelles, bright lit tle creatures that would sniff at us with wet black noses, swish their little tails like windshield wipers and bound away in astonishingly graceful leaps. And we waited patiently near a thick et of thorn trees while a huge bull ele phant stripped an overhanging branch, thoughtfully chomping each mouthful as if respecting some parental admonish ment about chewing his food very care fully before swallowing. For long periods, we saw no animals, but these interludes only served to heighten our sense of expectancy. We would drive from one rise to another, hoping to find something free and wild, but discover nothing more than the empty bush expanding before us. Just before we would give up and turn our thoughts to the big bottles of Tusker beer awaiting us back at camp, the car would chug around another bend and perhaps a half‐dozen species would be laid out before us on the plain—like Steif toys in the window of F.A.O. Schwartz. G.G. would stop the car and light a cigarette, binoculars would be lifted and focused and we would begin to talk in hurried whispers. “Do you see that impala over there?” “There must be 20 baboons in that tree.” “Do you think we can drive closer to the giraffes without scaring them away?” This scene is endlessly repeated for the traveler in Africa, and one never seems to tire of it. Perhaps it is because the animals are neither as tame as the ones you see in the Bronx Zoo nor as dangerous as the ones that leap out at you in Technicolor. It is always as you are seeing them for the first time. It was now early afternoon. The clouds had obscured the snowy peak of Kilimanjaro and we had quite forgotten our search for the cats. I was scanning the plain through the powerful German glasses, my wife was changing yet an other roll of film and G.G. was reaching into the glove compartment for a Sports man, the local Gauloise. Suddenly, he sat up and said, “Out there I see Duma — cheetah.” I trained the glasses in the direction he was pointing, but I could see noth ing but the dry brown grass. I had the high‐power binoculars, but G.G. had those marvelous Ted Williams eyes. He started the car, and we bumped off the road and moved swiftly across the plain. It wasn't until we were a few yards from her that I saw the cheetah. She was sitting quietly and regally in the grass, her yellow eyes searching the plain, her tawny coat dotted with inky circles. She made no move when our car halted a few feet away and, al though we knew that she was aware of us, she refused to turn her head in acknowledgement. The traveler in Africa soon learns that, if he remains In his car, most animals will not flee or menace him; if he attempts to get out of the car, most animals will scamper away, although some will attack him. This general truce, which works to everyone's advantage, is made possible because the animals have grown used to autos and do not associate them with danger, perhaps be cause the odor of gasoline overwhelms the offensive smell of man. Still, it was the indifference and ar rogance of the cheetah that startled and diminished us. People grown accus tomed to tossing peanuts at caged ani mals are unsettled at being regarded as just another beast on the plain. For several minutes, the only move ment was an occasional twitch of the cheetah's long, ringed tail. Then, with aristocratic nonchalance, she turned her small gold and white head and looked our way. I had read that cheetahs will never attack a man, even when cor nered, but, fixed with those intense yel low eyes that seemed to burn into my own, I shifted uneasily. Still the cheetah sat, studying us very carefully, until, apparently satisfied, she dropped on her side ‐ like a house cat and the tension was broken. She yawned a great yawn, giving us a glimpse of her teeth and long pink tongue, and then she began chirping. It was a soft, bird‐like call that seemed odd for an animal that one expected to roar ma jestically and rout the marabou storks from their perches atop the umbrella shaped Acacia trees. Instantly, five cubs exploded from their hiding place in a clump of tall grass. The cubs were only a few weeks old and endowed with none of the grace and dignity of their mother. They were soft and gray, with only a suggestion of spots on their legs, and as they romped forward their manes stood up like hairbrushes. They were on their mother in a flash, more Marx Brothers than beasts of prey, nipping at her neck, licking her muzzle, pushing frantically at her milk. All this the mother cheetah endured with ease and patience. Methodically, she washed each of her cubs with raspy tongue and adjusted her lithe body so that her litter could burrow into her warmth. Once reassured by this show of affection, the cubs grew restless. One tried to, start a game of follow the leader, but after a few go‐rounds the others tired of the game and began to stalk and ambush one another. Soon the grass was flattened in the tumble of little bodies. Teeth were bared and hind legs flashed in quick little kicks at exposed underbellies. But this was kid stuff, lacking in murderous intent. We realized this when their mother rose, stretched and turned her eyes toward the antelopes grazing a few hundred yards away. She didn't quiver, or lick her lips, or growl, but her concentration was so single‐minded, so obsessive, that we instantly recog nized the deadly reason for it: She was hungry. More Marx Brothers The antelopes remained in repose. They seemed to have every advantage over the cheetah. The wind was in their favor and the flat terrain afford ed the cat no cover. In addition, there was a very sound reason, we were told later, why the antelopes —Thomson's gazelles and larger Grant's gazelles and clownish wildebeests—should have been grazing together: One species excels in hearing, one in scent and another in sight, and together they have estab lished a kind of early‐warning system against the approach of their common enemy. We were very quiet in the car, wait ing to see what the cheetah would do. First, she chirped softly at her cubs and they huddled into a ball, making them selves as small and as still as possible in the grass. Cheetah cubs have ene mies. With their mother gone, a hyena prowling nearby would waste little time in snatching one of them in his powerful jaws. Satisfied, however, that her young were secure, the cheetah stretched her long body flat in the grass and began to move with fluid stealth toward a Thom son's gazelle that was grazing a little to the left of the herd. It was to be careful, choreographed attack. When the Tommy's head was bent eating, the chee tah inched forward. When the gazelle raised his head the cheetah froze—a paw suspended in the air, a bent leg kept rigid. When the gazelle resumed eating, the cheetah pressed cautiously ahead. We watched with rising excitement. We knew that if the cheetah advanced to perhaps 150 yards of the gazelle, she would start at him with a comfortable lope and then turn on her blazing speed. The gazelle would run for all its worth, which is considerable — about 45 miles an hour. The cheetah — the fastest of all land mammals and the only cat that depends entirely on speed to run down its prey — can clock 60 miles an hour. But the kill is by no means a math ematical certainty. Like a shifty half back, the gazelle can change its direc tion at top speed — twisting, dodging and bounding high and stiff‐legged in the air. And the gazelle has stamina; it can go 45 miles an hour for a greater distance than the cheetah can do 60. If she were to be successful, the chee tah's pursuit would end quickly and vio lently at a point 600 to 900 feet from where she had shifted into high gear. That distance is all she could do before she would have to stop, exhausted. If she succeeded, she would drag her vic tim by the throat to the shade of a tree and lie there, drained, while her cubs tore frantically at the carcass. A victim claimed, the herd would re turn. The gazelles would lower their heads to the grass and stillness would envelop the plain again. It is all grand and terribly inevitable, and my wife and I, veterans of countless peace marches, found ourselves longing for the kill. But there was not to be one. The gazelle sensed danger and moved hur riedly back to the safety, of the herd, and the cheetah, deciding that the dis tance was too great to overtake an al erted Tommy, slumped in the grass again with a flick of her shoulder. An other chirp and the cubs had blanketed her again. This time, however, the mother was less patient with them. She shook them off, rose on her haunches, and re turned to surveying the plain. But she made no effort to stalk another poten tial victim, seemingly content to wait until another gazelle wandered into her territory. An hour passed. None did. The darkness came fast, and we had to return to our camp. Visitors are not permitted on the park roads at night— another truce between man and the ani mals. Elephants can overturn a stalled car with ease. Impala confused and blinded by headlights will stand paral yzed in the path of an oncoming vehicle. As G.G. turned the auto, we glanced at the cheetah through the back win dow. She was watching for another herd of antelope, and we regretted that we would not be there for the kill that we felt certain would occur when night fell, We resolved to try and find her again the following day. Near the camp stood the thatched roundvels (small huts) of the Amboseli park rangers, and we stopped to ask them about the cheetahs. The rangers knew our cheetah family well; the day before, they had spotted them near the reserve's airstrip and they, too, had observed the mother hunting unsuccess fully. The rangers told us that the mother cheetah had been abandoned soon after mating and hunted alone. Like all chee tahs, she could go for days without food, but her cubs would stay with her for two years. Their appetites are great and their hunger would prod her on. The rangers said, however, that the cheetahs were unlikely to eat that night. because, unlike most cats, they hunt by sight. They are considered excellent hunters, but less than half their attacks are successful. Even if they do com plete a kill, they must be wary be cause other predators might appropriate it. Because cheetahs prefer fresh meat, hunting becomes a virtually constant activity and the young are often left unprotected. The rangers thought that a litter of five was too large for the cheetah and that she would be able to protect only two of the cubs from other predators. My wife and I began to feel a great concern for what had become “our” cheetahs, our lonely, short‐dis tance runners. Nonetheless, we had something spe cial to talk about with the other tourists gathered in the big canvas dining room of the Amboseli Tented Camp. Swapping stories with other guests is the great pastime of the long African evenings. It is practiced with zest and various degrees of one‐upmanship, but it is all done with good humor. Frequently, you learn from other visitors what species are about and where you can find them in the 1,259 square miles of the re serve. One is constantly aware of the com ings and goings of his fellow tourists. Most of them travel in zebra‐striped or leopard‐spotted minibuses of the tour ing companies. But an increasing num ber rent cars from agencies in Nairobi or Mombassa in Kenya or in Arusha, Tanzania. Driving by oneself in East Af rica is obviously not as easy as cruising along U.S. 1, but one need not be combination of Stirling Moss and Henry Stanley to attempt it. Popular‐make compact cars suitable for a small family can be rented for $2.15 a day, plus 22 cents a mile. Chauf feur‐driven cars are available at $3.07 a day, plus 29 cents a mile. It is cus tomary to tip the driver; we gave G.G. about $18 for the nine days we traveled together, and this was considered high by African standards. The ideal travel ing seasons are from June to October and again from December to March. The Amboseli Tented Camp resem bles a military compound: rows of can vas triangles arranged in a horseshoe, each tent looking exactly like the next, each with the same little table and plas tic ashtray and lantern outside. For roughly the same charges — $27 a day for two, including meals — we could have stayed at the more luxuri ously appointed Amboseli New Lodge. But there was something undeniably ro mantic about the camp. The sight of Kilimanjaro from the opening in the tent starts you off. It looks like Hemingway told you It would, “as wide as all the world, great, high and unbelievably white in the sun.” And you lean back on your cot, clutch the imaginary wound in your leg and tell your wife, “The marvelous thing is that it's painless. That's how you know when it starts.” Your wife doesn't answer because she is too busy being Ava Gardner in “Mogambo.” Each tent in Amboseli has an attached shower, shielded on all sides by canvas, but open to the sky. The sun dries you before you can reach for the towel. It's a lovely feeling. Even realists will be impressed by the sounds of an African night. There are the deep‐throated rumbles of lions as hyenas whimper, baboons cough and silvery vervet monkeys scamper in the trees overhead. It is all so theatrical, but it is genuinely thrilling, too. We savored it, speculated about our chee tahs out there in the darkness and slept well. The best time to look for animals is daybreak, when anticipation is high and the sun is low. Usually, G.G. liked to linger over his tea, but that morning he was as anxious as we were to set off after the cheetahs. It was not until the sun had risen over our heads that we found them— near the airstrip, where the rangers had thought they might be. The first act was familiar, but no less fascinating for it being so. The cheetah noted our arri val with a casual stare before returning to her hungry inspection of the plain. The herd of antelopes (was it the same one as yesterday?) remained tantaliz ingly out of her range. G.G. must have guessed our thoughts. “Let's try to get her a gazelle,” he said. “Let's try to drive one toward her. She could have a better chance.” He backed the car away from the cheetahs, drove in a wide loop behind the herd of gazelles and brought the auto to a gentle stop about 20 yards away from them. The sun was in our eyes, dulling the ruddy color of the lit tle antelopes and washing out the deep black lateral stripes on their sides. Then G.G. gunned the motor, the gazelles froze for an instant, bolted, and the chase was on. A small male sprinted across our path. G.G. swerved to the left, lined up the car directly behind him and at tempted to narrow the distance be tween us. The Tommy bounced in the direction of the cheetah, and for the moment it appeared as if our ploy had worked. But the gazelle darted to the right, neatly reversed his field again and left us in the cloud of dust. G.G. maneuvered the Toyota toward another gazelle. The Tommy raised its head and waited wide‐eyed for us to make our move. We suddenly felt a deep sense of shame. G.G. drove back to the cats. If the cheetah was disgusted by our inepti tude, her sphinx‐like stare allowed no hint of it. Morale was low in the car. We were angry at ourselves for med dling, for deciding to play executioner and then for doing a bad thing badly. The intensity of the sun added to our discomfort. Even the cheetah and her cubs seemed drained by the heat. They lay on their sides panting, their sides swelling with every gasp. We watched and worried about them for a long time. Abruptly, a cub stood and began walking guilelessly toward our car. The other cubs scrambled to their feet and followed. Their mother whimpered, but they ignored her. Closer and closer they came, wide‐eyed, in ragged formation. They waddled the length of the car be fore disappearing from my view. “Where are they?” I demanded. “They've crawled under the car,” my wife answered. “What for?” “It's cooler there. We're shading them from the sun. See. We're good for some thing.” But the keen pleasure I felt dis solved instantly into fear. The mother cheetah had risen and was striding pur posefully toward us. Nervously, I rolled up the window. First, we wouldn't leave her alone, I thought. Then we, drove away her meal. Now we have taken her cubs. The cheetah drew up to us, and I found myself caught once again in the stare of her implacable yellow eyes. I braced for her leap; instead, she low ered her body and joined her cubs in the cool darkness under the car. In the hour that followed, other tour ists wheeled up to snap photographs of our cheetahs peering from beneath our car. The cheetahs were still hungry when we left them, but later, at the camp, I slept better than I thought I would.

136-> Harold Phelps Stokes Is Dead; Times Editorial Writer '26–37
WASHINGTON, June 9 — Harold Phelps Stokes, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times from 1926 un til 1937, died Monday at his home after a long illness. He was 83 years old. Before joining The Times, Mr. Phelps had served as Washing ton bureau chief of The New York Evening News and as ex ecutive assistant to Herbert Hoover when Mr. Hoover was Secretary of Commerce. Mr. Stokes, who was born Jan. 10, 1887, in New York, was the son of Anson Phelps Stokes, a prominent banker and the former Helen Louisa Phelps. He was graduated from Groton School in Massachusetts in 1904, and in 1909 he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale. The following year he studied and traveled in the Far East. In 1911 Mr. Stokes joined the staff of The Evening Post as a cub reporter and two years lat er became Albany correspond ent. In 1917 he was commis sioned a second lieutenant in the Army and sent to Europe where he saw action in the Oise‐Aisne and Meuse‐Argonne campaigns. After covering the Paris peace conference for The Evening Post in 1919, Mr. Stokes became chief of the newspaper's Wash ington bureau, succeeding Da vid Lawrence. As such he cov ered many of the most import ant stories of the time, includ ing the Versailles treaty de bate in the Senate and the con ference for limitation of arma ments. In 1923 Mr. Stokes was among newsmen who accom panied President Warren G. Harding on his trip to Alaska. During the course of the trip, the President fell ill and was rushed to San Francisco, where he died Aug. 2. Mr. Stokes's friendship with Herbert Hoover, Mr. Harding's Secretary of Commerce, deep ened during those crisis days in August, 1923. Mr. Hoover con tinued to serve as Commerce Secretary under President Cal vin Coolidge, and in 1924 he persuaded Mr. Stokes to give up his newspaper job and he be came one of his most trusted assistants. In 1926 Mr. Stokes joined the editorial board of The Times. In the next several years he specialized in writing about state and city affairs, and traf fic and transit problems. He was a frequent contributor to The Times Sunday Magazine and the Book review. Because of ill health, Mr. Stokes was forced to give up active work and left The Times in 1937. For a time he lived in Tucson, Ariz., and in Santa Fe, N. M., but eventually set tled in Washington. He wrote occasional freelance articles for The Times and the Saturday Review. He is survived by his widow, the former Elizabeth Miner King, whom he married in 1920; 3 daughters, Mrs. Robert Hawkins of Boulder, Colo., Mrs. Nicholas deB. Katzenbach of New York, and Mrs. Orman Ketcham of Washington; and 10 grandchildren. A funeral service will be held Thursday at Christ Episcopal Church at 11:30 A.M.

A man who has described himself as a member of a rev olutionary Puerto Rican group called MIRA was indicted yes terday for attempted arson and other charges growing out of an alleged attempt to bomb the General Electric Building, at 51st Street and Lexington Avenue. The man, Carlos Feliciano, 41 years old, has also been described as a suspect in sev eral other bombings or at tempted bombings, including one at the New York Public Library and several in depart ment stores. He was arrested May 16 after he allegedly placed a loaf of bread containing a bomb in the doorway of an Army recruiting station at 163d Street and Southern Boulevard, the Bronx. After his arrest, the police said they found bombs, detonators and gunpowder at his home at 313 East 118th Street. MIRA is an acronym derived from its name in Spanish, Movimiento de Independencia Revolutionaria en Armas, or the Armed Independence Revolu tionary Movement.

139-> Apse Takes New ‘Tonic’ At Cloisters
New methods of preserving stone, devised since 1968 by a New York University chem istry professor, may have provided a new lease on long life for the Romanesque Spanish apse, added to the Cloisters in 1961. Dr. Seymour Z. Lewin, who has been engaged in conser vation for some years, nota bly in the wide area of stone preservation, was among sev eral conservators who re viewed their experiments and achievements yesterday at a conference held at the Metro politan Museum of Art. More than 300 delegates from about 50 countries are attending the week‐long an nual conference of the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. The event is the first to be held in this hemisphere. The ancient apse, which was removed from the Church of San Martin at Fuentiduena after complex negotiations that began in 1935, and moved here block by block, was apparently in fair shape, although some what weathered, at the out set of the rebuilding. However, in a year's time scaling began, and in the nine years since it was add ed to the Metropolitan's Medieval complex in Fort Tryon Park, marked deter ioration began to be visible. Various treatments were tried, but to no avail, to stem the degeneration of the limestone exterior surfaces. Then, a year ago, Dr. Lewin began his special treat ment. The deterioration, a cyclic phenomenon that ap peared after each winter, “was completely arrested,” said Joseph V. Noble, the Metropolitan's vice director for administration. The villain of the piece, which has turned crisp carv ings into anonymous blobs in many cities of the world and has transformed sound stone to near‐ruin, is sulphur dioxide—the pollutant from automobile exhausts and coal and oil furnaces. Rain, which absorbs the sulphur dioxide, deposits showers of dilute sulphuric acid on the apse, creating fissures in the golden limestone. And, as the rain freezes and expands with the weather, the havoc wrought strikes deep into the struc ture. Periodically, as Dr. Lewin showed in slides, heaps of crumbled stone are deposited at the foot of the apse. Two new methods were employed by Dr. Lewin, for two kinds of stone were involved. One kind of chemical treat ment was used for limestone, the other, a similar, but more porous, for stone in the struc ture that was used in the re building to replace unusable original blocks or missing blocks. In the case of the limestone, Dr. Lewin's prepa ration consolidated the crum bling, fissured stone, in a technique that worked from the inside to the surface. In the case of the more porous replacement blocks, Dr. Lewin devised a chemical mixture that lays a glassy deposit over the stone. “This is virtually completely resist ant to the environment, and because of its chemical simi larity to the mineral constit uents of the stone, tends to adhere firmly to the grains. ... An essential feature of this process is the fact that the individual grains are pro tected, without the pore spaces being filled in, or the surface of the stone becom ing sealed,” he said.

140-> Training Program Is Urged to Put More Nurses in City Hospitals
A demand for large‐scale training programs to alleviate the critical shortage of nurses and technicians in municipal hospitals has been made to the city' new Health and Hospitals Corporation. The demand is being pressed by two professional organiza tions and a labor union: the New York State Nurses Asso ciations, the Committee of In terns and Residents of New York City and District Council 37 of the State, County and Municipal Employes Union. The three groups called for a commitment by the Hospitals Corporation before July 1, the date when it will take over the city's 18 public hospitals. Their demand is spelled out in an eight‐page letter sent last week to the corporation and the city's Office of Labor Relations and made public yesterday. Victor Gottbaum, executive director of the union, at a news conference at the Com modore Hotel, said: “The city hospitals need total of about 10,000 more em ployes, including 5,000 nurses —and that's a conservative es timate.” As of last March, the city hospitals had a total of 4,151 registered nurses, although 7, 996 were authorized. Mr. Gottbaum said he was confident the three groups would be granted an early meeting with Dr. Joseph T. English, the corporation's chief executive, and the board of directors. Highlights of the joint pro posal were as follows: ¶The placement of at least 1,200 nurses aides each year in training programs for ad vancement to more skilled po sitions. These would include 250 in a one‐year program to become licensed practical nurs es and 50 in a two‐year pro gram to become registered nurses. In addition, 900 would be trained as technicians. ¶Placement of at least 300 licensed practical nurses in full‐ time study programs preparing registered nurses. ¶Expansion of existing in training programs for regis tered nurses, and the granting of full tuition reimbursement for registered nurses enrolled in part‐time study in academic in stitutions. ¶Creation of 650 “unit ad ministrator” positions within the city hospital system. ¶Establishment of a $250,000 revolving fund to enable the city to get living quarters for nurses, technicians and aides.

142-> E. M. Forster
So long as a need exists to identify and impale racial and social prejudice, the novels and essays of Edward Morgan Forster will be read. For in such books as “A Passage to India” and “A Room With View” he exposed, in a quintessential way, the human flaws of hypocrisy and repression. Forster was part of a circle of English writers and thinkers—including Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, D. H. Lawrence—who flourished between Bloomsbury and Cambridge before and after the First World War. Their avant‐garde glory passed with the coming of the Second World War and the rise of today's hyperactive, personalized writing—and what Forster once called “pseudo ‐scholarship.” But what he and his friends had to say about social, sexual and political repression lasts. Although insular in some ways, they were creative visionaries in other ways, unwilling to be fooled by governments or authoritarian leaders, and contributing life styles of personal and scholarly freedom. For Forster and his friends were uncompromising believers in democracy. He called himself “an individualist and a liberal” even as he found true liberalism crumbling around him. He believed in the critical press, despite its short comings, and in the existence of a parliament, despite its crankiness. E. M. Forster's fiction can be read for its purity and insight alone, but his legacy can best be found in one of his essays: “So two cheers for democracy: one because it admits variety and one because it permits criticism. Two cheers are quite enough: there is no occasion to give three. Only Love, the Beloved Republic, deserves that.”

144-> Astoria Compromise
As an interim answer to a difficult problem requir ing immediate resolution, Mayor Lindsay's compro mise decision on the proposed generating plant in As toria has much to recommend it. Consolidated Edison has won permission to go ahead and build what it re gards as urgently needed capacity to meet this com munity's electricity needs. But those who opposed the project because of understandable fear of additional pollution can console themselves that the expansion will be only half that originally reauested. Unfortunately, before the Mayor settled the issue, he fostered a bitter public debate that not only pitted some of his key subordinates against each other, but also inflamed the passions and fears of many. The angry reactions of some Astoria residents to the Lindsay compromise raise the unhappy possi bility that the dispute has not ended, and that new and difficult roadblocks may appear to hamper those trying to build even the smaller generating plant the Mayor has approved. The future may show, however, that the real im portance of Mayor Lindsay's decision was its enuncia tion of an important principle fundamental to a ra tional antipollution policy. In effect, Mr. Lindsay has recognized that the city's supply of clean air is limited resource whose availability must be protected by a comprehensive policy that takes account of all sources of pollution, rather than merely dealing with individual sources in isolation. “If some pollution inevitable and the choice is between sufficient elec trical power or streets congested with automobiles,” the Mayor said, “I would choose electrical power.” Having articulated his correct understanding that tradeoffs must be calculated and choices made, Mayor Lindsay has already appointed a five‐member commit tee to work out a plan for limiting motor vehicle pol lution here. The organization called Citizens for Clean Air has gone a step further and asked the Mayor to ban private automobile traffic from Manhattan south of 59th Street during business hours. This is the di rection in which the city must move to protect its most precious possession, the air its citizens breathe.

145-> 39 Elderly in a Chartered Bus Hurt in Crash in Pennsylvania
ALLENTOWN, Pa., Aug. 23 (UPI)—Thirty‐nine elderly per sons were injured today when a chartered bus carrying them to a religious shrine ran off a wet road and crashed. The bus, owned by the East Penn Transportation Company of Pottsville, Pa., was carrying members of the Polish Women's Alliance of America from Shenandoah, Pa., on an annual feast day pilgrimage to the na tional shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa in Doylestown, Pa. The head of the Vatican apostolic delegation to the United States, Archbishop Luigi Raimondi, celebrated the mass at the shrine. Eight women were hospital ized, including three reported to be in guarded condition at Osteopathic Hospital here. The others, including the 26‐year‐old driver, James Bialek of Mahanoy City, Pa., were re leased. Narrow Highway The bus crashed on a narrow, two‐lane stretch of Route 309 where it cuts through a hill two miles north of the Route 22 interchange. It was on this highway, also designated as In terstate Route 78, that a char tered bus crashed last July 15 about 10 miles west of here, killing seven children from private school on Long, Island who were touring the Pennsyl vania Dutch country. Patrolman Donald MacCon nell of the South Whitehall Po lice Department said the bus driver hold told him that the southbound bus skidded on the wet highway, began to fishtail and “then he really lost it” as the bus entered a gap between rocks on the side of the road. “The bus struck the rock em bankment on its side six feet from the road and then spun across the highway and struck the other embankment, Patrol man MacConnell said.

156-> Goodell Announces Official Senate Bid
Senator Charles E. Goodell announced yesterday that he would seek a full six‐year term and said he and Governor Rockefeller had “agreed to disagree on many issues” dur ing the coming campaign. Mr. Goodell, the former Rep resentative from Jamestown, was appointed 18 months ago to complete the term of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. He opened his campaign by saying that he expected to get the Republican nomination without opposition and hoped to get the Liberal party nomination as well. As a Senator, Mr. Goodell has quickly become a national fig ure because of his opposition to the war in Vietnam. He has also regularly attacked Presi dent Nixon, rejected Mr. Rocke feller's personal plea to support the Safeguard antiballistic mis sile system and opposed two of Mr. Nixon's Supreme Court nominees—all the time collect ing Republican critics and Dem ocratic charges that he is an “instant liberal.” But, according to polls taken by most parties, he has also become one of the best known and potentially best vote get ters in the state. After seeing one of several polls that show Mr. Goodell beginning the cam paign far ahead of his current Democratic rivals, Governor Rockefeller announced two months ago that he wanted the Senator running with him on the Republican ticket this year. “We've agreed to disagree on many issues,” Mr. Goodell said yesterday. Port of that agree ment, he said, is that he will concentrate on national issues in the campaign and the Gov ernor on state issues to avoid as much public conflict as pos sible. The Governor's personal com mitment has gradually quieted county Republican chairman who had been attacking the the Senator's liberal record and urging that he be dropped from the ticket infavor of a more conservative candidate. In news conferences yesterday here and in Buffalo, Mr. Good ell said: “I am a Republican. I support the candidacy of Nelson A. Rockefeller for Governor. I do not anticipate a primary fight. I've found that I have more support in the Republican pri mary than is generally attrib uted to me.” There will apparently be only token opposition to Mr. Goodell when the Republican State Committee meets April 6 in Rochester to nominate its state wide ticket. Two men—State Senator Ed ward Speno of Nassau County and Robert Reeves, former County Attorney of Rensselaer County—have announced their Senate candidacies, but neither is expected to receive the 25 per cent of committee votes re quired to get on the June 23 primary election ballot. It is also possible to get on the primary ballot by collecting 10,000 signatures on petitions, with at least 50 names from each of 47 counties. Mr. Goodell, who had made no secret of his ambitions for fulll term, made his official an nouncement yesterday morning before 200 people at the Park Sheraton Hotel here. He then flew to Buffalo to repeat the statement to 300 people at the Statler Hilton Hotel. In New York, the crowd was dominated by young people wearing peace symbols, and Mr. Goodell stood with Senator Jacob K. Javits. In Buffalo, much of the crowd looked middle‐aged Republican, and Mr. Goodell invited William E. Miller, the former Representa tive who was Barry Goldwater's Vice‐Presidential nominee in 1964, to join him on the stage. In New York, Mr. Goodell's endorsement of Mr. Rockefeller was greeted with absolute si lence. In Buffalo, the mention of the Governor's name drew the afternoon's loudest ap plause. While flying between the cit ies in a chartered Mohawk Air lines plane, Mr. Goodell dis cussed the coordination of his campaign with Mr. Rocke feller's, his hopes for the Liberal party nomination and his biggest problem, raising the $3‐million he thinks he will need for the campaign. “Rockefeller and I will have a joint headquarters in Man hattan, but other than that our campaigns will be entirely sepa rate,” he said. The ambivalent relationship between the two campaignsis pointed out by two facts: Harry Albright, a member of the Gov ernor's personal staff made this trip with Mr. Goodell, but the two candidates have not ex changed the information they have derived from polls on separate issues. On Liberal backing, Mr. Goodell said he had not met with party leaders but would ask for such a meeting in the next few days. On campaign financing, he said that $13,000 was the most he had ever spent on his Con gressional campaigns and that he was still trying to organize his finance committee for this year. The Senator also mentioned one other endorsement that he would like to have, that of Mayor Lindsay. He said he had no commitment from the Mayor — whom he supported last year — but he would be “surprised” if Mr. Lindsay, did not eventu ally help him this year. Mr. Goodell—who was ac companied throughout the day by his wife and five sons— finished the day with a recep tion at his home in Jamestown.

157-> F.C.C. Seeks Ideas On Relay Satellites
WASHINGTON, March 24 — After four years of study of the use of space satellites by domestic telephone and tele vision networks, the Federal Communications Commission announced today that it still could not decide which systems would be useful or who should operate them. The commission gave Ameri can industry a general invita tion to submit specific satellite plans, but it offered only a few broad guidelines as to the shape the new system should take. It is “preferable,” the commis sion declared, “to permit poten tial applicants to take the initiative in submitting concrete system proposals for the com mission's consideration.” Dean Burch, the commission chairman, in a news conference, estimated that it would take at least three more years to put a domestic satellite system into operation. The Communications Satel lite Corporation (Comsat), the Government‐chartered company that operates a worldwide satellite network for interna tional message service, con firmed today that it would ask permission to operate a multi purpose sateilite system in the domestic market. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said it planned to use satellite facil ities—though not necessarily to build its own — as a supple ment to its vast cable network on the ground. The Federal Communications Commission's policy state ment today put a special bur den on A.T.&T. to prove, be fore venturing into space, that its monopoly control over the earthbound telephone system would not impede innovative, competitive exploitation of the, promise of space communica tions. Other potential applicants for domestic satellite rights include the Western Union Tele graph Company, the commercial television networks, cable tele vision systems; specialized car riers of computerized data and the Ford Foundation, which has urged that the savings inherent in satellite link‐ups be used as a permanent subsidy for edu cational television. The F.C.C. reserved the right to grant or reject the different satellite applications that are being put forward. But in is suing an open‐ended invitation to private proposals, the com mission has postponed the re solution of controversial policy questions and has apparently made itself a relatively passive arbiter among rival applicants. The debate over satellites has involved competing bids for ownership, the demand of different potential users for special‐function and multipur pose satellites, the advantages of competitive free enterprise over monopoly and, occasion ally, skeptical views as to the need for satellite service in nation with a sophisticated, rapidly developing network of terrestrial communications fa cilities. Until today, the Federal agency had been expected to make a clear choice between two alternatives. Under a plan developed by the commission's staff two years ago, Comsat would have been authorized to build a multipurpose pilot sys tem. The F.C.C. would have retained close control not only over the rates that Comsat charged but also over experi mentation with the new tech nology. Other communications companies would have had a chance to invest in the sys tem's ground stations, and ownership of the satellite itself would have been resolved only after the two‐to‐three‐year trial run period. The other possibility, recom mended by the White House last January, was for the wide open, virtually unregulated ex ploitation of the satellite mar ket by any company that ap peared technically and finan cially equipped. The commission's perplexity reflects a wider, growing puz zlement about the practical role of satellites. A decade ago, when science fiction descriptions of bouncing messages through space proved workable, some enthusiasts pre dicted that satellites would make it possible to make a phone call anywhere in the world Xfor 10 cents. The Ford Foundation stirred general excitement with its sug gestion that satellite economies could divert up to $30‐million a year to noncommercial tele vision. Many specialists, on the other hand, are now doubtful that any domestic satellite system, can be economically viable. The principal reason for their doubt is the rapid development of high‐capacity cables and micro wave lines, which will carry many more circuits, at still lower cost, than satellites can. And the three commerical networks, irritated by A.T. &T's rate increases for interconnec tion of their affiliated sta tions, have often described their own independent satellite hook up as a bargain. The most modern satellite, which Comsat will put into in ternational service next year, can carry up to 9,600 voice messages at a time. By contrast, A. T. & T's L‐4 coaxial cable, introduced three years ago, can carry 32,400 cir cuits, and the L‐5 cable that will be ready in 1973 will carry 90,000 circuits. Long‐distance transmission, for which satellites would be principally used, is already the most economical form of serv ice in the A.T.&T. system.

159-> Data Concerns Can Sue Banks; Reserve Clears Rochester Deal
WASHINGTON, March 3 (AP) —The Supreme Court gave data processing companies today the right to sue on claims that national banks are illegally in vading their domain. The 6‐2 decision opened ad ministrative rulings by the Con troller of the Currency regard ing the scope of national bank activities to judicial review. Justice William 0. Douglas, speaking for the court recog nized that the decision was furthering a trend toward wider judicial scrutiny over administrative actions by en larging the class of people who may protest rulings with law suits. The decision did not judge the merits of the complaint by the data processing companies. They have alleged illegal in vasion of various fields of busi ness activity by national banks. This includes travel, insurance. revenue bonds and investment funds. Challenged in the case at hand is a 1966 ruling by the Controller that “incidental to its banking services, a na tional bank may make avail able its data‐nrocessing equip ment or perform data‐process ing services on such equip ment for other banks and bank customers.” Mr. Douglas said there could be no doubt the Association of Data Processing Service or ganizations and other petition ers have satisfied the test that the challenged ruling has caused them economic injury. The suit is directed at Amer ican National Bank & Trust Company. The Douglas opinion said Section 4 of the Federal Aria Service Corporation Ant of 1962 allowed competitors of banks to bring such suits. Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Byron R. White dis sented, saying economic injury should be sufficient grounds to maintain a law suit. They questioned whether the major ity, was not adding an undue burden by also suggesting companies that bring suits should show the challenged governmental action evaded a legally protected interest.

160-> KEOGH IS VICTOR IN TWO‐MILE RACE
The 14th annual St. Francis Prep Games, a 10‐hour school boy track affair, got off on the wrong foot yesterday, but end ed with some outstanding per formances. Early arrivals at the 102d En gineers Armory, and there were many more on hand than usual for a 10 A.M. start, were greet ed with the news that Denis Fikes, the top‐rated runner from Rice, had been scratched from the two‐mile run, the first event. The fans were disappointed but even more chagrined was little Mike Keogh, Essex Catho lic's premiere two‐miler. “I had my heart set on heating Denis and maybe breaking the rec ord,” the 5‐foot‐8‐inch, 125‐ pound senior said. He was re ferring to Art Du Long's flat floor mark of 9:09.2. Many schoolboy track buffs had pre dicted this for a race between Keogh and Fikes. Fikes was scratched from the race because of illness. Joe O'Keefe, the Rice coach, said that the talented senior had been out of school for three days and was still confined to his bed yesterday. “He has been bothered by a stubborn respira tory infection,” O'Keefe said. “and I'm just hoping he'll re spond to treatment shortly.” As the race turned out, Keogh ran all by himself al most all the way and set a meet record of 9 minutes 18 seconds. It was his second major meet mark this season. He ran 9:14.4 at the Loughlin meet in Decem ber. While the two‐mile time was below expectations, the 1,000‐ yard run clocking of 2:13.3 by Joe Savage of Roselle (N. J.) Catholic was not. This was the third fastest schoolboy 1,000 ever run. Only the races won by John Brady in 1968 (2:12.4, the national record) and Brian McElroy in 1969 (2:12.6) have been swifter. Savage, a senior who is headed for Manhattan College as is Keogh, had to rally to win. He got off last, was hit by an elbow on the second turn, but still managed to get into first by the 880 mark (1:56.8) and won by 6 yards from Cliff Bruce of Rice. First Attempt at 1,000 It was Savage's first attempt at the 1,000‐yard distance. He holds the national flat‐floor rec ord of 1:53.3 for the 880. “I'm still not in top shape,” the New Jersey runner said. “I was asleep at the switch when the gun went off. I was thinking too far ahead of the race it self. I had to fight back and I know I lost valuable time in so doing.” There was a tragedy on the sidelines just as Savage crossed the tape. The No. 1 follower of the Roselle track team, John Stuart, a 57‐year old resident of that city, collapsed from an apparent heart attack. Only fast life‐saving work by Dr. James Marshall, the meet's physician, and Gerard O'Connor saved the stricken spectator's life. O'Connor, a lieutenant on the Newark police force and a stanch rooter for Essex Catho‐, lic, the chief rival of Roselle Catholic in New Jersey, quickly administered mouth ‐ to ‐ mouth resucitation.. “Mr. Stuart was turning blue at that point,” Dr. Marshall said, “but we man aged to get his heart pumping again in the nick of time.” Stuart was rushed to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital where he was placed in the intensive‐care unit. A third New Jersey athlete was responsible for another meet record. Steve Adams, mammoth (6‐feel pinch, 260 pounds) senior tarn St. Joseph's Regional in Montvale, put the 12‐pound shot 65 feet 51:, inches to smash Gary Guhner's, 10‐year‐old record of 63 feet. The mark by Adams was the best ever indoors in New York and New Jersey. Adams also bettered the rec ord in two other tosses in the finals. He had distances of 64‐2⅔ and 64‐7¾ on these. Bill Collins of Mt. Vernon posted the fourth meet mark when he clocked 9.9 seconds in the 100‐yard dash. The former mark of .10 sec onds was held by Ollie Hunter of New Rochelle. Collins's victory and that of Fred Singleton in the 60‐yard high hurdles paced Mt. Vernon to the team title. The Westchester team scored 16 points to 14 by Essex Cath olic, the runner‐up.

164-> American League Calls Off on Seattle Franchise
TAMPA, Fla., March 10—The American League abruptly called off its meeting today on the future of the Seattle fran chise, just 27 days before the start of the baseball Season. A strong tide appeared to be running toward an immediate shift of the franchise to Mil waukee. But the decision was complicated by yesterday's threat from Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Washington Demo crat, to ask Congress to strip baseball of its immunity from the antitrust laws. The postponement of the meeting took most of the club owners by surprise when they arrived this morning at the International Inn here. They were met by Arthur Sullivan, league controller, who told them the meeting had been put off by Joe Cronin, president of the league, who had re turned to his residence in Sarasota. The reason given was that William R. Daley, 78‐year‐old owner of the Seattle, Pilots, had entered a hospital in Cleveland over the weekend and could not attend. Franchise’ Cost $6‐Million Daley and his associates paid the league $6‐million for the new franchise last year, then tried to sell it after the club had lost $800,000 the first season. It reportedly had needed an attendance of 850 000 to break even the first year; but had drawn only 680 000. Since then the city's economy has been buffeted by severe cutbacks at the Boeing Company. In Cleveland Daley was quoted by The Associated Press as having said he had “made all the arrangements so they wouldn't have to cancel the meeting.” “I think,” he added, “that they kind of used me as an ex cuse to cancel it.” In Sarasota ‘Cronin said there was “no need to hold a meet ing without him,” and indicated the session might be switched to Cleveland. lloweve, there were signs that ‐ the league had been frightenedoff temporarily by Senator Magnuson's statement. Ironical Development He warned that if the Seattle club were moved to Milwaukee, he would urge Congress to re voke the game's immunity from the trust laws. Still waiting, in the wings is Milwaukee, an old‐timer in the franchise‐hopping game. In 1953 the Boston Braves switched to Milwaukee four weeks before the season. In 1966 the Braves abandoned Milwaukee for Atlanta. Now the city, forsaken by the National League, has been pre paring for “vindication” in the American. “The cancellation does not injure our chances,” said Allen Selig, president of the Milwau kee Brewers Company, which is trying to induce baseball to return “We ‐ have an experi enced ticket office, we've nego tiated all the television con tracts, we have the stadium. All we need is to sell a lot of tickets in a hurry.”

165-> Colonels Subdue Nets by 128‐101 and Even Series at 2‐2
WEST HEMPSTEAD L.I, April 22—The New York Nets should have taken a lesson to night from the Whiz Kids, group of basketball tricksters who staged a half‐time show at the Island Garden. The youngsters, aged 4 to 15, did more with the basketball than the Nets did as they were overwhelmed by the Kentucky Colonels, 128‐101, in the fourth game of the American Basket ball Association semifinal play offs. The Colonels evened the four‐ of‐seven‐game series at two games each. The fifth game is scheduled for Sunday afternoon in Louisville, the sixth at the Island Garden Tuesday night. The first three games of this series were close contests—a total of 14 points separated the teams. The Colonels, who finished second in the Eastern Division, shot at a 57 per cent rate and their Lou Dampier sank four 3‐point baskets. The A.B.A. awards 3 points on field goals of 25 feet or more. The Nets could not match the outside shooting of Dam pier and Darrel Carrier or the inside shooting of Sam Smith. Carrier led the scoring with 29 points, one fewer than Smith, and Dampier had 26. But it was more than hot shooting that beat the Nets. Gene Moore and Smith of the Colonels were in complete charge of the offensive and de fensive boards. The Nets shot at a 39 per cent rate and were at their most accurate in the fourth quarter, when they scored 34 points. Levern Tart, who had aver aged 34 points for the Nets in the previous three games, tallied 21 and most of his points came after the game was as good as lost. Tart had only 2 points at half‐time, as did Sonny Dove, who went into the game with a 24‐point average and wound up with only 8 points. ?? ??

166-> Knicks Confront Big‐Man Jinx in Final
After 17 years, the New York Knickerbockers have another shot at the National Basketball Association championship, and some things are remarkably familiar. The opposing team is, again, the Lakers — although now it represents Los Angeles instead of Minneapolis. And the central problem again is to cope with the physically most domi nant player in the‐ game—Wilt Chamberlain now, George Mikan then. Actually, this will be the fourth time the Knicks have reached the final round in their 24‐year history. They went the limit before losing the seventh game at Rochester in 1951; they went seven games again in 1952 before losing to the Lakers at. Minneapolis; and in 1953, they split the first two games of the final series in Minneapolis and then, unaccountably, lost three straight at home. In all those series, the Knicks had to play their home games at the 69th Regiment Armory which could hold about 5,000 people, because the circus dates at Madison Square Gar den were inviolable. In the four‐of‐seven‐game series that starts tomorrow night, two cir cus dates (tomorrow and next Friday) have been appropriated by the Knicks and earlier in the playoffs circus dates were taken by the Knicks and the hockey Rangers. That's one measure of how times have changed. More important, the Knicks will go into a final round for the first time with the odd game‐at‐home in their favor. They earned that right by winning 60 games more than anyone else, during the regular season. Until last year, when the Lakers lost the sev enth game to the Boston Celtics in the Los Angeles Forum, no seventh‐game final had ever been lost by the home team. The Knicks have waited longer than anyone else to win an N.B.A. title. Only two other teams, the Celtics and the San Francisco Warriors (who were the Philadelphia Warriors until they moved after the 1962 sea son), are survivors of the origi nal league wriich began play in 1946–47. The Warriors won the first year, and again in 1956. The Celtics, of course, were champions in 10 of the last 12 years.

167-> Rams'
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1— “I intend to be coaching the Rams in 1971,” George Allen, the controversial Los Angeles coach, said without qualifica tion today. Allen's statement scotched the latest rumor that John McKay, Southern California's successful coach, would suc ceed him at the Rams’ helm next season. McKay himself denied that he had received any new offer from the Rams—for one, five or 10 years. One report was that McKay had been offered a 10‐year pact for about $1‐million. The Ram front office dis missed the report as sheer speculation. Dan Reeves, the Rain owner, has said the question of renewing Allen's five‐year contract would not be taken up until Dec. 31, when it expires. Allen, elated over “our big gest win in five years [the 30‐13 victory over the 49ers],” hit at rumor‐mongers for “trying to sabotage our team.” The intense Rain coach said: “My only concern is doing the best job for my players. I've told them the future is now. The same goes for George Allen.” With their upset of San Francisco last Sunday, the Rams moved into a first‐place tie with the 49ers in the Western Division of the Na tional Conference. However, the Rams hold a 3‐point edge over the 49ers in their two games, San Francisco win ning the first, 20‐6. Allen noted that a Ram victory over New Orleans next Sunday would leave Los Angeles with only one loss in its own division games. San Francisco has already lost to Atlanta and the Rams in division play. These factors would make Los Angeles the official first place team in the event the Rams and 49ers finish with identical records. “We'll be okay if we win all the rest,” Allen said, “but beating New Orleans is most important. This week there may be a tendency to let down, but we can't afford it.” San Francisco is an im proved team, conceded Allen, who puts a heavy premium on experience. “But,” he added, “I think they're too young.”

168-> Ex‐Vietnam GI., 15, A Fafher in 8th Grade
ARCADIA, Fla., Sept. 16 (AP)—Walter Lee Martin, a twice‐wounded Vietnam vet eran who is now 15 years old, became the father of son today as he prepared to re‐enter the eighth grade. Alma Lee Jones, Mr. Mar tin's widowed mother, said tier son's 17‐year‐old wife, Rosa Lee, gave birth to a 10‐pound‐3‐ounce son, Walter Lee Martin, Jr. at Mrs. Mar tin's hometown of Dothan, Lee Martin Jr., al Mrs. Mar Ala. “We're trying to scrape to gether some clothes so Wal ter Lee can get back in school,” Mrs. Jones said. “It!s not orange‐picking time, so the money's all gone.” The 6‐root‐3‐inch, 198‐ pound youth enlisted at the age of 12, lying about his age.

169-> One‐World Trading Seen
“In the not too distant future, there will he one world market operating on 24‐hour‐a‐day basis dealing around the clock in securities and commodities from all over the world.” The crystal ball gazer was Robert S. Sinn, president of Ultronics Systems, part of the General Telephone and Elec tronics Corporation. Mr. Sinn's statement is consider ably better than a hazy guess, inasmuch as his company has installed market information equipment in more than 20 countries on six continents. In the United States Ul tronics competes with Scant lin Electronics, Inc., Tele register and the Trnaslux Corporation, which all sell various market quotation sys tems. Overseas Ultronics is nearly alone in the field. This success has stemmed from Mr. Sinn's desire to sell overseas and the company's fortuitous agreement granting the Reuters organization ex clusive world rights outside North America for Ultronic equipment. The Reuters or ganization brought its knowl edge of world markets gath ered over 100 years and the American company supplied the hardware and sales ad vice. It was somewhat fitting that Reuters should become involved in a market report ing system Paul Julius de Reuter, who established what has now become a worldwide news network began by relaying stock and exchange prices by carrier pigeon. Mr. Sinn believes that the differences between security dealers and techniques in the various countries is a very real thing, but that they are gradually diminishing. “On the Continent, you don't have retail brokerage houses as you do in the United States except for branch offices of American firms. Most dealings are through banks. Yet this is gradually changing as the number of investors in Europe increases.” In London most trades are in big blocks and a very suc cessful brokerage office can look as active as an outdoor swimming pool in the Artic. Yet the office will be doing a major business.” The Australians, Mr. Sinn points out, are closer in ap proach to the United States than to Europe, and the man in the street there is inter ested in stocks. Mr. Sinn noted that the managers of securities sales in banks or brokerage houses in Europe tend to be counts, dukes or otherwise titled. They in a sense are backing up their reliability with their family name. Ultronics and Reuters began their operation selling the “stockmarket” market quotation system in Europe with a satellite computer situated in London and fed by data from the Ultronic Mas ter Computer Center in the United States. Since then, master center has been estab lished in London. This feeds both European and North American information to satellite computer memories in Paris, Frankfurt, Geneva and Amsterdam. At the moment, the sys tem in Europe covers approx imately 10,000 stocks and commodities with around 100.000 different items of in formation stored in drum memories at any one time. All information is instantane ously updated when a price movement occurs on any of the stock exchanges or com modity markets covered. Most European markets are included in the system and coverage is being extended. The first European input was from the London commodity markets of prime importance to international trade in met als, sugar, wool and cocoa. Paris Was First The first European stock exchange to be covered was paris, followed by Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Mu nich. London then followed. Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich and the Eurodollar bond mar ket are now also carried, but not as completely. Besides Europe, there are also Stockmaster subscribers in Hong Kong, Beirut and Central and South America. The first computer center in the system outside the North Atlantic Area was set up in Sydney. Data on Australian mining and oil shares will flow across Australia and to Europe. The company hopes to in stall the systems in Japan by the end of this year while they are already playing a role in South Africa. For a while the Russian Government toyed with the idea of setting up a “Stock master” system in Moscow to follow the world commodity markets. Mr. Sinn believes that the availability of information on markets by itself creates vol ume. He points to the histor ical fact that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was once bigger than the New York Stock Exchange but decided not to install a stock ticker. “That was the end of Philly as a major market,” he added. “As more and more infor mation on stock around the world is made available on an up‐to‐the‐moment basis, people will begin to follow progress of a stock price from Paris to London to New York to San Francisco across the Pacific to Sydney and Tokyo. Where they can get the best deal, they will buy and sell. It will be a one‐ world market,” he said.

170-> HOUSE PANEL VOTES FOOD STAMP CURBS
WASHINGTON, July 23 (AP) —The House Agriculture Com mittee attached to the food stamp program today new re strictions including work re quirements and minimum pay ments for recipients. Another teature was added that would ultimately require states to pay 10 per cent of the program's cost. The panel ap proved the over‐all bill extend ing the program for three more years, 25 to 2. But Representatives Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washing ton, and Allard K. Lowenstein, Democrat of Nassau County, who cast the two negative votes, called the measure “in some cases actually regressive” and began working on a revised version. One new requirement is for a minimum payment of at least 50 cents a person a month for the coupons. The Senate bill would make free stamps avail able to families with less than $60 a month. Another new provision re quires an able‐bodied person be tween 18 and 65 years of age, except those responsible for the care of others, to register for and accept employment, if it is offered, as a condition of eligi bility for the household of which he is a member.

171-> Roundup: Porky Fattens With Tigers' Dumbo Out
While Dumbo's away, Porky will play. And the more Porky plays, the better it is in the Wonder ful World of the Detroit Tigers. Dumbo is a name that is sometimes affectionately ap plied to Denny McLain for his questionable achieve ments in his not‐so‐wonderful world of financial invest ments. Porky is a name bestowed on Mickey Lolich for the protruding stomach that spills over his belt. McLain, of course, is under suspension until July 1, but Lolich played for the fifth time last night and for the fifth time pitched a complete game as the Tigers whipped the Cleveland Indians, 5‐0. Although none of the Tigers, including Lolich, likes to see McLain on the side lines, there's no doubt that Lolich is profiting from his fellow pitcher's absence. In winning 55 games in the last two seasons, McLain overshadowed his left‐handed teammate, though Lolich won 36 games in that time plus three more in leading the Tigers to a World Series vic tory over St. Louis in 1968. Now, however, Lolich is the No. 1 man on the Tiger staff, and he's establishing a record that McLain will find difficult to match when he returns in 69 days. Lolich, also a colorful character but in tamer ways, stopped the Indians last night on five hits for his second shutout and fourth victory, this season. The 29‐year‐old Tiger has lost once, and the Baltimore Orioles had to take him into the 10th inning to beat him. Rain ended the game after five innings but not before Cesar Tovar hit a two‐run homer that gave the Twins a 3‐1 victory. —Carl Yastrzemski's run‐scoring single snapped a 2‐2 tie in the seventh inning and sent the Red Sox past the Orioles, 5‐2. Luis Alvarado and Jerry Moses drove in Boston runs in the eighth. Don Mincher drove in the winning run for the second straight night, lofting a sacri fice fly in the eighth as the Athletics topped the Royals, 2‐1. Al Downing pitched a three‐hitter for the winners. — The Angels sent the Brew ers to their seventh straight defeat, 3‐1, scoring twice in the seventh on a single by Aurelio Rodriguez and Toni Egan's sacrifice fly. —The Cubs won, 7‐5, extending their winning streak to seven and halting the two‐season winning streak of the Card inals' Mike Torrez at 11. Don Kessinger and Billy Williams drove in three runs apiece for the Cubs. —Four Giant errors, two by Bob Heise, the shortstop, helped the Phillies to six un earned runs and a 6‐1 triumph. The Pirates put together trio of threes as they belted the Astros, 6‐1. Steve Blass pitched a three‐hitter while Roberto Clemente and Manny Sanguillen rapped three hits each. For good measure, Blass walked three and struck out three. — Don Sutton, laden with an extra burden now that his teammate, Bill Singer, has hepatitis, stopped the Expos on six hits as the Dodgers won, 9‐2. Wes Parker led a 14‐hit barrage with three hits, and Willie Crawford got a single and a triple. Earlier in the day, the Dodgers learned that Singer, a 20‐game winner in 1969, will be out for at least a month with hepatitis.

172-> SOPRANO DISOWNS TAX RETURN ITEM
Renata Tebaldi, the opera singer, denied that she had paid $2,400 to a claque in 1964, as in dicated on her tax return of that year, which was introduced as evidence yesterday in Federal District Court in the trial of Norman H. Egenberg, a tax ac countant, who is charged with bribing Internal Revenue agents and falsifying tax returns of more than a dozen theatrical clients. “No, I never paid a claque in my life,” said Miss Tebaldi in a low firm voice as she sat up straight in the witness chair, wearing a broad‐brimmed brown straw hat that shaded much of her face. She also de nied paying $2,200 to a claque in 1965, as shown on her tax return for that year. Mr. Engenberg, who is also being accused of falsifying the tax returns of the tenors Franco Corelli, Sandor Konya and Jon Vickers, is alleged to have lifted expenses on those returns that were not incurred. Included was money supposedly paid out by his clients for professional training and coaching, publici ty and promotion, studio rentals, commissions and travel. According to the indictment against him, Mr. Egenberg bribed three Internal Revenue officials with repeated cash payments of up to $100 each time, the use of credit cards and, in one case, a pen and pencil set. The bribes were said to have been given in connec tion with tax examinations of departing aliens. The indictment also charges that Mr. Egenberg advised his clients to state, on the forms that aliens are required to fill out before they leave the coun try, that they were not plan ning to return. The declaration that they did not intend to re turn entitled them to tax refunds. When several such forms, filled out on behalf of Miss Tebaldi, were introduced in court, the singer denied that she had ever indicated that she would not return to the United States. “I like to come to this coun try,” she said. “I can't say no.”

173-> A Young American in Paris Who Cooks to His Heart's Content
ARIS—If you see a young man swinging a knap sack full of pots and pans and cutlery along the banks of the Seine, it may well be an American named William Rice en route to a cooking session in the home of a friend or friends. Mr. Rice is doing his thing in Paris. (and Europe) this year—a thing that scores of his countrymen would doubt less like to do but very few have the courage to do. One day last summer shortly after his 30th birth day he withdrew his savings, bid a temporary farewell to newspaper work in America tend emplaned for Paris to learn about la bonne vie—the cooking, wines and restau rants of France. He enrolled in language schools; in cook ing classes at the Cordon Bleu; and found an apart ment, a fifth‐floor walkup “under a roof near the Seine.” “It has a two‐burner gas unit without an oven, suffi cient to make a meal for four,” he noted recently. “But now I'm invited out a lot to cook in various homes, for pleasure mostly.” Then he whips up souffles and ome lets and roats and, one of his most admired desserts, poached pears with a French oriented sabayon sauce made with a dry white wine. Among those present at dinner he recently prepared was Anne Watson, daughter of Arthur Watson, the new American Ambassador to France. “That meal,” he said, “started with a souffle with shrimp and we had veal chops in a cream and mush room sauce flamed with bour bon; an endive salad and oranges Cyrano,” a congealed affair. He has also prepared meals for two French groups. “One of them a buffet in Amiens,” he said. “They wanted typical American dishes, so we gave them whisky sours served with a clam dip; Smithfield ham and steaks; baked potatoes with sour cream; Texas chili with tostadas; pumpkin and blue berry, pies and ended by dem onstrating a Caesar salad. They liked ft, but the thing they liked best, oddly enough, was the clam dip. They were fascinated by it.” During his stay in France the gentleman is spending considerable time in the vine yards. He recently spent a day in the champagne coun try, joining an American group called Les Amis de Vins for a dinner at the Moet and Chandon winery. If all goes according to pres ent plans, he hopes to join a kitchen staff in Burgundy for one month in the summer; another in the fall in Bor deaux. He has spent considerable time since his arrival last September exploring the res taurants of Paris. “I've been to all the large, well‐known, well‐publicized places and the food at its best is fantastic. But I like the small places, the regional places that are reasonably priced. Three of his personal choices are Cartet, a place with only six or so tables at 62 rue de Malte; Aux Lyon nais at 32 de la rue St. Marc; and Kuntz, an Alsatian res taurant at 31 Rue d'Alsace. His preference for the latter may not be sheer happen stance. In Paris he has had the rare good fortune of meeting a first‐rate Alsatian boulan ger or baker who has taken Mr. Rice under his wing. The baker is Jean Weber, a handsome, friendly, dedicated man who produces fine long loaves and short loaves and other pastries at his own shop at 79 Avenue Mozart. He met Mr. Webpr through a mutual friend, another Alsa tian, who is a restaurateur in Washington. The young American spends each Saturday helping Mr. Weber in the pastry kitchen, and at midday they feast on home‐style Alsatian cooking. Mr. Rice, a native of Al bany, studied history at the University of Virginia and journalism at Columbia Uni versity. Prior to his European travels he wrote about res taurants for The Washington Post. He intends to return to the American scene after the wine harvest. Here are adaptations of three dishes he prepares at times in the heart of Paris. AVOCADOS WITH SHRIMP 1. Place the egg yolk in a mixing bowl and add the vin egar, mustard, salt, cayenne and pepper. Gradually, add the oil while beating vigorously with the whisk. Beat in the lemon juice. 2. Stir in the curry pow der, tarragon, thyme, shallot and tomato purée. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 3. Chop the shrimp and fold them into the sauce. Fold in the chopped eggs. 4. Carefully scoop out the flesh of the avocado but leave a quarter‐inch rim of the pulp. Cube the scooped out portion and fold this into the shrimp mixture. Spoon equal portions of filling into avocado shells. Serve garnished with chopped parsley. Yield: Six servings. COQUILLES ST. JACQUES PROVENCALE Finely chopped parsley. 1. Peel the tomato and cut it into small cubes. Set aside. 2. Heat the butter in a skil let and add the tomato cubes, shallots, garlic, wine and dried mixed herbs. Simmer five minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. 3. Meanwhile, dredge the scallops in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. 4. Heat the oil in another skillet and cook the scallops until golden brown all over, three to six minutes. 5. Spoon the scallops into scallop shells, if available, or into individual ramekins. Spoon the sauce over each serving and sprinkle each with chopped parsley. Yield: Four servings. POACHED PEARS WITH SABAYON SAUCE 1. Peel the pears one at a time and cut each in half. As the pears are peeled and cut rub the surface with a cut lemon half. Drop the pears immediately into a basin of cold water. 2. Combine the four cups of water with half a cup of sugar and bring to a boil. Add the pear halves and sim mer until the pears are ten‐ der; about 10 to 12 minutes, turning once. Let pears cool in the syrup. Carefully drain the pears and chill. 3. Cut the skin from the orange and slice it into the thinnest possible strips. Drop these strips into boiling wa ter and simmer three to four minutes. Drain and set aside. 4. Meanwhile, add the re maining sugar to a round bottom mixing bowl, prefer ably one of polished copper. Add the egg yolks and egg white and beat with a wire whisk. 5. Place the bowl over a double boiler containing hot water and continue beating a few seconds. Add the wine, beating constantly, and con tinue until the sauce is three or four times its original vol ume. Taste for sweetness and beat in more sugar if de sired. If the sauce is too thick, beat in a little more wine. 6. Remove the sauce from the heat and beat in the orange flavored liqueur. Chill the sauce. Serve over the cold pears sprinkled with orange strips. Yield: Six servings.

175-> BRIBE TRIAL STARTS FOR CITY PATROLMAN
Waverly Logan, a suspended New York patrolman formerly assigned to Harlem's preventive enforcement patrol squad, went on trial yesterday on depart mental charges of accepting $100 from a convicted narcotics dealer. Patrolman Logan is also ac cused of having one bag of marijuana, 14 bags of heroin and other illegal narcotics equipment in his car. During the first day's hearing before Deputy Police Commis sioner Louis Stutman, Capt. Joseph DeMartino, Lieut. Frank Alioto and Sgt. Randall Perk ins—all of the department's in ternal affairs division — gave testimony about the apprehen sion of Patrolman Logan last Sept. 3 in the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street. Last night Patrolman Robert E. Wollack Jr., a member of the force since 1967 assigned to Brdoklyn's Bergen Street station, was arrested and charged with selling narcotics and with conspiracy to violate the Federal narcotics laws. And Patrolman Windsor S. Rhoden, a member of the force for 19 years, was suspended on charges of failing to explain why he was driving a stolen car. He was stationed at, the 100th Precinct in Elmhurst, Queens.

176-> Scribner Backed on Harlem Principal
The appointment of a black teacher es acting principal of Benjamin Franklin High School in East Hariem—without regard for a Civil Service list of eligi ble candidates—was upheld in a Brooklyn Supreme Court de cision yesterday. Supreme Court Justice Frank J. Pino denied an application by the Council of Supervisory Associations, which represents most city school supervisors, to force Chancellor Harvey B. Scribner to remove Acting Principal Melvin Taylor, 39 years old, and replace him with someone from the Civil Service list. Mr. Taylor was selected last Oct 19 by a committee of teachers, students and parents. His appointment ended a series of demonstrations, including one that forced the closing of the 4,000‐student school for more than a week. In his decision, Justice Pino noted that 15 of the 19 persons on the Civil Service list for principal originally said they were not interested in the job at Benjamin Franklin, “includ ing at least five of the peti tioners who now say they are interested.” Of the four who expressed an interest, Justice Pino ob served, Chancellor Scribner de cided that none was qualified to handle “the severe problems of Benjamin Franklin.” Justice Pino rejected the su pervisors' contention that the civil service list was competi tive. The list was a “qualifying one,” he said, and those on it had no competitive status, even though it appeared from their petition that they thought they did. In addition, the court also rejected the assumption that Mr. Taylor had been appointed because he is black. “Mr. Scribner states that the appointment was made on the basis of Mr. Taylor's extensive teaching and supervision experience,” the ruling said. “As head of one of the world's largest educational systems, he is entitled, as a minimum, to the presumption that his offi cial acts are honestly moti vated.” Mr. Taylor holds a, B.S. de gree in education and an M.S. in science from City Univer sity, has taught science at Charles Evans Hughes and Franklin High Schools, is certi fied by the state as a high school principal and for the last three years has been a di rector or assistant director of programs preparing disadvan taged youths for college at Fordham, Yale and City Uni versities. At Benjamin Franklin High School yesterday, Mr. Taylor said he was “delighted” by the court ruling. The suit in question was brought by nine of the people on the civil service qualifying list, in addition to the Council of Supervisory Associations, which is recognized by the city as the exclusive bargaining agent for supervisory employes in the public schools. Specifically, the suit asked the court to order the Board of Education and the Chancellor to “promptly fill the existing permanent vacancy of princi pal of Benjamin Franklin High School by appointment of a person who holds a New York City license for such a posi tion.” The suit also asked an in junction against the temporary appointment of Mr. Taylor as acting principal on the ground that he did not hold a New York City license. ‐ There has been no permanent principal Since last March 1. The court's ruling cited Board of Education bylaws that specify that the head of the school sys tem may “in an emergency” as sign not more than five months at a time “a person of lower rank” to “any teaching or super vising position” in the school system. Justice Pino said in his de cision that state law “reflects an intent on the part of the Legislature to give greater flexi bility” to those who make school appointments and “to extend the policy of qualify ing, noncompetitive appoint ments to all supervisory posi tions.” Thus, the court ruled, “Mr. Taylor's appointment is in all respects lawful and will not be enjoined at this time.”

178-> Pines Are At Home Everywhere
HERE is at least one pine adapted to every state and in some of the northern states as many as twen ty different species would make themselves at home. The best known shrub form is the mugo pine (Pinus mugo) which varies in the length of its needles, density, form and height. The looser more open forms with longer needles may reach a height of 10 to 12 feet while the short needled, dense types may be only two to three feet high after 15 years. Selections should be made in the nursery for a specific size. Slow‐growing pines take much longer to reach planting size. In this group is the dwarf white pine (P. strobus Nana) with its beautiful soft fine texture that will be a broad billowy globe of some four feet after many years. It is well worth searching for. Other species have dwarf or shrubby forms but they are even more difficult to obtain. Included are the Scots pine (P. sylvestris), Swiss stone pine (P. cembra) and Austrian pine (P. nigra). The latter dwarf is most interesting with dark green short needles and is known as Hornibrook pine, most rugged plant, not easily purchased. The pines survive well in soils that are low in organic matter, with good soil drainage and at least a half day's available sunlight. An extremely slow growing pine with a most remarkable history is the bristlecone pine (P. aris tata) which came out of the southwest. It grows well in planters and in a short period of time, the species has become rather easy to obtain. It may reach 30 feet but not in one generation. For orn amental use, it can be confined to three or four feet. Another slow grower but with inter esting mottled bark is the lace bark pine (P. bungeana). The bark peels to show colors of cream to orange brown and gray — a bit like a sycamore. The bright green soft needles surround the outer fringes of a more or less short trunked umbrella‐like tree. The Swiss stone pine (P. cembra) is slow growing and produces a dense head of soft bright green needles. The form is oval and varies in its rate of growth. It may only be six to eight feet tall after 25 years while another tree of the same age may reach 10 to 12 feet. Two pines that are difficult to trans plant but provide a most interesting picturesque appearance are pitch pine (P. rigida) from the East and shore pine (P. contorta latifolia) from the Pacific Coast. The branches of both come out at irregular lengths and bunches of nee dles appear here and there on the main trunk. Either species is worth finding. Two other unusual pines are short needled jack pine (P. banksiana) and scrub pine (P. virginiana). Both adapt well to extremely sandy soils or those that are so devoid of organic matter that not much else will grow. A fast growing pine with fine texture and orange bark is the Japanese red pine (P. densiflora); it grows with an irregular horizontal habit. An umbrella like, slow‐growing form with a short main stem and a canopied top is known as Tanyosho pine (P. densiflora um braculifera). An unusual variation known as Dragon's‐eye Pine (P. densi flora Oculus‐draconis) is also available with its semi‐spreading and partially weeping habit. There are several long needled types. Himalayan Pine (P. griffithii) has prob ably the softest blue‐green needles of any pine. The horizontal branches em phasize its weeping effect. A western species with unusually long pendulous needles is the Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyii) whose long needles hang on a slow growing stem; it needs an acid soil or a yellowing of the foliage appears. Light green long needles of Korean pine (P. Koraiensis) appear on irregu lar branching. Japanese white pine (Pi nus parviflora) has horizontal branches in irregular lengths and the clusters of curved leaves bunch here and there blue foliaged variation, P. parviflora glauca is like the species except for blue cast on the needles. It makes most effective patio tree. Another irregular tree is the limber pine (P. flexilis). The branches curve outward and reach to display a cluster ing of blue‐green needles that are not uniformly arranged. Sometimes the needles are so close together and the branches so disorderly arranged that one's first impression is not a pine. The dark‐green needled ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) does amazingly well in the Northeast; so does the native red or norway pine (P. resinosa). The latter is not recommended where the growing seasons are long and the sum mers warm but where the temperatures quite often reach 25 degrees or more below zero, it may be most welcome. Eastern white pine (P. strobus) is most useful tree with picturesque form. A narrow‐headed selection, pyramidal white pine (P. strobus fastigiata) has up right branches for narrow areas. Another sculptured tree is the Scots pine (P. sylvestris). It is particularly well suited to the more northerly areas where soils are well‐drained and with out much organic matter. The orange bark is an added asset. There are great many variations varying in bark color and length of needle. One worthy of mention is the narrow columnar se lection fastigiata. A second possibility is blue‐needled upright branched water er Scots pine. It is not as narrow as the fastigiata form, but slow growing. One could not conclude the discussion of pines without mentioning the most adaptable species for planting near the ocean, namely, Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii). Its irregular branching and beautiful lustrous dark green foliage makes it stand alone as the pine to use where salt air rushes in from the ocean. Finally, along inland roadways where conditions are not favorable, Austrian pine (P. nigra) is durable. It does well as a screening.

179-> Income Rises In Virginia
RICHMOND, Va., May 9— The upward income trend continued in 1969 in the Fifth District, the latest editon of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's “Monthly Re view” reports. “But while personal income continued to grow in 1969, ?? gains became slimmer curing the year. In the final months, the publication ?? the growth in per sonal income failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living. For the United States, the year‐to‐year growth in total personal income declined from 9.3 per cent in 1968 to 8.3 per cent in 1969; com parable figures for the Fifth District were 9.3 and 8.8 per cent respectively. Within the district West Virginia and the District of Columbia showed greater ad ances in 1969 than in 1965. Total personal income in creased 6.4 per cent in West Virginia, up from the 5.8 ad vance registered in 1968; it rose 83 per cent in the District of Columbia in 1969, compared with an 8 per cent increase a year earlier. Personal income in Mary Iand, Virginia and the two Carolinas rose by a smaller percentage in 1969 than the year before. Maryland's ad vance of 10.5 per cent in 1969 was down from 11.5 per cent in 1965. For the same periods, Virginia had an increase of 9.5 per cent and 10.3 per cent; North Caro lina, 9.4 per cent and 10 per cent, and South Carolina, 9 per cent and 9.9 per cent. During the past two dec ades, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina have more than tripled their total personal income, while the District of Columbia and West Virginia have doubled their's. The average annual growth rate is 6.9 per cent for the Fifth District corn pared with 6.6 per cent for the nation. The District's per‐capita Income has increased at an average yearly rate of 5.1 per cent from 1949 to 1969, compared with a 5 per cent rate for the nation. Indivi dual personal income in the Carolinas and Virginia out paced the nation with aver age annual growth rates of 5.7 per cent in each of the Carolinas and 5.6 per cent in Virginia. Maryland and the District of Columbia had growth rates below the 5 per cent national average.

180-> U. S. CURBS SALES OF A WEED KILLER
WASHINGTON, April 15 — The Federal Government took steps today to halt the use of the controversial herbicide 2,4,5‐T as a weed‐killer around, homes and ordered the suspen sion of its use as a defoliant in Vietnam. The actions came in separate announcements this morning by three domestic departments and by the Defense Department after new information was re ported Monday to the Depart ment of Health. Education and Welfare indicating the herbicide “2, 4, 5–7, as well as its con taminant didxins, may produce abnormal development in un born animals.” In the domestic action, the registration of the herbicide was suspended, making inter state sales illegal. The Depart ments of Agriculture, Interior and Health, Education and Welfare said they were acting because it was felt that an “im minent danger” was posed to Women of child‐bearing years by liquid 2, 4, 5‐T. The order Immediately halts interstate movements of the liq uid form of the herbicide. The nonliquid forms, not considered imminently harmful, will re main on sale until hearings and possible appeals are completed. Government officials cau tioned home gardeners about disposing of household products containing 2, 4, 5‐T, since flush ing it down drains, burying it or burning it merely adds it to the general environment, in more concentrated form than spraying it. They asked that householders put such herbicides away, out of reach of children until the Department of Agriculture pub lishes full details on disposal, in the next few days. The Federal action does not affect sales of the herbicide abready on retail store shelves, nor can it stop use of commer cial products containing 2, 4, 5‐T already puchased by home gardeners. At a Senate Commerce sub committee hearing last week, two young lawyers identified some of the commercial pro ducts—both dry and liquid— that contain 2, 4, 5‐T as Scotts Turf Builder, Plus‐1, Scotts Kansel Weed Killer, Amchem Garden Weeder, Ortho Brush and Ortho Triox Liquid. None of today's actions af fects the uses of 2, 4, 5‐T for control of weed and brush on range, pasture, forest, rights of way and other nonagricultural land. These areas account for most of the use of the herbicide in the United States. The Pentagon said this morn ing that the suspension in Viet nam of use of 2, 4, 5‐T—known as Orange in military jargon— was temporary. A Defense Department spokesman, Jerry Friedheim, said other herbicides and de foliants were available and added that 2, 4, 5‐T had already been restricted to areas in Vietnam remote from the popu lation. A New York Times article on March 14 reported cases of birth defects and miscarriages in South Vietnam that villages attributed to use of defoliants. The new test results that prompted today's actions veri fied findings last fall that cause Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, White House science adviser, and en vironmental health experts to call for a halt in the use of 2, 4, 5‐T. No action was taken after this early report, however, be cause commercial manufactur ers pointed out that the herbi cide sample studied was contaminated with dioxins. The study just completed that even pure 2, 4, 5‐T—which has never been commercially produced—was as liable to cause birth deformaties as those dioxins normally found in it.

181-> Uranium Deal Set By Westinghouse
OAK RIDGE, Tenn., May 2 —The Westinghouse Electric Corporation of Pittsburgh is to get additional uranium en richment services from the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge operations. The contract now provides for total of $24,190,9722 of such services through October, ac cording to S. R. Sapirie manager of the Oak Ridge operations. The original agreement, in January. 1969, called for $6,500,000 in services. Modi fications in June, September. December and February added $8,403,382 to the original agreement. Now the contract has been modified to add $9,287,590 more in services. Westinghouse will use the enriched uranium for fabrica tion of fuel elements for nu clear power plants, both in the United States and abroad. The uranium will have range of enrichment from 1.85 per cent to 3.40 per cent in the isotope U‐235. Toll enrichment, which began in 1969, is an ar rangement whereby privately owned uranium is enriched at A.E.C. gaseous diffusion plants in Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Paducah, Ky., and Ports mouth, Ohio. The three plants are all under the Oak Ridge operations. The customer furnishes uranium feed material to the A.E.C., pays an enriching charge and receives uranium enriched in U‐235 in return.

182-> Laird Disclaims Koreans' Acts
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11—Sec retary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said today that alleged atrocities by South Korean troops against South Vietnam ese civilians were not the re sponsibility of the United States command in Vietnam. His views were disclosed as other “hearsay” evidence of brutality by the South Koreans was brought to light today. Noting that there is no “uni fied command in Vietnam,” Secretary Laird said the matter should be handled by the Gov ernments of South Vietnam and Korea. Mr. Laird, appearing on the Columbia Broadcasting Sys tem's television and radio pro gram “Face the Nation,” con ceded that his department had received “certain reports” of alleged atrocities. These reports, he said, have been called to the attention of both the South Vietnam and South Korean Governments, but he did not say when this had been done. Meanwhile, Francis West of Santa Monica, Calif., a re searcher for a Rand Corporation project funded by the Defense Department, said today he had received “hearsay information” of South Korean brutality dur ing several trips to Vietnam. Interviewed by telephone, Mr. West said that while his infor mation was “just hearsay, am pretty convinced instances of brutality did occur.” Mr. West has worked for several years on a pacification research project and just re turned from Vietnam last month. He said that over a period of three years he had been told of alleged atrocities by “at least 100 different people” among the several thousands interviewed during that time. He said he presented his information last month in a writ ten report to the “highest levels” at the Defense and State Departments and the Na tional Security Council. He de colined to disclose the names of those to whom he presented hiis report. Mr. West said that his re port was made “at the direct urging” of an admiral and an Assistant Secretary of De fense. “There was no muzzling, no whitewash,” he said. This was in contrast to con tentions late last week by an other private project research er, A. Terry Rambo, who said an American Army officer had sought to thwart any mention of the research team's findings of alleged brutality by the South Koreans against South Vietnamese civilians. Mr. Rambo, now a gradu ate student at the University of Hawaii, was director of a research team for Human Sciences Research, Inc. The project, involving interviews with South Vietnamese refu gees in the summer of 1966, was funded by the Defense Department. Mr. Rambo said his inter viewers turned up evidence that South Korean forces had mur dered hundreds of South Viet namese civilians. He added that, despite the unidentified of ficer's attempt to quash the in formation, the findings were outlined in a report that he as assured would go to the Pentagon. In his appearance today Sec retary Laird did not disclose the information contained in what he called “certain reports” of atrocities. He merely said the reports “have not been substan tial in the legal way.” Later, a Pentagon spokesman said “there are reports and documents bearing on this situation.” The spokesman said he was not familiar with the Rand re port that Mr. West said he had submitted last month to “the highest levels” and did not know to whom Mr. West had spoken. South Korea has about 50,000 troops in South Viet nam, the largest force among the United States' allies there. The Korean units include two infantry divisions, a Marine bri gade, a construction support group, a logistical command and a naval transport group. The Koreans' role in the war has been ostensibly to hold areas won from Vietcong guer rillas. But the Korean soldiers are all volunteers and have a reputation for fierce fighting. The United States pays for Korea's military operations in South Vietnam, supplying weap ons, equipment and wages for the troops, which average about $45 a month for a private‐38 times more than he would earn at home. The cost to the United States exceeds $135‐million an nually.

188-> Edging Back From the Brink
The reported withdrawal of Syrian forces from Jordan and the apparent growing ascendancy of Jordanian troops over the extremist Palestinian revolutionaries give a new lease on life to the tottering regime of King Hussein and, more important, to the hope that a major war can be avoided in the Middle East. The planned evacuation of Americans from Amman by com mercial aircraft—rather than by military intervention—is another hopeful step back from the brink of a new catastrophe. The frightful cost in life of the Jordanian conflict and the perils it has posed of a wider war involving the big powers should serve as one more warning to every one concerned of the urgent necessity for an over‐all Middle East settlement. Guerrilla leaders have sought to shift all the blame to Government forces for what from many accounts has been a horrible slaughter. Certainly King Hussein's Bedouin troops are not beyond reproach for reported indiscriminate attacks in heavily populated areas. But the primary responsibility for this bloodbath clearly lies with guerrilla leaders who have repeatedly rejected the King's offers of truce and compromise, finally forc ing a showdown which Hussein sought to avoid because he foresaw—as the guerrillas must have foreseen—the heavy price in human lives. Jordan's suffering, however, is small compared to the death and misery that would be inflicted on the whole of the Middle East, and perhaps beyond, if the Palestinian guerrillas were allowed to prevail with their mad scheme for a fight to the bitter end to exterminate Israel. The extremists’ arrogant challenge to interna tional peace efforts and to the conciliatory overtures of King Hussein and President Nasser must be put down decisively if there is to be any chance for peace in the area in the foreseeable future. Military victory alone will not end King Hussein's problems. Even if he can consolidate the recent suc cesses of his army, the King faces formidable tasks physical and political reconstruction. He will almost certainly have to offer generous political concessions to the misled Palestinian majority of his people who once more have been the principal sufferers from reck less misdeeds committed in their name. Foreign powers can help with speedy relief. But if the King's moderate policies are to survive in Jordan, the outside world also will have to revive hope for a peace settlement under a formula that affords some reasonable recognition of the legitimate aspirations the Palestinian people.

189-> Rules Unit Asks Minors to End ‘Wild‐Card’ Pinch‐Hit Tests
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 (AP) — Baseball's rules committee rejected proposals for colored bases and foul lines today at the winter meeting and voted to discontinue a “wild‐card,” pinch‐hitting experiment in the minor leagues. The committee, possibly in fluenced by a controversial in cident in the 1970 World Series, also amended an official rule dealing with interference with a catcher by a home plate um pire. Playing rule 5.09B, as amend ed by the committee, provides that base runners may not ad vance if a plate umpire inter feres with a catcher's throw. In the opening game of the Series two months ago, an um pire, Ken Burkhart, became en tangled with a Baltimore catch er, Elrod Hendricks, and Cincinnati runner, Bernie Car bo, in a play at the plate, touch ing off a controversy. Charles Segar, aide to Com missioner Bowie Kuhn and chairman of the nine‐man rules committee, said a proposal for multi‐colored bases, advocated by the Oakland A's owner, Charles Finley, had been turned down. Suggestions for colored foul lines and a 20‐second clock on pitchers to speed up the game also were rejected. The wild‐card experiment. used in the Class AA Eastern League the past two seasons, allowed a player to bat several times in a game without play ing on defense. The automatic walks and ex panded foul lines, tried out at the Class A level, also will be discontinued. Other action taken included rulings that all players in pro fessional baseball use some type of helmet while batting, that players in Class A and the rookie leagues also wear ear flaps, that official scorers no longer may change a scoring decision 24 hours after com pletion of a game and that if a pitcher balks and then de livers a wild pitch, the base runner will be allowed to ad vance beyond the single base he is entitled to because of the balk, but may advance beyond that base only at his own risk. The committee also sug gested that several rules be submitted allowing for experi ments in wild‐card pinch‐run ners at the minor league level.

190-> Kung Peng, Press Spokesman For Chou En‐lai, Dies in Peking
HONG KONG, Sept. 23 —The death of Kung Peng, for many years a close associate of Premier Chou En‐lai and high‐ranking functionary in Communist China's Foreign Ministry, was announced today by Hsinhua, the Chinese press agency. A dispatch’ from Peking said Miss Kung had died on Sunday at the age of 56 and was bur ied yesterday in a ceremony at Papaoshan Cemetery, the place of interment for high Chinese Communist party members. The cause of death was not given, but she had long suffered from cancer. Miss Kung was the wife of Chiao Kuan‐hua, a vice minis ter of foreign affairs and head of Communist China's team ne gotiating with the Russians over their countries’ border dispute. For many years Miss Kung was head of the information department of the Foreign Of fice in Peking. She first be came widely known to foreign ers associated with Chinese affairs during the Japanese War in Chungking. She and her husband, then writer for the Chungking Com munist daily Hsinhua Jih Pao, were considered highly cap able press and public relations representatives of the Chung king Communist Liaison Office, headed by Chou En‐lai. Access to Foreigners Miss Kung, who was shapely and beautiful in those years, had learned English at the Am erican mission‐supported Yen ching University in Peking. From Chinese Communist sources to which she was privy she always had revealing, if slanted, packets of informa tion on political affairs in Chungking and elsewhere in the country. The door of the Chiaos's small apartment in the govern ment sector was always open to foreign visitors, and the Chi aos themselves were frequent guests of foreigners at din ners and receptions. When the Chinese Govern ment shifted from Chungking to Nanking after the Japanese War and Chou En‐lai became the Chinese Communist nego tiator with the government and Gen. George C. Marshall of the United States in efforts to ar range a peace agreement be tween the Government and the Communists,. Miss Kung and Mr. Chiao continued their role as public relations agents for the Chou mission. When the negotiations broke down in renewed civil war, the Chiaos slipped out through Shanghai to Hong Kong and continued their propaganda role here until the Communists triumphed on the China main land. They went to Peking in 1949. Along with her husband, Miss Kung became part of the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Chou En‐lai, she as head of the intelligence department and he as a special assistant to the minister. At International Party The inclusion of the Chiaos as members of the Peking ne gotiating group, headed by Mr Chou, to the Geneva Confer ence of 1954 on Korea and In dochina brought Miss Kung world prominence. She was interpreter and often spokes man at press briefings and con ferences given by the Peking delegation. She became head of the in formation department of the Foreign Ministry in 1955, and in 1956‐57 she accompanied Chou En‐lai on a tour of South east Asia. Miss Kung's beauty had fad ed by 1961, when she repre sented Peking in Geneva at the conferences on Laos. She had become heavy, almost fat, and features that once were radi ant and expressive had settled into a mask. She had a troubled life dur ing the cultural revolution that began in late 1966. Her hus band was attacked as a revi sionist by Red Guard publica tions, and their teen‐age son came under fire as a member of a group of sons and daugh ters of high officials who op posed Red Guard attacks on their parents. The son was arrested and sentenced to a five‐year jail term, but the sentence was commuted to a long period of intensive thought rectification. The assumption is that Mr Chou's backing saved the Chi aos from being purged from office during the cultural rev olution.

192-> Obituary of a Heroin User Who Died at 12
Walter Vandermeer —the youngest person ever to be reported dead of an overdose of heroin here—had been identified by many of the city's leading social service agencies as a child in desper ate need of care long before his body was discovered in the common bathroom of a Harlem tenement on Dec. 14, two weeks after his twelfth birthday. For most of these agencies he never became more than one case among thousands passing through their revolving doors. Others tried to fit him into their programs but lacked the manpower or re sources to focus on him ef fectively. Eventually he would be shunted off to yet another institution. It was not heartlessness or malfeasance that explains why he usually went un noticed, just overwhelming numbers. As one school offi cial expressed it, “There are thousands of Walter Vander meers out there.” Along the way his case was handled by Family Court, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Department of Social Services and its Bureau of Child Welfare, the Board of Education's Bureau of At tendence and Bureau for the Education of Socially Malad justed Children, the Wiltwyck School for Boys and the Of fice of Probation. Most of these agencies have refused to discuss their actions in the case on the ground that their relation ship with the boy was confi dential. But interviews with neigh bors, relatives and individuals in the schools and agen cies through which he passed have made it possible to re trace the course of his short life and his efforts to find a foothold in a world that al ways seemed to him on the verge of collapse. The agencies had exhaust ed their routine procedures before he died; only his file continued to move. For his last 14 months he was left to himself, with no consistent supervision or counseling of any kind, on the decaying block where he lived most of his life and died‐117th Street between Eighth and Manhat tan Avenues. There he was in intimate daily contact with addicts and pushers, as if none of the overstrained agencies had heard of him or even existed. After his death, one of the block's junkies paid him this discerning tribute: “Walter lived to be 30 in 12 years. There was noth ing about the street he didn't know.” In those months he slept at home only sporadically and attended school for a to tal of two and a half days. Walter would be out late at night hawking newspapers in bars or begging for coins at the corner of Eighth Ave nue. In the daytime, when most children were in school, he would station himself near a radiator in a grocery store for warmth until chased or borrow a couch to catch up on the sleep he had missed. His diet was made up of Yankee Doodle cupcakes, Coca‐Cola and, when he had the change, fish ‘n’ chips. It was a life of frightening emptiness and real dangers. The only regular thing about it was a daily struggle for survival. “Walter didn't do too bad,” a junkie on the block remarked when he was dead. “He didn't do too good,” retorted a black youth, full of bitterness over what heroin has done to Harlem. “He won't see his 13th birth day.” “He didn't do too bad,” the junkie repeated. “He looked after himself.” The one thing the court and the various agencies to which it referred his case never knew was that he was experimenting with drugs. But even this probably wouldn't have mattered, for no treatment centers have yet been authorized for nar cotics users under the age, of 16, although youths under 16 in the city are dying of heroin overdoses at the rate of one a week. Two sides, of Walter Van dermeer are remembered on his block. One was the apprentice hustler, an angry, mistrustful youth given to violent rages in which he hurled bottles and flayed about with iron pipes. The other was the small child who cried easily and searched continually for adult protection and warmth. Some of the older addicts, into whose orbit he gravitated in the last months of his life say he would sometimes call them “Mommy” or “Daddy” and fantasy a household into which he could move as their child. “Walter wanted a lot of attention,” said his oldest sis ter, Regina Price. And there were those in his family and neighborhood who tried to ex tend it, when they could. Given the stress of their lives, that was only now and then and never for long. Survival on 117th Street is a hard proposition at best, and Walter's circumstances were already far from the best when he was born Dec. 1, 1957. His mother, Mrs. Lillian Price, had come to New York from Charleston, S. C., with her husband, Cyril, in 1947, when she was 22. Her school ing had never got beyond the third grade and she was on welfare within a year. (21 years later, she is still there). In 1949, Mrs. Price had her ‐first children — twins — and her husband moved out. By 1957 she was, in social work jargon, the nominal head of a growing, desperate ly disorganized “multiprob lem” family. Walter was her sixth child; there had been four fathers. Five more chil dren (one of whom died in in fancy) were to be born in the next seven years to Mrs. Price and a Liberian immi grant named Sunday Togbah. Walter's father, known variously as Robert or Willie Vandermeer, entered the country illegally from Suri nam, having jumped ship here in 1947. Six months after Walthr was born, he was found by immigration author ities while he was working as a counterman at a mid town pharmacy and deported. But by then, it appears, Mr. Vandermeer and Mrs. Price had separated, for hardly six months after he left the country she gave birth to the first of the chil dren she was to have with Mr. Togbah. Only one other Vandermeer was left in the family, a brother, Anthony, three years older than Walter. In those days, Mrs. Price and six of her children were squeezed into one room of a three‐room apartment at 305 West 117th Street they some how shared with a couple wirn two children of their own. (Another of Mrs. Price's children, a daughter named Beverly, was being raised by a friend.) According to the recollec tion of neighbors, Walter was sniffing airplane glue by the time he was 6 and sitting in on card games on the stoops when he was 8. In school he was marked as a disrup tive child who could not be contained within a classroom's four walls unless permitted to fall asleep, which he did reg ularly, a sign to his teachers that he was staying out nights. Public School 76 on West 121st Street gave up on him in early 1967, when he was in the third grade, soon after his ninth birthday. Walter had been out of school more days than not that year. When he was there he seemed locked in an aggressive pat tern, roaming the halls and throwing punches at teachers who sought to restrain him. Sometimes his violence could be seen as a stifled cry for attention and help. On one occasion he stormed out of an art class, only to fly into a rage because his teacher had not pursued him. Walter was repeatedly warned to behave better, then suspended on March 2, 1967. It does not appear that the school ever attempted to arrange psychological consul tations for him or his mother with the Board of Education's Bureau of Child Guidance. After Walter's death, As semblyman Hulan E. Jack was to charge that the school had “put the child out onto the street.” In fact, it did just the op posite by referring his case to the Society for the Preven tion of Cruelty to Children, which then brought it up in Family Court on a neglect petition. On March 14, both Walter and his brother Tony—the two Vandermeers—were placed in the Society's Children Shelter in Queens. Later they were shifted from there to the Children's Center at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street. An attendance teacher, as truant officers are now called, had singled out the older boy as a youth of unusual intelligence and promise. Six months later, Tony was as signed to a home operated by a private agency in Yonkers, where he has made what is regarded as a highly success ful adjustment. But Walter got lost in the judicial maze. While one branch of Family Court found Mrs. Price unable to care for Tony, another decided in August to release Walter— the younger and more dis turbed of the two boys—to her care. He had been classified as a “person in need of super vision” rather than a “neg lected” child—a narrow legal distinction that has the effect of blaming the child and not the parent for his difficulties. The fact that the law forces the judge in such cases to an implicit finding of blame, a court officer said; places a tremendous psycho logical pressure on parents to resist help for their chil dren: It does not seem to be offered as help but as punish ment for having failed them. Releasing Walter to Mrs. Price was tantamount to re leasing him to the street (by now the family had shifted to a top‐floor apartment at 2124 Eighth Avenue, near 115th Street). The court expected Walter to go to Public School 148, a special school for disturbed and socially maladjusted chil dren at West End Avenue and 82d Street. But there was no response to repeated no tices sent by the school to the boy and his mother. Meantime, members of the family recall, Tony was at tempting, without success, to interest the agency that looked after him in his younger brother's plight. Stranded, Walter at 10 was reaching for his own solu tions. One involved Mrs. Barbara Banks, who had regarded him as a godchild ever since she accompanied Mrs. Price to the hospital at the time of his birth. Around Christmas, 1967, she said, she told Wal ter he could move in with her and three of her children, since her eldest son was go ing into the Army. “A whole lot of people told me, ‘Ain't no hope for that boy,’” she said. “But I be lieved I could save him. He was so inquisitive, he could have been anything.” Although Walter eagerly seized the invitation, she said, she was soon forced to with draw it, for her son was nev er inducted. Walter felt re jected. Late one night he made that clear in his own way by climbing to the roof of a tene ment across 117th Street and hurling a bottle through Mrs. Banks s window, raining glass on her bed. The boy spent most of his time on the streets until April, 1968, when the Family Court assigned him to the Wiltwyck School for Boys, a treatment center, for dis turbed youths from the slums that had enjoyed the pa tronage of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. The idea was to place Walter at the school's main center at Yorktown Heights in Westchester County, but the center was full and cut ting down on its staff be cause of a budget crisis. As a temporary alternative — to get Walter off the streets —he was put in Patterson House, at 208 East 18th Street, a “halfway house” run by the school for youths returning to their communi ties from the main center. Dr. Howard A. Weiner, a psychiatrist who was then in charge of Patterson House, remembers that Walter was “extremely bright verbally” but says he was “as dis turbed as any kid we had.” Like many maladjusted children from the poorest, most disorganized families, he would erupt into towering rages when he felt himself under pressure and he had to be held till he regained control. Usually that took at least an hour, so it was de cided to give him 50 milli grams of the tranquilizer Thorazene four times a day. At first, Walter showed his suspicions about his new surroundings by taking food from the table in a napkin and hiding it under his bed. After his wariness sub sided, he permitted himself to draw close to his child care counselor, John Schoon beck, a recent graduate of the University of Michigan. Learning that they both had Dutch names, Walter eagerly proclaimed that they were “soul brothers.” Mr. Schoonbeck, who now is on the staff of Time maga zine, says Walter was “a great little kid.” Dr. Weiner credits him with giving Walter the swarm, reliable affection he had rarely found in an adult. Encouraged by his coun selor, Walter finally put in an appearance at P.S. 148. In fact, in May he went to school there regularly— his first stretch of steady school attendance in more than a year and the last in his life. Flora Boyd, a teacher at the school, says Walter had never learned to read beyond the first ‐ grade level but thought he could catch up. “He was an intelligent little boy,” she recalls. “Of course, he had a lot of problems. But he could learn.” Every afternoon when he returned to Patterson House, he would insist on doing his homework before anything else, according to Mr. Schoonbeck. In the evenings and on weekends, he regularly made quick, unauthorized expedi tions to Harlem to check on his family and block, but al ways returned to Patterson House. Children like Walter, Dr. Weiner said, need to go back regularly to their home en vironments, however dis turbed these may appear, “because their identities are bound to their communities— they need to re‐establish who they are.” Finally a place opened for him at Wiltwyck's pastoral upstate campus, and on June 20, Mr. Schoonbeck accom panied him to Yorktown Heights—the fifth separate institutional setting in which he had been lodged in 15 months. Walter felt that he had been betrayed and trapped. He had never been told that his stay at Patterson House would be temporary. It was a‐repetition of his experience with Mrs. Banks and, pre dictably, he flew into a fit of anger on his first after noon at the school. Wiltwyck's troubles, mean time, had gone from bad to worse. In May, a third of its staff had been suspended after protesting that stu dents were receiving inade quate clothing and food in the wake of the economy drive. In the next two months, Walter ran away at least four times. As justification, he told his family he had been beaten at the school. Wiltwyck concluded that it could not hold Walter with out his mother's cooperation and that this was unavaila ble. On Oct. 10, 1968, Wilt wyck turned Walter back to Family Court, which meant he was where he had been more than a year earlier, only more frustrated and “street‐wise.” His involvement with insti tutions was now nearly ended. It took warrants to bring him and his mother to court so that he could be ordered to go to school, or to Harlem Hospital for psychiatric counseling, or to one of Har you‐Act's “self‐help teams.” Asked why the court had not placed him in a state in stitution — a training school or mental hospital — in order to take him off the street, a judge replied that Walter, who was too disturbed for Wiltwyck, did not seem dis turbed enough. In fact, the probation offi cer assigned to the case rec ommended last spring that he be detained in a training school. But Walter's sister Regina insisted that her mother oppose the recom mendation in court. In the back of her mind were recol lections of the state institu tions in which she was placed after she became pregnant at the age of 12. She knew that a youth in detention had to “stay by himself” to survive, she said, for there were always homo sexual fellow inmates threat ening to “mesk up his mind.” Regina wanted Walter to re ceive care, but she thought the probation officer only wanted to “criticize him” and “lock him up.” In her view, state institutions were no less dangerous than the streets. On his own, Walter contin ued to search out adults he felt he could trust. In November, he went down to East Sixth Street to call on John Schoonbeck, who had quit Patterson House in discouragement and was packing for a trip to Africa. Walter asked plaintively if he could come along. On the block he had a half dozen households where he dropped in regularly at unpre dictable hours to cadge food coins, an undemanding hour in front of a television set, or sleep. One addict said Walter tagged along after a gang that called itself Bonnie and the Seven Clydes. The gang spe cialized in auto thefts and shoplifting, and he accompa nied it on several forays downtown. He also teamed up, it was said,, with some older youths who conducted raids into Morningside Heights and learned to snatch purses. According to Regina, he bought most of his own food and clothes and sometimes had as much as $50 in his pockets. But it is doubtful that he had any regular in come as a drug courier, as has been alleged, for he con tinued until his last days to hustle for small change, sell ing newspapers and deliver ing groceries. In his last months, Wal ter's already disastrous fam ily situation deteriorated sharply. Last summer, Mrs. Price was living most of the time on 117th Street, although her younger children were still in the apartment on Eighth Ave nue. Walter stayed on the block, too, although not with her, sometimes sleeping on a fire escape above a ware house. When his mother saw him, she would shout, “Go home!” Walter would shout back, “Go home yourself!” Sometimes, neighbors say, she would call the police on her son. In September, an 18‐year‐ old half‐brother, Reggie Brooks, was arrested for rob bery Five days before Wal ter's death, he was sent to the Rikers Island reforma tory. In October, another half brother, Eugene Price, 19, was shipped back to Vietnam, where he had already served a year, for an involuntary second tour of duty. In November, the whole family was evicted from the Eighth Avenue apartment be cause Mrs. Price had not paid the $73.10 monthly rent for seven months out of her $412‐ a‐month welfare checks. She said she was holding the money in escrow because the toilet hadn't worked for a year and a half, but never got to Rent Court to explain this to the judge, perhaps because she no longer had the money. Tony Vandermeer became distraught when he heard the news and got permission to come down from Yonkers for a day. It was not only the eviction that alarmed him— word had also reached him that Walter had started to take drugs. The chances are negligible that any child on 117th Street could retain much innocence about narcotics; for the block is wide open to the traffic. “I can go to my window any morning and see a man hand somebody some money and get his little package in return,” a resident said. The fact that the police regularly manage not to see the same thing convinces the residents that they are indifferent, at best. Walter's brother Reggie had long been using narcot ics. Sometimes he would show his “works” — the eyedrop per, needle, cord and bottle cap that are the tools of the addict's vocation — to his younger brothers. Once Wal ter found an empty glassine envelope on their tenement stairway, filled it with salt and sold it to Reggie as a $3 bag of heroin. Interviewed briefly after Walter's death, when he was brought to the funeral home from Rikers Island, Reggie said he knew who had first given drugs to his brother and named a 17‐year‐old ad dict on 117th Street, who shall be called Theresa here. When, she was visited the next day, Theresa was sit ting next to a stove with all its burners on, the only warm corner in an apartment that had been without heat all winter. She readily acknowl edged that she had been on drugs for two years, had been close to Walter and had known him to be using them. Although she denied ever having given him any herself, Theresa said she had often seen him “skin” (inject the drug beneath the surface of his skin) but had never known him to “main” (inject it di rectly into a vein) Usually, she said, he skinned at the top of the stairs at 303 West 117th Street or in an apart ment next door at 301 shared by two of her fellow addicts. At 301, the two addicts —call them Mary Lou and Lizzie—also denied ever hav ing sold or given drugs to Walter, but Mary Lou said he would often ask for them. She said that she had seen him “snort” (inhale heroin) and that she had occasionally allowed him, to watch while she “mained.” Sometimes she would think of Walter as “a little man,” Lizzie said. At other times she, would see him as an abandoned child and haul him to the bathroom to scrub him in the tub. Treated like a child, he would behave like one, she said. The two addicts said they found it hard to imagine his locking himself in the bath room across the street to “shoot up” by himself. “Walter was scared of the needle,” Lizzie said, laughing indulgently as one might in recalling a baby's first steps. “He'd always say, ‘Wait. Don't hurt me. Let me get myself together. Please Wait!’” It was their expert specu lation that he might have tried to “find the hole” where he had been “hit” earlier in the evening. After the funeral, Tony Vandermeer rushed Lizzie, overturning a floral wreath and shouting, “You killed my brother!” He had heard sto ries on the block that Lizzie and Theresa had dragged his brother's body on the morn ing of Dec. 14 from 301 and across 117th Street to 310, where it was found. Lizzie acknowledged that she had a loud argument with Walter the night before he died over $9—the change left from $25 he had given her to buy him some clothes —but insisted she had not seen him after that. “Tony really didn't know me at all,” she said. “He just had nobody else to blame.” Another addict — known here as Sugar—moved off the block as soon as the body was found. Walter had been especially close to him since the summer, it was said, and sometimes called him “Daddy.” A lanky, good‐looking youth who now works at two jobs to keep up with the “Jones” (his habit) Sugar still returns to the block late at night to make his connection. The other night at about 12:30 A.M. he came ambling into Mary Lou's apartment on the heels of two pushers — one wearing a leather tunic, the other done out in a frilly shirt with lace cuffs like an 18th‐century gentleman. After an interlude in a bed room, Sugar appeared rolling down his sleeve and adjust ing his cuff link. Behind his dark glasses his eyelids were drooping. His only response to a question about Walter was a perfunctory expression of “shock” over his death. “But something had to hap pen.” Sugar drawled sleepily. “He was always hanging around.” Dr. Michael Baden, an as sistant medical examiner, who examined the body at the scene, said it looked to him like “a typical overdose case.” But he cautioned‐ that his of fice never classified narcotics overdoses as homicides, sui cides or accidents, for medi cal evidence on this point is invariably moot. Curiously, chemical tests failed to reveal any trace of heroin in the eyedropper found next to Walter in the sink—a hint, by no means conclusive, that it might have been planted. The autopsy proved that Walter had been using drugs for at least three months— possibly longer—but the ab sence of any track marks on his arms indicated he had probably yet to become a full‐fledged addict. He had also yet to give up on himself. About a month before he died, Walter re ceived a new pair of shoes from Mrs. Carletha Morrison, one of the women on the block whom he would allow to mother him. He said he would save them for going back to school. According to both Regina and Mrs. Morrison, he seemed to think he could not go to school until his mother took him to court. No one seemed to realize that he was still enrolled at P. S. 148, where he had appeared only three times the previous year. When the school reminded the Bureau of Attendance of his truancy, it was told to stop sending in reports on the boy because Family Court had his case “under advisement” —a bureaucratic formula that seemed to have no specific application. Occasionally last fall, Wal ter would drop into the class of his younger brother “Doe” at P. S. 76 and would be al lowed by the teacher to stay. He even asked his brother to teach him reading. “I gave him my book and any words he didn't know told him,” said “Doe,” who is 11. He was also looking for ward to Christmas. Regina had promised to buy him a pair of expensive alligator shoes and a blue pullover. In addition, she said she would treat him to ice skat ing in Central Park and a movie downtown, probably “The Ten Commandments.” Everyone noticed a maca bre touch in a legend stamped on the cheap “Snoopy” sweat shirt Walter was wearing when he died. “I wish I could bite some body,” it said. “I need to re lieve my inner tensions.” “When I heard that I broke down,” Regina said. “That was him. That was the way he felt.”

195-> Stennis Bloc Scores Eased Rights Curb
WASHINGTON, March 24 —Angry Southern Senators protested today that the Sten nis amendment to a major education bill had been so drastically rewritten in a Senate‐House conference that it no longer subjected North ern segregation to the same penalties as Southern. Joining the Southerners in their effort to revive the old form of the amendment was Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, a supporter of the original pro posal. He called the new version “completely unac ceptable” and said it would have been better to drop the whole idea. Republican Senators, led by Hugh Scott of Pennsyl vania, the minority leader, argued that the new school desegregation amendment re flected the position President Nixon set forth in his policy statement today and the Sen ate should thus accept it. The school desegregation de bate erupted again as the Sen ate opened debate on a $24.6‐ billion three‐year education bill, a compromise version of the measure to which the original Stennis amendment had been, attached last month. The original amendment, sponsored by Senator John C. Stennis, Democrat of Missis sippi, declared that guidelines for depriving school districts of Federal aid for failure to eliminate “segregation by race, whether de jure or de facto,” must be applied “uniformly in all regions of the United States, whatever the origin or cause of such segregation.” The Senate‐House conference committee, which completed a compromise bill last week, left this language intact but added this sentence: “Such uniformity refers to one policy applied uniformly to de jure segrega tion wherever found and such other policy as may be pro vided pursuant to law applied uniformly to de facto segrega tion wherever found.” Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, declared that the added lan guage “doesn't clarify the Sten nis amendment, it nullifies it.” Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., Demo crat of North Carolina, said that the change “segregates the schools of the South from the schools of the North.” Although Senator Stennis de clined to say what move he would make against the re vision of his amendment, a statement issued by Senator John G. Tower, Republican of Texas, said that there would be a motion to send the entire school bill back to conference with an instruction to restore the original amendment. No such motion was made to day, apparently because Stennis amendment supporters had not rounded up their votes. The vote on the amendment last month was 48‐46 in favor of it, so they do not have many votes to spare. Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Democratic floor leader, expressed concern that debate on the education bill might run over into next week, further delaying consideration of the nomination of Judge G. Harrold Carswell for the Su preme Court. The judicial appointment was laid aside to take up the edu cation bill, which, as a confer ence report, took precedence on the floor. Senator Scott suggested that the issue of the Stennis amend ment might be resolved by dropping all the language, old and new, from the bill, but Mr. Stennis told fellow Democrats that he would not support such a move. Senator Stennis, arguing for the original version of his amendment, said that 50.5 per cent of the Negro pupils in 118 Mississippi school districts at tended schools with a majority of white pupils while the per centages in a number of North ern states were far lower. In Illinois, he said, only 13.6 per cent of Negro pupils are in white majority schools, in Cali fornia, 22.5, in New York, 32.3, and in Michigan, 20.6. Under the revised version of his amendment, the Senator de clared, this Northern segrega tion “couldn't be touched just because of a legalism—that the Supreme Court had failed to pass on it.” “If you want to perpetuat segregation in your schools,” Senator Stennis said, “you stand with the group that pro duced this bill.”

196-> KELLY TAKES LEAD IN ETCHELLS CLASS
RYE, N. Y., May 16—Wil liam E. Kelly of the Larchmont Yacht Club, sailing Dowry, took a 1‐point lead in the Etchellls 22 class invitation spring re gatta today. Two races were sailed on Long Island Sound off the American Yacht Club in a 13‐knot easterly. Two races to morrow will complete the se ries. Kelly finished second to George M. Isdale Jr., skipper of Rampant of the home fleet, in the first 10‐mile race over an Dlympic course. Then he won the second, in which Isdale was third. Kelly had 3 points, Isdale 4 and James M. Mertz of the host club, with a third and sec ond with Shillalah II, had 5. A collision occurred near the finish of the first race when Herbert Foote's Kristen, cross ing on starboard tack about 30 seconds from the end, was hit amidships by Jonathan Tobey's Tantivy. Kristen's topside rail and her boom broke and the crew had a scare, but no one was injured. Mrs. David Larr of the Sea wanhaka‐Corinthian Y.C., Oys ter Bay, L. I., national cham pion of the class, was unable to finish the first race when the head of the jib on Rosinante parted. Not in contention in the fleet of 18 at the time, she re turned for the second race but got a late start and trailed the fleet.

197-> Movies
HOSE of us who spent our most formative years during that decade which we already refer to with nostalgia as the sixties celebrated the New Year by jettisoning all kinds of paraphernalia. We unloaded all the great childhood gadgets and emotional trinkets which couldn't make it into the seventies without showing signs of appalling age. Danish modern didn't make it, for in stance. The hippie ideal of building a good life in the ghettos didn't make it either. Prop airplanes didn't make it; nor did rail roads or cigarettes or the aspiration of making it and leasing an apartment in a luxury building with a doorman. Also on the list of things we thought we dug but ended up ditching are Brooks Brothers suits, booze, big new cars, haircuts, par lor pianos, opera subscriptions, spin the bottle, etiquette, cocktail parties, foun tain pens, caviar, small talk, neckties, Peg gy Lee, white linens, cuff links, corsages, calf‐bound books, Broadway shows, dates, postcards, contraceptives, Monte Carlo, Fort Lauderdale, movie stars, heroes, chicken soup and mamma, buttoned‐down shirts, underwear and James Bond. Which brings us to “On Her Majesty's Secret Service” — the sixth and possibly, final installment in the adventures of 007. Do you remember 007? Do you recall May of 1963 when “Dr. No” had lines around the block at your local movie house? And James Bond, played by that rough‐cut sophis ticate Sean Cannery — the ultimate kitsch hero who could identify a woman's per fume at 50 feet and knew his caviars and wines from Provence all the way to the Caspian Sea! Wow, the epitome of chic! What every young man wanted to be when he grew up! But of course in those days boys didn't grow up; they simply went from Christmas office party to office party. And today many boys don't get a chance to live long enough to grow up. But in 1963 pop corn still cost a dime at the movies and the world was beautiful. Ah, yes, the world of James Bond was the world of the early sixties. There he stood, Brooks Bra thered to death in a dark blue serge or getting kinda gamey in a terry‐cloth jump suit. Daredevil gentleman, with expertise in absolutely everything, even a noncha lance which permitted him to seduce su perduper double spies on a whim. Ah, the world of 007! Where the enemy was ei ther an exotic samurai with a lethal black derby or six dozen fold‐outs from Play, boy magazine. And people always died so beautifully in a James Bond movie. The explosions were the biggest darn explo sions we had ever‐ seen. The blood was redder and the sounds of fists in faces were crisper and crunchier than ever. Even technology was fun in a Bond movie— the lethal gadgets killed with ultra‐comic book flamboyancy. Death was always so intricate in the world of 007. That astonishing automobile with its dead ly cargo of special effects. That attaché case! What magic! What imagination! What spectacle! What violence! What a bore.... So, while I was standing in line on a recent weekend at the Waverly Theater to see the latest Bond bundle, I noticed that I was not the only die‐hard 007 fan. It was a young crowd which went into the theater smiling and came out looking per plexed. The formula didn't make it any more. And it wasn't merely a question of whether the new Mr. Bond — George La zenby — was as effective at his bits as Connery had been, or whether the latest Bond thriller was as thrilling as its pre decessors. It was essentially a matter of change. But the change was in us and not in 007. Like Superman and all other good super‐heroes, James Bond had not changed. But since 1963, when all of us first caught sight of the dashing Mr. Bond, our heads had gone through more changes than you could shake a joint at. And it was astounding to realize how different. I sat there during the movie recalling how incredible the sensation had been during “Dr. No” and “From Russia With Love” and “Goldfinger” and “Thunder ball” and “You Only Live Twice.” All that karate and all those bloody noses had really been a thrill. Now, as the en trails of a “nameless” enemy geysered out of a snowplow and Bond quipped, “He sure had a lot of guts,” I was roundly turned off. The fists smashing into faces were grotesque and vicious. The “baseball game” in which bodies were sent flying over a cliff was cruel and humorless. Why was I so disturbed by the lavish violence‐which had previously amused me so much? Was it possibly because I had been in‐Chicago and seen real people and real friends bashed and battered? Was it because I had seen young Bob Kennedy cut down in the pantry of a Los Angeles hotel and the Hell's Angels brutalize a crowd at a rock festival in Altamont, Calif., or because I was desperately sick of the useless obscenity of death in Viet nam? I don't know. I only know that the idea of seeing a Follies of sadism turned me off. And what about James the man? Well, he seemed something Of a drag. A rather pompous dirty old man who asserts his moribund concept of masculinity by cruis ing every chick who passes. The covey of allergic ladies In the film comes on as the ultimate male self‐deception. A lady on the hour, every hour, is the phallic fantasy of the middle‐aged man. He's not up to the mere physical labor, let alone possessing the sexual prowess. What Bond used to do as our surrogate adulterer he can't do for us any more. We would ra ther do it ourselves because we do it so much better. 007 gets zero for sexual con duct. Bond is masculinity according to Madison Avenue. Intellectually, he's also fraudulent. Spec tre—that diabolical world organization of sin and corruption — seems less corrupt than Bond himself, not to mention his heartless superiors who license 007 to kill. Meanwhile, the enemy Is an enigma. We aren't told why we must hate the enemy but only that we must at all costs HATE the enemy. But it doesn't work. We are enlightened young men and women who have learned the importance of knowing the enemy — and we have learned to know him well in real life. In fact, we are downright intellectual about the enemy. And we aren't buying any hate propa ganda; so the evil that lurks behind the gullible shadows of childhood doesn't frighten the activist‐oriented kids of the seventies. We don't get our jollies from sitting in dark theaters and hating pre scribed enemies. Bond Is fighting a shadow in a shadow play. Ultimately it's all fake. However, it is not harmless because it's essentially sadistic and cruel and a last‐ditch expres sion of that confounded militant egotism which used to be the trademark of the normal middle‐class male. Rest in pieces, James Bond. Rest in PIECES!

198-> Mr. Shanker's Appeal
Albert Shanker, president of the United Federation of Teachers, has introduced a note of reason into the con flict between some of the city's professional educators and Dr. Harvey Scribner, the new chancellor. Writing his new column (published as a paid advertisement), Mr. Shanker has appealed to the professional staff to think of Dr. Scribner's success as essential to the future strength of public education in New York. This appeal stands in welcome contrast to the intem perate statements issued earlier by some of the associa tions of administrators within the school system, and to a few highly combative blasts by Mr. Shanker himself. Even more important, Mr. Shanker did not join in the game of pretense in which so many of the system's loyal “insiders” paint a glowing picture of the city's educa tional accomplishments. He admits that changes are badly needed. He even reminds those who had predicted chaos and anarchy under decentralization that their forecasts luckily failed to materialize. The fact is that Dr. Scribner has spoken out eloquently and intelligently about the enormity of the urban school crisis and the inadequacy of present efforts to meet Mr. Shanker now concedes that such statements may indeed have been necessary to gain public support for actions that must be taken to reverse the decline. We agree, too, with Mr. Shanker that the time has come for Dr. Scribner to bring the concerned factions of teachers, administrators and parents together. As we have previ ously observed, this is an essential step in the creation of an alliance of educational progress—open to all those who are ready to stand for reform.

199-> Bombings Here Reaching ‘Gigantic’ Proportions, Leary Tells Senators
WASHINGTON, July 16—New York City's Police Commissioner and three associates told the Senate today that a wave of bombings in New York had reached “gigantic” proportions. Appearing before the Senate Permanent Investigations Sub committee, Commissioner How ard R. Leary said there had been 368 bombings from Janu ary, 1969, through May of this year—more than twice as many as in the eight preceding years. Commissioner Leary said that four deaths had occurred in the recent wave of bombings and that a large number of persons had been injured. He did not have figures for the number of injured or the amount of prop erty damage. Lieut. Kenneth W. O'Neill, commander of New York's 14‐ man bomb section, added to this testimony by disclosing that bomb threats in New York City had risen from approxi mately 3,300 in 1969 to more than 6,000 in the first six months of this year. Mr. Leary said the dramatic rise in bombings had “func tioned as their incompassionate designers intended” to spread fear and demonstrate the vulnerability of the city to this type of terrorism. Bombs and bombing threats have also been used increasing ly against Federal buildings and agencies in leased private prop erty, the subcommittee was told by an official of the General Services Administration. Hart T. Mankin, general coun sel of the agency that operates and protects 2,813 Federal prop erties throughout the United States, said that damage to Gov ernment properties increased 6,860 per cent in fiscal year 1970 over the preceding 12 months. Fiscal 1970 ended June 30. He said that the damages had risen from $10,455 in fiscal 1969 to $729,219 in fiscal 1970, and that the cost of disruptions from bomb threats for the first six months of 1970 was esti mated at $2.25‐million. In his testimony today, Com missioner Leary recommended a series of controls to limit ac cess to high explosives. These would include the li censing of all manufacturers, importers and users of explo sives or their components; strict recording of sales and use of explosives; Federal and local in spection of these records, and tighter security to prevent thefts of explosives such as dynamite. He also advocated the re quireemnt of a coded, inde structible object inside explo sives that could be recovered and used to trace the origins of a blast. Testifying with the Commis sioner was Frederick M. Lus sen, chief of detectives. He out lined for the Senators nine cases in which bombings were involved. Although he could not go into details because the cases were still pending, Chief Lussen did give enough facts on the or ganizations and the nearly 100 people allegedly involved to show that bombing conspiracies in New York City are carried out by both right‐wing and left wing groups. “We know, and we can say that the present crop of ex plosive devices, in the main, represent distorted petitions for redress of grievance,” Commis sioner Leary said. And he added that using bombs in this manner would probably increase in the future rather than decrease. The Police Department's Chief Inspector, George P. Mc Manus, told the Senators that it would be extremely difficult to conceal instructions on how to make a bomb. He said that extremist or ganizations could get their in formation from such deverse sources as the Swiss Army manual or a Marine Corps guidebook on explosives. Cruder designs and instruc tions for Molotov cocktails and simple “pipe bombs” are handed out at high schools and junior high schools as well as on college campuses, Chief Mc Manus said. In addition to an explosion at Police Headquarters in which seven persons were in jured, the police reported the following major bomb blasts here this year: ¶A March 6 explosion in Greenwich Village townhouse being used as a bomb factory in which three persons lost their lives. ¶A March 29 blast in Lower East Side apartment, also an illegal “bomb factory” in which one man died and an other was critically injured. ¶Two separate explosions in two Bronx movie theaters on May 1 that injured 11 persons. ¶Three powerful blasts on March 12 in three midtown of fice buildings. No one was in jured. Other lesser explosions, some involving incendiary devices, occurred this year at military recruiting offices, in variety and department stores, at number of bank offices and at the Haitian consulate. No one was injured in these incidents.

200-> Italian Government Crisis Plays Out a Familiar Ritual
ROME, July 16 — In the Rome of the politicians it is an outright disgrace these days to have a tan. It indi cates that one really does not count for much and has plenty of time to loll on the seaside rather than being en gaged from morning until late at night in the ritual of crisis consultations. Premier‐designate ?? Andreotti, who is going through the elaborate cere monial that is customary in an Italian Cabinet crisis, is ensconced in an air‐condi tioned hall of the Monteci torio Palace, the stately home of the Chamber of Deputies, with a face as pale as parch merit, like an ascetic priest. His more important visitors are also persons with pale faces. An Italian government cri sis unrolls in accordance with fixed rules that are as styl ized as those of a ballet. After a Premier resigns, the head of state, now Presi dent Giuseppe Saragat has to meet with and hear the ad vice of his own living prede cessors, all former premiers, present and former speakers of the two houses of parlia ment, and secretaries and floor leaders:of all 10 parties represented in the legislature. After receiving three dozen or so notables in for mal audiences in the Quirinal Palace, the head of state ponders and comes up with his candidate for the premier ship. The Premier‐designate is summoned into the presence of the President, condition ally agrees to make an at tempt at forming a new gov ernment, and calls on the speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to toil them in person what they already know from tele vision, radio and the news papers, namely, that he is going to make a try. Then the Premier‐designate begins his own consultations, receiving singly about the same cast of politicians who have just filed past the Pres ident. If preliminary sound ings indicate that he may be able to patch together a ma jority in parliament, then the horse trading for Cabinet jobs starts in earnest. If the Premier‐designate feels he has been getting no where, he returns to the head of state to how out. The President may then open a new round of formal consul tations, or select another can didate right away. Then the new Premier‐designate of course, has to begin his own series of conferences. The charade of the con sultations is the showy side of a government crisis. Swarms of reporters lie in wait to pounce on any pol itician who calls on the Pres ident or the Premier‐desig nate. Banter with hidden pol litical allusions is quoted, explained and commented on by the press. At the same time, obscure contacts and cabals are going on behind the scenes—tele phone calls in a code that only a few insiders under stand, furtive meetings in private apartments or in some country trattoria, or even in a convent dining hall, and messages are passed back and forth by unobtrusive middle men. It usually takes weeks be fore a new Cabinet is formed and can go before parliament to ask for the votes of con fidence from the two cham bers that it needs to be able to get down to the business of governing Italy. The last government crisis went on for 40 days in Feb ruary and March before Pre mier Mariano Rumor and a record number of 26 minis ters were sworn in as Italy's 31st Government since the fall of Fascism. It lasted 102 days, much less than the av erage life‐span ?? Italian Cabinet, which is 10 and a half months. While Mr. Andreotti is ex ploring his chances of estab lishing Italy's 32d post‐Fascist government, the outgoing Rumor Cabinet is carrying on a shadowy existence as a caretaker administration. No one attacks it any more. It is no longer exposed to hostil ity in parliament, which has been adjourned until the new government presents itself. Mr. Rumor and his minis ters are no longer expected to solve all the nation's prob lems at once. Organized labor no longer calls general strikes to protest against the Cab inet's failure to enact radical reforms of Italy's social struc ture. Now, at last, the Rumor Government can concentrate on day‐to‐day administration, and some of the staggering bureaucratic backlog actually is getting cleared up. Italy, which has a reputa tion for being ungovernable and unstable, is never so smoothly governed as when one Cabinet is on its way out and the next one is not yet in.

202-> The Difference Between ‘Marat/Sade’ an ‘Trotsky’
CAME to Düsseldorf to attend the critics' pre miere of Peter Weiss's new play, “Trotsky in Exile.” I saw only half of Weiss's play, but I partici pated in a happening that, in effect, made Weiss's “Trot sky” a play within a play— something like “Peter Weiss's ‘Trotsky in Exile,’ Interrupted, Terminated, and Reinterpret ed by Leftist Students from the University and Art Acad emy of Düsseldorf, Apparent ly Not Directed by Anyone.” This drama began in the dobby, where long ‐ haired, casually dressed students were handing out mimeo graphed sheets of 10 ques tions directed to “Comrade Weiss.” Most of the questions attacked Weiss's connection with the imposing new the ater at Düsseldorf, a temple of bourgeois splendor which, at its opening a few nights before, had required 600 police “with dogs, water cannon and horses” to protect “Dan ton's Death” from disorder. Did Comrade Weiss approve of this action, and why had he given his play to a theater that was a haven for the privileged? Would he discuss his play with the audience? Weiss came on stage to say that he deplored the inter vention of the police, that he would join in a discussion afterwards, and that he begged the audience to re spect the work of the actors, implying that they, after all, were proletarians too. The play began — a fairly straightforward biographical drama, concentrating on Trotsky's ideas and, in fact, embodying verbatim some of his most characteristic ex pressions of them. It began with his exile to Alma Ata in 1928, moved back to his early years as a revolution ary and forward again to the Russian Revolution. Time and time again, Weiss's Trotsky is wise, persuasive and, espe cially, prophetic. He reveals his interest in Vietnam and in American Negroes, endorses student radicals (even if they are of bourgeois origin), urges the dictatorship of the proletariat but gives a rea sonable meaning to this term, puts down a Jewish separatist (“You are a Jew,” says the separatist. “I am a socialist,” says Trotsky), insists that the revolution must be perma nent and not confined to one nation (thus anticipating his ideological dispute with Stalin), puts down a gaggle of Dadaists (telling them that art must serve the revolu tion), and wins the warm praise of Lenin, who laugh ingly confesses: “I am a Trotskyist.” The second act was to show Trotsky as a fugitive in France in 1935, sagely answer ing the questions of students, including a Vietnamese and a Trotskyist.” German Jew (who, propheti cally, came from Dachau); his old colleagues and rivals at home confessing to every conceivable crime at the Mos cow trials; Trotsky in Mex ico, receiving the homage of Andre Breton and Diego Rivera; and, finally, Frank Jacson raising his ax to slay him. The second act was not performed. First, to speak of the play Weiss wrote, all the doc trines were there, but Weiss had omitted the element that, years ago, had induced a teacher of mine, the late Re nato Poggioli, to call Trotsky the only tragic subject that modern history has given us. Like Oedipus and Macbeth, he was a man of unusual gifts who held supreme pow er and lost it. How? If Weiss were giving a serious answer, it would be: by being right all the time. His fated adver sary, Stalin, is not present in the first act and has only a few lines in the second; the other characters do not refer to Stalin by name. The real heart of this play, as of “Marat/Sade,” Is in its ide ological arguments but, inter esting as the arguments are, the difference is crucial. While he wrote the “Marat/ Sade,” Weiss was moving from de Sade's position to Marat's; and so he imparted to bath sides. Here, however, no one can doubt that the Dadaists, the Jewish separatist, the Mensheviks, the Stalinists, and all the oth er opponents are wrong from the beginning and might as well have stayed home. Throughout the first act, the dissident students shout ed interruptions and applaud ed, often ironically. Making their special target the unfor tunate, unprepossesting little man Who played Lenin, they greeted his first appearance with a storm of derision, as if to say, “This pipsqueak is Lenin?” At one point, the ac tor turned toward the audi ence, as if to answer his tor mentors, but, thinking better of it, he swung back Into the play. The able Richard Munch, playing Trotsky, kept his cool rather better, al though he had the peculiar task of covering 40 years while made up to resemble Trotsky as an old man. Following the first act, the students found another rea son to object: several dozen more of them, informed that the play would start at 8, had arrived too late (since the of ficial starting time was 7:30), and been shut out of the the ater. Also, the students want ed some discussion at once. One asked, “Why should Weiss have the floor for three hours before we can answer him?” They seemed to object not so much to the sympathy shown Trotsky, al though there had been ap plause for the police who burst in to take him to exile, as to the cutting down of his contemporaries. Weiss mounted the stage, perhaps intending to mollify the objectors. Derisory shouts continued, and someone in vited Weiss to play Lenin himself. Any micro phone ceased working the moment it was handed to him. Unable to make himself heard, Weiss canceled the second act. A dozen students took the stage. Music blared forth on loudspeakers to drown them out. At once they began dancing, first ballroom style and then do ing high kicks, like the Rock ettes. When it was quieter, they announced they would re‐enact the play for those who had not seen it. One of them was identified as Trot sky, and all the others crowd ed together. “Trotsky” pan tomimed bowling, and the others fell over like tenpins. Not bad at all.

203-> Movie Mailbag
TO THE EDITOR: Am an aging kid (oh, God, 21 years old and hair receding!), once dropping out of college, twice dropped out, and cur rently copping out by work ing 42 hours a week for $80 (post taxes). Though I regret the ever‐increasing commer cialism of Arlo Guthrie as an Establishment product to be sold to alienated kids and concerned adults, I am hope ful that Arlo himself can escape unharmed. I was one of the few kids who discovered Arlo (or more accurately, whom Arlo dis covered) one hot afternoon up at Newport, R.I., during the annual Folk Festival (when festivals were really festive: pre‐post‐Woodstock). It was then that Arlo, in his assured but quiet, unpretentious style, served up his “Alice's Res taurant Massacree” to us starving kids. The impact, as is well known, was immedi ate. Arlo was one of us: I was he as he was me and, per haps, he could let You All into our bag of hope and de spair, joys and sorrows. Like Dylan and Donovan before him, Arlo was at once young, talented and THERE to laugh and cry with us. Only those who were there at that time can truly appreciate the em pathy of the moment. And, sure enough, there is Arlo (after Newport, tours, many hassles, and “Alice's Restaurant”) on the front page of the Establishment's newspaper's newspaper, tell ing what's going down today and tomorrow. On first read ing, this event encourages one to hope that maybe (just may be) straight society (i.e., Mom and Dad) could understand us a little better. But then reality wakes us from our dreams: whites packing their children into “private” schools in Mis sissippi, the Mafia chortling about their influence on pub lic officials in New Jersey, the collapse of the Biafran revolution, “enemy” shelling in Vietnam, Nixon's concern for the quality of life (and the lack of bread to do any thing about it), blah, blah, blah—all the junk that the kids vomit up everyday is thrown in our face. We shud der in revulsion and sudden ly remember the murders of the Kennedys and King, we see the blood in “Medium Cool,” hear the shotgun blasts in “Easy Rider” and see Alice standing alone and lonely at the close of “Alice's Restau So our hopes turn into de spair, our faith into bitter ness. Too tired for thoughts of suicide, we don't bother any longer to say help or please. We will continue to leave that reality behind, to search for our own thing, for our own forest of peace, love and serenity, but only be cause there is nothing else left for us to do. Okay, Arlo, I'll pet the hound‐dog affectionately (the dog is happy in his ignorance) and say, “It's all going to work out.” But there are too many tears behind my eyes and I am too old to cry and too tired to hope for much. ROBERT J. YANNUZZI JR. Fanwood, N. J. TO THE EDITOR: Mel Gussow writes about Arlo Guthrie, how he lives, his philosophy of life, and why kids want to be free. How can one devote so much expensive space to the view point of such an illiterate and materialistic peison? Guthrie talks about what kids want and how they don't want to live. With his income, he does not have to worry about education and earning a decent living. One just re mains ignorant. He is fortu nate that our forefathers raised this country to its pres ent standard of living and culture. It is very easy to talk about an individual living his own life when that individual owns a 260‐acre property with nobody nearby except the people he wishes to have around. With a world popu lation of two billion or more, and ever growing, only an ignorant person can indulge in such nonsense. BERT MAYER. Pine Beach, N. J. TO THE EDITOR: I assume that you published the article about Arlo as a befated piece of camp, That guy does not know how to express a logical thought in a sentence. Does he really speak for kids today? Which kids? Can you imagine any body, except maybe a mis guided, muddleheaded mi nority, listening, and what is more, understanding what Arlo is trying to say? What does he represent except a momentary financial success? I would dearly love to tell Arlo that the Good Teacher, “That Guy with the vibes,” is the supreme product of prob ably the strongest establish ment that ever existed (the Catholic Church), and only, through the good manage ment of this establishment is Arlo able to get all those good vibes. Arlo, do not knock establishments before you consult Dr. Bettelheim. FREDA NEUWIRTH Forest Hills, N. Y. TO THE EDITOR: Apparently it has not oc curred to Arlo Guthrie that if each of us were free “to do his thing” or “to do nothing;” there would be no movies, no movie houses, no concert halls, no money with which to buy concert or movie tick ets and, indeed, no New York Times. The very ink and paper used to record his wise words required the sacrifice a free dom on the part of hundreds of persons. The only thing a “kid” would be free to do would be to starve — unless, of course, papa were to give up some of his freedom in or der to furnish him with an allowance. It's too bad The Times dig nifies such drivel. EDITH W. SEIDEN The Bronx, N. Y. a rock musical at the Public Theater, closes to night after 89 perform ances.

204-> Nureyev's Back in Town—Socially
The guests filed into the gold‐carpeted living, room and went into a series of do‐it yourself introductions. The hostess ran around her leopard skin‐upholstered bed room, smoothed her lip stick‐shadowed eyelids and adjusted her curly golden haired wig. The, guest of honor, house guest of the hostess, sat in the perfume candle scented library on a throw of Argentine fox. He was covered by two just‐adequate red towels, and he was sip ping broth and watching color television—“Cleopatra's Daughter,” to be exact. The maid was in a cork walled bedroom, making up a hide‐a‐bed from which the guest had recently emerged It was a somewhat compli cated procedure because the guest had placed’ a feather comforter under the mattress. It was 8:30 P.M. Monday, the beginning of a short Ru dolf Nureyev social season. Mr. Nureyev, a disciplined man who knows an obliga tion when he meets one, breathed a little sigh, switched off the television, cast a stray glance at a record jacket of “The Russian Revolution, So viet Army Chorus and Band” and padded off, towels twisted around him, to change into something more substantial. He is in New York rehears ing and filming for a Burt Bacharach television ‘special and will leave for Los An geles next week to begin a two and one‐half‐month tour with the Australian Ballet. Monique ‘Van Vooren, the hostess, rushed into the liv ing room where Natalya Ma karova, the ballerina, was making a desultory inspection of silk flowers and a juxta position of paintings by Keane, Dufy and some illeg ible signatures. “Does she speak any Eng lish?” the Belgian‐born chan teuse and actress asked:’ Vladimir Rodzianko, a com poser and friend of the dancer, allowed that Miss Makarova, who defected to the West during the Lenin grad Kirov Ballet's visit to London in September, did speak some English. Miss Makarova, hair cov ered in a pink silk scarf draped into a hat, hitched up her black leather pants and sat down facing the room in a vantage point from which she could admire the stunning décolletage on most of the women. “They are extravaganza,” she said quietly, as the light reflected pounds of gold dog collars, necklaces, rings and belts. “It is beautiful to see.” Mr. Nureyev, in black trou sers and a pongee‐colored shirt with a, tie neckline, glided into the room. He smiled shyly, and a little vaguely, at most of the guests. A few, including Miss. Makarova and Erik Bruhn, the dancer, drew a glow of pleased recognition. “This whole thing was get ting out of hand so I in vited only his dear and close friends,” said Miss Van Vooren, nursing a broken fin gernail. “Valentino is the only one who does not know him; he was supposed to return to Rome but he stayed over an extra day to meet Nureyev.” Valentino, the Italian cou turier, resplendent in a red shirt, said he had met Mr. Nureyev before and that’ he had stayed over because he had a cold. Other guests included Rob ert H. Kenmore, chairman of the board of the Kenton Cor poration, and Mrs. Kenmore; Loredana Pavone, who is planning to open a boutique here in the spring; Daniella, an Italian model; Michael Nouri, an actor, and Christo pher Allan and James Mitch ell, both in public relations. Miss Van Vooren, who had spent part of the fall in Italy filming.. “The Decameron,” said that, all in all, she was absolutely exhausted. Mr. Nu reyev's plane had arrived late Sunday, and they had sat up the whole night. “I am dead,” She moaned. “We ate caviar, and I drank 100 proof Vodka. He doesn't drink.” “Yes, I drink,” said Mr. Nureyev, pointing to a cham paigne glass with ice in it.” She also reported that she had made Mr. Nureyev steak for breakfast that morning, and, despite insomnia, which usually kept her awake until 5 or 6 A.M., she planned to get ,up every morning during his visit and make his break fast. She would make steak, she indicated, because dancers use up a lot of en ergy and need meat twice a day. “The maid wasn't here this morning,” Mr. Nureyev said. He added that when he didn't have a matinee, his usual breakfast was tea, toast and honey. He was, he said, looking forward to his tour but hoped to stay here until after the Dec. 22 premiere of the American Ballet Theater's “Giselle.” It will star Miss Makarova and Mr. Bruhn. “I don't care anything about Christmas “and New Year's,” he said. “They mean nothing to me, and it doesn't matter where I am. The only thing that matters is my work.” Miss Van Vooren started rounding up her guests for the limousines’ waiting to take them to the Iperbole Restaurant for dinner. She had planned a veal menu with fish for Mr. Bruhn, who is on a diet, and steak for the dancers. She put on her long .white ermine coat, which she wears when she isn't in her sable or her leopard. For evening, that is. “I'm so secure now I wear cloth during the day,” she said.

205-> RALLIES PROTEST TRIAL IN CHICAGO
CHICAGO, Feb. 21 — More than 5,000 demonstrators gathered outside the Federal Building here today to protest the convictions in the Chicago conspiracy trial, then rallied in front of the Cook County Jail where the seven defendants are imprisoned. Chanting and waving pla cards denouncing the trial and Judge Julius J. Hoffman, the crowd packed the plazas and the streets around the tall brown, skyscraper for two hours, then nearly all of them headed in motorcades and by subways to the jail and county courthouse about five miles away. The first‐floor windows of the county courthouse were covered with plywood and ranks of helmeted sheriff's deputies and city police lined the steps and surrounded the building. Marshals urged the crowd back across the street and the demonstrators, chanting “You can't jail the truth,” marched to the north of the building, surrounded by policemen. Several snowballs were thrown at the police lines and at one point a scuffle broke out between undercover policemen moving through the crowd and demonstrators. A policeman fired three shots in the air and three arrests were made. Five of the defendants— David T. Dellinger, Rennie C. Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin and Thomas E. Hayden— were sentenced yesterday to five years in prison for crossing state lines to incite a riot dur ing the 1968 Democratic Na tional Convention. The two others—John R. Froines and Lee Weiner—were acquitted by the jury but are serving time for contempt of court. Defense attorneys filed an emergency motion in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit this morning asking bond for the five convicted men pending appeal. Judge Hoffman denied bond yesterday, ruling that the five were “dangerous men to be at large.” At the rally outside the Fed eral Building this afternoon, Susan Schultz, a member of the defense staff, read a message she said had come from the jailed men. It urged the demonstrators to remain orderly, warning that “the police will use any excuse to create an incident in order to deny us our bail.” Although there were several hundred blue‐helmeted police men stationed near the build ing with at least four busloads in reserve on Clark Street, there were no clashes. The only incident occurred when a young man, apparently a counter‐demonstrator, threw a tear gas canister into the crowd around the seapekrs' stand. People near the stand dabbed their eyes with wet cloths and went on listening to the speakers. Among the speakers was Douglas Dowd, a professor of economics at Cornell, who re called speaking at a rally in the same plaza last November with Mr. Davis, Mr. Dellinger, Mr. Froines and Fred Hampton, the Illinois Black Panther leader who was killed when the police raided his apartment in De cember. “Now three of those men are In jail and one has been mur dered,” Mr. Dowd said. “This adds to the consuming sense of rage which people in the Move ment feel.” Noting that many people had once laughed at Judge Hoffman, Mr. Dowd said, “These guys who are jokes are monsters and they are monsters with power.” Jesse Jackson, a leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, told the crowd that “the next conspiracy demon stration must be in Washington with a million people to say ‘no more fascism, no more im perialism, no more capitalism.’” Phil Ochs, the folk singer, sang “I Ain't Marchin' Any more.” Then he told the crowd: “The final public death of democracy was in Chicago in 1968 and now we have the final death of law in Chicago. Daley and Julius Hoffman are the as sassins of law.”

207-> ALLISON OF TWINS IS PUT ON WAIVERS
ORLANDO, Fla., March 31 (AP) — The Minnesota Twins placed Bob Allison, an out fielder, on waivers and sent 11 players to their minor league camp today as they trimmed the squad to within one of the 25‐player limit. An earlier report said the Oakland Athletics had claimed Allison immediately. Calvin Griffith, the Twins' owner, said today, however, that he had received no claims for the 36‐ year‐old outfielder. The waiver remains in effect for 72 hours and Griffith has 48 hours after that in which to change his mind before surren dering Allison. After today's cut, the 26th man on the Twins' roster be comes either Allison or Paul Powell. Powell is a 22‐year‐old rookie and the Twins' No. 1 draft choice last June. He played 20 games with Denver and 54 at Charlotte last season. Allison is one of three remaining members of the old Washington Senators, who moved to the Twin Cities in 1961

208-> Esteban Bilbao of Spain, Ex‐President of Cortes
MADRID, Sept. 23 (Reuters) —Esteban Bilbao, a leading government figure who served for 22 years, until 1965, as pres ident of the Cortes (parliament), died today at the age of 91. Mr. Bilbao was a close friend of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, the chief of state, who had named him to a Regency Council in 1947 to take charge of the government in the event of General Franco's death or incapacitation. Before the Civil War, in which General Franco gained power, Mr. Bilbao was a Basque Carlist leader prominent for his efforts in defense of the Roman Catholic Church. Gen eral Franco later awarded him with a noble title as a marquis.

209-> Breakfast Cereal Critic
WASHINGTON, July 23— In a carpeted hotel hallway last December, between ses sions of the White House nutrition conference, a poor black woman stopped short. bile stares at a craggy‐races man, a beard framing his chin. “He looks so much like Lincoln,” she said to her companion. “Do you think he could be any rela tion?” He is not. He is Robert Burnett Choate Jr., a wealthy 45‐ year‐old son of another family, the Choates of New England, who number Sena tors, ambassadors and other distinguishhed public men in their lineage. Until today, Mr. Choate was a private public man— a one‐man lobby for effective action against hunger and malnutrition. This morning, he took a very public Senate witness stand before very public television cameras and, in an intense, Yankee accented voice, indicted most dry breakfast cereals as be ing poor in nutritional con tent. “It was quite a change for me,” he says. “In this town, you learn that the way to get things done is by giving public officials the knowl edge and letting them take the acclaim. ‘Got Ticked Off’. “But here it is eight months after the White House conference, and I didn't see any of them out there pushing for food re forms. So, as screwy as it was for me, an uncivil en gineer to be up there talking about reforms while a bunch of industry lobbyists scrib bled madly, somebody had to do it. “I guess I finally just got ticked off and decided to get out in front myself.” It may have been Mr. Choate's first exposure to national attention, but it was by no means the first time he has provided effective fuel for the enduring work of the Washington “hunger lobby,” which seeks better food as sistance—and better food— for the poor. Mr. Choate came to Wash ington in late 1966 from an engineering background in Phoenix to engage in anti poverty work. He was soon immersed in an “engineer's analysis” of Federal antihunger programs. When he learned, in exten sive detail, how few poor people were being reached, he turned to the hunger is sue fulltime. At times working with public interest groups, at times financing his own ef forts, he helped to stimulate national interest in hunger, a subject previously discounted as not relevant to the United States. In the 1968 campaign, he prepared position papers for the Nixon forces and after the election became a con sultant at the Department of Health, Education and Wel fare. In June, 1969, he be came one of the principal consultants to the White House conference. “He has not been well known publicly,” says John Kramer, director of the Na tional Council on Hunger, “but Bob Choate has done more than any other person to make hunger a national issue.” Mr. Choate's concern with poverty, hunger and nutri tion came late. “Until I was about 30,” he says, “I was a cipher.” He was born Nov. 6, 1924, in Boston and grew up at the foot of Beacon Hill. His late father worked his way up from reporter to publisher of The Boston Herald. During childhood, the son was “latently” affected by the social welfare views of his grandmother, Mrs. Henri etta Crosby, who engaged in a never‐ending series of pub lic causes. “But those seeds didn't sprout for a long time,” Mr. Choate says. They did not sprout until after war‐time Navy duty, an engineering degree and years of work in the construction business. Then, eager to re marry and settle down (an earlier marriage had resulted in divorce after nine years), he moved to Phoenix “and I started to make some mon ey.” With the resulting freedom, he turned to poverty work, among blacks and Mexican Americans. Now as then, he is very much a loner. Mr. Choate, his wife, Jean, and their three children, Trinka, 9; Christopher, 7 and Rufus, 5, live comfortably in a big Victorian house in Washington's fashionably lib eral Cleveland Park Area. He no longer has his beard. He works out of a spare three‐room office in an old building on the fringe of downtown, with one assist ant. His friends, who some times sail with him on a char tered 35‐foot sloop, like him, but do not know him well. “Bob Choate is a nutri tional radical—one who be lieves that everything that can be done to improve nutri tion should be done, and now,” one friend says. But acquaintances say that there is an authoritarian quality to this “radicalism”— that he ignores the question of people's taste when it conies to what is nutritious. “It's not an unthinking thing,” says one. “It's just that he cannot stand the free dom to commit nutritional suicide.”

212-> Goodell Plans a Hearing On L.I.'s Unemployment
Senator Charles E. Goodeli announced yesterday that he would hold a hearing Aug. 31 to focus attention on the need for Federal action to increase employment on Long Island. The present employment rate on Long Island is 5.3 per cent and is significantly worse than the national average, ac cording to Senator Goodell. Last month the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the national unemployment aver age at aproximately 5 per cent. “Since January of this year, at least 7,885 manufacturing jobs have been lost in publicly acknowledged lay‐offs,” the Senator said. Reduced spending for de fense and aerospace projects were blamed by him for this crease. “Thirty‐five per cent of fac tory jobs and 8 per cent of all jobs in Nassau and Suffolk Counties are dependent on de fense and aerospace con tracts,” he said. The Senator will meet with residents of the county in the hearing room of the Nassau. County Executive Building in Mineola.

213-> Dodd Considers Running For Senate Independentiy
HARTFORD, June 9—Sena tor Thomas J. Dodd confirmed reports today that he is con sidering running for re‐election this fall on an independent ticket. He said he had been “approached by many people who are asking me to run as an independent and I am giv ing it consideration.” Reports were widespread that Senator Dodd might with draw as a candidate for re nomination at the Democratic state convention here on June 26 and 27. These reports at first were confirmed by Joseph Barbarette, Senator Dodd's press secretary. But later in the day Mr. Barbarette said the Senator was considering running as an independent. Senator Dodd is recovering at his home in Old Lyme from a mild heart attack he suf fered in New Britain on May 13. He spent nearly three weeks in a hospital. A third party is being formed by some of Senator Dodd's po litical friends. Albert P.

215-> Office Queen Registers Half‐Length Victory in $57,500 Liberty Bell Race
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 8 —Office Queen made her owner's trip here from Florida worth while today by winning the $57,500 Cotillion Handicap for 3‐year‐old fillies by half a length from Ellen Girl. Fast Attack was another half‐length back in the 10‐horse field at Liberty Bell Race Track. Office Queen, starting in tne No. 1 post position, was first out of the gate and settled into second. There she remained until the three‐quarter mark of the 1 1‐16 mile race. Stephen A. Calder's filly went to the front and, after dropping back at the quarter pole, came on again to win without more than a flick of the whip from John L. Rotz, the jockey. After the race, witnessed by 15,583. patrons, Rotz said that he would have preferred to have moved from off the pace, but never had the opportunity. Office Queen paid $4, $3 and $2.60 for $2 across the board and was timed in 1:44. This was her sixth stakes triumph of the year and the $34,500 first‐place money raised her 1970 earnings to $246,123. The stakes triumph was com forting for Rotz, who was aboard Silent Screen when the Elberon Farm star finished last here a week ago in the Minute man Handicap. Today Rotz could do little wrong. He won the six‐furlong sprint preceding the feature with Words and Music by a nose in a five‐horse photo fin ish in which White Wake and Bushido. raced to a dead heat for the place spot. In that race, Rotz was able to storm to the wire with a closing burst. In the stakes, Rotz was never more distant from the front than 1½ lengths at the quarter. He had’ Office Queen within a length of the early leader, Forbidden Lass, at the half. The early effort was too much for Forbidden Lass, who sloughed off to finish eighth. It was Rotz's third stakes triumph with Office Queen, the other two coming at the begin ning of the year at Hialeah. Her rider in her last seven starts, including three stakes triumphs, was Carlos H. Mar quez. Pass The Drink Scores CHICAGO, Aug. 8 (AP)—Pass The Drink, owned by Ogden Phipps of New York, defeated Coaltown Cat in a photo finish today in the $32,300 Round Table Handicap at Arlington Park. Sarasota Bay was third In the 1 1‐16‐mile turf race that drew seven 3‐year‐olds. Pass The Drink, top‐weighted at 120 pounds and ridden by Mike Venezia, made his move around the bend heading for home. He drew alongside Coal town Cat a furlong from the wire and survived a foul claim by Coaltown Cat's jockey, Carlos Marquez. Pass The Drink earned $18, 800 and was timed in 1:43 4‐5.

220-> NEGRO MAY FORCE A CAROLINA RUNOFF
COLUMBIA, S. C., Wednes day, June 10 (AP)—A surge of late votes from heavily Negro precincts may have forced Rep resentative L. McMillan into a runoff June 23 against a Negro physician in the Sixth District. Until the last few boxes from the district were reported, Mr. McMillan, 72 years old, ap peared to have won renomina tion to a 17th term in the Dem ocratic primary yesterday. But then Dr. Claud L. Steph ens, 37, a Negro physician from Kingstree, began to narrow the margin. Mr. McMillan led his three opponents easily, but their com bined vote total may be enough to force the runoff. The issue, however, was still in doubt early today. With 293 of the district's 295 precincts reporting, the unof ficial vote totals showed Mr. McMillan with 25,885, Dr. Stephens with 11, 216, Bill R.

221-> Market Place:
IF the Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation has its way it will pay substantially more tax for the privilege of claiming more income in an inflationary period. If that sounds odd, you heard it right The Pittsburgh company has asked the Internal Rev enue Service for permission to discontinue its last‐in‐first out method of valuing its raw‐material inventories in favor of the first‐in‐first‐out method. If allowed to do so, Alle gheny would have an “ex traordinary increase in both after‐tax earnings reported to shareholders and income taxes for 1970 of about $6.15 million. And Allegheny would keep on showing relatively higher earnings and pay more tax as long as inflation con tinued. Allegheny said it would drop LIFO because of the ef fect of continuing inflation ary increases in the cost of raw materials. If allowed to do as it wishes—Allegheny says it in tends then to pay the added 1970 taxes over a 10‐year pe riod—the company would not ‘assume any more that high cost recently purchased raw materials were going into the furnaces. Instead, it would assume that the oldest heap of ore—the cheaper ore pur chased first—was being shov eled into the inferno. Whether this is wise is de batable. The LIFO method tends to smooth out earn ings, which doesn't please shareholders. But since you show a higher cost for raw materials under LIFO in in flation you reduce your tax exposure, paying out less pre cious cash in a period of tight money. Earnings would benefit un der FIFO as long as inflation continues because the com pany shows a relatively low cost on raw materials. The proposal recalled the wholesale bookkeeping switch by the steel industry a while back from accelerated to straight‐line depreciation. In that move, the companies enhanced earnings because, in shareholder reports, they showed smaller charges for depreciation write‐offs. They lost nothing from a tax standpoint because, for tax purposes, they, continued to claim accelerated deprecia tion. Merger Accounting Curbs A major battle is brewing over the plan of the Ameri can Institute of Certified Public Accountants to curb current accounting methods in corporate mergers: The exposure draft is pres ently warming the hands and collars of financial men throughout the land. Mean while, early‐bird critics are already chirping dissent. Take Thornton O'glove. The dour accounting expert of Scheinman, Hochstin & Trotta thinks there is a loophole in the draft that favors con glomerates. While the intent of the new rules is to force recog nition of goodwill through a write‐off not to exceed 40 years, Mr. O'glove believes large portions of goodwill can be eliminated from the write‐off. He notes that where a company acquires another company and gives less than one‐third of its voting stock in the acquisition this be comes a purchase ‐ not a pooling. He says that Paragraph 24 of the draft allows the ac quiring company to discount the market value of its com mon shares if the market is judged to be thin or volatile, among other things. He adds that, if a $10‐million acquisi tion included $5‐million in goodwill, the company might claim it actually paid $8‐mil lion in valuing the acquisi tion. This would reduce the write‐off portion to $3‐mil lion. Further, according to Paragraph 84, consideration should be given to the fact that goodwill is not a deduct ible item for tax purposes. Thus, the fair market value attributed to goodwill would be further written down $1.5 million in recognition ‘of the fact that it is not deductible for income tax purposes,. (This assumes a 50 per cent corpo rate tax fate.) Under reasonable circum stances, therefore, a 40‐year write‐off might involve an insignificant portion of good will and this method could be used over and over again to water down the effect of the proposed rule.

224-> Innovations on 747 Expected to. Calm the Safety‐Minded
When the Boeing 747 takes off on its scheduled inaugu ral commercial flight Wed nesday night from Kennedy International Airport, it will carry aloft innovations in air safety that experts are predicting will calm many safety‐minded critics. Almost since the day it was announced more than three years ago, the jumbo jet project has evoked con cern over safety for two seasons: the sheer size of the 747—with the specter of 350 or more passengers dying in a single disaster—and the spotty safety record of many tetliners during their year or so of service. But on the threshold of the Jumbe jet age, the aviation World is optimistic. An 11th‐hour safety ques tion about one aspect of the 747 was raised last week by John H. Shaffer, head of the Federal Aviation Administra tion. He ruled it would not be permitted to make com mercial flights until two faulty escape chutes—which would be used by passengers after a crash‐landing — were modified. Boeing and Pan American World Airways have pre dicted they will have the problem solved by Wednes day, when Pan Am plans to inaugurate commercial 747 service between New York and London. Mr. Shaffer said that basi ally the plane, because it in corporates the lessons of more than a decade of ex perience with jetliners, “will be the safest airliner any body's ever built.” Joseph F. Sutter, Boeing's director of engineering on the project, said during an interview in Seattle: “It's been 15 years since we built our first jet airliner, the original 707. We had Safety foremost in our minds those days, but we were new at the game. We didn't know how to cover all our bets. Now we do, I think. We're 15 years smarter.” This is the historical pat tern that has worried some people concerned with air safety: ¶The world's first jet liners, the British‐built Com ets, had to be permanently grounded shortly after their introduction in the mid‐nine teen‐fifties because metal fa tigue in the plane triggered two disasters over the Medi terranean. ¶When the first trans oceanic jets, such as the 140‐ passenger Boeing 707, began flying in 1958, some pilots who had flown the relatively sluggish propeller planes ran into problems in the cockpits of these new swift, agile air liners. Mechanical problems also were encountered in some of these first jetliners. The result was that the jets had a fatal‐accident rate dur ing their first four years of operations that was more than three times as high as it was later after the pilots tally the plane, because it in had more experience and the planes were modified to elim inate mechanical hazards. ¶Many pilots had the same kind of “teething” problems with the first three‐engine jetliners, notably the 100‐ passenger Boeing 727, intro duced in 1964. During the first 18 months of 727 service, the fatal‐accident rate for these jets was three times as high as it was in later years. Jack Funk, safety director for Boeing, said company en gineers studied in detail all 108 serious jet accidents in the non‐Communist world be tween 1958 and 1968 and de signed the 747 “to eliminate, as much as we could, the causes of these accidents.” Much of the emphasis, he said, was devoted to reduc ing opportunities for pilots to make mistakes—redesign ing and improving the con trol system and building in electronic and mechanical systems that “make it easy for a pilot to get out of trouble.” The reason for this em phasis was that the accident analysis had indicated that, of the 80 per cent of acci dents whose cause could be determined, 63.4 per cent were caused by mistakes by the crew. About 12 per cent were laid to failure of the en gines or other components of the plane. When the Federal Aviation Administration on Dec. 30 issued Boeing a “type cer tificate” for the 747 — the Government document that authorizes a plane to carry passengers — it ended the most exhaustive safety an alysis of a new airliner ever made. Robert Stanton, a Los An geles‐based F.A.A. official who headed the certification team, estimated that 38 Government inspectors spent more than 47,000 man‐hours to evaluate the craft from a safety point of view. He said he thought the end product was “a safer air plane than any we've had before.” The same kind of confi dence was expressed during an interview by Jerome Led erer of the National Aero nautics and Space Adminis tration, one of the country's leading authorities on avia tion safety. “Because of what we've learned over the years,” Mr. Lederer said, “and the experi ences that pilots now have with flying jets, I'm very optimistic about the jumbo jets. “About the only problem I can see is that this plane is too easy to control and so delightful to fly that it might lead to complacency on the part of the pilots.” Similar pilot overconfidence was blamed in part for some early Boeing 727 landing‐ap proach mishaps, he said. An unscheduled test of one safety aspect of the new jumbo jet occurred at Renton Field in Seattle on Dec. 13. A 747 descended through grey skies at the end of a test hop, and moments be fore touching down it shud dered in a cross‐wind. Its right wing dipped slightly. The plane landed short of the runway. The landing gear beneath its drooping right wing became mired in mud and snapped as the jet hurtled forward. Despite the broken landing gear the 747 did not pancake on the runway. It heeled over to the right, scraping two of its four engine pods on the runway, but continued to roll and stopped without major damage or injury to the test pilots. The plane survived its hard landing so handily, Mr. Sutter explained, because it was “four legged” — the first of this kind. To support its 350‐ ton weight, the 747 has four separate landing gears, two on each side of the plane. Each of these is so strong that the 747 can land using only one on each side, plus the conventional nose gear. “This illustrates part of the design philosophy in the 747,” Mr. Sutter said. “At points where we used to have one system to do a job, we now have two. And where we had two, we now have four. When something goes wrong, you try to make sure it is not catastrophic.” Some observers have won dered whether the Renton Field incident was evidence of the plane's likelihood to induce overconfidence among pilots — or whether its great weight and inertia might in duce miscalculation during landings. Boeing officials have attributed the incident to test pilot misjudgment. The pilot has been dismissed from the 747 project. The following are among the reasons cited by Boeing and F.A.A. officials on why they predict the 747 will prove to be the safest air liner and why passengers may have a better chance of survival after a crash landing: ¶Most of the interior ma terials used in the passenger cabin are fire‐resistant, mak ing crash landings safer from that standpoint. ¶The plane's large below deck cargo compartment is expected to absorb much of the impact during crash land ings. ¶Every flight control has at least one “back‐up” sys tem in case of failure. The wingflaps and rudder con trols, for example, can be regulated by any of four in dependent hydraulic systems. There are two independent automatic‐pilot systems. ¶The 747 is highly auto mated. Pilots say they can remove their hands from the controls 10 minutes away from an airport and the plane will land itself using only the electronic automatic pilot. The 747's computerized inertial navigation system should all but eliminate navigation and altitude errors. There are ad vanced electronic aids for the pilot, including an altimeter that bounces radio signals off the ground during the landing approach to measure altitude within an accuracy of two feet. Mr. Shaffer of the F.A.A. expressed his confidence in the plane this, way: “It's not necessary to believe any more that accidents are part of the price of introducing a new piece of equipment.” Referring to the past prob lems with new jets, he added: “We have everything going for us but statistics, and I be lieve they will be on our side before the year is out.”

225-> SPECIALIST MOVE BY BEAR, STEARNS
Bear, Stearns & Co., the in stitutional brokerage house, has established a financial relation ship with John E. Barrett & Co., a specialist firm on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In doing so, Bear, Stearns became the ‘first brokerage house to acquire an interest in a Big Board specialist book. The move, if followed by.ntheri houses, could contribute to the further breakdown of the struc ture of the securities industry and add new capital to special ist units. Specialists are the market makers in the shares’ listed on the exchange. They do not deal with the public, but do business strictly with other brokerage houses, creating the prices ‘that reflect supply and demand forces in the stocks in which’ they specialize. Move Is Explained “We have formed a joint ac count with them,” said V. Theo dore Low, senior partner ‘of Bear, Stearns “We feel we can help the specialist by adding our capital to the specialist book. We provided our capital to that unit. ‘ Mr. Low indicated that tech nically Bear, Stearns had added capital. to the Barrett book, rather than purchase an inter est in the firm itself. He said a Bear, Stearns— partner, Mi chael J. Heaney Jr., was in training to join the Barrett firm. Mr. Low declined to confirm or deny a reprt that the Bear, Stearns participation in the Bar rett book amounted to 30 per cent. “We share in a joint ac count with them in their book,” he said. Because of the increasing dominance of the market by large institutions dealing in big blocks of stock, it has become increasingly, difficult for spe cialists to ‘bring sufficient capital to bear to absorb the huge transactions of institu tions. The infusion of capital from non‐specialist firms could add substantial liquidity to spe cialist units and slow down the movement of block transactions, away from the floor of thel stock exchange. However, cur rent stock exchange rules se verely restrict the dealings of specialists. For example, Bear, Stearns will not be able to solicit any orders in the 24 stocks in which the Barrett firm specializes. Moreover, it will not even be able to accept unsolicited., orders in these issues if they come from the company ‘itself, any officer, director or 10 per cent stockholder or froni any institu tions, such as banks, insurance companies or mutual funds. This means Bear; Stearns— an institutional house—will no longer be able to accept orders from institutions to ‘buy or sell any of the issues in which Barrett makes markets. Rule Change Desired “I think it's quite evident that we feel these restrictions make it quite difficult to do business,” Mr. Low asserted. A§Ited if. Bear, Steams was at tempting to get the exchange to change its rules, he said, “We certainly hope they will be changed.” Bear; Stearns and at least two other brokerage houses already have acquired interests in spe cialist books on the American Stock ‘Exchange, where the rules apparently are less strict. Some Wall Street experts feel the trend will spread rapidly in the future. In another development in volving the exchange, Andrew J. Melton; Jr. president of the. Investment Bankers Associa tion, disclosed he had sent a letter to the Securities ‘and Ex change Commission, urging the adoption of a new “interim” commission‐rate schedule by Mr., Melton recommended that the interim schedule be based on the schedule proposed by the Big Board Feb. 13; ex cept that the increases on small transactions ‘he reduced and the volume discounts on block transactions ‘also ‘be made smaller. Be asserted that prompt adop tion of an interim schedule would provide criticall3r, needed rate relief while the ‘S.E.C. studied the rate. package of fered by the exchange ‘and analyzed related questions.

226-> U.S.L.T.A. Fined $2,500 by World Unit
LONDON, April 22 (UPI)— The United States Lawn Tennis Association was fined $2,500 today by the International Lawn Tennis Federation for rule violations at recent tourna ments in Boston and Philadel phia. The U.S.L.T.A. has acknowl edged the infractions and, as result of the Philadelphia in cident, is denying a 1971 sanc tion to the promoter. A $2,000 fine was levied be cause four Americans and two Australians used a Davis Cup format during a charitable tour nament in Boston last month. The $500 fine resulted from an unapproved scoring system used in the Philadelphia tournament in February. Basil Reay, secretary of the I.L.T.F., said the fines were im posed after a meeting of the federation's management com mittee in Paris. They are mod erate, he added, “but in the future heavier fines will be im posed and stricter disciplinary action will be taken.” The sportsman's Tennis Club of Boston received approval to conduct an open tournament on the Harvard indoor courts last month to raise funds for its youth program. Arthur Ashe, Clark Graebner, Cliff Richey, and Stan Smith were the Ameri can players who opposed Fred Stolle and John Newcombe of Australia for a $20,000 purse in four singles and a doubles match. A 12‐point tiebreaker game, to be used when a set reached 6‐6, was initiated during the $60,000 International Tennis Players Association open in Philadelphia. The idea was to eliminate marathon sets and produce faster, more exciting matches. Ed Fernberger and his wife, Marilyn, who served as co chairmen of the tournament, an nounced last night, however, that they would run it next February under its original name, the Philadelphia indoor tennis championships, and con tinue to use the tie‐breaker. “We intend to apply through the proper channels for sanc tion,” Mrs. Fernberger said to day after having been apprised of the I.L.T.F. action. “We did not wish to be defiant, difficult or uncooperative, but we thought we were doing some thing in the broadest and best interest of tennis.’ She declined to say whether the tournament would be strict ly for professionals, placing it outside the jurisdiction of the U.S.L.T.A., if a sanction for an open was withheld. Alastair B. Martin, president of the U.S.L.T.A., said Wednes, day night that the association would pay the fine. However, he added, the federation's ac tion “strengthens my position that more home rule should be given to national associations.” “We are a member of the federation and will pay the fine, but there was no real con flict here,” he said. Regarding the Philadelphia tournament, he said he under stood that it would be held as a professional event next year.

228-> Straw Hat Awards Devised for Summer Actors
The Council of Stock Thea ters, comprising some of the major summer theaters in the country, has created the Straw Hat Awards for excel lece In the American sum mer theater. The first annual presenta tions will be made June 16 from 5:30 to 8 P.M. at the Fabergé Townhouse, 5 West 64th Street, before a gather ing of theater personalities including Tom Ewell, Arlene Francis, Katherine Crosby, Betsy Palmer, Edie Adams, Sid Caesar, Barry Nelson, Joel Grey and Gig Young. Cary Grant, who conceived the idea for the awards, with George Barrie, president of Fabergé Inc., will make the presentations. Winners will be judged by council mem bers. Whitfield Connor, presi dent of the council, said the awards would be selected in five categories: Best new play, best starring perform ance by an actress, best star ring performance by an actor, most promising new talent and an achievement award. The achievement award will be given to an actor or actress whose career began in summer stock and who rose to stardom in the theater or allied arts. A gold straw hat suspended in a lucite cube mounted on an ebony base will be given each winner. Mr. Connor called the awards “a long overdue rec ognition of the many tal ented artists on the summer circuit.” The Barbwire Theater pro duction of “The Cage,” writ ten, produced and performed by six former convicts from San Quentin, will be brought to the New York stage by David Carroll. It will open at the Playhouse Theater, 357 West 48th Street, on June 18 after a week of previews. The 12 years spent by Rick Cluchey, a lifetime parolee, in San Quentin provide the basic material for the play. The author also plays the role of Hatchet in an inte grated cast. His explanation of the title is that “a cell represents life, a cage repre sents death.” The second half of the work is described as a con frontation, in which the audience's questions about crime and punishment are answered by the acting troupe.

229-> House Votes Arms‐Sale Credits
WASHINGTON, March 24— The House approved legislation today authorizing $770‐million in sales of arms on credit to foreign countries, particularly developing nations, over the next two years. Administration officials mean while told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that for eign sales of arms on credit could be expected to increase in the corning years as part of the Nixon doctrine of assisting friendly nations to assume the burden of their own defense. The Deputy Defense Secre tary, David Packard, told the Committee that the arms credits would be extended to such na tions as Nationalist China, Iran and South Korea. He said those were countries in which “we have vital security interests” but which were economically unable to buy outright the arms they needed to “protect our mutual security interests.” The legislation, passed by the House by a 351‐to‐26 vote, now goes to the Senate, where it will be considered by the Sen ate Foreign Relations Commit tee. One critical question being raised by the Senate committee is whether the Administration, in promoting the credit sales of arms, is dislocating the domestic economies of the de veloping countries. Mr. Packard and U. Alexis Johnson, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, assured the Committee that in extending arms credits, the executive branch took into ac count economic as well as military considerations to make sure there would be no inter ference with the recipient country's pace of economic and social development. Senator J. W. Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas, the Com mittee chairman, replied that he “could not think of a worse way to do so than to make it easy for them to buy bigger and better armaments. The legislation passed by the House contains amendments encouraging the President to seek ways to control the inter national trade in arms, caution ing against sale of arms to military governments that deny “social progress” or “fundamental rights” to their people, and calling upon the President to negotiate a Middle East arms limitation with the Soviet Union while making sure that adequate arms credits are available to Israel to protect her security. The Administration‐requested legislation passed by the House extends for two years a law passed in 1968 when Congress tried to impose some controls over Pentagon sales of arms abroad. Prior to 1968 there were no limitations on the amount of arms that the Pentagon could sell on credit. Since then the Pentagon has had to obtain Congressional authorization for credit sales, and Congress, in turn, has imposed ceilings on the amount of such sales. The two‐year extension, for example, sets a ceiling of $385‐ million in credit sales in the 1971 and 1972 fiscal years. The credits usually are extended for a 10‐year period at an interest rate comparable to the rate the Federal Government has to pay to borrow money. In considering the extension of the law, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is raising the question whether similar Congressional limitations should be imposed on the sale and transfer of surplus weapons. Vast amounts of surplus weap ons are now becoming available and the Pentagon presently is under no Congressional restric tions on the amount that it sells or gives to foreign coun tries.

230-> SUSSEX TITLE WON, BY THE IRISHMAN
BRANCHVILLE, N. J., Aug. 8 —Melanie Smith's The Irish man, who could do no better than fourth place in the final class, captured the amateur owner jumper championship after a three‐horse jumpoff to day as the Sussex County Horse Show ended a six‐day run. The point The Irishman picked up in the last event enabled him to tie Ann Yohai's Appy Leo, the jumpoff winner, and Nancy McClure's Shorty, who finished second, for the championship. All three horses had 8 points. In the jumpoff, only The Irish man was clean. Appy Leo had two faults, front touches on the second and sixth fences, and Shorty had one knockdown for four faults. Appy Leo barely beat out Shorty in the last class. Appy Leo. was clocked in 36.48 sec onds to 36.56 for Shorty. Had Shorty been just 9‐one‐hun dredths of a second faster he would have won the class and the championship without a jumpoff. But he didn't even take the reserve title. Barney Ward's Catbird won the final event tonight, an open jumper time class that went to two jumpoffs. Catbird beat out Kip Rosenthal's Rome Dome, 34.62 seconds to 35.45. Both horses were clean. Frank Chapot of the United States Equestrian Team was up on Mrs. Nelson Slater's Co manche in winning his second preliminary jumper class of the show. No championships were awarded in the preliminary, in termediate or open jumper divi sions on the recommendation or the American Horse Shows Association. Comanche and six other mounts were clean the first time around. In the jumpoff, Comanche was first out of the gate. Chapot gave the aged grey gelding a speedy and fault less ride. He was, clocked, in 35.67 seconds, a performance designed to discourage the op position. None of the other horses in the jumpoff came close. Cedar Hill Farm's Springdale, han dled by Karen Peterson, was second in 41.20. Li‐Ke, Corny Guest's 6‐year‐old chestnut gelding, won the regular working hunter crown with.15 points. Ridden by Pat Heuckeroth, Li‐Ke scored 15 points. Hurdle. Hill Farms Smilin’ Jack won the last class —Li‐Ke was third—and the 5 points the aged bay gelding col lected enabled him to take re serve honors with 8 points. Lynn Trusdell's Super Hill outclassed the opposition to win the first‐year green work ing hunter championship with 22 points. THE CHIEF AWARDS Amateur‐Owner Jumpers—Ann Yohai's Appy Leo.

232-> A BIG BOARD FIRM GROWS RESTLESS
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jen rette, Inc., the institutional brokerage house, has expanded the conditions under which it would consider quitting the New York Stock Exchange. In a revised prospectus is sued yesterday, D. L. J. said might leave the exchange certain questions involving membership restrictions were not resolved in its favor. These were understood to involve the concern's diversification. into capital management and pub lic opinion polls. D. L. J., also suggested that it would abandon its exchange membership if a “substantial discount” in commission rates for large trades were imple mented. Such a discount was proposed Feb. 13 by the ex change. The prospectus revealed, in addition, that D.L.J. increased its earnings in 1969. Virtually all of the other brokerage con cerns that report their earn ings have indicated that they incurred substantial profit de clines, if not losses, during the year. The Donaldson concern said its earnings last year rose to $7,817,977, or $1.12 a share, from 1968's $6,839;077, or $1.01 a share. The increase stemmed entirely from a reduc tion in Federal income taxes. The concern's pretax income fell to $14.3‐million from $14.5 million. Public Ownership A footnote indicated that the decline in pretax income re sulted from the use of more conservative accounting proced ures in evaluating securities held. D.L.J. is the concern that forced the public ownership issue on Wall Street last May when it filed its initial pros pectus for a public offering of 800,000 D.L.J. shares. Since then the stock exchange has proposed rules changes that would permit members to sell their shares publicly to a limited extent. The Big Board also has pro posed substantial volume dis counts in commission rates for large transactions of the kind in which Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette specializes. These pro posed rate changes are under Consideration by the‐Securities and Exchange Commission. “It is P.L.J.'s present inten tion to remain a member cor poration of the exchange,” the concern said yesterday in its new, prospectus. “However, if a substantial discount in the minimum commissions for large volume transactions is adopted by the exchange, D.L.J. might conclude that the long‐term profitability of its business would be enhanced by with drawing from membership.” Other Questions The Donaldson concern also noted that the S.E.C. was con sidering such other questions as competition among securities markets, exchange membership restrictions, access to exchange by nonmembers and member restrictions to discourage trad ing in listed securities on other markets. “The resolution of these is sues could create a significant change in the structure and oco nomics of the securities indus try and could have a materially adverse effect upon the com pany's operatons,” D.L.J. as serted. “The company will continue to evaluate its membership on the securities exchanges in light or future changes in me com mission structure and other rules of such exchanges,” it said. If institutional membership on the stock exchange were granted, the ‘bulk of D.L.J.'s customers theoretically could transact their own business on the exchange, thereby elimi nating a portion of the concern's securities brokerage business. The revised prospectus dis closed that revenues from New York Stock Exchange commis sions in 1969 accounted for 56 per cent of D.L.J.'s total rev enues of $31.03‐million. The concern said it felt it could develop other compensation ar rangements if it left the ex change, although there was no assurance of such arrange ments. Many leaders of the stock exchange community fear that D.L.J.'s exit from exchange membership might trigger the departure of other members. The activities of such concerns in the “third market'—over the‐counter trading of listed stocks—could seriously, detract from the viability of the central marketplace. Recently Blyth & Co., a ma jor investment banker and bro ker, was purchased by the I.N.A. Corporation, a publicly owned insurance holding com pany, and therefore was forced to resign its exchange member ship. It has resumed activities in the third market.

233-> GOODELL SHIFTS CAMPAIGN CHIEF
Senator Charles E. Goodell, who has become increasingly dissatisfied with his own politi cal campaign, announced yes terday that he was replacing his campaign manager, former Deputy Mayor Robert W. Sweet. The Republican‐Liberal can didate, who met late Tuesday night with Mr. Sweet in Wash ington, issued a press release yesterday afternoon announc ing that Brian Conboy, his 31‐ year‐old administrative assist ant, would take over as man ager and that Mr. Sweet would become a campaign co‐chair man. The release praised Mr. Sweet as “an invaluable as set,” but the staff reorganiza tion followed two weeks of private meetings at which the Senator complained that his campaign was “not getting off the ground.” Yesterday's changes, accord ing to campaign sources, re flected a difference in attitude between candidate and man ager — a difference that mu tual friends characterized as Mr. Sweet's “defeatism” and Mr. Goodell's “go‐for‐broke atti tude.” Mr. Sweet and Mr. Goodell disagreed, for example, on whether to use the $100,000 they were able to raise this summer for television adver tising this month. Mr. Sweet contended that the Goodell cam paign could not hope to raise more than $750,000 over‐all and, that television money should be saved until October. The Senator overruled his manager and ordered his staff to speed as much as possible — including loans from friends — to begin showing a series of 10‐second commercials on Labor Day. “We'll spend the money be fore we get it,” Mr. Goodell re portedly said. “We could win this election in October, but I don’ want to take a chance on losing it in September.” Mr. Sweet, who was ap pointed last June 11 after Mr. Goodell had spent six months looking for a manager, was also involved in running disputes with at least three key men in the Goodell campaign — Mr. Conboy, who was deputy man ager; George Mitrovich, the senator's press secretary, and Sid Davidoff, an assistant to Mayor Lindsay who often feuded with Mr. Sweet when Mr. Sweet was a Deputy Mayor. Mr. Conboy, a special as sistant to Ramsey Clark, when Mr. Clark was United States At torney General, will direct a paid staff of 35 in Mr. Goodell's campaign against Representa tive Richard L. Ottinger, the Democratic candidate who is leading in the‐pre‐election polls of both candidates, and James L. Buckley, the Conservative party candidate. Two new members of that staff were also announced in yesterday's press release. Paul Leventhal, press secretary of Senator Jacob K. Javits, was named as campaign press sec retary in New York, and Jean McKee, a special assistant to Mr. Javits, Was named to co ordinate scheduling activities. Mr. Buckley, meanwhile, re ceKred one of the most en thusiastic receptions of the statewide campaign as he greeted white‐collar and blue collar workers in the down town financial district at the noon hour yesterday. Wearing a white hard hat, which had been given to him by workers at the World Trade Center building site, the 47‐ year‐old candidate declared that “the guts” of his can didacy was “a test of con fidence in this country.” He added at an impromptu rally in front of the subtreasury build ing on Wall Street that “it is time we put people in power who have confidence in this country.” Mr. Buckley joined his op ponents, Senator Goodell and Mr. Ottinger, in welcoming tele vised debates. However, the three candidates have made various proposals. Their repre sentatives are scheduled to meet this afternoon at WABC TV to discuss a debate invita tion by that station.

234-> Bridge:
ONE of the world's great est players, Jean Besse of Switzerland, paid a brief business visit to New York last weekenu and found time to play bridge in a private game at the home of Edgar Kaplan. The two authorities found themselves in partnership on the diagramed deal, with Besse sitting West and Kap lan East. The bidding was aggres sive all round the table. South had one of the rare hands on which a vulnerable overcall is appropriate with a four‐card suit. West ven tured one spade on his rather feeble hand and East strained to show his spade support when North jumped to three hearts. Against four hearts West led a trump and South won with dummy's queen and led the diamond jack. East won with the king and played a second trump, taken by the ace in the closed hand. A diamond ruff, a club to the ace, and another diamond left this position: ?? A low club was led from the dummy, and West won with the eight. He returned the club ten, and South ruffed East's queen. South ruffed another diamond, ruffed the last club with his last trump, and cashed his diamond winner, discarding the spade four. Finally he had to guess the spade situa tion, and he judged correctly that East must have had the spade ace to justify his opening bid. So he led to the spade jack and made his contract. Besse was quick to criti cize his own defense in the post‐mortem. He should, he pointed out, have led a spade when he won the sec ond club lead. This would have forced South to guess the spade situation before he knew the location of the club honors. But Besse is not a mathe matician and a computer consultant for nothing. His own computer was hard at work, and he raised the post mortem to a higher plane by suggesting that his partner could have done slightly better in defense. East should, said Besse, have played the club queen when the suit was led from dummy in the diagramed sit uation. The idea would be to make South think that East held the club king. He would then be inclined to place West with the spade ace, to justify the one‐spade bid, and would probably mis guess in spades and go down in the contract. Whether South would have been deceived by this in genious maneuver is open to question. But there is no question that it reveals the depth of Besse's thinking, and that he deserves his reputa tion as one of the finest card players anywhere in the bridge world.

239-> Peking Withholds Comment
HONG KONG, March 24— Communist officials and com mentators in Vietnam and Laos have been quicker to react to recent events in Cambodia than their counterparts in China. While Peking seldom acts with undue haste, it has been expe cially slow in commenting di rectly on the action taken in Cambodia to oust Prince Si hanouk. China has been moving cau tiously toward a public ap tpraisal of the events, as if un certain about what role it might play in a situation in which the Vietnamese and Laotian Communist leadership have a more direct stake. Hsinhua, the official Peking press agency, today reported the political change in Cam bodia, five days after the event. But it freely quoted foreign accounts of the coup and refrained from any com ment. While China has withheld comment, North Vietnam, the provisional revolutionary gov ernment set up by the Vietcong in South Vietnam and the Pathet Lao movement have all come out in support of Prince Sihanouk. The strongest expression of support came from another prince. The Laotian Communist leader, Prince Souphanouvong, said in a statement made public today that on behalf of the “Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people” he wished to ex press to Prince Sihanouk his “high indignation at the ad venturous acts of the United States ‐ paid extreme rightist group in Pnompenh.” He voiced “the friendship and the militant solidarity of the Lao people toward the fra ternal Khmer [Cambodian] peo ple in the struggle against our common enemy, the United States imperialist aggressors.”

240-> 1‐Cent Stamp Sold for $280,000
A one‐cent stamp that would not move a postcard—even in normal times—brought $280, 000 at auction here last night. The stamp, the most valuable in the world, is the British Guiana 1856 one‐cent magenta. It was purchased by a syndi cate of eight men headed by Irving Weinberg, a Wilkes Barre, Pa., collector. “It's a long‐term investment,” Mr. Weinberg said. He described the syndicate as “sophisticated businessmen who want to pro tect themselves against infla tion.” The seller was an Australian collector who has managed to remain anonymous since he purchased the stamp in 1940 for around $45,000. Collectors from all over the world attended the auction at the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel, con ducted by Robert R. Siegel Auctions, a New York firm. Bidding on the British Guiana started at $100,000 and pro gressed to the sale price in about three minutes. The total amount bid at the auction was $878,720, some what under the record of about $900,000 at a similar auction a year ago. Collectors said they had expected the total last night to reach $1‐million. Among the other items pur chased by Mr. Weinberg for his syndicate was a United States 24‐cent carmine, rose and blue airmail stamp with an inverted picture of an airplane in its center. The cost of this stamp was $34,000, which was $1,000 more than Mr. Weinberg paid for another of these inverted airmail stamps a year ago. The British Guiana one‐cent magenta is one of a few only one‐known stamps—unique in stamp‐collecting parlance—but none has had the romantic appeal to stamp collectors or the layman than the reddish bit of paper sold here last night. It has a well‐documented history. Produced in 1856 by a local printer at Demerara (nowt, Georgetown) in British Guiana (now Guyana), to alleviate a shortage of postage stamps, the one‐cent was discovered in 1873 by a teen‐ager, L. Vernon Vaughan, who sold it to a neighbor for six shillings, (then, about $1.50) so that he could buy more colorful stamps. Subsequent sales led it into the fabulous collection of Baron Arnold de la Renotwe von Kriegsfeld Philipp von Ferrari, an Austrian rending in Paris. When the baron fled Paris for Switzerland at the start of World War I, he left his stamp collection behind and eventually willed it to the Berlin Museum. The collection, however, was seized by France and sold in the nixeteen‐twenties as Ger man reparations. It was at one of these sales that Arthur Hind, a manu facturer of plush in Utica, N. Y., who was born in England, pur chased the stamp for about $32,500, reportedly outbidding King George V of Britain for the stamp. The stamp is the only British adhesive not in the Royal Philatelic Collection, which has been maintained by King George's successors. After Mr. Hind's death, the stamp could not be found with in his collection, but eventually turned up in his desk. He had sent it off to an ex hibition and on its return had tossed the envelope containing the stamp into a drawer of the desk. Mrs. Hind said the stamp was a gift from her husband and won a court suit, and it was eventually sold for about $45, 000 to an Australian collector who has kept his identity secret. The octagon‐shaped design, its corner clipped to shape, rather than “cut ‐ square”— straight up the sides and along the bottom and top, which was normal for unperforated stamps of the mid‐nineteenth century —followed the design of earlier British Guiana stamps, which showed a sailing vessel and the colony's Latin motto, Da mus petimusque que vicissim (We give and we seek in re turn). At the time the one‐cent stamp was printed on magenta colored paper, four‐cent stamps were also printed on blue coated paper. A number of the four‐cent stamps survive today. Among other one‐of‐a‐kind stamps are a Swedish 1855 yel low five‐skilling banco stamp, which should have been green; a provisional Gold Coast 1885 stamp, one‐penny on a four‐ penny magenta stamp, and United States postmaster stamps from Basemen, N. H., and Lockport N. Y., issued before the first United States stamps of 1847. There is also an envelope bearing the one‐cent and two‐ cent Mauritius stamps of 1847. All have realized extremely high prices when offered for sale.

242-> U.S. and Japan Set Up Joint Panel in Okinawa
NAHA, Okinawa, March 24 —The United States and Ja pan inaugurated here today a joint commission that will co ordinate measures necessary to prepare Okinawa and the other islands of the Ryukyu chain for their transfer to Japanese administrative con trol in 1972. The preparatory commission was established under terms of the joint commique issued in Washington last November after talks between President Nixon and Premier Eisaku Sato. The United States represen tative on the panel is Lieut. Gen. James B. Lampert, the High Commissioner for the Ryukyus, while Japan has designated Jiro Takase, a dip lomat of ambassadorial rank. Chobyo Yara, Chief Executive of the Government of the Ryukyus, will serve as an adviser. Among the many complex problems to be dealt with are the replacement of the cur rent United States regula tions and legal systems with the Japanese systems, appli cation of the two nations' status‐of‐forces agreement to Okinawa, which will require the Japanese Government's consent for troop operations by United States forces from the islands, conversion from the dollar to the yen cur rency, and settlement of the problems of United States funded assets on the islands.

243-> Letters to the Editor of The Times
To the Editor: It is long past the time to register dismay, anger, utter dis enchantment and moral revul sion toward the conscious choice of violent techniques and violence itself by extremists on college campuses. [Editorial Aug. 25.] The bombing at the Univer sity of Wisconsin is the most recent manifestation — at least as this letter is being written— of a morality of duplicity, the obscenity of self‐righteousness, and the growing commitment to “overkill” regardless of the ends or consequences. Too many — and one is too many—are un concerned that if buildings are blown up people will be killed. Issues to the side, there can be no campus issue of such crit ical importance that the death of any person can be justified as the result of dramatizing that issue. The death of any person, male or female, faculty or stu dent, white, brown or black, revolutionary or reactionary, administrator or custodian—to say nothing of the death of a thirty‐year‐old graduate stu dent, who happened to be in building, who happened to be a husband and the father of, three children. Three children must now live without a father because some one or some group did not ap prove of a certain type of re search. This is barbarism of the highest order. This spring many shared in the expression of horror and grief of students for the deaths of students at the hands of the “establishment.” Any rationali zations that this death is dif ferent or justifiable, accidental, unplanned, ignorance, or any thing else just will not do. Vio lence is violence, and death is death. To the Editor: New York is among the dirt iest cities in the Western Hemi sphere. However, since all we ever get from the Mayor and Sanitationmen's Union is dou bletalk, here are two concrete suggestions which would help immeasurably in cleaning up the mess: Employ able‐bodied welfare recipients as cleaners. Arm them with brooms and shovels and put them to honest work. Close the subways down for an hour each night, and then clean the stations thoroughly. Both these solutions work in other countries. Unlike Mayor Lindsay, I would feel no pain to see welfare workers clean ing the streets. It is a highly pernicious idea that some work is degrading and others not. All work is honorable and has its place. We can't all be presi dent of General Motors. To the Editor: I must reply to your rather remarkable Aug. 21 editorial in which you oppose did Con Ed project at Storm King but sup port the one at Astoria. The editorial is not remarkable for your continued opposition to Storm King, which may not be the best way to solve New York City's electrical needs, but for reaffirming your sup port of Astoria, which is cer tainly the worst way. I shall not develop again the arguments against Astoria, but simply wish to make two points: You are justifiably concerned about the poksible environ mental impact of Storm King on the fish life of the Hudson River, but show no under standing of the certain adverse health impact of Astoria on the human life of this city. You correctly discuss the fact that Storm King will re quire three kilowatts of pump ing power to produce two kilowatts of stored power and that using fossil fuel plants to generate the pumping power will result in additional air pollution. Since it now seems likely that Storm King will one day be built, it is doubly vital that Astoria not be built. This is to insure that only nuclear plants be used for the base load pumping power for Storm King. If Astoria is built, it will be used to generate power not merely for reserve capacity, but in off‐hours for Storm King, thereby further increas ing the pollution burden on the tortured citizens of this city. Thus, you should support ac celerated construction of the nuclear plants which the com munities have already approved for Verplanck and David's Island for 1980, and demand that the Astoria site be re served until a pollution‐free plant can be built. To the Editor: Charles A. Lindbergh, with such great potential for leader ship, tragically concerns him self with winning or losing wars, but not with ending wars. He thereby identifies himself with the obsolete minds of the past. To the Editor: I read with interest Tom Wicker's Aug. 9 column on Adam Walinsky, Democratic candidate for New York State Attorney General, its observa tions respecting “unenforced laws,” and references to Mr. Walinsky's campaigning to re establish “a rule of law.” I read with like interest, but considerable alarm, Mr. Walin sky's statements concerning flag desecration laws, as re ported in The Times of Aug. 15, in which Mr. Walinsky is quoted as saying that he would take a dim view of enforcing such laws if he is elected in Novem ber, and that he “would have a very low regard for enforcing them.” Whatever one's views on the wisdom of flag desecration laws, as to which Mr. Walinsky is entitled to his own opinions, they are not relevant here. What is relevant is Mr. Walinsky's notion that if elected State Attorney General, he would be entitled to pick and choose between those laws he wants to enforce and those he has “a very low regard for enforcing.” It is the duty of the Attorney General to enforce all laws which he has jurisdiction to enforce — a jurisdiction about which both Mr. Walinsky and Mr. Wicker seem, to have an inaccurate understanding—and he has no right to substitute his personal tastes for the obligations of office. There could be nothing more defeating of the “rule of law” than to elect a law enforcement officer who conceives of his office as a personal privilege to enforce the laws he likes and to disregard those he does not like. To the Editor: I could not let George Char ney's Aug. 12 letter regarding a change of policy toward Cuba go unanswered. In advo cating a “more compassionate” policy toward the Castro Gov ernment and blessing it with recognition is to view the com plexities of the Cuban reality in much too simplistic terms. Mr. Charney claims that it is the turn of the United States to “modify our policy in favor of some mutual understanding.” He was referring to the eco nomic blockade. It should be made clear that Mr. Castro rejected any ties with the hemispheric commu nity last July 15, when he said he was not interested in the Organization of American States after there was some talk re garding Cuba at the O.A.S. an nual meeting. One of the most unbelievable statements which Mr. Charney makes is that “the excommuni cation of Cuba (from the hem ispheric community) is an ag gravating factor that would not be relieved with the defeat or ouster of Premier Castro.” What good could the rest of the Americas derive from more contact with a dictatorial re gime that has no economic as sets to barter and hardly a desirable ideology to sell? In the field of politics, failure leads to replacement. Force alone keeps Castro in power, even after his own concession on July 26 of failure. I be lieve that the Americas can do without such friends as he. Mr. Charney adds that the recent concession of failure by Castro may lead him to reap praise his situation. He hopes that Castro would come to the conclusion that democracy and economic growth are inescap ably related. As a Cuban who Ieft his country because economics and politics were intrinsically tied to one goal—total revolution— I would also hope so. But to understand Castro's philosophy of government one must try to understand his past, his behav ior and his political beliefs. Castro a democrat? Hardly. To be realistic, I concede that the lesser of present evils would be for Cuba to digress from its present trend and move to ward a more humane form of government. But it is not for the United States, as Mr. Charney suggests, to take the first step. Castro hardly deserves the courtesy. To the Editor. Let it be known that the theory of a “volunteer army” will work. It is already working throughout the state of Con necticut in its own amorphous fashion. There is no general, no colonel, no officer at its helm. In fact, it is no military organ ization at all, though its de tractors may choose to call it militant. Rather it is led by people who seek a peaceful path of protest toward those soluble human problems by which we are presently besieged. It is an army that unequivocally be longs to the people, for it was recently created by and of the people, and has dedicated itself to deliver Joe Duffey to the United States Senate. To the Editor: In 1964 when the Berkeley campus first began erupting, the catchword was “free speech.” Anyone who suggested the agitators be put off cam pus or the disrupters be dealt with by law was immediately termed anti‐“free speech.” And so, afraid of their daily more riotous students, administrators retreated. Today we see the re sults, nationwide. In 1970 we have a new catchword, “constitutional gov ernment.” It is the special phrase of a certain group of Senators who have adopted many of the tactics and most of the confusion of the original Berkeley leaders. Senator Hatfield is especially fond of posing all his attacks on Presidential policies as defenses of “constitutional government.” The “mom‐and apple‐pie”‐ good feelings such a phrase evokes in listeners (or readers) helps them to over look the confusion of Senator Hatfield's arguments. For in stance, his suggestion that President Nixon may now be looking for a “military solution” in Vietnam, when in actuality the President is systematically reducing military forces there. Senator Fulbright is also experimenting with the 1970 catchword. But he remains partial to the old‐fashioned term “McCarthyism” as his rallying cry. After all, it does evoke memories of years when the Senator was considered scholar and internationalist, rather than a dove and a “fuddy‐duddy.”

244-> Pope Prays That the Nigerians Won't Massacre Biafran Rebels
ROME, Jan. 11—Pope Paul VI termed reports from the Nige rian civil war “very alarming” today and prayed that there would be no slaughter of Bi afrans by Nigerians. In his regular Sunday noon benediction to crowds in the piazza in front of St. Peter's Basilica, the Pontiff said: “The war seems to be reach ing its conclusion, with the ter ror of possible reprisals and massacres against defenseless people worn out by depriva tions, by hunger and by the loss of all they possess. The news this morning is very alarming.” The Pope spoke in an emotion laden voice of his own unsuc cessful attempts to negotiate an end to the conflict and of his efforts to send help to the needy on both sides. He then said: “Today weapons decide. God will that this at least be followed by the end of the war and by the return of normality and harmony.” “But one fear torments pub lic opinion,” the Pontiff added, “the fear that the victory of arms may carry with it the kill ing of numberless people. There are those who actually fear a kind of genocide. We wish to exclude such a horrendous hy pothesis for the honor of the African people and of their leaders who have themselves excluded it with many explicit assurances.” Pope Paul has tried to make world peace the dominant concern of his pontificate. During a two‐day trip to Uganda last August he met twice with rep resentatives of both Nigeria and Biafra in an unusual, but futile bid to start them on the path to a negotiated reconciliation.

245-> Angelo A. Simonetti Is Dead; A Tammany Leader 30 Years
Angelo A. Simonetti, a Democratic district leader in Manhattan for about 30 years and a senior administrator of lithe Board of Elections, died yesterday after a short illness at Harkness Pavilion, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He was in his early seventies and lived at 765 Riverside Drive. Mr. Simonetti, whose district leadership embraced the area between 153d and 175th Streets, joined the Board of Elections as chief clerk for Manhattan in 1954 and be came a senior administrator 10 years later. In 1951, when he was secre tary to former Mayor Robert F. Wagner, then Manhattan Borough President, Mr. Simo netti was accused of being as sociated with the racketeer, Frank Costello. But Mr. Wagner said he was satisfied that Mr. Simonetti had no connection with Costello, and Mr. Simonetti was cleared by a lawyer as signed to investigate the charge. According to Democratic sources, he served as district leader for a continuous period longer than that served by any other Tammany leader. An as sociate, Democratic Assemblyman Steve Gottlieb, said that Mr. Simonetti “was the last of an era.” Survivors include his widow, Dora; a stepson, Frank Dunn; and a brother, Joseph. A funeral mass will be of fered Saturday at 10 A.M. in St. Rose of Lima Church, 510 West 165th Street.

247-> F‐111's to Stay Grounded Until Intensive New Safety Tests Are Passed
The. Air Force has decided to keep its F‐111's grounded three tO six months more so the planes can be put‐through the most intensive safety tests ever required. Sources close to the long‐troubled program said that, starting in late June. individual Wanes will be tebtatively released for flight if as expected; they meet the rigors of the tests. These will hiclude torture tests in deep‐freeze hangars and painstaking inspection of critical pa‐rts with ultrasonic and other devices. In the hangars, the planes will be subjected to bending stresses up to the liMits for which they were designe.—7.33 times the force of gravity. The tests were recommended by Air Force science advisers after weeks of inquiry into a man ufacturing flaw that cauied a crash near LaS Vegas, New on Dec. 22 The crash in which the two pilots were killed, resulted in the imme diate grounding for the fleet of 1‐232 swing‐wiriged planes. Seven F‐111 research planes were put hack on flying status Feb. 12 with permissible nia nuevers Severely limited to further delar in the lagging flight‐test program. But the grounding of the bulk of the fleet, which will vary from total of six months to perhps a year, will have been the longest for any plane ever pro duced by this nation's militar forces. Despite all the F‐111's trot bles, the Air Force still is ver optimistic about the plane, cor tending that there is no othe plane that comes near it in per forming attack missions deep in enemy territory. The Air Force hopes that it ultra‐conservative test proce dures will help restore public confidence in the plane an convince the Nixon Administra tion not to halt production. An important side effect the decision to extend th grounding was the new threa it raised to Australian accept ance of 24 F‐111's that hay been ordered. Australia Rankled The repeated delays in de livery have long been a rank ling political issue in Canberra. Until recently, the Aus tralians had been confidentll assured by the manufacturer the General Dynamics Corpora tion, that they would finally get their planes by early spring Last night, amid growing in dications that new delays were in the offing, Australia's De fense Minister, Malcolm Fraser, told Parliament that the Gov ernment would urgently review its commitment to go through with the purchase. The Cabinet was reported ready to examine whether Aus tralia should seek an arrange ment under which the $200 million already paid for the F‐111's would be credited toward purchase of an alterna tive aircraft. In describing the rigorous new tests the grounded planes must pass, informants said ver bal approval was given two weeks ago to start building the small test hangars and making other preparations. The planes will be cooled to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit because metal is more brittle when cold and therefore more likely to display defects. The bending stresses will be im posed by hydraulic jacks. Apparently, only two signifi cant matters remained to be worked out before the final seal was put on the project, which is expected to cost about $20 million. One was the precise timetable for the tests. The other was a decision on how best to take advantage of the extended grounding to incorpo rate improvements that had been planned for later. In this connection, officials were very hopeful of being able to incorporate dollar‐sav ing and life‐extending improve ments in the wing box. This is the critical rectangular section that runs across the belly of the plane and has pivots at either end to which th, emov able wings are attached. Release of each plane for flight, as it passes the contem plated tests, will not constitute, a final seal of approval. It will be six months’ maximum, in formants said, and then a sec ond round of inspections is expected to be made by early fall to give the. plane more permanent clearance. The F‐111 has been a focus of political and technological dispute since the fall of 1962 when Robert S. McNamara, then Secretary of Defense, overruled top military advisers and awarded the multibillion‐dollar F‐111 production contract to General Dynamics instead of the Boeing Company. Since then, the plane has en countered a run of technical troubles — grossly excessive weight, engine stalls, cracks in key structures — and soaring costs. Their impact has been Accentuated by charges that the McNamara decision was dic tated by Democratic politics. Impact of Crash Most of the current commo tion traces back to the crash on Dec. 22, which was caused by the collapse of the left wing. It was the 15th crash in the F‐111 program, not an unusual figure as development programs go, but with added public im pact because of the political controversy. The collapse of the wing on Dec. 22 was fairly quickly trarfed not to a defect in design but to a flaw in a critical piece of structure—a flaw that in spection procedures should have caught. The part was the so called “wing pivot fitting.” It is attached, by a huge ver tical pin, to the wing box run ning across the plane's belly. The main part of the movable wing is welded to the more solid surface of the fitting. The problem now facing the Air Force is to make sure that there are no similar defects in wing pivots of its other F‐111's or in other forged parts that are equally critical. Metallurgy experts and Air Force officials have identified about 15 critical parts. They have also worked out improved ultrasonic and other inspection techniques that they believe cannot repeat the mistake of overlooking a flaw. But they have perfecter these new techniques, so far only for about half the It critical parts. They are con fident they can cover the rest of the parts by fall. It is for that reason primarily that individual planes will be put through the maximum stress bending in refrigerated hangars. Survival of such tests will give assurance that there is no crack large enough so that the plane cannot fly safely at 80 per cent of its performance limits until the final rounds of subsequent inspections are carried out. To prepare each plane for the bending test, mechanics will remove engines, rudder and horizontal stabilizer. They will also remove movable wing sec tions for prior inspection, but they will be replaced for the actual stress test. Each plane will take four days to go through this cycle, with a maximum of 24 hours spent in the 40 degree‐below zero (Fahrenheit) test chamber. The ultrasonic and other flaw detection inspections’ will con sume much more of the 45‐to 65 days that it will take each plane to go, through all the test procedures.

248-> AMEX PRICES RISE AS TRADING GAINS
Prices on the American Stock Exchange moved steadily higher after a slight setback in the first hour of trading and finished near their best levels of the day on moderate trading. Brokers attributed the up swing to the growing convic tion by many investors that a general reduction in the bank prime rate was in the offing. Earlier in the week a large Philadelphia bank cut the prime rate from 8 to 7½ per cent. Yesterday, two smaller banks followed suit. At the final bell, the ex change's price index was ahead 0.12 at 21.55. At 10:30 A.M. the indicator was off 0.01. Turnover on the exchange expanded to 3,404,345 shares Market Summary Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1970 (Volume, 3,404,345 shares) ??? from 2,855,840 shares the day before. Eleven blocks of 10, 000 shares or more changed hands yesterday against five blocks on Tuesday. Nine of the 10 most actively traded stocks rose in price yes terday while only one declined. The volume leader was Asa mera Oil which tacked on ¾ to 16⅜ on 94,900 shares. The exchange said it has suspended trading in RIC In ternational since the company has filed a petition for re organization under Chapter X of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A trading halt in the issue has been in effect since shortly before the close of trading on Sept. 10 when the issue sold at 3⅞. In its Chapter X petition filed in Federal District Court in Dallas, the company said that “certain of its subsidiaries experienced severe operating losses which have resulted in the company's cash position being depleted to the point where it cannot sustain cur rent operations.” The company asked the court to appoint a trustee or trustees and authorize them to direct and operate the busi ness and manage the property of the company. The over‐the‐counter market finished higher on stepped‐up buying in the afternoon in light trading.

249-> Air Canada's New Chief Winds Up Big First Year
MONTREAL, Jan. 17—Yves Pratte, the chairman of Air Canada, has been running the airline for only a year, but he has gotten off to a fast start by purchasing aircraft and equipment worth about a bil lion dollars, by challenging the airline industry to simplify its complex fare structure and by expanding routes. Although all airlines have their problems with funds, cus tomers and competition, Air Canada faces some added ones. As a national airline that is publicly owned, it must com plete with private enterprise— Canadian Pacific Airlines in Canada and commercial airlines of the United States in North America—while still being re sponsible to the Canadian tax payer. Mr. Pratte, who is 46 years old, accepted the Federal Gov ernment's invitation in Decem ber, 1968, to become chairman of Air Canada at a challenging time. With the arrival of the jumbo jet, the airline industry has been experiencing an eco nomic revolution. Mr. Pratte came to his new job with little experience other than an impressive background in the legal profession; an abil ity to work in the sensitive area of English‐French relations in Canada—he was born in Que bec City—and the hours spent as a passenger on Air Canada flights. Mr. Pratte made it clear last week where Air Canada was heading, and how he hoped to lead in a working partnership with John Baldwin, president of the airline: “Although profit for the sake of profit is not our goal,” he said in a major policy address to the Canadian Club, in Mon treal, “and can never be the goal of a Crown [Government] corporation, the industry as a whole is experiencing such soaring costs for labor, materi als and services that yields are tumbling almost past the point of no return. One United States executive, commenting on 1969 fare increases authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Board, has noted that ‘the February increase was wiped out in early June; benefits of the October boost won't survive through January, 1970.’ “If Air Canada is to avoid a similar fate, it has to achieve economies of scale through substantial growth. Otherwise, for one thing, we will not be able to finance the billion dol lars of new equipment and ground facilities over the next decade — equipment like the Boeing 747 and the L‐1011 Tri Star. “Growth is required to im prove our economic viability, reduce risk and attract neces sary financing at reasonable terms. We know only that strong, large companies can most readily sustain the rapid technological advances inherent in the air transportation indus try, including attracting and re taining the specialized labor force required by such tech nological innovations,” Basically, here is how Mr. Pratte sees Air Canada's fu ture: ¶Extension of routes to Southern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Africa and South America. ¶New methods of financing —including the sale of shares to the public—the expansion program of one billion dollars earmarked for the jumbo jets, the Concorde and Boeing super sonic aircraft, and ground fa cilities. ¶Branching into hotel opera tions, but not necessarily as owners, in Europe and the Ca ribbean. ¶Re‐allocation of routes ac cording to an expected policy change by the Canadian Gov ernment for Air Canada and its main domestic competitor, Ca nadian Pacific Airlines. Possibly the most difficult of Mr. Pratte's challenges to make Air Canada economically work able — by seeking new routes and more passengers with an expanded fleet of aircraft — is the problem of the air fare structure. The International Air Trans port Association will meet next September in Honolulu, to dis cuss again the various obstacles to an agreement on air fares for international flights. Mr. Pratte's newcomer status in the airline business did not prevent him from stepping in to lead the fight for changes. “The whole North Atlantic air structure needs to be com pletely revised,” he said. “If we can't come up with something that the man in the street can understand, then we can't do our job,” he asserted. Summing up his first 12 months as Air Canada chair man recently, Mr. Pratte said: “It's been rough. Rough and in teresting.”

251-> Aerial Sensor Is Shown Here For Spotting Water Pollution
A helicopter with electronic sensing gear criss‐crossed the waters of the metropolitan area yesterday, trying to track down some of the thousands of potential water polluters. Surveillance for pollution is difficult when inspectors rely only on visual sighting from boats or, occasionally, from airplanes. The helicopter scanning sys tem uses an infrared sensor that reportedly can determine temperature differences as small as 1 /10th of a degree in waters. Aside from obvious thermal pollution, such slight differences in temperature could point to polluting fluids going into a river; the fluids would be of a different temperature because they had been passing through a different area, such as a factory or sewer. The measurements from the infrared sensor, mounted below the helicopter's cabin, are translated into a picture of light and dark shading on a tele vision screen in the cabin. The pattern shows the shoreline clearly, and where there is possible pollution, telltale light area appears in the surrounding darker water. The light area indicates a higher temperature. Without further interpreta tion, the light area would indicate an area where thermal pollution was taking place that is one where industrial discharges might be warming a body of water to the point where plant and animal life I might be endangered. An analysis of the shading could indicate the chemical composition in the suspected area, to determine if a danger ous pollutant was entering the waterway. Infrared sensing is not a new technique. It has been used for photographic mapping and re search studies of terrain. But yesterday's demonstration by Remote Environmental Sensing Systems, Inc., of Spring Valley, N. Y., pointed to the system's use as an antipollution enforce ment device. An operator watches the screen for possible violations, without having to wait for film to be developed. What the operator sees on the screen can be recorded on videotape for future evidence against a polluter. The detection setup demon strated yesterday rents for minimum of $500 an hour, ac cording to David Freda, presi dent of Remote Environmental Sensing Systems. But he said an area the size of New York Harbor, for example; could be covered in an hour, with a heli copter flying at an average height of 500 feet and checking a channel of water 1,000 feet wide. Maurice M. Feldman, the city's Commissioner of Water Resofirces, sees the sensing de vice as especially valuable in providing information on the amount of pollution released, because a shading pattern re corded on videotape would show just how far the pollution had spread. Mr. Feldman said infrared sensing would be most effective after 1975, when the city's own sewage‐treatment plants are in operation. Right now, he said, the city releases so much raw sewage into the harbor it masks many industrial sources of pol lution. One problem that would have to be resolved, he said, is whether the courts would ac cept videotape as evidence.

255-> Pompidou: III—Europe
PARIS—The most significant devel opment in French foreign policy since Georges Pompidou succeeded Charles de Gaulle at the helm is a genuine desire to bring Britain into the Euro pean Common Market and an absolute conviction that this will occur. De Gaulle had twice vetoed the British application although, at the end of his presidency, there were indications he was gradually changing his mind. But Pompidou is now quite unequivocal and resolute on this dssue. He acknowledges that opinion polls still indicate perhaps two‐thirds of England's voters oppose the move but he believes this mood will change. Apparently he feels the English are more governable than the French and will accept ‘the proclaimed insistence of their political leaders that Britain must join “Europe.” Moreover, he is said to believe British analysts still maximize the agricultural adjustment needed and minimize industrial bene fits that will accrue. This shift from doubts—if not active hostility—on British admission to all out support represents an immensely important new factor in Western diplomacy. The French President him self believes such a Common Market enlargement will help wind up prob ferns now existing between the United States and Europe. The positive policy on expanding the market is not in any way linked to Anglo‐French nuclear‐sharing, subject often bruited during the past decade and at least once dis cussed by de Gaulle and former Prime Minister Macmillan. Theoretically, this idea Is still considered possible by Paris and accept able both for “Europe” and the North Atlantic Alliance, of which (as distinct from the NATO organization) France continues a member. But it is thought here that London is not free to take part because of binding obligations to the United States in exchange for American atomic aid. Anyway, France is not requesting any such move to share. Indeed the Pompidou Administration is just as determined as the de Gaulle Administration to build up the French nuclear force although it does reckon that long‐run future ,trends will be toward Anglo‐French sharing within a “European” framework. The French sense a common destiny with the British. They were both quite recently world powers. They have begun to develop more parallel poli cies as, for example, the French deci sion to cease selling light tanks and helicopters to South Africa because these can be used against guerrilla rebels, but to continue selling heavy weapons just as Britain prepares to do. Likewise the French are pushing the two‐nation “Concorde” supersonic jet regardless of economic difficulties. Pompidou apparently feels it would be a national defeat were the scheme to be abandoned. The Russians are well hoped the United States, which is bearish on supersOnic flights, will not create technical difficulties on the financially crucial trans‐Atlantic run. In Pompidou's view, there has been a shrinkage in France's world preten sions, but a concentration on two key areas, Europe and the Mediterranean Africa region. Britain is obviously involved in both. France has abandoned the vague idea that occasionally cropped up in former days—some sort of Mediterra nean pact. It wants bilateral agree ments on many issues with Mediter ranean lands but no longer has the slightest interest in fostering alliance. In judging Pompidou's foreign pol icy one might say that in a sense it has come geographically closer home to France, concerning itself less with distant parts (like Quebec) and there fore assuming more intensity in the two areas of its greatest concern. It clearly hopes that a larger Com mon Market (including Britain and also Ireland, Denmark and Norway) will strengthen the vitality of this area, possibly in .time to play more of a role in the European security con ference Moscow continues to foster, but which the West regards skepti cally until a Berlin accord is arranged. The new view from the Elysde plainly hopes the Soviet‐American arms race will be stabilized, but it doesn't bet on it 100 per cent. There fore, in the interim, it believes that a stronger, economically and politi cally healthier Europe can be devel oped so that, whatever the super powers agree or disagree on, this Europe can play a more determining role—and France in it.

256-> RATES ARE LOWER IN CREDIT MARKET
?? less than the 8.22 per cent provided by a smaller Delmarva Power and Light Company sale on Monday, also an Aa‐rated credit. The same group will also market $50‐million of six year Detroit Edison bonds as 7's at 100.45 to yield 6.90 per cent. A Smith, Barney syndicate will sell $50‐million of Aaa rated Lykes Brothers Steam ship Company bonds this morn ing as 8.30's at 100 and Paine, Webber syndicate is to sell $26‐million of General Tel ephone Company of Illinois A rated bonds as 8½'s at 100.25 to yield 8.48 per cent. The Lykes securities are guaranteed by the United States Govern ment. In winning the A‐rated Maine Yankee issue yesterday, a Mer rill Lynch team bid 100.101 for a 9.10 per cent coupon and re offered it at 101.041 to yield 9 per cent to maturity in 2002. In the only other competitive sale, the Ohio Power Company auctioned $40‐million of six year bonds to a First Boston‐led group, which reported only “tag ends” remaining late in the day. The company had previously carried an Aa credit rating, but it was cut to A in the Nov. 23 issue of Moody's Bond Survey. Standard & Poor's retained its AA rating. The Ohio Power bonds were 7¼'s priced at 101.207 to yield 7.00 per cent. First Boston bid 100.60. In negotiated offerings, the following were successfully marketed: ¶Panhanadle Eastern Pipe Line Company, $40‐million of A‐rated 20‐year 8⅝ per cent debentures priced at 99.75 to yield 8.65 per cent, through Kidder, Peabody‐Merrill Lynch. ¶Rockwell Manufacturing Company, $35‐million of A rated 25‐year 8½ per cent de bentures at 100 through Kuhn, Loeb. This sale was expected to be officially cleared by the Securities and Exchange Com mission this morning following a technical delay. ¶Pullman Transport Leasing Company, $23.2 ‐ million of A‐rated equipment trust certifi cates through First Boston. A total of $20‐million of 15‐year certificates were 8¾'s at 100, while $3.2‐million of serial cer tificates were priced to yield from 7 per cent in 1971 to 7.50 per cent in 1974. ¶Mercantile Stores Com pany, Inc., $25‐million of A‐rated, 25‐year 8.70 per cent debentures at 100 through White, Weld. ¶City Investing Company, $40‐million of 7½ per cent, 20 year debentures convertible into the company's common at $16.50 through Lehman Brothers. The tax‐exempt sector put in a busy day, too, with under writers bidding aggressively enough on two new issues to push down yields perhaps as much as 20 basis points com pared with last week's levels. Sales, however, were slow. Michigan awarded $60‐million of Aa‐rated bonds to a Chase Manhattan‐Bankers Trust‐First Boston group that reoffered them to return from 3.20 per cent in 1975 to 4.40 per cent in 1995. An unsold balance of $41.9‐million remained. “We're not really concerned about this one,” an under writer said. “The new levels just have to be digested.” Michigan's interest cost was 4.43 per cent. Newton, Mass., also rated Aa, sold its $15‐million of school bonds to a Bankers Trust group that priced them to yield from 2.90 per cent in 1972 to 3.90 per cent in 1981. The balance was $7.47‐million. Blyth Co. set the terms yesterday on the week's larg est municipal offering—$151 million by the Nebraska Public Power District, whose electric bonds are rated A and whose nuclear bonds are rated Aa by Moody's. A total of $100.4‐million of term bonds due in 2004 will carry a 6.60 per cent coupon and a price of 100. The rate on $50.6‐million of serial bonds is from 3.40 per cent in 1973 to 6.40 per cent in 1993. Elsewhere among taxable se curities, last week's key $150 million South Central Bell Tele phone offering was largely cleaned up late Monday and yesterday. This Aaa‐rated offering, yielding 8.16 per cent, had been only about two‐thirds placed before the cut in the discount rate. Similarly, a $30‐million Del marva Power and Light Com pany sale on Monday, also selling slowly, was reduced, yesterday to “tag ends.” The Federal Home Loan Banks put a 6½ per cent rate on a $350‐million of four‐year 11‐month bonds it will offer today.

257-> 36‐YEAR‐OLD STAR VANQUISHES ROCHE
WIMBLEDON, England, June 30—Ken Rosewall beat Tony Roche in four enthralling sets today, John Newcombe came out of the abyss to lick Roy Emerson in five and, if anything is sure in tennis, Rosewall will face Roger Taylor and Newcombe will meet Andres Gimeno in the Wimbledon tennis semifinals on Thursday. Taylor was leading Clark Graebner, 6‐3, 11‐9, 8‐7, and Gimeno was ahead of Bob (Nails) Carmichael, 6‐1, 6‐2, 1‐2, when a cold misting rain and bad light stopped play al the All‐England club. They resume tomorrow. The champagne of Rosewall's play on the center court was intoxicating. The little man, 36 years old on his last birthday, gave a performance worthy of those heady years when he swept the French and Australian championships at 18 and went on to rule the world from the end of the fifties to the mid‐Sixties. He was not supposed to beat Roche. Two years ago the sturdy left‐hander took Ken here in straight sets, and last year Bob Lutz knocked him out. It looked like the end of the trail for the frail figure incongruously called Muscles. At 3‐all in the first set, Ken unaccountably got the shakes, double‐faulting three times, and two games later Roche had set point. Rosewall staved it off and then played a ninth game that will be remembered. On successive points he hit forehand pass, forced Tony to volley long, rolled a forehand across court and then drilled an acutely angled backhand across court again for the break back. It was pure elixir. Na man could have played a game better. Newcombe Fights Back Roche can do almost anything with a tennis ball, but the shafts of lighting that streaked by him left him stranded. The scores were 10‐8, 6‐1, 4‐6, 6‐2 to Hosannahs. Across the way, in the swirling wind and dust on the No. 1 court, was a titanic struggle between Newcombe and Emerson. It was all hard, fierce striking, the bangs of the big serves and the crunch of smashes. Back and forth the issue waved, with Emerson leading two sets to one. The key to the match hung on the first game in the fourth set. Seven times it went to deuce, five times Emmo had advantage. In between, his shorts slipped and had to be pinned up by a line judge. It relieved the tension, but Newcombe held service to win the game and then went on to victory in a furious fifth set, 6‐1, 5‐7, 3‐6, 6‐2, 11‐9. Taylor's incredible triumph over Rod Laver brought a mob to the gates of the center court for his match with Graebner. The press, TV and radio had blazoned his name around the land. And Roger was ready. In playing on the circuit he had changed his service and worked vast improvement in his suspect backhand. Roger found that he could block the American's thundering service and dink it back. He found that Graebner's touch on the volley was erratic and mostly short, giving him time to spin the ball into open territory across court. With the crowd's idolatry spurring him on, Roger threatend to run away with it as Graebner seemed mesmerized by his swinging southpaw service. Taylor was serving for the match at 5‐3, with the crowd on its feet. Bravely the New Yorker took the gathe as Roger volleyed into the alley. They were at 8‐7, Taylor ahead and Clark to serve, when the rains came. The question that hung over the $100,000 tournament tonight was whether Mrs. Margaret Court could play her semifinal with Rosie Casals tomorrow. She pulled two ligaments in her left ankle while playing Helga Niessen yesterday and was forced to scratch from the doubles and mixed doubles. Wives Watch Husbands, Not Ball

258-> AMEX PRICES RISE AS VOLUME SLIPS
Peace possibilities, both in Vietnam and in the Middle East, apparently fueled a rise on the American Stock Exchange yes terday. The price increases were not broadly dramatic but the index moved up to close at 20.30, up 0.08. Turnover, however, was a lit tie disappointing in that it dropped to 2,184,245 shares, down from 2,346,960. Another factor behind some recent price strength is a con tinuing flow of some good earn ings reports. Teleprompter jumped 3 points to end at 67 on news of second‐quarter earnings of 41 cent: a share, up from 14 cents it the same year‐ago period.

Operating revenue rose by 7 per cent to about $206.2‐million from $192.4‐million a year earlier.

260-> NIXON APPOINTS BRUCE AS LEADER AT PEACE TALKS
LOS ANGELES, July 1—President Nixon announced tonight the appointment of David K. E. Bruce to head the United States delegation at the Paris talks on Peace in Vietnam. Excerpts from the interview are printed on Page 10. Mr. Nixon made the announcement here during an unusual one‐hour “conversation” with three television network commentators. He promised Mr. Bruce “great flexibility” in the conduct of the negotiations and expressed the hope that “this move on our part will be reciprocated by a similar move on the part of the North Vietnamese in attempting to find a peaceful solution to the war in Vietnam.” [North Vietnam charged, in response to President Nixon's written report of Tuesday that the United States despite the withdrawal of ground troops from Cambodia, was prolonging the war in Southeast Asia by aiding anti‐Communist forces, The Associated Press reported from Hong Kong. Page 10.] Other Major Points Among other major points that emerged from tonight's discussion were these: ¶The President said he regarded the crisis in the Middle East as a grave threat, greater in magnitude to that of Vietnam. ¶Mr. Nixon refused to say categorically that he would not reintroduce American troops to Cambodia, but emphasized: “We do not plan on it.” ¶He said he recognized the discontent in the United States caused by his policies in Indochina but he asserted that domestic dissent would not prevent him from acting decisively again to protect American lives and the withdrawal program if circumstances required it. ¶He said that he would consult with Congress on foreign policy and military matters whenever possible, but—invoking the memory of President Kennedy's swift response in the Cuban missile crisis—he defended the right of all Presidents to act quickly without prior consultation. Mr. Nixon indicated that the United States would return to hte peace table in a flexible frame of mind but would not relinquish two minimum conditions. It would not abandon the right of the South Vietnamese “to determine their own future,” and it would not agree, to impose a coalition government on the South Vietnamese, although it would accept such a government as a natural result of neaotiations. Moreover the tone of many of the President's answers tonight regarding future American involvement in Indochina indicated very clearly that he was prepared to match Hanoi in protracted struggle in Vietnam. He indicated a willingness to maintain substantial forces in Indochina until the enemy is willing to accept a “just peace” that would neither “humiliate” the United States nor encouragg the Communists to embark ob “expansionist policies in other areas” of Southeast Asia. He embraced more explicitly than ever before the so‐called “domino theory,” which holds that a Communist victory in South Vietnam would encourage the enemy to undertake wars of liberation elsewhere. “If the United States after all of this effort if we were to withdraw immediately, as many Americans would want us to do, it would be very easy for me to do it and simply blame it on the previous administration,” the President said. “But if we were to do that I would probably survive through my term but it would have, in my view, a catastrophic effect on this country in the cause of peace in the years ahead. “Now, I know there are those who will say, ‘well the domino theory is obsolete. They haven't talked to the dominoes. They should talk to the Thais to the Malaysians to Singapore to the Indonesians to the Philippines, to the Japanese, and the rest.” He went on to say that a humiliation in Vietnam would be “immensely discouraging” to 300 million non‐Communist Asians, and “ominously ‐encouraging” to the leaders of Communist China and the Soviet Union. Addressing himself to the Middle East the President said that the crisis there was extremely complicated and went well beyond the Arab‐Israeli struggle. One of the basic problems, he said, arose from the fact that the conflict involved not only the Arabs and Israelis but the two superpowers the Soviet Union and the United States. “I think the Middle East now is terribly dangerous, like the Balkans before World War I,” he said, voicing the fear that the United States and the So viet Union “could be drawr into a confrontation that neither of them wants.” Mr. Nixon said he had not had time to study Soviet proposals reportedly circulating at the United Nations, nor was he asked to expand on the Administration's own peace plans. But he said as he has many times before that the United States had a vital interest in maintaining the “balance of power” in the area. “The diplomacy is terribly difficult,” he asserted, “because Israel's neighbors have to recognize Israel's right to exist. Israel must withdraw to borders that are defensible.” “When we consider all those factors and put into the equation the fact that the Russians seem to have an interest in moving into the Mediterranean it shows you why the subject is so complex and difficult,” he said. “But we are going to continue to work on it and I can assure you that the fact that we are in Vietnam does not mean that the United States is not going to give every bit of its diplomatic and other energies to it.” The “Conversation With the President” represented the President's first use of this format since his inauguration, His questioners were John Chancellor of the National Broadcasting Company, Eric Severeid of the Columbia Broadcasting System, and Howard K. Smith of the American Broadcasting Company. The session took place in the headquarters of station KABC in a Hollywood studio regularly used for the television programs the “Newlywed Game and “Let's Make a Deal.” According to White House officials, no arrangements had been made between the President and the three commentators for the program on the questions to be asked, and or one or two occasions the President seemed to have beer taken by surprise. Mr. Nixon answered the questions rapidly constantly using his hands to make expressive gestures and on one occasion perspiring moderately under the hot studio lights he wiped his upper lip with a handkerchief. Although he occassionally displayed traces of nervousness Mr. Nixon told aides later that he had enjoyed himself and remarked to newsmen as he left the studio: “At my age, I don't have nerves.” Unlike the traditional White House news conference there was considerable give and take and the three commentators tried hard to make the President reconcile his statements when they seemed contradictory. At one point for example Mr. Nixon said that while he embraced the domino theory he was also prepared to accept a Communist government in Saigon if the people of South Vietnam chose such a government through free elections. Mr. Chancellor then asked him how, if “South Vietnam is the first of a row of dominoes which we cannot allow to topple can you say equally at the same time that we will accept the judgment of the people of South Vietnam if they choose a Communist government&” After a few hesitant moments, Mr. Nixon finally explained that what really counted was the method by which the South Vietnamese chose the arrangements under which they wished to live. A Communist government imposed on the South Vietnamese would make other Indochinese nations nervous, he asserted whereas a Communist regime resulting from free elections would not have the same shattering consequences. The new head of the delegation at the Paris peace talks is a 72‐year‐old diplomat who has served as Ambassador to Britain, France and West Germany. He will succeed Henry Cabot Lodge, who resigned last winter. Philip C. Habib has been serving as acting chief of the delegation, and will continue as Mr. Bruce's deputy. The appointment was described as an important overture designed to demonstrate Mr. Nixon's intentions to follow up the invasion of Cambodia with efforts to move the peace talks off dead center. McGovern Asks Equal Time WASHINGTON, July I (UPI) —Senator George S. McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, said tonight that President Nixon was “living in Disneyland” with his Indochina policies and demanded equal time on television to answer the President's defense of them.

261-> BRUNDAGE URGES BAN ON 4 SPORTS
AMSTERDAM, The Nether lands, May 9—Avery Brundage, the president of the Interna tional Olympic Committee, urged the international sports federations today to withdraw Alpine skiing, ice hockey, soc cer and basketball from the Olympic Games. Brundage delivered a 5,000‐ word speech to the assembled federation chiefs, reminding his audience that he has been associated with amateur sports for the last 60 years. He opened his address with the words: “Before we begin our delibera tions here today, ladies and gentlemen, it is my painful duty to inform you that the Olympic Games are in trouble, serious trouble.” After laving stated his ar gument as to why he believed the four sports should he with drawn from the Games, he said, “ice hockey, football or basket ball, or Alpine skiing should be fully withdrawn from the Games. We'll be sorry to have them go but they are victims of the materialistic times in which we live. The public will no longer support hypocrisy. Don't forget that tennis, a popular sport all over the world, is no longer on the Olympic pro gram.” Brundage also was critical of boxing and figure skating in sofar that mast medal winners in those sports immediately turned professional after suc cessful showings at the Games. Alpine skiing, however, was under the strongest attack by Brundage, who first showed his displeasure with the sport dur ing the 1968 Olympic Games at Grenoble, Frahce. He de manded then that brand names be blanked out in all victory ceremony photographs. Brundage charged the Inter national Ski Federation was responsible for the current state of affairs through which top men can earn as much as $50,000 annually from their sport and still be considered amateurs. He cited the case of the World Cup holder, Karl Schranz of Austria, as being “a living advertisement” for the ski man‐, ufacturers after his photograph appeared on the official Aus trian information bulletin showing him in ski uniform and with marked skis. Brundage said, “If the games are killed, it is not Avery Brundage but the president of F.I.S. [Marc Holder of Switzer land] and his associates who have killed them.” Brundage also pointed out it was not just a question of the amateur code being flaunt ed in explaining why Alpine skiing should be cut from the Games program. He noted that of the 114 medals awarded in the sport in 10 Winter Games held to date, 101 have been won by com petitors from only five of the 126 national Olympic commit tees. “There is no place in the Olympic program for a sport of such limited appeal. This poisonous cancer must be eliminated without further de lay. Alpine skiing does not be long in the Olympic Games,” Brundage said. Concerning team sports such as hockey, soccer and basket ball, Brundage said, “The truth is that in these sports, which have become commercialized, even with the best of good in tentions, it is impossible to as semble an amateur of Olympic caliber. It cannot be done. The public cannot be fooled any longer and we should stop try ing to fool ourselves. Football [soccer] has its World Cup and the Olympic Games gets what is left over.” Brundage made his address to the federations before their meeting with the executive board about problems of mutual interest.

266-> Peking and Moscow See Joint Cause in Indochina
The United States action in Cambodia has touched off a swift Chinese diplomatic offen sive which is radically altering Sino‐Soviet‐American relation ships and may open the way to temporary easing of Sino‐So viet tensions. The Chinese moves were un dertaken at a moment when the Sino‐Soviet conflict had touched a new height of violence. They came in the face of major new Soviet troop movements to the disputed frontier with China. Now, however, as a result of the personal intervention of Chairman Mao Tse‐tung the prin cipal Soviet diplomatic negotia tor, Deputy Foreign Minister V. V. Kuznetsov, has returned to Peking amid rumors that Mos cow and Peking may be willing to lay aside, in part and for the time being, their bitter quarrel. Premier Chou En‐lai moving with remarkable deftness, has managed to seize for China the leadership in the Communist re sponse to the United States ac tion. He has managed to put China at the head of an emerg ing coalition of Indochinese pow ers and may have stalemated the Soviet Union in what might have been a new escalation of the Sino‐Soviet quarrel. In the process the Chinese have delivered a low‐key warn ing to the United States that escalation of the war in Indo china might bring about their intervention; made an offer of “volunteers” to Prince Sihanouk (which he graciously declined); blocked the Russians almost completely out of direct rela tions with any of the Indochina countries; re‐established warmer and closer relations with bristly North Korea; and laid the foun dations for a possible “united front” of China, the Indochina states and North Korea against “U.S. aggression.” The consequences to future United States and future Soviet policy of the Chinese diplomatic blitzkreig may be far‐reaching. The United States is sched uled to meet with Communist Chinese delegates in Warsaw May 20 for a renewal of two‐ power discussions designed to lead to a new basic American Chinese relationship. Diplomats now wonder whether the meet irig will actually be held. They rate its chances for progress as something less than zero. At the same time the specter emerged of increasing difficulties with the Soviet Union, partic ularly in the critical SALT talks under way in Vienna. Pre mier Aleksei Kosygin himself raised the question of confidence in this connection in his Mos cow press conference. The effect of the United States action on the criticial confron tation in the Middle East was still uncertain. One Washington theory was that the President believed a display of “muscle” in Cambodia would deter the So viet Union from stepping up its military support of Egypt. The validity of this hypothesis re mains to be tested. The principal power to suffer in the rapid sequence of events appeared to be the United States. Instead of a diplomatic horizon marked by escalating rhetoric and menacing military moves by the two Communist powers the prospect emerged of s new if shaky “cool” between Moscow and Peking. An ironic touch was the fact that as of early April Russia and China had come to another derailment in their long, harsh disagreement. Mr. Kuznetsov had been ordered to return to Mos cow. New Soviet military units were ordered up to the China frontier. Polemics, suspended since the inception of the Pek ing talks in late October, had begun again. The propaganda war took a major turn April, 22, the 100th anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth, when the Chinese pub lished the most slashing assault they had ever delivered against Moscow — a declaration com paring Party Secretary Leonid Brezhnev to Adolf Hitler, So viet Russia to Nazi Germany “complete with Nazi racist over tones. They charged Russia with contemplating a Nazi blitzkreif against China. Moscow retaliated by spew ing into the airwaves persona vilification of Chairman Mac Tse‐tung, charging him witt complicity in the murder of his first wife, the death of his eldest son, and a wide catalogue of crimes and misdemeanors. But, with the mounting esca lation of the United States ac tion in Cambodia, a simultaneous escalation of the Sino‐Soviet conflict became increasingly em barrassing to both Peking and Moscow. Neither side was pre pared to abandon the deep rooted quarrel but there was ris ing urgency to lay it to one side for a while — if possible. Premier Chou En‐lai went in to action, providing patronage for the Indochina powers con ference, promising support and “volunteers” if necessary. On May Day Chairman Mao Tse tung himself, ignoring Soviet personal attacks, sought out Soviet diplomat, V. G. Gankov sky, and urged that the Sino Sovet talks resume. By week's end the well‐oiled propaganda machinery in Mos cow and Peking was swinging into line. China attacks on Mos cow ceased. Russian propaganda against Peking began to taper off — but did not cease com pletely. Moscow was still stung by China's emergence as the chief protecting power in Indochina and by Peking's obvious effort to shoulder Russia aside in that part of the world. But faced with a Chinese fait accompli and the critical implications of United States action in Cam bodia it seemed that Russia would, for the moment, put aside the China quarrel for the sake of over‐all opposition to the United States. —HARRISON E. SALISBURY

268-> High School Code
The Board of Education's policy statement on the rights and responsibilities of high school students is a much needed, if incomplete, effort to clarify issues that have been neglected for too long here and in school systems throughout the nation.. It deserves a full opportunity to work when classes resume regular session in September. But it would be unrealistic to expect that this measure alone, isolated as it is from any broader educational reforms, will defuse the tense high schools. Particularly commendable is the Board's direct linkage of students’ rights with students’ obligation to refrain from interfering with the education of fellow students. The Board correctly stated that “if dialogue is interrupted or destroyed, then the bonds that hold us together are broken.” That tragic lesson has already been brought home on many college campuses. The rights reaffirmed for students, or newly accorded them, will undoubtedly disturb some school officials who attacked an earlier draft of the Board's statement as too permissive, as they will fail to satisfy some students for not going far enough. In fact, the rights — including revitalized and representative student government, self ‐determination (within limits) of dress, freedom to display political badges and to dis tribute literature on school property— are relatively moderate by today's standards. Philadelphia, for example, is considering a student bill of rights and grievance procedure significantly more liberal than New York's new code. In all respects, the Board has emphasized consulta tion between students and parents and principals and a peaceful approach to enforcement of the code. The question remains whether student leaders were ade quately consulted in preparation of the code—although those who drafted it vigorously assert they were. It would destroy the code before it starts if it were to be received either by students as a license to try anything or by principals as an excuse to suppress any activity that is not precisely spelled out. The first problems may well arise over interpretation such terms as “obscene material,” which is forbidden on school grounds. On such questions as these, clarification is needed, but it can probably come only through experience. A re‐examination of the code's operability will surely he desirable after a year's trial. But it will require the cooperation of all if it is to help create what the Board calls “a new trust” within the high schools.

269-> GIBSON, SWORN IN, CALLS FOR UNITY
NEWARK, July 1—Kenneth A. Gibson, a product of rural Alabama, was inaugurated today as the first black mayor of Newark. He immediately appealed for “unity from all persons interested In the future of the city.” Responding to a roaring crowd of between 5,000 and 6,000, made up mostly of blacks, Mr. Gibson stood at the podium on the steps of City Halt raised a clenched fist and shouted, “Right on!” Then in a 15‐minute inaugural address the Mayor promised that “through hard work and cooperation, we in the city of Newark can build a better life for ourselves and our children.” “I want to restore our city's goad name. I want to make it good place to live, work ant worship,” he declared. His speech was punctuated frequently by applause cheers and. cries of “Right on.” A sprinkling of young people repeatedly raised clenched fists—a symbol of the black‐power movement. Mayor Gibson cautioned his enthusiastic audience that improving Newark would not be accomplished “overnight” and appealed for everyone's “full and continuing cooperation.” Explains Problem The problem, he continued is “partly the question of whether American cities can remain alive as centers for thousands and millions of people who live in them.” “It's also partly the question of Whether men and women of all faiths, races and backgrbunds can find the good that I :sincerely believe exists in every man,” he said. “This will avoid the rending irrational and tragic strife which sometimes divides us and deflects us from our Common goals.” Mr. Gibson, a 38‐year‐old civil engineer, defeated a twotetrin mayor, Hugh J. Addonizio in'a runoff election on June 16. Customarily the outgoing mayor would be present at the inaugural ceremonies for his successor but Mr. Addonizio is on trial in Federal District Court in. Trenton on charges of extortion and income‐tax evasion. When Mayor Gibson was informed at a news conference later, that Mr. Addonizio had said he had not been invited to the inauguration the Mayor said that “it must have been an oversight” and that he would have “preferred” that Mr. Addonizio be present. Black Leaders Attend Those attending the ceremony included the Rev Ralph Abernathy head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the National Urban League and the Rev. Jesse Jackson director of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago. Gov. William T. Cahill was present with some members of his staff. Mayor Gibson formally nominated several members of the city government “cabinet” today, and they were approved later at the first meeting of the new city council. Most of the Mayor's appointees are white. They include John Redden an experienced police officer as Police Director and John P. Caufield who returns as Fire Directer after having been ousted by Mayor Addonizio in January John W. Smith a Prudential Insurance Company vice president, was named Business Administrator for a period of 90 days, and Harry G. McDowell was chosen to remain as Finance Director for the same period. Municipal Judge William H. Walls was named Corporation Counsel. He is the only Negro so far designated to head city department. Elton Hill who, is black, was appointed assistant business administrator. Mayor Gibson also announced the appointment of two Deputy Mayors: S. Joseph Frisina, a white native of Newark who worked for Mr. Gibson during the election campaign and Ramon Aneses, a Puerto Rican who was an unsuccessful council‐at‐large candidate on the Gibson ticket last month.

270-> NASSER DECLARES HIS ‘YES’ IS FIRM
CAIRO, July 24—President Gamal Abdel Nasser said to night that his acceptance of the United States plan for cease‐fire and peace negotia tions “was not qualified, not conditional.” His statement, made before a television and radio audi ence of millions throughout the Arab world, was in effect response to reports in the West describing the Egyptian re sponse as partial or condi tional. The President also declared that Syria and Jordan were still observing the 1967 cease fire and that if Israel took ad vantage of an armistice on the Suez front to attack either of them, the United Arab Repub lic would come to their aid. [In Jerusalem, a member of the Israeli Cabinet charged that Mr. Nasser had actu ally accepted only what co incided with his own policy and had rejected the rest of the American plan. Page 5.] President Nasser's two‐hour broadcast was his second in 24 hours from the dais of the congress of his Arab Socialist Union. He devoted it to an swering scores of written ques tions from delegates, nearly all of them voicing misgivings about his positive position on the American initiative. The President was evidently profoundly conscious of the doubts and criticism. He turned scorn on “opportunists” and “pretended opportunists” and declared: “Those who want to fight should send us their troops and take part in our struggle.” Many of the questions, all submitted this morning, asked whether Israel would not USE the armistice to strengthen her self. The President replied re. peatedly that both sides woulc continue to consolidate their armed forces. He did not, however, refer directly to the defense of the Suez Canal zone. It is reliably reported that the cease‐fire con templated under the Rogers plan includes an assurance against a build‐up there. President Nasser said that he was withholding some ques tions touching on military mat ters for a closed session, which was under way late tonight. The presence of 1,700 delegates, appeared to limit the security of the discussions however. The broadcast was heard in tently by groups of silent listen ers in cafes and open‐fronted shops in Cairo and throughout Che Arab world. For this audi ence, President Nasser repeated the themes he had outlined last night. He made a point of link ing Britain to the United States as unworthy of Arab trust. He repeated that his acceptance of the Rogers plan was a “last chance.“After that, America's interest will be dangerously threatened,” he warned. One diplomat here expressed impatience with suggestions by Western analysts that the di vergences between the United States proposals as contained in the letter written by Secre tary of State William P. Rogers and the versions presented here signified reservations or quali fications. The difference was generally understood here to reflect the difficulty that President Nas zer faced in selling his accept ance to the Arab world. That difficulty was dramatized by the headline this morning in Amman. Jordan, in the news paper of Al Fatah, the leading Palestinian guerrilla group. The headline was one word: “No!” Headlines in the controlled Egpytian press reflected the same concern in reporting last night's speech by the President. The authoritative newspaper Al Ahram said in its main head line: “Struggle With All Our Might on All Fronts.” It men tioned the Rogers plan only in he sixth subsidiary headline. Another newspaper's headline Said: “Force is the Final Word.”

272-> STOKES ASKS RISE IN CLEVELAND TAX
CLEVELAND, Aug. 1—Some Cleveland commuters face the possibility of paying two municipal income taxes if proposals by Mayor Carl B. Stokes are approved. The Mayor has announced that he will ask the City Council to submit to city voters in November proposals that would allow a 5.8‐mill property tax levy to expire, raise the city income tax from 1 per cent to 1.8 per cent and end city‐suburban reciprocity of the income tax. The Council is studying the request. At present, the revenue from the income taxes imposed by Cleveland and its suburbs is shared, with the city where person works receiving 75 per cent and the city or village where a person lives receiving 25 per cent. Commuters thus pay only one tax. The effect of the plan is that Cleveland pays out to its 83 suburbs about $5‐million more each year than it takes in from them. Some people have said that many suburbs may have to tax commuters who work in Cleveland to meet costs if reciprocity is dropped. Officials of the Cuyahoga County Mayors and City Managers Association are opposed to Cleveland's proposals. After a meeting they announced that they might file suit against Cleveland if reciprocity was dropped. Suburban members of the Ohio Legislature have indicated they may submit bills next year that would require reciprocity on any city income tax. Only Cleveland and Toledo, of Ohio's major cities, have reciprocity clauses in their income tax laws, although all the major cities levy income taxes. There is no state income tax, although one has been proposed. Stokes Heads Study Group Mayor Stokes said he was taking the financial step upon the recommendation of a study group he appointed last month. Extra city funds are needed to meet the costs of wage increases granted recently to more than 10,000 city workers. The three steps outlined by the Mayor and the study group would raise $27‐million next year. The cost of the city workers’ raises was estimated at $30million over the two years of the contract. Thus there would be money left over next year. It would be used to hire 500 more policemen, bringing the department to its authorized strength of 2,841 men; to buy new police cars, and to provide “limited amounts” for improvements is health and recreation. The Mayor said he had mixed feelings about reciprocity and knew that many small bedroom communities would be hurt it were dropped. But he noted that several suburbs with large industrial complexes had refused to cooperate with Cleveland since reciprocity began three year ago. Mayor Stokes said he was re, commending letting the 5.8‐mil property tax levy, which raise: $17.4‐million a year, expire be cause he did not believe it taxes that hurt people on fixec incomes.

273-> Letters to the Editor of The Times
To the Editor: The President has revived the domino theory in his TV inter view by citing as evidence the views of Lee Kuan Yew and Tunku Abdul Rahman. In the past both of those leaders stated very grave reservations about the U.S. intervention in Vietnam and publicly urged far stronger emphasis on peaceful negotiation than we have given. While each statesman is strongly anti‐Communist and might dislike having a Com munist government in Saigon, that is a far cry from saying that they believe in the domino theory. Quite the contrary, they are both confident enough of the viability of their own states to believe, that they will continue to thrive regardless of the outcome in Vietnam, un less by some stupidity the U.S. again extends the war “to save more American lives.” What these men probably told Mr. Nixon is that they fear total withdrawal of the U.S. into isolation so that Southeast Asia is forgotten. This appears more likely as a result of pub lic reaction to the over commitment to military solu tions. There is a middle road be tween war and isolation, which I am sure most Malaysians and Singaporeans would prefer. That is an active American commit ment to the welfare and peace ful development of Southeast Asia by such policies as ex panding textile imports and price stabilization. So let us forget that old domino canard as a justification for the war and get on with the more important business of creating and sustaining a South east Asia in which we can all live and develop in peace. JAMES W. GOULD Cotuit, Mass., July 3, 1970 The writer is Professor of Asian Studies at the Claremont Col leges. National Appraisal To the Editor: Regarding the President's statement that we should give more attention to what's right with our country—and there's quite a lot—I should like to re mind him that what's right can not survive if we fail to give full attention to what's wrong. JACOB L. LIEBSON Halcott Center, N. Y. June 25, 1970 Import Quotas Opposed To the Editor: We believe that Congres sional sentiment for import quotas, now reinforced from the White House, may lead this country into a major policy blunder. [Editorial July 5.] To freeze import volume for textiles and other products whose domestic producers may claim to be “endangered” will damage underdeveloped coun tries, may start a new wave of economic warfare among in dustrial countries, and can be expected to intensify inflation ary pressures within the United States. Quotas will reverse the re cent—and desirable—shift from “aid” toward “trade” as a help to development. This shift can not only reduce the burden on aid‐donors among industrial countries, but can also speed the creation of efficient indus trial sectors within develop ing nations. Many underdeveloped coun tries now aim to generate industrial exports. The most successful (e.g., South Korea, Israel, Taiwan) have become ex port‐competitive over a consid erable range of industries. This stress on exports can gener ate sound industrial expansion in underdeveloped countries which the built‐in inefficiency of sheltered industries produc ing for minuscule domestic markets can never do. But if the United St Lacs ap plies quotas to industrial im ports from “low‐wage” coun tries, the most important single market open to underdeveloped countries will be throttled. After World War II, vividly recalling the beggar‐my‐neigh bor policies of the 1930's, the United States led the move to ban the two chief forms of eco nomic warfare: physical quotas on imports and restrictions on foreign exchange to buy im ports. If we now adopt quotas as a major instrument of trade policy, the restraints imposed in these areas by GATT [Gen eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] and the International Monetary Fund may soon col lapse. Retaliatory actions are to be expected, not only from Japan but from many other na tions. To fight against inflation, the openness of the United States to imports makes two contribu tions. First, the threat of im port competition is sobering to producers who think of rais ing prices, and thus abates the “push” element in inflation. Second, as our income rises, rising imports harmlessly drain off excess demand. Import quotas must therefore increase the pressure of inflation with in the United States. We oppose policies that must hurt our friends abroad, pro mote economic warfare, and increase the pressure of infla tion in this country. HAROLD BARGER ALBERT G. HART PETER B. KENEN KELVIN J. LANCASTER WILLIAM S. VICKREY New York, July 3, 1970 The writers are members of the Department of Economics, Columbia University. Draft Alternatives To the Editor: What Representative Jona than Bingham suggests (letter June 29) as an “alternative” to the draft begins with an erroneous assumption, namely that an individual must serve in some capacity to support our Government's or society's plan, whatever that might be at any particular moment and whether he agrees with it or not. He negates the basic concept of freedom of choice, which car ries along with it the only true alternatives—to serve or not to serve. A truly free society does not impose obligations. It achiever them through willful consent. There would be no shortage of volunteers if our freedoms were endangered by a foreign power bent on conquest. The only just solution to the draft is a volunteer army con sisting of well paid career soldiers. Naturally our standing army would be smaller but its very size would act as a de terrent to politicians who have the power to commit our forces. Knowing that there is not an inexhaustible supply of cannon fodder supplied by an in equitable draft, they would have to use force only as a means of self‐defense when we are in direct danger. Our politicians must awaken to the fact that when Govern ment tells one that he must serve in any capacity, be it army, social services or the like, it is an erosion of per sonal freedom. A natural outgrowth of this thinking is that I must serve in a particular job, I may not leave my job, etc. Mr. Bingham does not offer an alternative. He offers choices of subservience. EMANUAL GROSS Brooklyn, June 29, 1970 Encouraged Dissenter To the Editor: The Times of June 24 quoted Vice President Agnew as having said, “We must stand up for things that we believe are right and talk out against those things we consider wrong, even if occasionally we are found to be in error.” I am grateful to the Vice President for encouraging peace ful dissent with this comment. I can assure him that I shall gladly “stand up” for peace and equality and “talk out” against war and suppression. BRUCE O'LEARY BROWN New York, June 24, 1970 For Museums at Night To the Editor: The City of New York has many wonderful art and science museums and exhibitions that are not fully available to the masses of working people. The main problem is that the ma jority of these facilities do not remain open even one evening a week. It is understood that there are expenses involved in providing additional visiting hours in the evening, but there must be solu tions to these problems if the largest and greatest city in the world is also to be the cultural center of the world. A partial list of the cultural centers that have no visiting hours in the evening includes the American Museum of Natu ral History, the New York His torical Society Museum, the Museum of Primitive Art, the Frick Collection. It is my sincere hope that these institutions may be en couraged to arrange to be open one night a week. ROBERT T. HAMER South River, N. J., June 25, 1970 Candidates’ Litter To the Editor: With the advent of more po litical activity for the forthcom ing November elections, I should like to voice my plea to all candidates and their respective staffs to refrain from littering our already inundated city. Pamphlets, stickers and other campaign paraphernalia are in discriminately and illegally be ing shoved at citizens, pasted upon private automobiles, build ings, lamp posts, and other pub lic property, and ultimately come to rest in the gutters and subway entrances and exits of the city. I hope that with growing public awareness and concern about pollution, this year's candidates for public office will begin to prove their con cern for the ecological crisis by ceasing their indiscriminate dis tribution of campaign literature. ALAN W. ANDERSON New York, June 24, 1970 Threat to Cyprus To the Editor: The recent flareup of rioting in Northern Ireland points up clearly the fallacy of partition ing a country and placing arti ficial and arbitrary barriers between inhabitants of a geo graphical entity. Influential Government offi cials in Washington and Lon don are attempting the same in the island of Cyprus: that is to partition it between Turkey and Greece despite the fact that there is no legal, moral, politi cal, or economic basis for such a division, except possibly to satisfy a foreign power which seeks to subject the people of Cyprus once again to colonial status. This is why President Ma karios and the people of Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish, are vehemently opposed to having their island partitioned, as the Irish island has been. As is amply demonstrated in Ireland and other lands split up against the will of their people, the results are distrust, tension and friction and finally open warfare, thus inviting outside interference and intervention. The people of Cyprus will never submit to the partition of their homeland no matter who may desire or dictate it. The people of Ireland would not be fighting each other today if their homeland were not par titioned in the first place by the British. Differences in re ligious beliefs or ethnic origins are no valid justification for dividing any nation or people. ERNEST J. VARDALAS Chairman, Justice for Cyprus Committee Chicago, July 6, 1970 Helping Penn Central To the Editor: Proposals by Representative Ogden Reid and others that the United States Government directly or indirectly lend money or guarantee loans made to the Penn Central Railroad will benefit only the bond holders, creditors and stock holders of the company. If the Penn Central goes through the entire bankruptey procedure it will be relieved, during this process—which may take many years—of the bur den of paying interest or prin cipal on its commercial paper, bank loans, bonds, etc. Since all revenues will be available for operations with no charges for an immense over hanging debt, there will be ample funds for improving and assuring service. Federal finan cial aid will have the opposite effect. [Editorial July 8.] MOSES CAMMER Larchmont, N. Y., July 4, 1970 A FOOTNOTE TO OVID Arbor eris certe mea (Metamorphoses, I) Run slowly now. And I won't follow faster. Let me without pursuit catch up with you. Or if my question fails, go on, go on, But slower now. For see, it puz zles you, You put down roots into my patient ground. The tree stirs, seems to be say ing yes: Art is appeased. The slim girl running still. JOHN FULLER

274-> Pollution 2: Next to Motherhood For Votes in California
—One result of our “instant communication” en vironment is the instant cliché. A phrase uttered over the air waves one day becomes a house hold word the next. This has happened recently in the field of conservation. All of a sudden, politicians are talking about “preserving the environ ment,” “the quality of life,” “the ecology revolution.” Last week, President Nixon stressed environ mental issues in his State of the Union message. Jess M. Unruh, the astute Minority Leader of the California Assembly and a candi date for Governor, has called en vironmental protection “the motherhood resolution of politics this year.” But even though many politi cians are obviously leaping for a foothold on the rhetorical band wagon, environmental issues will play a major role in the politics of the 1970's. And nowhere is this more apparent than in Cali fornia, which has been the har binger of so many political—and cultural—trends in recent years. Mr. Unruh, who emerged as the leading Democratic candidate to oppose Gov. Ronald Reagan when San Francisco Mayor. Jo seph Alioto withdrew from the race amid charges of financial impropriety, has proposed crea tion of a State Conservation Au thority. It would have power to “review the programs of state, local and private agencies to prevent the piecemeal destrut tion of our environment.” (The other leading Democratic possibility is Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, who is taking sound ings about a possible primary, race against Mr. Unruh.) Governor Reagan, who once proclaimed that “if you've seen one redwood, you've seen them all” has also joined the chorus. Earlier this year he supported a bill to prevent further destruc tion of San Francisco Bay. In his annual State of the State mes sage this month, the Governor stressed the need to eradicate pollution of the air, water and land. And, last week, he proposed a tough clean‐air bill to abate the smog that is now more of a sym bol of Southern California than sunshine and oranges. Environmental issues are if anything even more prominent in the Senate race. Representa tive John V. Tunney, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican Senator George Murphy, started his campaign recently with a statewide tour of environmental trouble spots. In the course of that tour last week, Mr. Tunney proposed a California Coastline National Park “to preserve and enhance the small amount of beachfront suitable for public recreation.” Representative George E. Brown Jr., Mr. Tummy's chief opponent and long a crusader on environmental issues, formed an Action Committee on Environ mental Quality (ACEQ) to draft legislation in the field. Why have environmental is sues become so popular? The obvious answer is that they af fect everyone. There is not a person in California who does not breathe befouled get stuck in horrendous traffic jams or watch hundreds of acres of open land fall to the bulldozer every day. Politically, these issues become very attractive, particularly to men like Mr. Unruh,.Mr. Tunney, and Mr. Brown. If Governor Rea gan and Senator Murphy can run their campaigns against student radicals, welfare recipients and black militants, they would prob ably win easily. But if liberals are able to promote issues which cut across acrimonious class and racial lines, they could give the incumbent a battle. Beyond the election, the im portant question is whether all this rhetoric will result in any action. The answer is by no means, clear. Recently, for instance, after a leaknng oil well smeared. Cali fornia beaches with noxious sludge, Mr. Unruh proposed a bill to ban all offshore drilling in the three‐mile zone owned by the state. (The offending well was beyond three miles, on Fed eral property.) Governor Reagan, whose leading supporters include several prominent oil men, op posed the bill, and it died. In other words, the vested in terests which help cause pollu tion—the oil companies, the pow er companies, the auto compa nies—have become deeply en trenched in the political power structure, not only here but across the country. But what Might be happening is that an aroused citizenry— which last year forced the rever sal of American policy in Viet nam—might be forcing a change in political allegiances on this issue. Public officials might start actually representing the public.

276-> Advertising: SSC&B Marks Its 25th Year
SSC&B quietly celebrated its 25th anniversary the other Friday by giving its people a couple of hours off. You can't celebrate much more quietly than that. Before the general exodus, however, S. Heagan Bayles, chairman, and Alfred J. Seaman, president, chatted about yesteryear. Mr. Bayles is the B and the last remain ing member of the team that established what was Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell & Bayles, the hottest shop in town in 1946, its first full year. “Our promise was to have top people concentrating on the client's problems,” he re calls, which shows you that some things don't change. But others do and change plenty. In 1946, the top 31 agencies billing 10‐million and up placed a total of $764‐ million worth of advertising. Shucks, J. Walter Thompson placed almost that much all by themselves last year and an agency couldn't even make the top 100 list in 1969 with $10‐million. • In the top 10 agencies a quarter of a century ago (it seems like only yesterday) were Ruthrauff & Ryan, which the Sullivan, Stauffer crowd and its first clients came out of, and the Biow Company. What ever became of them? And where are Cecil & Presbrey; Maxon; Brooke, Smith, French & Dorrance; Geyer, Newell & Ganger; Don ahue & Coe; Brisacher, Wheel er & Staff, and Duane Jones? Does any other industry change so? But don't despair. Pan Am erican is still at J.W.T.; Gen eral Foods is still at Benton & Bowles and Young & Ru bicam, and Procter & Gamble is still getting along with Compton, B. & B. and Dancer Fitzgerald‐Sample. The biggest percentage gain In billing in 1946 was made by Grant Advertising and that was the year, too, that Thompson got the Ford deal er business from Maxon, and Foote, Cone & Belding picked up Pall Mall cigarettes from Ruthrauff & Ryan. And, although many agency men probably didn't know it, it was the eve of the mar keting revolution and Sulli van, Stauffer, which was to be billing $12‐million in three years, was in on the ground floor. • As Heagan Bayles remem bers it, the agencies had to change their style as the country moved out of a war time economy, when few goods were available, to one where selling was the thing. “It was the age of the Valentine ad, there was noth ing to sell, you just had to keep your name in front of the consumer,” he reminisced, going on to observe that “agencies got out of the habit of writing selling copy. It was the fun period—technique was the thing.” “So,” he said, “we set out to have a new streamlined operation concentrating on packaged goods and equipped to revitalize old brands and launch new ones. But we had no idea there would be so many new products.” There certainly have been and that probably helped the agency reach the $115.9‐mil lion worldwide billing figure last year. Now, time for one last quick look down Memory Lane. It took Sullivan, Stauf fer three months to get phone service when it first opened. Can you believe it? * You highbrows who en joyed the recent showing of the film “Hamlet” on Channel 9 and appreciated the fact that Procter & Gamble's Bounty paper towels, the sponsor, didn't interrupt the show with commercials, will be delighted to know that Bounty is going to do it again. And again. It will sponsor “The Red Shoes,” the most acclaimed ballet movie of all time, on Aug. 1, and the award‐win ning “Cyrano de Bergerac,” with Jose Ferrer, scheduled tentatively for Aug. 29. To some it might seem odd that one of the giant soapers, which has the reputation for the hard sell, should be con tent with merely an opening and closing “billboard” on a show it sponsors. Dancer‐ Fitzgerald‐ Sample, the agency for the brand, ex plained it simply enough by saying that Bounty is the type of product that will most likely be purchased by an “upscale” consumer, the kind that doesn't watch TV as much as most. “We want to reach the kind of person who is normally difficult to reach and reach him in a way that he wants to listen,” was what the man said. And he ex plained that it was the good response to the first show that brought on the other two. So if you like, respond. * The Dow Chemical Com pany, which has several large agencies on its agency list, has gone to a year‐old “crea tive cell” to advertise a new product, an automobile engine coolant. The shop is John Paul Itta, Inc., and it is understood that Dow only talked to small creative units. Is that interesting? * Doremus & Co., specialists in financial advertising, an flounced a drop in second‐ quarter billings to $10.86‐ million from $12‐million in the second quarter of 1969. It notes, however, that the six‐month figure is close to last year's. Second‐quarter net earn ings were $94,000, or 22 cents a share, compared with $137,000, or 32 cents, in the 1969 period. For the half, it was $206,000 compared to $212,000. * You'd figure that a maga zine that is sent to 245,000 physicians has a pretty well refined audience to offer. McGraw‐Hill has such a magazine — Medical World News — and is about to re fine its audience even more in order to reach “physicians in the top pharmaceutical‐pre scribing categories.” As of the Aug. 14 issue, the circulation will be cut to 206,000 and, for “full‐run” advertisers, the ad rates will also be trimmed. The maga zine already has a demo graphic edition that reaches 145,000 physicians who are “high ‐ prescribing private practice specialists.” Don't you go to one of those? Doesn't everyone? * Ruder & Finn, a public relations house with a New York headquarters and a worldwide appetite, has made a pact with Dentsu PR Cen ter of Tokyo. It's sort of a mutual assistance treaty— you take care of my clients on your turf and we'll do likewise for yours.

278-> War Songs Losing Favor in Israel
TEL AVIV—Eight of the 20 songs in this week's He brew “Hit Parade” are from army shows. Not one of them is a war song. Some deal with life in the armed forces but, like the civilian hits, they're about people, places, love and situations. “War songs were popular a year ago but people are now fed up with them;” said Miss Delia Heller, who edits the “Hit Parade” for the State Radio. “Composers have stopped writing them and singers don't want to perform them any more.” One of the last popular war songs earlier this year was ballad about a medical or derly who is killed while treating a wounded soldier under fire. It won first prize by popular acclaim at the an nual Israel Song Festival, but the award was attacked in the press. Unfairness Son There was no argument about the merits of the bal lad, but many felt that it had been an unfair competitor because it had capitalized on emotions. “It was blackmail of sentiments,” an army offi cer remarked. Interest in war books has also faded. Last year the best sellers were picture al bums and books about the six‐day war. They are now outsold by Hebrew transla tions of “Portnoy's Com plaint” and the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn novels. This year's original Hebrew books are memoirs, political vol umes and novels that have nothing to do with the war. On the Hebrew stage, the war in Vietnam figures, but not Israel's wars. “Hair,” presented by a combined for eign and Israeli cast, has re ceived mixed critical reac tions but is playing to full houses. The Cameri The ater's latest offering is Lyle Kessler's “The Watering Place,” about a confrontation between a Vietnam war vet eran and the family of a dead buddy. “The World of Jac ques Brel,” presented by Bi mott, also includes some antiwar songs. But most current stage of ferings are remote from the political situation. Habimah's greatest successes are Ed ward Albee's “A Delicate Balance,” about a troubled family in America, and David Storey's “In Celebration,” about a troubled family in an English mining town. The latest Habimah production is a classical bedroom farce, Feydeau's “Amelie.” The Cameri Theater's pro ductions of Garcia Lorca's “Blood Wedding” and Neil Simon's “Plaza Suite” have been well received, but Mo liere's “Tartuffe,” played by the Haifa Municipal Theater, had a bad reception. Original Hebrew plays that bad premieres this month are “Sephardic Orchard” by It zhak Navon, Deputy Speaker of the Knesset (parliament), and “The Sheep” by Yosef Ben Yosef. Both deal with life in the country before Israel's independence in 1948. However, the Experimental Workshop of the Haifa Thea ter as presenting “Co‐Exist ence,” which is based on a collection of interviews with Israeli Arabs about their liv ing conditions. It is a forth right portrayal, and sad. Earlier this year a stir wag created by the Cameri Thea ter's political satire, “Queen of the Bathtub.” Widespread exception was taken to sev eral scenes, including the portrayal of a father who wanted to murder his son in order to achieve the status of a bereaved war parent. Bereaved parents, widows and wounded veterans pro tested, and members of the audience created disturbances at most performances. By all accounts it was a vulgar and dishonest show, but the con troversy attracted capacity houses. Many who considered the show culturally worthless argued passionately for it to go on in the interests of freedom of expression. A growing number of mu sical shows draw on tradi tional Jewish material. The trend is seen as reflecting a search for JeWish identity as a reaction to the trauma be fore the six‐day war when the world left Israel to stand alone against Arab threats of annihilation, but Jews from all over rallied to her aid. ‘Witch’ and ‘Bible Songs’ Giora Godik is presenting “The Witch,” adapted from the Goldfaden classic of the Yiddish stage. Bimott is pre senting “Songs and Stories from Hassidic Lore” in He brew and “Bible Songs of Itzik Manger” in Yiddish. The Israel Philharmonic will open its new season at the end of the month with a Rubinstein festival. The po litical unrest has not deterred internationally famous con ductors and soloists from coming to Israel, and an im pressive array has been booked for the coming sea son. Festivals sponsored by the Government have also been successful. The seventh Zim riya, a choir festival, drew a record turnout of 1,000 sing ers from 14 countries this summer. The Zimriya origi nally had been envisaged for Jewish choirs only, but it has become international and 55 per cent of the singers this time were non‐Jews. The Zimriya was followed by the annual Music and Dance Festival. The fourth international harp contest, recently ended, drew 20 competitors from nine countries.

279-> Youths Burn U.S. Flag in Manila
MANILA, May 24 (AP)— About 200 leftist Filipino youths ended a noisy but peaceful anti ‐ Government and anti‐United States dem onstration here tonight by burning an American flag. They threatened to move on to the United States Em bassy but changed their minds. The embassy was heavily guarded by riot po licemen and soldiers. The demonstrators were the remnants of about 1,000 students and labor union members who earlier had staged what they called a “people's march” to downtown Miranda Square and de manded the resignation of President Ferdinand E. Mar cos. Speakers at the rally ac cused President Marcos of waging “war on his own people by his repeated threats of imposing martial law.” The march was the culmi nation of a week‐long dem onstration by the striking workers of the Filipino owned United States Tobacco Corporation who were joined by students belonging to the radical Movement for a Democratic Philippines.

280-> KARL L. BEISBART
SPRINGFIELD, N. J., Dec. 15 —Karl L. Beisbart, founder of the K. L. B. Tool Manufacturing. Company of Union, died yester day at East Orange General Hospital.

281-> 5 NEWSMEN IN WAR DETAINED AND FREED
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, May 24 (AP) — Five newsmen, in cluding a Pulitzer Prize‐winning photographer, were detained by North Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia this weekend but were quickly released. Picked up yesterday were Kyoichi Sawada of United Press International, winner of the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for his photo coverage of the Vietnam war, and Robert C. Miller of Honolulu, the United Press In ternational bureau chief. Today a Columbia Broad casting System news team— Don Webster, Willis Brown and Kurt Hoefle — was stopped by North Vietnamese soldiers. Both incidents occurred 30 miles south of Pnompenh. Mr. Sawada and Mr. Miller were released after having been held eight hours in a small vil lage, and the C.B.S. crew was detained at a roadblock for about 45 minutes. Since the Cambodian fight ing began less than two months ago, 15 American and foreign journalists have disappeared while reporting the conflict. Mr. Webster, a correspondent from Los Angeles, attributed the release of the C.B.S. team to Mr. Hoefler, a German na tional, who convinced a North Vietnamese officer that they were Germans, he said.

282-> Venezuela Signs for $100‐Million Loan
Agreement for a $100‐mil lion loan to Venezuela by a 16‐bank syndicate was com pleted yesterday at the main offices of the Chase Manhat tan Bank, which headed the lending group. Dr. Pedro R. Tinoco, the Venezuelan Finance Minister, and representatives of the participating banks, signed the agreement in ceremonies attended also by Dr. Carlos Rafael Silva, first vice presi dent of the Central Bank of venezuela. The five‐year credit will help to finance an extensive public‐works program in the South American country. The $100‐million loan is the second major borrowing by Venezuela from a Chase Manhattan ‐ headed syndicate in the last year. The previous loan — $85‐million — was made last August. Under the new agreement, repayments are to be made in eight semi‐annual install ments beginning Sept. 30, 1971. Interest will be the equivalent of the prime rate —now 8 per cent—plus ⅞ per cent. In addition to Chase, other banks in the group that are lending $10‐million each are the First National City Bank, the Chemical Bank, the Mor gan Guaranty Trust, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust and the Bank of America. The other 10 banks are lending sums up to $5.5‐million.

283-> Books of The Times
IF you are thinking of getting this set for a child (up to age 10), throw away all adult ideas about encyclopedias and put yourself in the hands of the editors. Un less you have been very close to the mate rial lately, your notions will be out of kilter. For one, this very junior edition is not all‐inclusive. You will find Shake speare but not Tolstoy, Stravinsky but not Schoenberg, Einstein but not Niels Bohr. On the other hand, you will find an entry on Benjamin Banneker. Who is he? Well you can look him up in “The Young Chil dren's Encyclopedia.” There is a sympathetic article on mice, including a number of charming photo graphs, followed in turn by the story of the country mouse and the city mouse, which I read once again with great pleas ure. There is an ingenious method of con structing a piggy bank, an article on how to arrange for a treasure hunt and how to get a model ship into a bottle. Obviously none of this is what admirers of the 11th edition of the Britannica had been led to expect in an enterprise of this sort. If the approach of the editors appears to be somewhat haphazard, so is the ap proach of the users. Young children, say the editors, almost never look things up. It just doesn't occur to a 5‐year‐old to see what a set is in math or to trace the Amazon River to its source. Children up to 10 are browsers, say the editors; their attention span is likely to be short. They like to turn pages, rove through the illus trations. Anything may catch their fancy but not for too long. Thus the articles are designed to entertain as they inform; the text is always balanced by spacious and numerous drawings and the language is pegged to a level they can handle or un derstand and maybe follow if they are read to. In other words, the youngster may be having a perfectly good time with out knowing that he is consulting an en cyclopedia at all. Most of the articles have been cast in the form. of simple tales. There are no graphs, charts, tabular matter .or fine print. Quite often the reader can identify with the. central personage of the episode he is following. The piece on astronauts starts off by inviting the youngster to consider the job: lying on one's back on top of tank of dangerous fuel and then being pushed off the ground with such force as to drive one's stomach out of the body. But the reward is a spectacular view of the planet. In an article on dance, ballet terms are not defined coldly but woven into the story of a ballet lesson. Some times the emphasis appears a little strange —to a nonexpert, that is. The piece on Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic is presented in a short dramatic vignette. Will he make it? Does he have enough fuel? But the name of the plane is not given; the number of miles flown not stated; the route not indicated. Wouldn't a 10‐year‐old be interested in such details? By and large it would appear that the articles are more successful with places, scientific facts and mechanical explana tions than with cultural matters. The chapter that defines a bird is far more suc cessful than the one on Lautrec or Bee thoven. And was it necessary to include the story about Newton and the apple even with the proviso that it may not quite be true? I was surprised to see noticeable absence of sports figures. Home Run Baker and Christy Mathewson were much before my time, but even as a young ster I was fascinated by their exploits. There's virtually nothing on football. Maybe the editors thought the interested youngster would absorb enough just by sharing his father's favorite indoor sport on Sunday afternoon. I guess every child knows how to turn on the television. Rhymes and jingles of various lengths are scattered throughout. They leaven the material, break up the formality of prose and catch the youngster's fancy. Some times scientific exposition is augmented by a brief poem. A sober article on the hippopotamus followed by a six stanza tribute that begins: This handsome animal is called A hippopotamus. That means a river horse. It looks More like a pig to us. The verses in turn are festooned with a series of precise and festive drawings. especially liked one in Which the hippo stands coyly on the scale waiting to be weighed. As a bonus for the parent and teacher, the publishers have included a manual that lists every article with its proper age group, the main idea it is intended to con vey and a listing of related pieces to be found “elseWhere in the encyclopedia. And there is a reading list for those parents and children who want to go further. The age bracket, as the ‘compilers of the man ual point out, is not rigid. A child may be attracted to a drawing in an article way beyond his years, whereas an older youngster ‘may return to a poem he learned a long while before. The point is that anything in these books may stimu late or provoke him.. Let him loose and don't worry. Some parents may be con cerned that the youngster may too easily grow out of these volumes. It's a possibil ity. But if they receive the kind of use the makers envision, there may be nothing left to grow out of. THE YOUNG CHILDREN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA. Howard L.

284-> Top 2 Stock Cars Have Come A Long Way From Showroom
RACINE, Wis., May 16 (AP) —They are called stock car races, but the cars go faster than 210 miles an hour because their owners make them as little like showroom buggies as pos sible. “We go over them from bumper to bumper,” said Norm Nelson, 47 years old, of Racine, who has been racing as a driver and owner for 29 years. His Plymouths rank first and second in the 1970 United States Auto Club standing. His driver, Roger McCluskey of Tucson, Ariz., is first in driving points. Nelson is second. “The first thing we do is go over every weld, and take the production out of them,” said Nelson, the career U. S. A. C. point leader. “Then we put on a lot stiffer springs and torsion bars.” “We take out all the excess,” he said of the work done in his Racine shop. “If something is not functional, we get rid of it.” A rigid web of steel tubing, for safety and strength, is top priority in turning a street ma chine into a “stocker.” Starting at the car's frame, it runs up alongside the radiator and back through the firewall where it joins a “squirrel cage” that surrounds the driver. It extends through the rear floor ing and anchors to the ground. “It's just like an old‐fashioned bridge,” Nelson said. “It's a functional part of the car. Now the car can he wrecked, but you keep the car's basic shape— you keep a little space in there for the driver.” “As a car goes through the corners, the whole hody dis torts like this,” he said, twist ing his hands alongside each other MI if wringing a cloth. “A standard car couldn't take ??” ?? dions cornering at those kind of speeds,” he added. “It affects both the car and driver. That's why we use this kind of a seat.” The small bucket seat had rests behind and to the right of the driver's head. It also had braces reaching around the driver's body. “On some tracks,” Nelson said, “there's no straightaway —no spot where you can get a little rest. After a while, your neck muscles give out,” he said, flopping his head on his right shoulder. “That's why the side headrest.” Bolted where the back seat was where two small radiators to cool the transmission and rear axle fluid. A small insulated bottle for drinking water— which the driver sips through a tube attached to his harness hung from the metal web. Heat is a major problem. A scoop on top of the car pours air down to cool the driver. Air hoses lead to front wheels to keep brakes cool. “The name of the game with us.” Nelson said, “is to get the cars perfected in the shop, then go race them. If we do that, we'll represent ourselves real well.”

285-> Ford Subsidiary in Britain Follows Price Rises There
LONDON, Wednesday, April 1 (Reuters)—The Ford Motor Company, Ltd., today became the third major British auto manufacturer to announce price increases this year because of higher production costs. The company (a subsidiary of the Detroit‐based Ford Motor Company) said all British Ford car prices would rise by as much as £39 ($93.60) from the basic price. And an increase in the sales tax makes the highest rise almost £51 ($122.40). The British Leyland Motor Corporation, Ltd., has already raised prices. The Chrysler‐con trolled Rootes Motors, Ltd., has announced its intention to fol low suit soon. Ford last in creased its prices in October. Under the new price range a Ford Capri 1600, which in the past cost £971. ($2,330), will cost £1,006 ($2,415).

287-> The Big Lie and the SST
WASHINGTON—Not even fourteen years of service in the United States Senate prepared me for the kind of propaganda blitz that was organized against America's participation in the development of a supersonic transport plane. Never in my experience has the “big lie” technique, popularized by Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister in World War II, been used more effectively to describe a needed program of research and development. All of a sudden, in the months and weeks prior to the first Senate vote in this year's SST appropriation, this ten‐year‐old program, begun in the Eisenhower Administration and sup ported in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, became the legisla tive monster of all time. Sound arguments for American par ticipation in the development of the SST to hold leadership in the field of civilian aviation were drowned in wave of scare stories, myths, guesses, speculation, half‐truths and downright lies. An unusual combination of left wing scientists, politicians, economists and conservationists effectively over powered the voices of reason in the Administration and Congress. Their efforts produced so much con fusion that the casual observer had every reason to believe that a vote in the Senate for continuing a program to build two prototype SST's for research could result in any one of the follow ing conditions: The possible extinction of all life on earth as a result of SST flights which might weaken the protective ozone blanket of the earth. • The inundation of all life on earth because SST flights might so alter the temperature of the atmosphere that it would melt the polar ice cap. • The complete exhaustion of all fuel supplies on earth in twenty years. • The final and fatal pollution of the earth's atmosphere by poisonous emis sions from SST flights in the atmos phere. • The possible death of all fish and birds and other life forms which exist in or over the ocean because of sonic booms from the SST. An epidemic of possible skin can cer throughout the earth because of SST exhaust emissions. These points supply some idea as to the scare techniques dreamed up and widely spread by organizations such as the Friends of the Earth, Environ mental Action, the Federation of American Scientists, the Zero Popula tion Growth Club and the Sierra Club. It was not only amazing but down right frightening to see the number of prominent scientists who were willing to lend their names to far‐fetched and hypothetical possibilities that might result from a research and develop ment program by the United States into an SST project which has almost reached the production stage in France, Britain and Russia. The scare techniques used against the SST are similar to the ones that were used by some of the same people to oppose the A‐bomb tests in Bikini in 1946, the development of an H‐bomb in 1949 and even to such beneficial hu manitarian projects as building a dam across the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. In each case so‐called experts assured us that catastrophe would fol low if affirmative action were taken. Some scientists said an underwater A‐bomb test would blow a hole in the earth's crust and blow up the globe. The prophets of doom confidently told us that the U.S, did not have the know how to produce an H‐bomb and that if we tried we might destroy the earth by miscalculation. That little old dam across the Colo rado River was described as a devel opment that would flood the Grand Canyon and make an inland lake out of one of the world's greatest national wonders. But when we got computers to work on the problem, it was discov ered there wasn't enough cement in the world to build a darn that would cross the Grand Canyon and not enough river water in the entire coun try to fill it up. I cite these fantastic tales because they are similar to the nonsense that is being spread about what a few air planes might do to the atmosphere flown at supersonic speeds. What’ it boils down to is that the enemies of an American SST are mak ing a scapegoat out of technology in desperate attempt to channel ever more funds into social welfare pro grams. The attitude is short‐ranged and ill‐advised. Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona was the Republican Presidential candi date in 1964.

288-> New Retail Frontier: The Small Town
The new frontier for stores may well be where the fron tier of the country was a century ago—the small town in the rural areas where in dustry is now becoming the economic partner of the farmer. At least 600 such towns (with populations of 15,000 to 30,000) beckon retailers across the country and there are at least a dozen such small cities in each state of the union, according to the head of a rapidly developing retail chain in the Midwest. Unlike the big city, where the economic facts of life place cost pressures on re tailing operations, the small city offers many opportuni ties because of lower costs to aggressive retailers, said Edward J. Kleckner, presi dent of Belscot Retailers, Inc., Chicago. “Any county seat has a daily newspaper in which a full‐page advertisement would cost only $250. Thus with one store in the town we can compete with Sears, Roebuck or J. C. Penney in the same town and maybe be just as effective,” he said. In the big city, however, many a retailer finds that he would need 10 or 12 stores to be able to afford similar ad vertising, he said. The growth of television stations linking many small towns in the same state or area also opens up promo tional opportunities for retail companies that prefer to avoid the rigorous competi tion and high costs of the big cities, he said. “If, let's say in Illinois, where we are increasing the number of our stores, we can get 17 or 20 stores—or in an even larger area—we can effectively use TV as an advertising medium. These towns are usually only 20 to 40 miles apart and television can encompass more of them than a local newspaper could. So, if we advertised on Peoria or Rockford tele vision, we could pretty well get wide coverage,” Mr. Kleckner said. The relative cost of tele vision advertising would, of course, be less in the small city than in the big one, he said. Preferring to be a “big fish in a small pond,” Mr. Kleck ner said that Belscot has earmarked an expansion of 17 new full‐line discount de partment stores, averaging somewhat more than 65,000 square feet each, in the next four years. Two of the new ones were opened last fall, giving the concern 14 such stores, with 15 more to build. Each will be in a town or small city such as Mr. Kleckner has cited. The company's stores oper ate in six Midwest states under the names of Belscot, Bell, Scot, Jubilee City, ABC Discount Centers and Econo mart. They will open on the average of one each fiscal quarter. The company's sales in the year ending Jan. 31 are ex pected to total about $32‐ million, up from the year‐ earlier $27.5‐million. Earn ings are expected to be “substantially higher” than last year's $770,000, or 77 cents a share. While the full‐line discount stores have risen from 30 per cent to 45 per cent of total company sales since last year, 55 per cent of sales are coming from 84 leased ap parel departments that Bel scot operates in its own stores and in others. In the new fiscal year, Mr. Kleck ner estimated, about 16 new leased departments will be opened by Belscot. The leased departments are combinations of two Bel scot divisions, the Jubilee Shops, based in New York and the E.&J. Corporation, of Chicago. Jubilee handles women's, children's and in fant's wear. E.&J. involves men's and boys' wear and domestics operations. In the full‐line, company operated stores, Belscot is planning eventually to take over the leases of its leased operators and run the depart ments, so substantial addi tional volume will be derived. “We feel that we are bringing self‐service, mass merchandising techniques in our stores to smaller mar kets, where the public has been able to shop only in the Momma‐and‐Poppa store. We find that the small‐town shopper is very fashion‐con scious because of the rapid growth of the small‐city tele vision station and new read ership habits. The belief that small towners believe in strictly conservative dress and are years behind in their apparel tastes is now just a myth,” he said. In its newest stores, Belscot has injected vivid color and use of a certain amount of avant‐garde decor. Bright colored walls liven up the interiors and striking effects are used, such as eight‐foot blow‐ups of model's faces in wall murals The company, which hopes to increase its sales 20 per cent annually, is shooting for sales of $100‐million by 1975 and “will probably do bet ter.” A new, 100,000‐square foot distribution center is being planned for Jubilee Shops in Secaucus, N. J. The company is the result of the 1968 merger between the E.&J. Corporation, with its Bell, Scot and other stores founded in 1947 by Mr. Kleckner and Jack Schaps in 1947, and the Jubilee Shops, founded in 1955 by Lawrence Altman. The merger was completed in May, 1968. The combined company went public in August of that year. Mr. Kleckner, born in Pitts burgh 50 years ago and reared in Chicago, became a surplus dealer following Army Air Corps service dur ing World War II. He had had been a specialist in the service in purchasing and contracting and later was as signed to disposing of surplus Air Corps materiel. Early in his civilian career he found himself the owner of several hundred thousand Army cots, which some ex pert estimated would take him 10 years to dispose of, and “of more plain black sur plus Air Force oxfords than the whole country could con sume.” But he did sell them and then moved on to a partner ship with Mr. Schaps, who had also been a surplus‐prod ucts dealer.

289-> What Role for Banks?
This is a time of troubles in Wall Street. The scattered failures in the brokerage corn munity, the Populist drive in Congress to restrict the banks in their future diversification, and perhaps most importantly the collapse of the homebuilding mar ket due to the shortage of mort gage money all bespeak a malaise to which the country's political leadership is now starting to respond. Abbie Hoffman, the Yippie leader, certainly speaks only for his own special constituency when he suggests that now is the time to “burn the banks.” But whether consciously or not, in a larger sense he reflects a deep‐seated concern that the financial markets—in their pri mary role of allocating re sources in a capital hungry na tion—are not doing the job they should. Indeed, this was probably President Nixon's basic concern when he decided to appoint a Commission on Financial Struc ture and Regulation to look at the way that financial flows are channeled from savers into productive investment in the United States. Representative Wright Pat man, the. Texas Democrat who has made a career out of bait ing the big banks, suspects that the financial commission pro posal is nothing more than a political ploy devised by the American Bankers Association to forestall Senate action on the extraordinarily restrictive one‐bank holding company bill that he pushed through the House last fall. There may be more than a grain of truth in Mr. Patman's suspicious. But the fact remains that there are bigger issues in volved here, too. The one‐bank holding com pany—with the potential that it offers to the largest banks to create department stores of finance—is without question very attractive device econom ically. However, it is also true that with the enormous growth of the economy, financial needs have changed and are no long er so easily satisfied by the traditional banking techniques of the 90‐day loan. The bill on one‐bank holding companies that Mr. Patman— as chairman of the House Bank ing Committee — helped write or the floor of the House would do an effective job of blocking the banks (as well as the bank holding companies) from the leasing business. What is less certain is how, and at what cost, the job of basing now being done by the banks—for example, of the giant Boeing 747's now coming off the production line—will be taken care of. This is the broader question: what kind of a financial struc ture does the nation need in the years ahead to meet both its social and its economic needs? The one‐bank holding com pany is a good case in point. It is only a beginning, however. The thrift institutions—the sav ings and loan associations and the mutual savings banks— have done an admirable job of financing suburban homes for white, middle‐class America. But despite some admirable efforts by a number of savings institutions, the bulk of the thrift industry is still wrestling with the question of how to deal with its responsibilities in rebuilding the central city. Quite obviously, the savings institutions are going to need new tools—both in attracting deposits and in investing them —if the job is to be done. In the financial establish ment, the common attitude is simply to ask for freedom from legislative and regulatory re straint so as to be able to merchandise its services to as broad a public as possible. Not long ago, Gaylord A. Freeman Jr., the outspoken chairman of the First National Bank of Chicago, wrote a long letter to Senator Charles H. Percy to argue for postpone ment of action on one‐bank holding companies. Events of the last year, Mr. Freeman told the senior Repub lican Senator from Illinois, sug gested that Congress had been “quite unjustifiably” critical of banks, and especially the large banks. “It may also be,” Mr. Free man asserted, “that in 1969 Congress felt it should take some action to limit or punish conglomerates, but didn't quite know how to do so. “A one‐bank holding compa ny may have been looked upon as a sort of mini‐conglomerate and was easy to attack, espe cially with interest rates high and banks consequently unpop ular,” he said. For many years, Mr. Freeman complained, banks have been providing insurance and travel services — two services the House bill would prohibit for the banks. “There has been no showing of abuse in their doing so,” Mr. Freeman said. “Yet without regard for the public interest, but solely to eliminate bank competition from these fields, H.R. 6778 [the one‐bank hold ing company bill] would pro hibit banks from continuing to offer these services to the public.” But what is the “public in terest” to which Mr. Freeman refers? That is less clear. Speaking of the financial de partment store concept the oth er day, Frank Wile, who is expected to be sworn in today as chairman of the Federal De posit Insurance Corporation, re marked that “I am concerned as a citizen with concentrations of economic power—and if po litical power flows from eco nomic power—with that conse quence of economic power.” Mr. Wile represents a wide spread and responsible point of view. Certainly, it seems that the financial community is un likely to get a blank check from a Washington concerned about improving the flow of funds in the economy. But neither should unreason ing political opposition to fi nancial bigness block the banks —or their cousins in the thrift industry—from providing use ful and needed services. The middle line between ex cessive concentration and com petitive freedom will not be easy to find. But it can be found. The President should ap point his financial commission without further delay.

290-> Heath: III —Suez to Singapore
LONDON—When President Nixon reviews the world this week with Prime Minister Edward Heath he will find the latter perhaps less worried about the chances of a military con frontation in the Middle East between the United States and Russia than by the possibility that the Soviets might get their way in that key area without any confrontation at ‘all. Not that Heath favors a showdown; far from it. But he does insist the West must make plain its intense interest in the Mediterranean, where the U.S.S.R. continues to build its power, and this is a cardinal point of his foreign policy. For this reason the Prime Minister presumably hopes to reassure himself on U.S. intentions and to discuss both the short and long range outlook from Suez to Singapore. The crux of Heath's global outlook for the moment involves the Common Market and the climax of Britain's long campaign to enter it. But, for him, there is no reason why this ex panded “Europe” should not be tied both to sounder trans‐Atlantic rela tionships and also to particular inter national responsibilities in other re gions. From a British viewpoint the Medi terranean, once seen as an imperial lifeline during the days of the Raj in India, remains central. There deep concern about the increasingly solid establishment of a Russian pres ence in Egypt and penetrations in Aden, Somalia and the Sudan. More over, worry is provoked by the activi ties of Soviet submarines and electronic vessels in the Indian Ocean. These factors helped Heath, upon assuming power, to insist that the planned total withdrawal from “east of Suez” contemplated by the Labor Government must be scrapped. A small but active British force will remain available for emergencies between the Persian Gulf ‘and Malaysia. For Heath this determination in no way weakens the resolve to concen trate Britain's principal energies on Western Europe. Indeed, he disputes contentions that a “European policy” means withdrawal from all extra European commitments. He hopes that some day Western Europe as a bloc can even shoulder a “European mis sion” in regions far removed from its own confines. Moreover, the ultimate benefits to Britain's economy of membership in the Common Market would in the interim, it is reckoned, make it easier to maintain London's extra‐European obligations until “Europe” itself is prepared to assume some kind of overseas policy of its own. Finally, such an “east of Suez” contribution, British or “European,” cannot help but be well received in the United States, overburdened as it is with costly world commitments. The hotly debated intention of Heath to sell South Africa arms is, in his mind, directly related to this over‐all design. The Tory argument is that the Western approaches to the Indian Ocean, increasingly infiltrated by the Soviet fleet, must be patrolled as a sensible precaution and the only sure support base is South Africa. Nixon is more likely to sympathize with Heath's Indian Ocean, goal than his South African method. However, the British say they will limit weapons supplied to gain Pretoria's cooperation. They ‘would withhhold arms useful against internal dissenters. against internal dissenters. Of all diplomatic problems not geo graphically contained within Western Europe itself, the one most worrisome is the Middle East. In Heath's opinion this has two aspects. The first is simply that of Western relations with the Arab world and its immense treasure of petroleum on which the Common Market relies heavily for its industrial development. The second is the requirement for permanent Arab‐Israeli. settlement which will terminate the chaos mark ing the past generation. Heath feels that Britain might now perhaps contribute more effective dip lomatic help than in the past. The sudden death of President Nasser en abled the British to get over their “schizophrenia” on Egypt and start the process of building more reason able relationships. POW, the Prime Minister apparently feels, Britain could get into a better position with useful contacts on both disputing sides and could at last begin to put to peace making use its long experience in that part of the world. Such intricate and extensive proj ects, of course, take time. Neverthe less, as Nixon will discover; there is

292-> SPENDING IS CURBED BY U. OF CALIFORNIA
BERKELEY, Calif., Dec. 15‐ The University of California, facing a financial crisis, an nounced today a series of strin gent budgetary measures, in cluding a freeze on hiring. The university's president, Charles J. Hitch, said the econ omy drive had been necessi tated by sharply rising operat ing costs and by the fact that an expected increase in reve nue from a new tuition charge had failed to materialize. Mr. Hitch's guidelines called for an immediate halt in the purchase of certain types of new equipment and a ban on out‐of‐state travel by univer sity officials, with a few ex ceptions. The guidelines took effect immediately and were to re main in force for the rest of the 1970‐71 fiscal year. Mr. Hitch termed the outlook for improving the university's fi nancial position in the next fiscal year “not optimistic.”

293-> Article 3 ‐‐ No Title
PARIS — “No one knows how deep the auto recession will go. I have already had to reduce my plant by not replacing employe turnover, not recuperating holidays. The credit restraint now in force hits the auto industry the hardest. Credit like that would completely shut down the United States market.” Six stories above the Champs Elysées, the Ameri can manager of the Chrysler owned Simca Automobile Company, 60‐year‐old Hany E. Chesebrough, describes how his company increased production and sales by more than 10 per cent last year, and has now run into a slump. “Fortunately,” said the rotund, flinty‐voiced Chrys ler engineer, “the European market has been strong for us. When the credit squeeze came in France, we were able by virtue of Simca distribu tion facilities in Germany, Italy, Belgium and Holland to maintain our sales. “It is only now, for the first time in two years, that we can more than meet all the demand.” As in the United States, most cars here are bought on credit. The terms now are the stiffest ever‐50 per cent down and only 15 months to pay. Simca, the fourth largest auto manufacturer in France, after Renault, Peugeot and Citroen, has been part of the Chrysler empire since the late nineteen ‐ fifties when Americans bought out most of the Italian stockholders. Formed in the nineteen twenties as a distributing company for Fiat cars in France, Simca was owned at the time mainly by Fiat or interests close to the Turin manufacturer. While Chrysler has in creased its ownership to 77 per cent, Fiat still retains 20 per cent of the Simca shares. Fiat officials concede to day that one of their big mistakes was in selling out to Chrysler. Recognizing tha limitations of national fron tiers, the big Italian company bought into Citroen 15 months ago as a means of widening its “European” ac tivities. Simca and the Chrysler owned Rootes Motors, Ltd., of Britain together produce more than half a million cars a year. Simca is the bigger company and probably a Chrysler money‐maker. Mr. Chesebrough said that aside from money put into Simca for equity capital, “Simca has stood on its own two feet” without any financial infu sions from the parent. Chrysler does not report the profitability of its sub sidiaries, but it is likely that Simca has been returning dividends to the parent, while according to British press reports, Rootes, a new er Chrysler investment dat ing from the mid‐nineteen sixties, has not. Chrysler's new president, John J. Riccardo, a 45‐year‐ old accountant recruited by chairman Lynn A. Townsend in 1959, has officially denied rumors that the company in tended to dispose of the 77 per cent interest in Rootes. Mr. Chesebrough said management changes would not affect the operations of Simca. “It is business as us ual in Europe,” he commented after a recent trip to Detroit. Does Simca's American ownership affect its business in France? “In my opinion,” Mr. Chesebrough said, “the av erage Frenchman thinks of this as a French company. Even so, nationalistic factors are of less importance in the Europe of today.” Simca tries to disguise its American links. The com pany, for example, has al tered the practice of making important style changes ev ery year. Europeans are less attached to the notion of instant obsolescence than. Americans. Only 17 of the 30,000 Sim ca employes are American. The president is a French man, Dr. Georges Héreil, the man chiefly responsible for one of the most successful French commercial aircraft ventures, the Caravelle, which has been sold to scores of airlines throughout the world. Dr. Héreil quit Sud Avia tion, builder of the Cara velle, after a dispute over future policy. He wanted to construct large medium range jet airliners, the type American manufacturers are now selling. He was outma neuvered by those who wanted to construct the Con corde supersonic airliner. Simca builds more than 300,000 cars a year at a plant in the Paris suburb of Poissy, and late last year decided to expand output by constructing a second plant at Valenciennes in the north, near Belgium. The new facilities will nearly double output at an estimated cost of $60‐million. The first stage of construc tion, in which $20‐million will be invested, is going ahead despite the present slump in the auto market. Simca is financing it chiefly through French bank loans and retained earnings. Simca has also undertak en to distribute through its dealer network the distinc tive French sports cars made by the Matra Company, a French armaments company with an automotive division that turns out less than 600 cars a year. Matra hopes to use Simca as an opening for sales in the United States.

295-> CAHILL CRITICIZES U.S. FISCAL GOALS
TRENTON, Dec. 23 — Gov. William T. Cahill of New Jer sey, signing into law a $50 million urban‐aid and city tax package for Newark, criticized President Nixon today and at tacked Federal spending priori ties that, he charged, short change the nation's cities. The Republican Governor, a moderate in his party, issued what was regarded here as his sharpest criticism thus far of Mr. Nixon. “The time has come for the President of the United States to redirect the priorities of this country,” he declared in a statement. “The Federal Government can no longer avoid its re sponsibility to the Newarks of this country. Housing, health, education and the myriad prob lems of urban America cannot wait much longer. Newark is a sign of the times—the end re sult of a series of mistakes throughout the years.” Thus Mr. Cahill, who has always supported the President publically, aligned himself with other Republicans, such as Gov ernor Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay, in criticizing the Pres ident's current fiscal priorities, which include such projects as the supersonic jet transport. Mr. Cahill declared that the near bankruptcy of Newark was a warning to “our Pres ident that Newark is a signal of the storms ahead — ap proaching urban storms that can bring our major cities and our sovereign states to financial destruction. The Governor continued: “Newark and all the Newarks of this country desperately need Federal funds to survive. The states can no longer serve the needs of their citizens with out Federal funds.” Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark called the aid and tax package a “great victory for all the citizens of New Jersey.” He said Oat its legislative pas sage last week was the result of the “forthright leadership of the Governor and the leader ship of both houses.” The package includes $33 million in state aid and state authorization for Newark to impose a 1 per cent city sales tax, a 1 per cent tax on business payrolls and a num ber of other, smaller excise taxes. Mr. Gibson said the aid and the taxes were, the only things that stood between Newark and bankruptcy. In reaction to Mayor Thomas J. Whalen's request yesterday that Jersey City be given the same aid package that Newark received, Governor Cahill told a reporter that there was no more money available for state aid. A spokesman for the Legis lature's Republican leadership said there was no sentiment for authorizing new local taxes for Jersey City. The reason for the double rejection, according to in formed sources here, is that Mayor Whelan and 11 other Jersey City officials are under Federal Indictments charging them with extortion of con struction contractors. In addition officials agree that the Democratic political machine that runs Hudson County and Jersey City has no chance of getting assistance from a Republican state admin istration until the charges of corruption that have been leveled at the county by Fed eral authorities are resolved. Perhaps with that in mind, Governor Cahill warned every Mayor in New Jersey today that “those in charge of these cities must use the funds re ceived, prudently, honestly and wisely.” Directing his remarks to Newark's new Mayor, who stood across from the Gover nor at the bill‐signing cere mony this morning, the Gover nor said: “Mayor Gibson, the Gover nor and the New Jersey Legis lature will be watching you and your city. The business communities and the taxpayers of New Jersey will be watch ing you. Indeed the entire state and nation will be watching you and your associates.”

296-> Oil Dealers in City Trying To Cut Backlog of Orders
Fuel oil dealers worked yes terday at reducing the backlog of customers who had run out of oil and predicted a rise in the price of oil because of the cost of the new union con tract that followed a seven day strike that ended Tuesday night. “I've got 40 trucks, anda backlog of 2,400 customers and each of them is saying deliver to me first,” Robert Greenes, president of Public Fuel Serv ice, Inc., of Manhattan de clared. The dealer, who said he was harassed all day by telephone calls from pleading customers, estimated it would take at least a week to return to normal and that snowy, icy weather would mean that some houses would remain cold into, the weekend. On the other hand, Frank Cirillo, a Brooklyn dealer said, “They're crying dry, but only about 50 really were and we took care of them this morn ing.” In interviews, dealers esti mated that the contract ap proved by Local 553 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters would force a price rise of perhaps one‐half cent a gallon in the cost of oil. One dealer said that for an average homeowner paying $400 a year for oil the new rate would add $10 a year to his bill. “Absolutely no question,” Mr. Greenes said of the possible rise. “Oh yes, positively,” Mr. Cirillo said. The contract between 30 com panies and 2,050 drivers and 600 oil burner repairmen pro vides for $40 in wages and $20 in other benefits during the next two years. The City Housing Authority began the day with 48 proj ects and more than 180,000 tenants heatless. This was re duced to 20 projects by midday as trucks made repeated deliveries, and a spokesman said the hope was to have all build ings heated by this morning. A spokeaman for the author ity said deliveries had been Promised during Christmas Day for projects that were nearly Benjamin Altman, Commis sioner of, Rent and Housing Maintenance revised the earlier hope of city officials to have heat fully restored by Christmas. “There's three days work out there,” he said yes terday afternoon “And snowy and icy weather only adds to the delay.” More than 10;000 complaints had been received during the strike at a special city num ber, 233–1600, which was shut off yesterday afternoon. Com plainants were left with the regular, 24‐hour city number, WO 4–3000, which received about 1,200 calls as against 800 on a normal day. Mr. Altman estimated that while union drivers supplied hospitals and other hard‐hit in stitutions, 400 of the scores of thousands of households without heat during the strike suffered severe health prob lems without relief. Mrs. Edith Ginsburg a ten ant in a six‐story apartment building in Coney Island, Brooklyn, said she called the city and said that of a total of 75 tenants, half were elderly, one had a severe heart ailment, two had respiratory troubles and one had a sickly 3‐month old baby. “And no steam since a week ago Tuesday,” Mrs. Ginsburg said, wearing an overcoat in her living room. “They said it wasn't an emergency, and I said: “What do you call an emergency, when people die already?’” One city official said the subject of deliveries to homes with health hardships was not pressed during the strike so as not to upset the contract nego tiations.

297-> Tax on Excess Wages?
In the current hunt for a viable “incomes policy,” the proposal for tax to discourage excess wage in creases has achieved some modest notoriety. On the assumption that the way it works is broadly familiar—to raise the profits tax for firms that grant excessive wage increases — I would like to examine some of its strengths as well as defects. The basic merit of the proposal is that it works through market forces. Other versions of incomes policy, from arm twisting to total freeze, violate market principles. The guidepost tax does not stop a businessman from paying wages beyond some guidepost level. If he needs to do it to attract labor, let him go ahead. If he can't avoid it because of a strike threat, he is free to give in. All that happens is a higher tax. It takes some of the profit out of contributing to inflation. Hence the comment I have heard from technicians, “you could strengthen business resistance to wage increases just as effectively by simply freezing prices,” misses the point. To be sure, if business had its back up against a rigid price wall, it would resist wage demands more strongly. But precisely the control of prices is .what we want to avoid. What the proposal seeks to achieve is to even up bargaining power between business and labor. That point was made force fully by Professor Sidney Weintraub, who independently has been develop ing this line of thought. To even up bargaining power im plies fairness as between business and labor. Although the proposal is asym metrical—tax business in order to re strain labor—I believe it is indeed evenhanded. The comment which equates it to the effects of a price freeze supports the belief that it is not “anti‐labor.” The proposal fits in well with the American revenue system. If this is an “age’ of inflation,” it might remain in force indefinitely. Certainly it is not a quickie device which destabilizes the tax system. Congress has come to object to “yo‐yo” tax devices. The guidepost tax makes sense under very different economic conditions. When I first wrote about it in a column, and testified about it before the Joint Economic Committee in 1966, we were in‐ the early, fine flush of a demand‐pull inflation. Now that we are smarting under cost‐push, the basic argument remains the same. Part of the criticism says that the guidepost tax will make strikes last longer. It has even been suggested that unions, angered by more stubborn employer resistance, might up their demands. Longer strikes, in a few cases, unfortunately are a possibility. Even so, if the tax improves the trade off ,.between unemployment and infla tion, the ensuing reduction in unem ployment should greatly exceed any extra time lost through strikes. I very much doubt that unions will find it to their advantage to strike longer. Wage bargaining does not occur in a vacuum. Both sides know the tax will have to be paid if the wage hike is excessive. That the ulti mate settlement should be higher I regard as contrary to the common sense of bargaining. Negotiating parties start apart and end up together. Each side yields a little as time goes on. An important feature of the guide post tax is that it comes on top of the profits tax. It would not do to make it a tax on excess wages directly. A payroll tax can be added to the price of the product. A profits tax is much harder to “shift.” In simplest terms the reason is that where there is no profit, there is no tax. Setting the wage guideposts is im portant. They will have to take into account the rate of productivity gains,’ over a period of years and for the economy as a whole, not just for one year and for each separate industry. They will have to take account of the going rate of inflation, not fully, but perhaps 50 per cent. It would be un‐ realistic to disregard inflation and set a guidepost of perhaps 3 per cent. To allow for the full rate of inflation, on the other hand, and set a guidepost of, say 8 per cent, would validate 5 per cent inflation indefinitely. The guidepost would come down as inflation comes down. If inflation comes to a complete halt, the guidepost would be equal to the produc tivity gain, as it was when guideposts were first established by President Kennedy's Council of Economic Ad visers under Dr. Walter Heller. The problem of the Heller guidepost was that it did not allow for any part of the inflation. I hold no immutable brief for my own guidepost. It could be varied to allow for more than half of the rate of inflation, if labor objects too stren uously, or for less. The fear that the ceiling will become the floor, and that the smallest wage settlement will be at least equal to the guidepost I find much overdone. If a company really can't pay an in crease, it can't pay. If the union can extract more in a borderline case, it is hard to see why it does not do so anyway. A reasonable formula will have to be found to translate excess wage in creases into penalty taxes. The penalty should be enough to discourage even small violations of the wage guide posts. If—a big If—the guidepost tax is enacted, it will be important not to regard it as the end to all our prob lems. Inflation is deeprooted. From time to time it probably will distort and disturb living standards, income security, and generally act as a pollut ant in our economic ecology. Good fiscal and monetary policies will be needed as they are today. What the tax can do is to‐‐make the policies a little more successful.

298-> Bridge
WHEN the President is carrying out his perennial search for new sources of revenue, he might do worse than consider a tax on bridge conventions. Apart from the obvious budgetary advantage, the benefits to the players would also be consider able. Little‐used conventions could be taxed at a much higher rate than the familiar favorites, such as Blackwood and Stayman, thus reducing the bur den on those who dislike having to meet too many conventions. And anyone who wants to play an arti ficial device of his own invention would have to pay substantially for the privilege, but would not be barred altogether by arbitrary decree. Players who might resent the mod est cost to themselves of this plan would find themselves compensated, in terms of satisfaction, by the auto matic improvement in their own bid ding efficiency. Virtually all players who use conventions at all use them much too often. If they are forced for reasons of economy to cut down on their employment of Blackwood and Stayman they will make better bids and reach better contracts. A case in point is the diagramed deal played in Italy. South would have had no trouble in reaching the obvious contract if he had never heard of the Stayman convention. North made a somewhat eccentric opening bid of two no‐trump, and as it turned out he was right to do so. A game was possible for his side, and an opening one ‐ spade bid would probably have ended the auction. With youthful impetuosity South made a Stayman three‐club bid to find out about North's hand. But he failed to look ahead. When North rebid three spades the problem about whether to play in no‐trump or hearts was left unresolved. South had to guess, and he guessed wrongly by bidding four hearts. He hoped that North would have three‐ card support for hearts, but his hopes were not fulfilled. East could hardly believe his ears when he dis covered that his opponents were about to play game in hearts, and had to resist the temptation to dou ble. He was rightly afraid that a double would scare North‐South into retreating into four no‐trump, a con tract that could have been made by guessing to play East for the spade queen. It did not occur to East that South might make four hearts, but he was due for a surprise. The opening dia mond lead was won with the ace in dummy, and a low spade was led to the jack. When the finesse won South cashed the spade ace and led a club, taking all the available tricks in the black suits. Thanks to East's hesitation before the final pass, South had some clue to the distribution, which at this point was: A spade was led from dummy, and there was no escape for East. He ruffed with the heart seven and was overruffed with the eight. A heart to dummy's ace and another spade lead promoted South's heart ten as the declarer's tenth trick. If East had ruffed high in the dia gramed position it would not have helped him. South would still have been able to make three of the last six tricks. The South player who achieved the feat of making four hearts was an Italian teenage boy named Vaccaro, playing in a junior championship. In another ten years, when he is old enough and wise enough to play for his country internationally, he will know that he should bid three hearts on the South hand in response to two no‐trump. And he will save money on his Stayman tax, too.

299-> Opera: ‘FilleduRegiment’
GIVEN a soprano who can sing the role of Marie— and, even more, convince the audience that she is hav ing a good time singing it Donizetti's “La Fille du Regi ment” can be a lot of fun. And so it was Friday night in Carnegie Hall, when Beverly Sills took over the stage as star of the American Opera Society concert version. In many respects it was puzzling singing that Miss Sills gave us. Sometimes it was firmly produced, clear, exciting. Sometimes it was shrill and off pitch. Uneven is not the word for it. But so great is Miss Sills's charm, so lovely the basic quality of her voice, and so dazzling a technician can she be in cer tain phases of singing, that the evening turned out a tri umph for her. The trouble that she occa sionally gets herself into in volves too much pressure in an attempt to get a big tone. She really does not have to do that, for her voice is well placed. It is a lyric instru ment, and of ravishing beau ty in cantilena passages. The way she sang “Chacun le sait” or the second‐act ro mance, “Il faut partir,” was a sheer joy—and a joy that was communicated to the audience. But in some of her colora tura work her singing was forced. Here again Miss Sills is a puzzling singer. She is exceptionally secure in the area around the octave above middle C, and her trills there are of a golden‐age variety. Marvelous. But around the high A to C region, her pitch is liable to wander and her trills are poorly adjusted. Then, way above the staff, she is again secure. Last night she was throwing high E flats and E's into her inter polated cadenzas, right on target. Lapses or no, it was ex citing and authoritative singing. And there were some amusing characteriza zations from others in the cast. Fernando Corena sang the role of Sulpice, and we all know what a fine basso buffo he is, and how steadily he goes through any part in which he is engaged. Then there was Muriel Greenspon as the Marquise, and that is a story in itself. ?? She is a wonderful come dienne, with perfect timing and great presence, and she made quite a production of the second‐act trio, actually playing the piano for Miss Sills in the lesson scene. Miss Greenspon accompanied very sensitively, too. Her voice is almost a true con tralto, with booming low notes that unfortunately sound detached from the rest of her scale. But she is an artist, with a good sense of style and more than enough voice to make her points. The tenor was Grayson Hirst a handsome, young newcomer with a fresh, at tractive sound up to about an A. In the upper treble his voice thins out consider ably, and he had his troubles in the “pour mon Arne” aria, with its high C's. He made them, but just. The conduc tor was Roland Gagnon, not a very experienced man. More rehearsal time was needed; he made a few mis calculations that might have been avoided had he had more time. Anyway, he con tributed to the lively per formance. It was one of the better nights of the Ameri Opera Society. What is going on In Car negie Hall? The odor of cooking, of hot grease, is filling the premises each night. Fried fish or what ever has a place In society, but the smell does not espe cially consort with Donizetti, or with Mahler last Monday night.

300-> Stram Stars in Film of the Super Bowl
NFL Films, producer of the annual Super Bowl film plus a host of other pro foot ball shows for television and promotional purposes, achieved another first this spring. The coach of the win ning Super Bowl team was wired for sound throughout the game and thus became a focal point of the movie. Hank Stram, the coach of the champion Kansas City Chiefs, emerged as the star of the new Super Bowl film, which will inaugu rate the American Express television series over the Co lumbia Broadcasting System network on May 24. Stram, an ebullient and ar ticulate coach, had a very good time on the sidelines last Jan. 11 when the Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings, 23‐7. When Joe Kapp or the Vikings threw a wobbly pass that was intercepted, Strain said, “Boy, it looked like there was helium in that one.” An assistant coach behind him added, “Yeah, you can't float those balls in our league.” American League fans will love the show Just as did a theater full of Chief adherents at the premiere in Kansas City last Tuesday. • In the film Strain demeans the Vikings (“Kassulke was running around like it was a Chinese fire drill”) and chides the officials (“What kind of officials do you call that? II is good theater. In what may have been a weak moment the forthright Stram gave in to the en treaties of Ed Sabol, the president of NFL Films, and allowed himself to be equipped with a small micro phone under his shirt and a tiny transmitter in his pocket during the most important game of the year. Steve Sabol, the director, has had a lot of success in recent years wiring coaches like Joe Kuharich, Mike Ho lovak, Allie Sherman and Sid Gillman but in unimportant contests. The resulting films gave fans an insight as to what a coach does on the sidelines during games. Mostly he baits officials, ca joles his athletes and dies little. At the premiere Stram seemed overwhelmed at what the Sahols had wrought and how much of a comedian the coach had become in the eyes of the audience. He was subdued if not apologetic and refused to move to the stage for a congratulatory introduc tion. This notable half‐hour film provided more evidence, if further was needed, that pro football is less of a sport than a branch of show busi ness. • Chip Oliver, a capable starting linebacker for the Oakland Raiders, says he has forsaken pro football forever. Oliver has given up his money and worldly goods and joined a commune near Mill Valley in northern California. He is working in a restaurant fea turning organic foods. Oliver, who is 25 years old, said, “Pro football is a silly game. I don't need it any more. It dehumanizes peo ple.” He said he made $50, 000 the last two years from football. “Money was my last hang up. Now that I've got ten rid of it I've never felt better in my life. I quit pro football because I wasn't do ing anything positive toward making this world a better place to live.” John Madden, the coach of the Raiders, is skeptical of Oliver's departure from the game. “I'll believe it when he doesn't show up for training camp,” said Madden. • The American Broadcasting Company has sold all its advertising time for the 13 Monday night games sched uled this season at the high commercial price of $65,000 minute. • The spring meeting of the 26 team owners will begin here on May 25. That evening the annual dinner of the New York Chapter of the Pro Football Writers Association will be held at the Americana Hotel. Awards will go to Joe Kapp and Daryle Lamonica, the most valuable players in the National and American Leagues; to Dan Reeves of the Los Angeles Rams for long and meritorious service; to Gale Sayers for his tour rage in making a comeback from surgery; to Milt Wood rd, the retired president of the A.F.I., and to Stram.

304-> Agnew T Shirts and Watches Yield $25,000 to 2 Charities
WASHINGTON, July 16 (AP) — Vice President Agnew's favorite charities received $25, 000 in donations today as royalties from watches and T shirts bearing caricatures of him. One company that has sold such watches refused to con tribute. In a ceremony in the Vice President's office, checks for $10,000 and $2,500 each were presented to representatives of The National League of Fami lies of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia and the American Indian Self Help Program of Save the Children Foundation, Inc. The donors were the Novelty Watch Company, Inc., of Balti more; the American Time Com pany of Detroit, and Varsity House, Inc., of Columbus, Ohio, the manufacturer of the T shirt. Of these, only the Detroit concern has its product in the market. Mr. Agnew told reporters he was “grateful for the notoriety of my physiognomy.” “This is an unusual occur rence,” he said. “I welcome you to the first public chari table presentation by a house hold word.” Mr. Agnew said that the caricatures on the watches and shirts “are completely in the (realm of propriety” and that he was “pleased to convert this enterprise into good work.” The Novelty Watch Company wristwatch shows Mr. Agnew wearing a red shirt and blue pants with white stars and pointing to the time with fin gers. One of the watches was placed on Mr. Agnew's wrist by Mrs. Karen A. Robinson, president of the company, with the words: “To a good sport for a good cause.” Mrs. Robinson said the watches would sell for $15.95. She said her company had the idea late last year, before the Dirty Time Company of Ana heim, Calif., distributed a simi lar watch. Hale E. Dougherty, owner of the Dirty Time concern, wrote to an attorney for Mr. Agnew that his company would not honor the Vice President's re quest that a share of the prof its be turned over for chari table uses. Mr. Dougherty wrote that compliance with the request “would be a recognition of the right of politicians to control and therefore stifle political comment.” Norman Traeger of Varsity House, manufacturer of the T shirt, which will sell for $1.99 and $2.99 presented the two $2,500 checks. The two watch companies each presented a $10,000 check.

305-> FORD SAYS U.A.W. FEEDS INFLATION
DETROIT, July 16—The Ford Motor Company labeled as in flationary today a demand of the United Automobile Work ers that the union calls a key to halting inflationary wage increases. The charge came as the U.A.W. opened new contract talks with Ford. At issue is an escalator clause in the auto industry's contracts that raises pay as living costs increase. Currently, an auto worker's pay cannot go up more than eight cents a year in pursuit of the rising cost of living. The union wants to remove the ceiling. Were there no such escalator ceiling today, an auto worker would be earning 26 cents an hour more than the current average of $4 an hour. Yesterday, Leonard Wood cock, president of the U.A.W., opened new contract talks with the General Motors Corpora tion by calling full protection against inflation a way to “re turn to sanity” and to avoid damaging wage increases in the future. Today, as he opened the bargaining at Ford, he re peated this view. But after the opening session at Ford, Malcolm Denise, Ford vice president and the company's chief bargainer, said: “It would be our view that it would be inflationary” to lift wages without a limit as the living costs climb. The Ford executive also em phasized to the union what he described as “the threat posed by rising sales of imported cars to the continued growth and health of our auto industry.” Imports now represent one of seven new‐car sales in the United States. “We are at critical point in our history,” Mr. Denise said. As the gap between foreign and American wages “becomes even wider as a result of the upcoming negotiations,” Mr. Denise said, “it will become even more difficult for the do mestic manufacturers to com pete with foreign producers.” Mr. Woodcock, the union president, said the Ford position meant that the union “should be saying we should stand still to protect the jobs of our people.” He said that when the Detroit manufacturers brought out small cars—Ford and G.M. will introduce such cars in Septem ber—they would “win the bat tle against the imports.” At today's negotiations at General Motors, the auto union presented 35 position papers. The papers asked for items such as a dental care plan; a week‐long vacation between Christmas and New Year's Day; a vacation bonus; the elimina tion of time clocks for factory workers, and an end to manda tory overtime work. The union and General Mo tors are speeding up their talks, compared with past bargaining sessions. The union is expected to finish its presentations Mon day. General Motors is sched uled to make its first sugges tions on contract changes (but not an economic offer) next week. The contracts between the U.A.W. and the big auto makers expire midnight, Sept. 14. Be sides the unlimited escalator clause, the major union goals this year include a sizable wage increase and retirement after 30 years' work with a $500 a month pension.

309-> ‘Inquest’: Its Author Speaks For It
T THE Music Box each night near the end of “Inquest,” hot lights flash from the stage, blinding the eyes of the audi ence. Then the lights go dim as Julius Rosenberg is pro nounced dead, electrocuted at Sing Sing on June 19, 1953. A moment later his wife Eth el is electrocuted. The Rosen bergs had been convicted of conspiring to steal atomic se crets for the Soviet Union. The late Albert Einstein said, “From the viewpoint of restoring sanity to our po litical climate, one must not let this case rest.” Donald Freed, who was 21 years old when the Rosenbergs were executed, has brought the case back to haunt us. “In quest,” his first play, takes the view that the Rosenbergs were innocent. * Freed was a child of his time — the Silent Generation of McCarthyism in the Ei senhower Fifties, when the better part of valor seemed to be to keep one's mouth shut. “I was totally unin volved and unaware of the case,” he says. “A few years later I read John Wexley's book, ‘The Judgment of Ju lius and Ethel Rosenberg.’ I was very moved by it. Then I read the trial transcripts, and I would hear the case dis cussed by people who had lived through the period. Meanwhile, as the war in Vietnam went on, I began to realize that the murder of the Rosenbergs was not an aberration but simply part of murderous pattern. “Also, meanwhile, new ideas in the theater were de veloping. In the Artaudian theater of cruelty, the audi ence must be forced to choose. The Weiss‐Ho chhuth thea ter of fact — ‘The Deputy,’ for example — expanded the range of what could be done on stage. So I felt the time had come to write my play, to say something about matt against the state and about violence and justice?’ During the ten years he had been researching and thinking about the play, Freed taught philosophy, lin guistics, anthropology and psychology at various Cali fornia colleges. He calls him self “a premature dropout from the curriculum and dis cipline that is our inheritance from the German university. I chose to specialize in fields I wanted, even if that meant not being able to satisfy the requirements of any one priesthood or department.” He had also spent a couple of years in New York look ing for acting jobs. Then he became director of the Los Angeles Art Theater, where he met and married actress Barboura Morris four years ago. “Inquest” took a year of writing, from the trial trans cripts, plus “reconstruc tions” from letters and docu ments. In a somewhat differ ent version, the play was done at the Cleveland Play House a year ago. What was intended as a few days' run was extended to nine weeks. In Cleveland, where “the po litical temperature is consid erably lower than New York,” the critics did not raise the question of whether Freed was biased on behalf of the Rosenbergs. The Cleveland Plain Dealer urged editorial ly that the case be reconsid ered. But New York critics who made the trek to Cleve land called the play “tenden tious” and wondered wheth er it should have been writ ten instead by “a playwright more interested in drama than propaganda.” * The New York production was rewritten, says Freed, “to give the government more space.” The reviews 10 days ago ranged from Barnes's ... a powerful piece of theater” to Richard Watts's “... carefully loaded to em phasize the innocence of the convicted pair.” Hear Freed on the charge of “bias.” “One of the rea sons the American theater is in such serious trouble is that our tradition confuses com mitment with propaganda and demands on the stage, and on the campus, a kind of crackpot objectivity which is nothing but the veriest fail ure of nerve and intellect. This is what the rebellions on the campuses are about, because young people and black people consider the con cept of not making a com mitment to be on the level of a war crime. “Good theater, good teach ing, good learning involve good opinions, commitments and biases. They also involve being disinterested enough to rise above the immediate con sequences of one's commit ment, to set it in the widest possible context and deepen its meaning. “What is shocking to Broadway critics and college presidents is the passion that infuses the ideas of some of their teachers and students and playwrights, producers, and directors. They are frightened by this passion. It reminds them that behind the cool tone we tried to adopt during the Cold War, in or del...to live through the hys teria of McCarthyism, was the cult of objectivity. This was brought to a pitch here in New York, which set the tone for the rest of the country intellectually. And it is pre cisely in the Cold War intel lectual and liberal that one sees this inhuman objectivity — to allow ‘the other side’ to be heard, long after ‘the oth 'er side’ has laid its entire weight on the man in the street and the life of a cul ture. “When a critic says my play is biased, that even though it's from the tran script, it's selected, I say, ‘Yes, but what I really left out were the more flagrant actions and words of the pro secution, because they would look too melodramatic’ This endless squawking that the theater of fact is not alto gether factual because of the choice of facts — in what way is this new? Playwrights have always tried to reflect life, but they've always had to be selective and always tried to take the illustrative moments they felt were in the service of truth. If facts are not in the service of truth, then there is dishon esty. ‘Inherit the Wind’ took the position that it was cor rect to want to teach evolu tion and this was called good theater, because the critics didn't have guilty conscienc es. Our only fear in New York was that we wouldn't be able to get by those critics who, no matter what their political persuasion, are real ly committed to the Fifties. “A play, like any other cultural event, can help in either deepening or eroding the regnant myths of any so ciety. In what way, in 1970, is it biased, when the scan dal of the Rosenberg case has been laid open for so long, to aver that the state—when it is frightened enough—has been, is now and will be in the future capable of ritual murder, suppression, death camps and genocide? That's the lesson of the 20th cen tury.” * Would Freed hold the same view if, say, someone like William Buckley wrote the play taking the position that the Rosenbergs were guilty? “But that play has already been written!” said Freed. “It was written by Irving Saypol and Roy Cohn at the behest of J. Edgar Hoover. It was a laugh riot. Another hit team wrote ‘The Gulf of Ton kin’ and ‘The Black Panther Will Get You if You Don't Watch Out.’ And there's the play called Why Don't They Take a Bath? ‘The Body Count’ is a wonderful com edy of the absurd where the numbers are toted up on a piece of paper. There is also that wild satire by Sidney Hook and other liberal hu manists who have told us to use the democratic process, that if a majority wants Dow Chemical off the campus, it will be off the campus. That is, until the majority does then are told, as they were at UCLA last year, that a refer endum, if taken, would not be binding. “There is the story of The Outside Agitator,’ that great continuing adventure series which began with the Pal mer raids. Occasionally you have a new star like the wife of Attorney General Mitch ell. But otherwise the reper tory company are your old favorites, your Richard Nix ons and your other men of the Fifties. To the question about writing a play from the other side, the answer is that Buckley would be con victed of plagiarism. The gov ernment has already done it.” * Times change and some people change with them. Freed is a slim six‐footer with a conservative haircdt, but the former non‐activist now wears a large button with the slogan “All Power to the People” and a picture of Huey Newton, the imprisoned Black Panther leader. Last October, the Los Angeles po lice swooped down in middle of‐the‐night raids and arrest ed Freed and Shirley Suther land, wife of actor Donald Sutherland, who stars in “M*A*S*11” as the screwy military surgeon. Freed was charged with possession of hand grenades and Mrs. Suth erland with conspiracy to possess. Both had been active in a white group formed by Freed, “Friends of the Black Panthers,” to raise money to support the Panther program of hot breakfasts for ghetto children and to promote black‐white dialogue. “It's really dangerous in the minds of some people for blacks and whites to get to gether. The existence of our group helped destroy the myth that the Panthers hate whites. An agent provocateur joined the Friends and he left the hand grenades at my apartment.” Freed and Mrs. Sutherland faced possible 10‐ year sentences, but the charges have now been dis missed. Instead, 10 members of the Los Angeles Police Department may be indicted in connection with the case on a list of charges involv ing stolen evidence, entrap ment, breaking and entering. Freed says. “Huey New ton, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver are the Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs of today. Now we can read letters of the Rosenbergs, hear their words and see them as sym pathetic people but in the Fifties they were considered slimy Jewish communists like the bad niggers of today. What we have to prevent is a play being written 20 years from now that will cause au diences to say, ‘Do you mean they really fed breakfasts to poor children and that they were sensitive, extraordinary human beings? We thought they were something out of the American nightmare, coming to the suburbs to our daughters.’ “Bobby Seale must not go to the electric chair in Con necticut. This country cannot take again what we went through in the Fifties. The men running the war in Viet nam are men from that time. In the purges of those years we lost the leaders and young people we might have had in the Sixties and Seventies. History won't give us a sec ond chance.” * Prehistory may be Freed's next step. He wants to spend next year with a troupe of university actors improvising a play without words about a two‐million‐year‐old race of primitive men who had nei ther language nor fire. The theme will be violence and survival.

311-> Beau: ‘Am I Happy Enough? Am I Sad Enough?’
HOLLYWOOD. NLIKE his slightly old er contemporaries, Dustin Hoffman and Richard Benjamin, Beau Bridges might well have become a movie star in the days when movie stars were molded out of blond hair and dimples, instead of born out of dissonance and alienation. He has the sweet awkward ness of a young Jimmy Stew art that would have served him well a dozen years ago. The surprising thing is that he may become a major mov ie star in this already tense and anxious decade. On screen he has a sincerity that humanized small roles as a young soldier unwilling to get involved in “The Incident” and as the harmlessly hippie son in “For Love of Ivy.” Although his formal training was limited to a couple of years in the UCLA Theater Arts Department and a few classes at Theater West, the critics have almost unani mously praised his comic performance as the innocent cub reporter in “Gaily, Gaily.” Coming up shortly are “Adam's Woman,” an Aus tralian adventure story, and “The Landlord,” in which he stars as a rich white boy who buys an apartment house in a black slum. The enviableness of his sit uation is, to him at least, more apparent than real. Hav ing one foot in each of two worlds is to be perfectly bal anced in neither. At 28, Beau Bridges questions “the depth of my own feelings. Am I hap py enough when I'm happy? Am I sad enough when I'm sad? My way of hiding is to be very easy in social sit uations.” Unconsciously, he illustrates his last statement with an ingratiating soft shoe dance. “There's someone in every high school class like Beau,” says an acquaintance. “He's the good athlete who gets B's and is popular with the girls but not a stud. Even if he has any intellectual inclinations, he moves away from them because intellectual in clinations are not popular. Beau's the all‐American boy, but he's the all‐American boy in Hollywood so he supports peace marches and doesn't beat up homosexuals the way his midwestern counterpart does.” Bridges would wince at that appraisal but would probably not argue with it. He remembers high school (where he lettered in both baseball and basketball) as being “the most comfortable time, a very happy time would have liked to stay there.” At 28, he can still successfully play a 19‐year‐ old boy. He lacks rich ness and fullness, and he knows it. He describes him self as “frustrated” and fan tasizes becoming a high school basketball coach. “I know it's just a fantasy now, but I could do it. I really could.” (It is not quite all fantasy. He spent his three months in Australia last year seeking out and helping to coach a schoolboy basket ball team.) Beau, who had a brief, un spectacular fling on Broad way in 1966 in William Inge's “Where's Daddy?,” likes acting but thinks it might be “kind of a bore to do the same thing all your life.” Perhaps he values it less because he inherited ra ther than chose it. “Of all the things I could get into, acting seemed the easiest because had dad to help me. And dad always seemed to be having a good time acting.” Beau's sole memory of his brief childhood career as an actor—in films directed by friends of his father, Lloyd Bridges—is of watching his screen mother in “Zamba” accidentally fall from a tree Into the midst of six lions. For the rest, his childhood was baseball and basketball and a series of jumps upward from the little house in the valley to the first Cadillac. The Cadillac, and Lloyd Bridges's success in the TV series “Sea Hunt,” didn't come until Beau's junior year in high school. “It took me years to ad just to that Cadillac, to being known as someone's son. It only got easy when I started making some of my own private victories.” But Lloyd Bridges's success had come late enough so that it did not drain the energies of his son. “My father gave me a car when I was 19‐ a new convertible. And it was too much. When you get things too easily, you don't value them enough.” Beau Bridges values certain things very much, but the only material possession he prizes is his house on the beach. The house is raw wood and burnt brick, all yellow and orange tile lapped by sun reflected from the water. Ile loves it in an almost spir itual way. Silting in the sun‐drenched living room in white tennis shorts and an Australian rugby shirt, his hare feet melted into the thick orange rug, he tries to put the things he values into words—but the words are not quite com plex enough for the thoughts. “I'm happy if the people around me are happy. Being ir father sure puts you through a lot. It's a whole other responsibility. Casey's mine. He's someone to love.” Beau drinks half a bottle of organic apple juice and stares at the ocean. “Sister Mary Corita wrote, ‘To be lieve in God is to die and not be embarrassed.’ That's what I want out of life.” After five years of mar riage, Beau Bridges is still waiting hopefully for a child of his own. The baby whom he gently disentangles from the telephone cord is an adopted one—Casey, who is half‐Negro, half‐white. Bridges shrugs and smiles an uncon sciously winning smile. “The most honest answer I can give is that it was something we felt like doing. But it's no big deal, you know. We love him very much.” In his new film, “The Christian Licorice Store,” Bridges plays a winning ten nis pro who collides with the commercialism inherent in being a hero. The director, James Frawley, chose Beau because “he has a kind of ease, a charm that is nec essary for a winner and a star. In this role Beau is al lowing the cockiness that is inside him to come out.” Frawley notwithstanding, any cockiness inside Beau Bridges is buried so deep it would have to be dredged out. The charm is always there — even when he least wants it to be—but there is no trace of arrogance. He leans forward anx iously, his long, straight, blond hair falling into his eyes. “If it ever gets to the point where everybody knows who I am, I don't know if can handle it.” He already needs what he calls “escape periods.” He gets into his 1963 Jaguar and drives whichever way the car is headed. He drove once to the ocean 300 miles north of Los Angeles, once to the Arizona desert over 500 miles away. Safe inside his two‐bedroom beach house, he still fears an encroaching world. “It would be weird, really weird, if there were no place where you could go to be alone.” He is in the movies but not of them. He sees, at most, a dozen‐and‐a‐half films a year and his favorite movie is one from his childhood, “The Lit tle Kidnappers.” Each Tues day night he plays basketball with “a group of guys I went to Venice High School with.” Basketball, not movies, is his passion. If he were able to change one thing about him self, “it would be a toss‐up between making myself 6 feet 5 inches tall and giving my self a chin.” Despite the ad vantages of a chin for a movie actor, he would un doubtedly choose the height. At 5 feet 10 inches, he has the finely tuned body and crisp coordination of a suc cessful basketball player, but his lack of height forced him to the bleachers after his year on the UCLA freshman team (he dropped out of col lege after his sophomore year). He “swims, surfs and dances a lot.” The dancing is never at the big Beverly Hills discotheques but at nameless little places in Malibu and Santa Monica. “We're isolat ed,” he says, almost proud ly. “We” includes Julie, his pretty, 26‐year‐old wife. Six years ago he bolted to Hawaii “in order to avoid get ting married,” stayed there six months, and proposed on the day he returned. Julie has the look of American Dresden; she is dainty but not breakable in an abstractly flowered blouse. Around her neck she wears a gold peace symbol tiny enough to fit a child. Aware of the fragility of actors' marriages, she shudders. “This business scares me. So I travel with Beau lot.” Beau finishes his organic apple juice and opens a bottle of guava juice. He is on the first day of a week‐long fast. For the past three years he has sporadically lived a week at a time on fruit juices. For the last year he has been a vegetarian. Neither decision was planned. “In New York last year we went out to dinner. Somehow meat looked too heavy, so I passed it. The same thing happened the next night. I used to love rare steaks. If I ever feel like eating them again, I will.” Nor was the decision an ascetic one. He “loves food” and reminisces about his wife's “mulligan chowder with peppers, onions and po tatoes,” and her “noodle cas serole with broccoli and cheese.” It is more likely a facet of the introspection that is gripping him for the first time in his life. “I'm so aware of time pas sing now. Time affects me very much. I sometimes won der if it affects me more than most people.” And a little la ter, “I'm trying to get my self together, trying to sort myself out.” “He's going through kind of a weird time,” Julie says. “I guess he enjoys his work but he'd like to go back, fin ish school, and some day maybe become a basketball coach.” The odds are against it of course. In recent memory only Dolores Hart, the prom ising young actress who be came a nun, has left — by choice—the heady success that Beau Bridges inhabits. It might be nice—for Casey and Julie and Beau Bridges— if the odds were wrong.

313-> Wood, Field and Stream
In America, the blue mus sel flourishes in neglect. Ranging from the Arctic Ocean to South Carolina, this abundant and tasty bivalve is largely ignored. In France, tor example, the blue mussel is considered a delicacy and artificial beds of them are cultivated. Blue mussels are certainly one of the easiest of the shellfish to gather and may be found clustered on rocks and pil ings at low tide along almost any stretch of Eastern sea coast. It is difficult to understand this resistance to the mus sel, which is a sweet and wholesome thing, amenable to almost any form of cook ery. An old wives tale along the New England seaboard warns one not to gather mus sels that are exposed at low tide. This is really not valid, for most of those so exposed are not harmed. What may happen occasionally is that some mussels occupy a fringe area where they have water for just enough time to sus tain life. The seasonal shift of tides could destroy this balance. Also, of course, very cold weather could result in exposed mussels being frozen to death. The extent of the mussel's lack of appeal to most Amer icans was demonstrated re cently off New Hampshire's coast, where authorities sought to destroy large colonies of them that were encroaching on the beds of soft‐shelled clams. At first, a machine was devised that prowled the flats at low tide, taking the mussels in at one end and spewing them out the other in bits and pieces. This proved impractical and the canny Granite Staters eventually smothered them with sand from a nearby dredging operation. When gathering mussels, those that are not tightly closed or are resting unat tached should be avoided. Mussels anchor themselves to one another and to home base with a network of black threads, known as the bys sus, more commonly called the “beard.” In some areas, concentra tions of certain dinoflagel lates, microscopic marine plants, provide food for the mussels, but also may make them dangerous to man. In California, for example, peo ple are barred from gather ing shellfish when dinoflagel lates are present in great numbers. However, experts appear to agree that little danger exists from the New Hampshire seacoast to the Carolinas. Mussels should be thorough ly scrubbed when preparing them for cooking. They may be steamed open and dipped in butter and their flavor is more delicate than that of the soft‐shelled or steamer clam. If the aforementioned “beard” troubles you, pull it off; if it doesn't, go ahead and eat it. Steamed mussels may also be chopped up and mixed with scrambled eggs, using them as you would mushrooms. Another recipe calls for steaming 50 or 60 large mus sels in a pot with a cup of white wine. These may then be dipped in melted butter, to which garlic and lemon juice have been added.

314-> KIRK SAYS ‘CLUB’ TOOK IN $420,000
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Feb. 17 —Claude R. Kirk Jr. disclosed this week that state contrac tors, political appointees and friends had contributed more than $200,000 in dues to his “Governor's Club” in the last 22 months. The club, which finances many of Governor Kirk's ac tivities and pays part of his living expenses, received $220, 000 more from other sources, Mr. Kirk said. All but $1,800 of the total of $420,000 has been spent, he said. The Governor released limited details on the club after a State Supreme Court justice ruled that a committee of the State Legislature could subpoena the club's records. The committee plans hearings next month. Governor Kirk, who has taken tours of the United States and Europe since be coming Florida's first Republi can Governor in 100 years in January of 1969, organized the club in April of 1968, setting “dues” at $500 a year. Some businessmen have said privately that they paid money into the club to maintain good relations with the Governor lest their state contracts be jeopar dized. “Obviously, some members do business with the state,” Governor Kirk said. “Most have done business for years.” But, he said, the donations bought no favors. Although the Governor did not say who gave what, the list of contributors included highway contractors, painting contractors, automobile deal ers, truckers, bankers and law yers. The Governor said there were 219 members of his club. The $420,000 fund is ex pected to be an issue in Mr. Kirk's re‐election campaign this year. William Murfin, the former State Republican Chairman, is resigning from the Small Busi ness Administration to return to Florida to manage the cam paign of Jack M. Eckerd of St. Petersburg. Mr. Eckerd, the owner of a chain of drug stores, may furnish the main opposi tion to Mr. Kirk in the primary. In his report on the club's finances, Governor Kirk said receipts were: membership dues, $201,323, speaking en gagements, contributions and honorariums, $148,346, expense refunds, $2,029, and loans, $69, 000. He said expenditures were travel, meals and lodging, $147; 406; jet airplane expenses, $140 933; promotion of the state $76,059; office expense, $17, 060; salaries and payroll taxes $15,718; a voter survey, $5, 650; interest on loans, $4,811; equipment rental, $3,088; furni ture and equipment, $2,824 convention lodging, $4,473, and miscellaneous, $858. In addition to a salary of $36,000 a year, the state this year is furnishing Governor Kirk a contingency fund of $13,000 and a living allowance of $158,656 to operate the Governor's Mansion.

315-> Sociology Racing Ahead
Sociologists, in the estima tion of Neil J. Smelser, so ciologist of the University of California at Berkeley, are “the psychoanalysts of the sixties — without the mys tique.” In a tumultuous era, they are diagnosing a pressing array of perplexities and dis orders—from the problems of new nations to the riots of decaying cities. But there is little con sensus about the destination of the discipline, and Dr. Smelser may be closest to the mark when he states: “Sociology is going in dif ferent directions all at once.” According to the sociology panel of the Behavioral and Social Sciences (BASS), which Dr. Smelser served as chairman, the discipline is progressing along several paths. Findings indicate continu ing emphasis on methods of research and quantitative analytis and new or renewed emphasis on: comparative studies of societies, particu larly dynamic new nations; demography, spurred on by increasing concern about population growth; social stratification—“how the good things of life are distributed by society”; complex organi zations, political, economic, military and educational and others that dominate much of American life; socialization, or “how an individual learns to take account of the social order and cope with it,” and the study of deviance, or how and why some individuals fail to cope with the social order. The last is one of the old est concerns of sociology, once centered on criminals, prostitutes and alcoholics. But currently, according to the BASS report, sociology is turning its attention to new forms of collective deviance — middle‐class drug‐using groups, hippie cults, protest movements and urban riots. A number of sociologists, among them Daniel Bell, formerly of Columbia and now of Harvard, also see movement away froin micro sociological examination of minute slices of life, toward large‐scale concerns. At the broadest level, some sociologists, including Irving L. Horowitz of Rutgers, editor in chief of Trans‐Action magazine, see sociology re examining its basic philo sophical foundations and moving away from theories and models of spbiety that assume stability and con sensus” toward a new soci ology with social conflict at its core. Some other practitioners say sociology is doing noth ing so Much as ‐heading'back where it started from, to an emphasis on social philoso phy and social work. In this general atmosphere, growing numbers of sociolo gists are being summoned to take time out from academic work to advise government and other institutions on social problems. Nevertheless, the ranks of sociologists manning the lec ture halls and serninar rooms are swelling. Membership in the predomi nantly academic American Sociological Association has tripled to more than 13,000 since 1955. At Princeton, the nuniher of undergraduate so ciology majors has increased more than sevenfold in five years, from 21 to 150. And sociologists at Har vard, partly in response to overflowing courses, voted recently to split off from the university's department of social relations (which in cludes clinical psychology, social psychology and social anthropology) and establish a separate sociology, depart ment. Throughout the country, Peter H. Rossi of Johns Hop‐. kins University estimates, en rollments have “doubled and tripled in sociology depart ments in the last five years.” By some reckoning, this growth of interest and pres tige, both academic and other wise, should have infused American sociology with a confident sense of purpose and direction. Instead, this amorphous discipline—which concerns it self with the roles that indi viduals play in relation to one another —is experiencing an identity crisis of sorts over just what role sociologists themselves should play. Historically, they have played several. The first Americans to call themselves sociologists were social philosophers who found inspiration abroad in the works of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer and Emile Durkheim; or they were a curious American amalgam of both. Heading the home‐grown movement was a quartet of theorists: ¶At Yale, William Graham Sumner, an ordained minister who preached that social change was an organic process largely beyond the control of man. ¶At Brown, Lester Ward, who disagreed, and stressed the power of man to con sciously shape their social environments, mainly through government. ¶At Columbia, Franklin Giddings, who saw the “herd habits” of like‐minded indi viduals as the basis of social customs and institutions. ¶At Chicago, Albion Small, who started the world's first independent academic depart ment of sociology at the uni versity in 1892, and who stressed social development through the interaction of competing interests. Though all four were gen eralists who tended to re gard sociology as an almost boundless study of social phenomena, specialties quick ly developed — demography, criminology, social ecology, social psychology, and so on. In the branching‐off proc ess, sociology became more empirical, less philosophical. Today one of its principal tools is the sample survey, used to try to measure group actions and attitudes, such as doctors' attitudes toward Medicare before and after the Federal health‐care pro gram went into effect. Since World War II, soci ology, like other social sci ences, has been increasingly preoccupied with measure ment and quantitative analy sis—a movement meant to make it more “scientific.” Investigations have tended to focus on ever‐narrower, and more measurable, areas, such as a recent project that ex amined in minute detail “The Validity of Census Data on Bilingualism in a Puerto Rican Neighborhood.” The latest generation of sociologists tends to be ac tivist, stirred by demands for “relevance” and impatient with the role of the rigorous scientist. “We'd like to do away with the obsession with methods rather than problems,” says Richard Flacks, a founder of the Students for a Democra tic Society and, at 31, an associate professor of soci ology at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Many activists came to so ciology with the idea of em ploying its insights to solve what they feel are the urgent and morally demanding prob lems of race relations, crime, urban tensions and interna tional conflict. “They want to use sociol ogy to improve society,” says Marvin Bressler, chairman of the department of sociology at Princeton, who feels that activism is one of the main explanations for the large in crease in enrollments. Super‐activists are less concerned about where soci ologists probe than for whom they do the probing. They think sociologists should stay out of government projects because this seduces them into applying their knowledge to shoring up existing insti tutions. They even challenge the “objectivity” of contempo rary sociology in general and virtually accuse all nonradi cal sociologists of supporting the “power structure.” The introduction of a new text by John Howard of Rut gers University and Steven E. Deutch of the University of Oregon, entitled “Where It's At, Radical Perspectives in Sociology,” proclaims, for ex ample: “The social scientist who refuses to take sides opts by default for the status quo . . . Radical sociology is the sociology of engage ment.” Dr. Rossi, the secretary of the A.S.A., says the radicals are “keeping sociology de partments around the coun try in a constant state of ferment.” The ferment, which includes organizing and participating in campus political protests, underscores a debate over whether an objective sociol ogy is desirable, or even pos sible. Seymour Lipset of Harvard says, “If you give up the effort for objectivity, then any man's opinion counts.” Amid the turmoil, some outsiders hold the opinion that it would be just as well If sociology and sociologists vanished altogether. “Sociology is contributing to making us polyp‐like peo ple, like lumps In seaweed,” says the poet Reed Whitte more, a professor of English at the University of Mary land. “When I walk down the street, I like to think of myself as flesh and blood, not a sociological entity.”

317-> New Haven Panther Trial Opens
NEW HAVEN, June 16—The first trial in what is expected to be a drawn‐out series of trials of Black Panthers started quiet ly here today with an unusual assurance from the prosecutor that he had no intention of seeking the death penalty for defendant. Lonnie McLucas. Mr. McLucas is the first of eight Panthers—including the party chairman, Bobby G. Seale —who are expected to stand trial here in connection with the death last year of a party mem ber named Alex Rackley. The seven other defendants could be tried separately or together after a verdict in the McLucas case, which is expected to last most of the summer. State's Attorney Arnold Markle offered the assurance about the death penalty after the defense counsel objected to a ruling by Judge Harold M. Mulvey that death was the max imum penalty on the most seri ous of four charges against Mr. McLucas, a charge of kidnap ping resulting in death. The de fense counsel had contended that the law was unclear on penalties and therefore “void for vagueness.” Across the street from the courthouse, on the New Haven Green, a small group of white and black youths demonstrated for less than an hour with hand painted signs demanding that Mr. McLucas be freed. The local Black Panther chap ter has been handing out broad sheets charging the state with seeking “to legally assassinate Lonnie McLucas” as part of “a fascist frame‐up” of Mr. Seale, who is accused of ordering Mr. Rackley's execution. The prosecutor's assurance appeared to be intended, in part, as an answer to the Panther charges. Evidence in the McLucas case could have a decisive effect on the subsequent prosecution. Mr. McLucas is alleged to have been one of three Panthers who drove Mr. Rackley to a boggy riverbed at Middlefield, 25 miles north of here, where he was killed on May 21, 1969. The two others, George Sams and Warren Kimbro, have al ready pleaded guilty to second‐ degree murder, although neither has yet received the life sen tence that is mandatory on that charge in Connecticut. Sams told the police that Mr. Seale had passed on allegations that Mr. Rackley was an in former and had given to word to “off the pig”—kill him. The McLucas trial will be closely watched to see if Mr. Kimbro corroborates or refutes the testimony against Mr. Seale. Other testimony is expected to come from Mr. Seale and Huey P. Newton, the Black Panthers' founder and Minister of Defense, whose 1968 man slaughter conviction was over turned on May 29 by the Cali fornia Court of Appeals. Unless that ruling is reversed, Mr. Newton is expected to be released from the California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo by the end of July. Mr. McLukas's lawyer, Theodore I. Koskoff of Bridgeport, included Mr. Newton's name on a list of likely defense witnesses, which he read in court this morning. The small courtroom, which has only 29 seats in the spec tators' gallery and 18 for the press, was unadorned except for the American flag, the Con necticut flag and a clock that had stopped at 9 o'clock. Shades were drawn over the recently installed bullet‐proof windows, and all spectators were searched before entering. Mr. McLucas, who is 24, sat in a swivel chair at the defense table, attired in a blue double breasted suit, a grey and blue striped tie and a white shirt. During legal arguments the strong features of his face ap peared impassive but later when his lawyer started to question prospective jurors, he some times cupped his hand over his mouth to hide a smile. It will be considered a small miracle if the selection of 16 jurors—including four alter nates—is completed by the end of the week. Last week Judge Mulvey rejected “without preju dice” a defense motion contend ing that adverse publicity had made it impossible for any Panther to receive a fair trial in Connecticut. He said the mo tion could be lodged again if the selection of the jury bogged down. The first prospective juror, Mrs. Helen Roman of Ansonia, was excused by Judge Mulvey after she said she believed “there must be some truth to the charges.” The second person to take the stand was a black woman, one of four blacks on the first panel of 60 prospective jurors. The prosecutor, Mr. Markle, seemed eager to seat her, thereby averting the potential embarrassment of an all‐white jury. His questions were brief and perfunctory. Mr. Kosoff, by contrast, ap peared disconcerted by the as sertions of the woman, Mrs. Alice Blandshaw of New Haven. She said she had never taken any interest in the Black Panthers and she could not identify Huey Newton or El drige Cleaver, the Panthers' Information Minister, who has fled the country. When it came out that the prospective juror's son‐in‐law was a prison guard, Mr. McLucas emphatically shook his head and indicated ex asperation. After much consultation be tween the defendant and his lawyer, Mrs. Blandshaw became the first juror to be seated. One other juror, Nicholas J. Coscia, an electrician from Waterbury, was seated during the day. The decision to try Mr. Mc Lucas alone has been related to statements he is understood to have made to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Haven police after his arrest in Salt Lake City on June 6, 1969. If he had been tried with the others, the prosecu tion would probably have been barred from introducing these statements as evidence on the ground that they might have prejudiced the case against any co‐defendants. Mr. McLucas, who has been held in the Litchfield State Cor rectional Center for more than a year, never sought bail, ap parently because his lawyers wanted to avoid the introduc tion of those statements at bail hearing. But numerous defense motions have been filed, challenging the indictment and other aspects of the case. Judge Mulvey took strong exception today to the pro priety of Mr. Markle's assur ance that no death sentence would be requested in the case, warning him that he was invad ing an area of discretion he shared with the jury and the presiding judge. In addition to the charge of kidnapping resulting in death, Mr. McLucas is accused of con spiracy to commit murder, con spiracy to kidnap and the bind ing of the victim. He also has been indicted on charges of first‐degree murder in Middlesex County where the crime took place. The defendant — who is characterized as quiet but in tensely loyal to the Panthers— joined the party in Jersey City, where he had been living with a sister moving from Wade, N. C. Later he was co‐founder of a Panther chapter in Bridge port, the first in Connecticut. Today in Washington Justice William J. Brennan Jr. became the second member of the Su preme Court in two days to re fuse to hear a challenge to the special security rules laid down by the Superior Court here for the Panther trials. These include a ban on cam eras and sound equipment in the courthouse, demonstrations within 500 feet of the building while the court is in session, or interviews with newsmen by any defendants or their lawyers. Justice John M. Harlan refused yesterday to intervene in the case.

318-> KOBAYASHI RETAINS WORLD BOXING TITLE
TOKYO, Aug. 23 (UPI)—Hiroshi Kobayashi of Japan, world junior lightweight cham pion, retained his World Boxing Association title tonight by scoring a unanimous 15‐round decision over Antonio Amaya of Panama. The victory was the 59th against eight defeats and four draws for Kobayashi, while Amaya, who also lost a title bout with Kobayashi in April, 1969, had his won‐lost record drop to 34‐4 with two draws. Kobayashi also became the first Japanese champion to defend his title successfully five times. At the end, the Japanese was bleeding from cuts over his left eye and the side of his head, and his face was puffy from the constant battering of Amaya's left jab. Nick Pope, the referee, scored it 72‐71 and the judges, Yusaku Yoshida and Takeo Ugo, 72‐69 and 73‐71 respectively. Kobayashi weighed 128¼ pounds to Amaya's 129½.

321-> STAR TO RECEIVE $125,000 SALARY
Rick Barry, who has spent more time in court than on the court the last three years, was traded to the New York Nets yesterday by the Virginia Squires for a No. 1 draft choice and an undisclosed amount of cash. The Nets, who finished fourth in the Eastern Division of the American Basketball Associa tion last season, picked up the contract Barry had originally signed with the Oakland Oaks of the A.B.A. and which in turn was picked up by Earl Foreman, the owner of the Squires, formerly the Washington Capi tols, formerly the Oaks. “We are willing to take the risks to bring Rick to New York,” said Lou Carnesecca, the general manager and coach of the Nets, alluding to the legal complications that developed when Barry jumped from the National Basketball Association to the A.B.A. in 1967. A star with the San Francisco Warriors, Barry jumped to the Oakland Oaks of the A.B.A. in a celebrated case that forced him to sit out a season in order to complete the transfer. He played with the Oaks the following year and helped them to win the championship. When the Oakland franchise was switched to Washington, Barry had a change of heart and decided he should have stayed in San Francisco. He signed a five‐year, $1‐million pact with the N.B.A. club, but a court injunction has pro hibited him from making the move until after the 1971–72 season. An appeal of that in junction is still to be heard. As the situation stands now, Barry is expected to complete his contract with the Nets, which calls for one year of play plus one‐year option, and then return to the Warriors in 1972. For his services in New York, he will receive $125,000 a year. Barry, who said he would honor any contract the courts ruled legal, said he was shocked to hear Foreman had traded him. Foreman, a Washington lawyer, indicated earlier that he had no intention of trading his star player, even though Barry had expressed extreme displeasure over playing in Virginia. “I having nothing against the South,” Barry explained, “but I like to be around big cities. My heart was set on playing in San Francisco, but New York is the next best place.” Barry, who is 26 years old and was graduated from the University of Miami in 1965, was named rookie of the year in the N.B.A. and won the league scoring championship the next season with an aver age of 35.6 points a game.

322-> ART GROUP LOSING WESTCHESTER HOME
WHITE PLAINS, July 15— For nearly a decade, the West chester Art Society has held classes and exhibitions for its 700 members in a converted sweatshop on the third floor above a General Electric repair store here. But the society now must find new headquarters by the end of the summer or face se vere losses or possible dissolu tion, according to Fred Sheri dan, the group's founder and treasurer. The society was notified last month that its lease at 35 West Post Road would not be re newed after Aug. 31. This city is now in the second decade of a massive urban renewal program, and much of its low rent, potential loft space has been torn down or converted. The group has been offered an acre of land in Harrison by Maury P. Medwick, a sculptor, and had tentatively chosen an architect to design a perma nent building. “We expected to sit out our term here until we could ac complish that,” Mr. Sheridan said in the brightly lit gallery the other day. In the past, the society has sponsored an active calendar of exhibitions of painting, sculp ture, graphics, photography and crafts, including annual open membership shows and juried exhibitions. There have also been invitational shows of works by Marc Chagall, Joan Mir& Milton Avery and other artists. The society has supplied vol unteer teachers for prisoners: at the county penitentiary and has held exhibitions of prison er's art, as well as special shows for county school chil dren. The members, who include, professional and amateur ar tists, have monthly meetings, lectures by artists, critics, and New York gallery owners, and weekly life sketch and painting classes in the gallery. “This is a group of working artists who grow through their contact with each other,” said Mr. Sheridan, a Vienna‐born pharmaceutical manufacturer and amateur painter. “We've been able to bring art here that people could once get only in New York. A county like this must be able to support the arts.” The society is an outgrowth of the county‐sponsored West chester Arts and Craft Guild. Artists had objected to the county's administration of that organization. During the 1950's, Mr. Sheridan said, members of the art juries were required to sign loyalty oaths. In 1961, he and several other members broke away to form the first countywide art society support ed entirely by the membership. Dues are now $15 a year and the society's yearly expenses come to about $15,000.

326-> Priest in Massachusetts Is Opposed as Politician
NEWTON, Mass, June 15— At the Massachusetts Demo cratic Convention last weekend a woman approached the Rev. Robert F. Drinan and told him she could not vote for him be cause he was a priest and be longed in a parish, not in pol itics. Father Drinan, a 49‐year‐old Jesuit priest, is an author, a legal scholar, dean of the Boston College Law School—and a can didate in the Sept. 15 Demo cratic primary for a seat in the House of Representatives. The seat is held by Philip J. Tthilbin, now 72, who has been in Congress for 27 years. In his best pastoral manner, the priest told the woman that Protestant clergymen had been serving in Congress for almost 200 years. And he asked her whether she, as a Roman Cath olic, wanted to exclude clergy men of her faith from politics while permitting Protestants to take part. She said she would have to think about it. But Father Drinan had clearly scored a debating point. He will have to score many during the next three months if he is to beat Mr. Philbin, a white‐haired New Deal liberal who serves as vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Representative Philbin is a hawk. Father Drinan calls him “an unthinking rubber stamp” for the committee's conserva tive chairman, Representative L. Mendel Rivers, Democrat of South Carolina. Father Drinan is a witty, out spoken dove who was chosen to oppose Mr. Philbin by a cau cus of antiwar Democrats. The caucus included people from all parts of the district, which stretches from Newton and Weston in Boston's affluent western suburbs to Winchen don, 50 miles away on the New Hampshire border. For the caucus members— such people as Jerome Gross man, the envelope manu facturer who provided a major share of the financing for the Vietnam Moratorium — war versus peace is the paramount issue. The same is true, no doubt, for, others in the dis trict. But for many middle and lower class Catholics, especial ly in the western part of the district, the key question is the propriety of a priest running for Congress. No priest has ever been elected to the House although the Rev. Gabriel Richard was appointed a dele gate in 1822 from what was then the Michigan Territory. A poll taken for The Boston Globe by the Becker Research Corporation in April gave Mr. Philbin 40 per cent of the vote, with 21 per cent for Father Drinan, 8 per cent for a third candidate, State Representative Charles Ghanian, and 31 per cent undecided. For a neophyte running against a well‐established in cumbent, those figures are not discouraging. But the Globe survey also indicated that 30 per cent of the respondents considered it improper for a priest to run. It is not impossible to gauge whether those who take that view would be anti‐Drinan in any case. He said in an inter view they “use it as a cover for their conservatism.” But even the antiwar Jews and Protestants who crowded into the Auburndale Congrega tional Church in Newton on Sunday night to hear Father Drinan showed some apprehen sion, asking repeated questions about abortion, birth control and the priesthood. He explained his generally lib eral views on each subject, called for immediate withdraw al from Southeast Asia, and hammered away at “emergence of death” in the armaments industry. Mr. Philbin, who lives in rural Clinton, has not cam paigned extensively, but he is clearly vulnerable. Reappor tionment in 1967 added urban voters to his district, and in 1968 he won the primary with only 49.9 percent of the vote in a four‐way race. But, says Father Drinan's campaign manager, John Mart tila, “Philbin obviously has lots of credit cards out after 27 years.” Mr. Marttila, who is from Detroit, worked for the Republican National Committee until he quit last March in dis gust at the Nixon ad ministration. Mr. Marttila has enlisted hun dreds of local Democrats and students in an attempt to can vass all the district's 80,000 Democrats (75 per cent are Catholic) and 100,000 inde pendents (independents can, but generally do not, vote in party primaries in Massachusetts). Having identified potential Drinan supporters, he hopes to get them to the polls Sept. 15. “When Kent State hap pened,” said Anne Marie Gog gin, 21, a June graduate of Regis College in Weston, “it told some kids that the system was so ugly that the only answer was violence. “It told me and a lot of my friends that the forces of the status quo were strong and ruthless enough to put down any opposition, and that will mean only the senseless loss of more lives. To us, people like Father Drinan seem the only way.”

327-> Kadar's Lenient Brand of Communism Permits Hungarians to Poke Fun at the System
BUDAPEST, July 11 — At 8:30 P.M. last Monday all over, downtown Budapest the sound, of laughter was competing with the clatter of the yellow streetcars and the rumble of the big, fume ‐ trailing city buses. The laughter came from open windows, from cars and from uncounted pedestriansi clutching transistor radios. All Budapest, it seemed, was lis tening to one of the country's most popular programs, a po litical satire aired every four weeks that is an example of the Hungarians' freedom to poke mild fun at life under social ism. The program and three po litical cabarets playing perm anently in the city are among the reasons why Western ob servers describe the Govern ment of Janos Kadar, leader of the Communist party, as&#X0020; most liberal in the Soviet bloc. The right to poke fun is part of the Hungarian sys tem as long as it does not go so far as to offend the Rus sians. The program's two main characters, played by dramatic actors, are husband and wife. She is on the gullible side and opens almost all her state ments with “I read In the newspaper today.” He is for ever pointing out that the newspapers should be taken with a grain of salt even, or especially, in the best of Com munist worlds. What had the listeners laughing particularly hard the other evening was this: The wife had read that gas oline was going to be scarce this summer and suggested that they buy a few barrels to be sure they had enough for their vacation drive to Czech oslovakia. Her husband com mented: “What do you thinks we are going to drive to Prague — a tank?” Nikita S. Khrushchev, in Budapest shortly before his downfall, pinned the term “gou lash communism” on the Hun garians. Hungarian Communists do not like the description even though it was meant as a com pliment. They prefer the words of Mr.1 Kadar, who declared eight years ago that “those who are not against us are for us” and set the regime on its present con ciliatory course. A high party official said Mr. Kadar's phrase meant the ac knowledgement of a common goal for all citizens and an obligation for the regime to im prove the quality of life for all. “But Kadar never promised un trammeled freedom to the in tellectuals or to anybody else,” the official added. “The basic Communist concepts of party supremacy and precedence of collective interests remain in tact.” A Western diplomat put it differently. Mr. Kadar and the Hungarian people, he said, have concluded a kind of contract in which both sides vow not to repeat the traumatic experience of 1956, when a Hungarian at tempt to break out of the Com munist bloc was crushed by Soviet tanks. The result, the diplomat said, is an elaborate balancing act by Mr. Kadar, who is trying to reconcile internal and external needs, and the Hungarians, who display an attitude of self restraint amounting to self censorship. In the 14 years since Mr. Kadar came to power after the abor tive Budapest uprising, he has gradually provided the politi cal system with a number of important safety valves: ¶Last year a million Hunga rians in a population of 10 million were able to travel abroad, though most went to other Eastern European coun tries. According to official figures, three million tourists came to Hungary, including half a million from the West. ¶The secret police, once all powerful, has been reined in. “The fear is gone,” a Western ambassador said, adding that surveillance was discreet al though unfailingly effective and “much more sophisticated.” ¶There is a wide range of relatively free if cautious pub lic debate. The most popular television program is a forum on which officials answer questions as they are called in by anyone who cares to pick up the telephone. ¶Books, plays and poems in great variety are being published. Film ‐ makers say they have considerable free dom, and journalists engage in debate in the newspaper col umns. ¶The central feature of the “Liberalism” is far ‐ reaching economic reform, which, under the forbidding name of New Economic Mechanism, Is bring ing the beginnings of a con sumer society to Communist Hungary. The reform has given exten sive freedom of decision to in dividual factory managers and reduced the central plan, once sacred, to a nonbinding guide line. Workers and managers, especially the latter, share in the profits of their enterprise. The program of economic liberalization is going far be yond the cautious decentrali zation in the Soviet economy and is often likened in bold ness and scope to the economic reforms advanced in Czecho slovakia under Alexander Dub cek. The foremost reason for Moscow's tolerance, it is felt, is that Mr. Kadar has been demonstratively faithful to the Soviet Union on all foreign policy issues. Hungary, a small country, has no foreign policy of her own. A Western visitor who asked his taxi driver to take him to the Foreign Ministry the other day was driven to the Foreign Trade Ministry. The driver explained that all the other foreigners at the ho tel always wanted to go there. Furthermore, the Russians have no reason to doubt that under Mr. Kadar the Commu nist party will remain in con trol. His Government is re garded as one of the most solid in Eastern Europe. Finally, it is believed, the Russians are conscious of the fact that the economic re forms and the political safety valves are supported with re markable unanimity by all leading Hungarian officials. There are no rival factions that could be played against one another, Western observ ers say. For all those reasons, they believe, Mr. Kadar has unusual freedom of maneuver. “We have the most realistic regime now that Hungary has had in many decades,” a Com munist said proudly. “Realis tic” is one of the most fre quently used words here; others are “reasonable” and “balanced.” “We have an instinctive knowledge of where the limits of freedom lie,” another Hun garian said. “Self‐restraint” is also a recurrent theme. A leading party ideologist described the tense, sometimes acrimonious debate in the Hungarian Writers Union the other day when it was decided that a novel about Stalinist prison camps by Jozsef Len gyel, a long‐time Hungarian Communist, could not be pub lished without changes. The officials who opposed publication — and won the day — argued that the book, re flecting the author's personal experiences, was so bitter and hate‐filled as to be fundamen tally distorted. Mr. Lengyel refused to change his manuscript or to withdraw his application for publication. But he has not been pressing his demand, pre sumably awaiting another day when the risks for the gov ernment will be smaller. The incident illustrates the Kadar Government's method of operation — “caution, compro mises, ability to avoid confron tations,” as a Hungarian puts it. “As long as the Russians are not able to solve their Solzhe nitsyn case, it is clear that we cannot bring out our own Sol zhenitsyn,” he added, referring to the Soviet writer who has been banned from publishing in the Soviet Union.

328-> Washington‐Moscow‐Peking
The return of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Kuznetsov to Peking last week suggests that the recessed Sino‐Soviet negotiations will resume soon, perhaps today. This renewed effort to ease tensions between the two Communist giants comes after two other noteworthy contributions toward a better inter national atmosphere: the successful preliminary Soviet American Strategic Arms Limitations Talks in Hel sinki and the resumption of official Chinese‐American diplomatic contacts in Warsaw. Taken together, these events suggest a remarkable thaw has begun in the Washington‐Moscow‐Peking triangle. The temperature has not risen equally in all three of the bilateral relationships involved—Washing ton‐Moscow, Washington‐Peking and Moscow‐Peking but some ice has melted everywhere. And these beginnings have been made in the face of continued fighting in Vietnam, sharp Soviet‐American differences over the Middle East, and persistent Chinese fears of a Soviet military attack. Foreign observers can only speculate—with uncer tain accuracy—about the motives behind the Soviet and Chinese contributions to the present atmosphere. With respect to Washington, however, it is plain that the Nixon Administration has embarked upon a policy of trying to improve relations with both Moscow and Peking. Implicit in that decision is a course of neutral ity in the basic Soviet‐Chinese conflict. This point is central because Peking and Moscow have so often asserted the contrary. A major thesis in the Chinese propaganda barrage against the Soviet Union this past decade has been the claim that there was a secret Soviet‐American alliance to dominate the world and to force all other countries—particularly China—into a position of permanent subordination. Moscow's riposte to these charges has been the equally ridiculous assertion of a secret Washington‐Peking understanding, allegedly aimed at facilitating Ameri can “aggression in Vietnam” as well as other belliger ent activities. Fantastic as Peking's talk of a “Soviet‐American alliance” always was and still is, it continues to feed on the clear fact that the United States treats the Soviet Union far more favorably than it does Commu nist China. Thus there are no special barriers to Amer ican travel in the Soviet Union, and the existing re strictions on Soviet‐American trade remain far less onerous than are the recently eased limitations on Chinese‐American commerce. Greater progress toward equally good relations and eventually even equal friendship with the Soviet Union and Communist China might be more speedily achieved by extending to Peking as many as possible of the privileges Moscow now enjoys. The goal would be establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Communist China, admission of Peking to the United Nations, and Chinese‐American exchanges of scholars, journalists, businessmen and tourists at least at the levels that now exist between he United States and the Soviet Union.

329-> SENATE REFUSES TO HALT DEBATE ON DIRECT VOTING
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17— The proposal for direct popular election of the President was dealt a serious and probably fatal blow today when the Sen ate refused to shut off debate on the issue. The vote was 54 to 36 in fa vor of a motion for closure but this was six votes short of the required two‐thirds majority. Thus the opponents of the di rect election plan retained the right to continue the debate and prevent even preliminary votes. Senate leaders tentatively agreed to give supporters of the direct election plan a second chance to close off debate next week, but the prospects for rounding up the necessary votes did not look very favor able. Senator Birch Bayh, Demo crat of Indiana, chief sponsor of the electoral plan, said that he believed six of the 10 Sena tors who were absent today would vote for closure. This would produce a 60‐to‐36 vote still four votes short of two thirds. Looks for Compromise Senator Bayh indicated that he was open to compromise on both procedure and substance in an effort to attract more support for his cause. This could include promising more extensive debate to those who thought 10 days of discussion was inadequate and abandoning the runoff provisions of the plan for something more widely acceptable. Although the vote did not doom electoral change by amendment to the Constitution in the current Congress, it went a long way in that direction. Unless Senator Bayh and his allies can win a closure vote, opponents of the direct election plan can by a single objection continue to block any agree ment to schedule a vote. If the second closure vote next week, tentatively sche duled for Wednesday, also fails, Senator Mike Mansfield of Mon tana, the majority leader, will have no choice but to put the issue aside in favor of the mass of legislation still awaiting ac tion before adjournment. If Congress fails to complete its work, by mid‐October and re cesses until after the election instead of adjourning, the direct election amendment could be brought up again in November or December, but it would still need the same two‐thirds vote to prevent a new filibuster. Even if the opposition per mitted direct election to come to a vote on its merits, it would also require, as a constitutional amendment, a two‐thirds major ity. Senator Mansfield said in the debate today that forcing a closure vote on a constitutional amendment and thus requiring a two‐thirds majority test “abuses the clear purpose and interest of the Senate rules.” The 36 Senators who refused to end debate today were evenly divided politically 18 Democrats and 18 Repub licans. It was almost entirely a coalition of Southerners and Conservatives from small states who had protested that abolish ing the Electoral College would reduce their states political in fluence. Under the Bayh amendment the electoral vote by states would be eliminated and the Presidential candidate who re ceived the highest total of popu lar votes wherever cast, would be elected. If no candidate got 40 per cent, there would be runoff between the two leading vote getters. That runoff provision is one of the most controversial in the amendment, largely because there are no provisions at all as to its operation. Its elimina tion, in favor of a more com plicated but less hazy system using electoral votes and then a joint session of Congress to resolve elections with less than a 40 per cent plurality, would probably increase the popular ity of the Bayh plan. The League of Women Vot ers, one of the national organ izations behind the direct elec tion plan, described itself as “dismayed” by the Senate's re fusal, to shut off debate. “Today, when everyone is talking about voter apathy,” said Mrs. Lucy Wilson Benson. the league president, “a small group of Senators has effec tively blocked a measure that reaffirms the power and value, of every individual's vote.” President Nixon endorsed the direct election plan after it passed the House, 339 to 70, almost a year ago, but he has not made any personal appeals to Republican Senators to back it, as he has done in connection with other legislation.

330-> New Palomar Telescope
PALOMAR MOUNTAIN, Calif., July 16 (AP)—A one‐ ton mirror, the optical heart of the first telescope to be added at the mile‐high Mount Palo mar Observatory in 22 years, is being installed this week and should be operational by next Monday. The precisely ground slab of fused quartz, 11 inches thick and 61 inches in diameter, ar rived here Tuesday after a five‐hour truck trip from the California Institute of Tech nology in Pasadena, where technicians spent three years grinding it. Dan Netto, a Caltech engineer ing designer, said the mirror would be housed in a $300,000 dome about a half mile west of the 200‐inch Hale telescope, the world's largest. Although dwarfed by the Hale telescope the new tele scope will have some advant ages of its own, observatory officials said. It is expected to be effective for photometric ob servations, which do not re qure the great light‐gathering ability of the larger telescope.

332-> U.S. Switches to a Debtor Status With Foreign Banks
The United States ‘switched from a creditor” to a debtor status in its dealings with for eign central banks during the last six months, the Federal Reserve System reported yes terday. Charles A. Coombs, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and manager of the GovernL ment's transactions in the in ternational money markets; said that foreign governments had completely repaid their borrowings under the recipro cal credit arrangements (or “swap lines”) that the Reserve System has with its counter parts abroad. On the other hand Mr. Coombs stated in his official, semiannual report on Treasury and Federal Reserve foreign exchange operations, the Unit ed States “found it necessary to make repeated drawings on its swap lines with the Swiss National Bank, the National Bank of Belgium and the Neth erlands Bank.” On Sept. 10, the report stat ed, the Federal Reserve owed $220‐million to the Netherlands Bank and $95‐million to the National Bank of Belgium. The analysis—which, though signed by Mr. Coombs person ally, has the status of an offi cial Government report—at tributed the change in the American position to two basic factors: !Shifts in the international flow of funds in response to differential credit conditions; and, secondly; ¶The Move into deficit of the United States international bal ance of paprients On official account. In particular major commer cial bakk in the united States have greatly, reduced their bor rowings in the Eurodollar mar ket (the market for dollars on deposit in banks labroad) in the last six months, and as this has happened dollars have begun to pile up on the books of foreign central banks—in some cases more than those banks wanted to hold. Over all, however. Mr. Coombs’ report characterized trading in the foreign exchanges over the last six months as “quiet and orderly.” notwith standing the brief interruption caused by the Canadian Gov ernment's decision to allow its currency to float freely in the world money market. In his report, Mr. Coombs listed several. European coun tries that had made substantial repayments of previous draw ings on the United. States. “More than Slbillion of Bank of England debts to the Federal Reserve and the. Unit ed States Treasury were almost fully repaid by the end of June,” the report stated, “and since then the Bank of England has had no further recourse to United States credit facilities.” The Bank of France paid back $200million to the Trea sury, Mr. Coombs said, while the Bank of Italy repaid an $800‐ million drawing on the Feder al Reserve (which it had used to finance heavy reserve losses in January and February), “partially by substituting me dium‐term financing through the Eurodollar market.” On the United States side the Federal Reserve's drawing of $145‐million in Swiss francs that was outstanding at the beginning of the year “could not be reversed through mar ket transactions, as the usual seasonal weakening of the Swiss franc during the early months of the year failed to materialize. “Accordingly.” the report said, “the Swiss National Bank agreed to sell, in a direct trans action with the Federal Re serve, the Swiss francs re quired to clean up the bal ance.” Later, in May, the Federal Re serve made a new $200‐million drawing of Swiss francs, which was repaid through a combin ation of market transactions ($30‐million), sale of gold by the Treasury to the Swiss ($50‐ million) and another direct sale of Swiss francs to the Federal Reserve ($120‐million). Mr. Coombs said that the need for the United States to deal directly with the Swiss National Bank to settle these swap drawings was a reflec tion, at least in part, of the fact that Switzerland is not a member of the International Monetary Fund. Drawings on the LM.F have often been used in the past by other countries to pay off swap credits. Casting his eye over the world scene, Mr. Coombs ob served philosophically that “the very prevalance of inflationary trends, both here and abroad, left the exchange markets in something of a quandary as to which currencies might eventu ally fare better or worse.” Over‐all, he minimized the danger of a new world money crisis. The new special draw ing rights in the I.M.F. — “SDR's” in financial jargon had had something of a calm ing effect in the markets, and had helped persuade specula tors that an increase in the official United States price of $35 per ounce of gold had been “ruled out.” The increase in the value of the German mark and the drop in the French franc had brought currencies into much better line with each other, Mr. coomos said, adding that he saw no need for “similar surgery” on the dollar. In any event he concluded, the United States had ample resources available to defend it's currency.

333-> Nevada Prison Odds High
CARSON CITY, Nev., Feb. 21 (UPI)—If one was arrested on a narcotics charge in Nevada last year, the odds were at least 65 to 1 that he did not go to the state prison. A survey showed that, of 2,000 adults arrested in 1969 on narcotics or drug abuse charges, only 160 were convicted in Nevada, and only 30 of them ended up with prison terms.

335-> Job Training Policy Questioned In Light of Unemployment Rise
WASHINGTON, March 24— The Nixon Administraticn was urged today to reconsider spending plans for job training programs because of rising un employment. Senator Gaylord Nelson, Democrat of Wisconsin, ques tioned the policy of committing money for job training when there might not be jobs for the trainees. He particularly called on President Nixon to cut back on the job opportunities in the business sector program oper ated by the National Alliance of Businessmen. That program is highly thought of by Admin istration officials and this year became the Federal Govern ment's prime job training ve hicle. The Senator, who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Em ployment, Manpower and Pov erty of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, made the request to Secretary of La bor George P. Shultz. It came after the Secretary issued a report estimating that nearly one million additional workers would be unemployed if the jobless rate reached 4.7 per cent. The rate was 4.2 per cent last month, highest since 1965. Senator Nelson's subcom mittee resumes hearings on various manpower proposals tomorrow. He had asked Mr. Shultz for a report on the im pact of higher unemployment. The Secretary said that if the jobless rate rose from 3.7 to 4.7 per cent, the number of unemployed would increase from three million to 3.9 mil lion. Under the Administra tion's plan to cool the economy, the jobless rate was expected by Administration officials to go up to an average of about 4.3 per cent in 1970, which meant it would rise as high as 4.7 per cent in some months. “These projections of rising unemployment seem to call for reconsideration of Administra tion budget proposals,” Senator Nelson said. Citing the projection that un employment among black youths would rise from 22.9 to 26.2 per cent, the Senator said: “I don't think we can stand by and watch the unemploy ment rate for black teenagers soar to more than 25 per cent, for example, and continue to budget hundreds of millions of dollars for programs which seem to offer little help in meeting this very serious prob lem.” President Nixon asked for $3.2‐billion for manpower pro grams in the fiscal year 1971 with $375‐million budgeted for the jobs program. In addition to reallocating the $300‐million scheduled to be spent on the jobs program during 1970, Sen ator Nelson proposed that a significant portion of the $375‐ million for 1971 be used in stead to meet rising unemploy ment problems, especially among the young. “Even if unemployment were not rising alarmingly, it seems doubtful that the Labor Depart ment could effectively commit the vast sums it has earmarked for the jobs program,” the Sen ator said. He noted that some com panies participating in the pro gram, including the Chrysler Corporation, have begun can celing or reducing their parti cipation because of unemploy ment problems. According to Secretary Schultz's report, a 4.7 per cent jobless rate would have two vital effects: it would nearly double the adult black male rate while the white male rate would rise by more than half, and it would mean longer dura tions of unemployment. The black adult male unem ployment rate would go from 3.9 to 7 per cent and the white adult male rate would increase from 2.2 to 3.5 per cent. The report said an increase of the jobless rate to 4.7 per cent would mean that “the in crease in the average duration of the spells of unemployment would be considerably greater than the increase in the number of such spells.” “At the 3.7 per cent level of unemployment,” the report said, “the duration of the average spell of unemployment would be about 5.4 weeks.” At 4.7 per cent, the average would rise to 6.5 weeks. Mr. Shultz also said that at 4.7 per cent blue collar jobs would be affected mostly, about 600,000, with from one‐half to three‐fourths of the increase occurring in the 20 largest metropolitan areas. In a related move President Nixon reportedly told construc tion union leaders in a private session at the White House yesterday that “there is going to be a lot of work in 1970” as a result of his lifting the freeze last week on $1.2‐billion in Federal funds for state and local construction proiects. Some union leaders ex pressed hope the move would help ease unemployment in the building trades, estimated to be over 500,000 persons. However, organized labor's chief econo mist, Nathaniel Goldfinger, questioned whether the Presi cent's action would be enough. declaring It only “one small step in the right direction.”

336-> The One‐Room School: It Is Going but Not Gone
SPARKS, Neb., Sept. 1— Vernon L. Brill is 38 years old and a part‐time garage mechanic, campground oper ator and insurance salesman. He is also part of a Much revered but dying American institution — the one‐room schoolhouse. As the lone teacher in this tiny town's school, which be gan fall classes today, he is responsible for the basic edu cation of the children in School District 71, a remote 48‐square‐mile area here in northern Nebraska. On school days when howling blizzards don't block the dirt roads, he drives 23 miles to this crumbling crossroads community (Pop. 3) to in struct 15 children in kinder garten through the eighth grade. For this, Mr. Brill, who is working on his bache lor's degree in education at Chadron State College, re ceives $6,000 a year and an occasional meal at a pupil's home. He, is among 42 such teachers in Cherry County and less than 2,000 others in similar schools across the country. They are the remnants of the nation's first educational institution, an institution that taught the three R's to mil lions of Americans from George Washington to Chet Huntley, with Abraham Lin coln, Bat Masterson, Thomas Edison and Herbert Hoover in between. Until the mid‐1800's the one‐room school taught the majority of Americans. But, like many aspects of a sim pler America, it is vanishing. In 1966 a Federal survey found 6,491 such schools in the nation, 1,413 of them in Nebraska, which has the most. By 1968, the latest year for which nationwide figures are available, only 4,146 were left, with 1,033 of them here. And Washington officials estimate that the decline has quickened. Faced with decreasing and older farm populations, rising costs and greater educational demands, thousands of smaller school districts across the country have merged in recent years, some after long, bitter feuds. Larger schools, their pro ponents say, will offer chil dren a better education and preparation for college, preparation they want but which their parents never had. “Those one‐rooms are pdin in the neck,” said Mel vin Olson, a state education official in Lincoln. “They just don't provide the best education.” As a result, the state's one‐ room schools have been whittled down to 744, with about 125 closing each year. But, at least for the moment, Sparks has avoided that fate. So its 15 students, tanned from their summer's work, jumped from their parents’ cars and trucks about A.M. today and scrambled into the three‐year‐old school building—the district's third since 1885 and the first with an inside toilet. There they helped Mr. Brill adjust desks to their new heights. After the Pledge of Allegiance the books, which come from a county library in Valentine 20 miles south west, were distributed amid much whispering and gig gling. Mr. Brill, in his 12th year of teaching, asked the older children to note what they wanted to improve in their handwriting this year. While the eighth graders —Shirley Bruecklander and Rose Ann Foster—dashed off a few sentences, Mr. Brill helped the five second grad ers practice printing letters. Fred Copeland and Billy Foster, the kindergartners, played in the corner on the floor. Then Mr. Brill read the responses (“I'm not going to slant letters every which way”) while the youngsters practiced at the blackboard. “I probably don't explain as much to the whole class as in other schools,” Mr. Brill told a visitor, “but more than make up‐for it in individual instruction.” He teaches arithmetic, reading, spelling, English, science and social studies. There are two recesses, and 30 minutes for lunch brought from home. At 3:30 today after clean ing up the school, the children, who come from six families, all piled out the door and went home to help with the evening chores. There are 180 school days. The children will be off at Thanksgiving and Christmas and, if it's an average winter, maybe five days when school and the roads are buried in eight‐foot snowdrifts. Classes end in mid‐May and next year Shirley and Rose Ann will attend the 880‐student high school in Valentine, the county seat. “I think our kids get everything in school that others get,” said Lawrence E. Turner, the local board president, “except maybe all the competition and social life, but they'll get that soon enough.” “We like having our chil dren at school close to home,” added Mrs. Martha Foster, who has three boys at the school. “We have more local control over their education this way and they get practically individual tu toring.” It is also less expensive. Area landowners pay a 15‐ mill school tax levy — that is, $15 for every $1,000 of assessed valuation. In Valen tine, the area's largest town, they pay 72 mills. The Sparks school was founded in 1885 by a hardy band of homesteaders (in: eluding the Sparks brothers, Eldon, James, Charles and Levi) whose great‐grandchil dren now run much of the corn land and cattle ranches sprawling across the sandy range where electricity ar rived only 21 years ago. Here, the far‐away prob lems of desegregation and de centralization seem unreal. More important is the weath er forecast—given at the be ginning, not the end, of each local newscast — and the fact that most boys now for sake the farm for the city. It is a friendly area where a 3,000‐acre ranch is not un usual, where the farm family is dependent only on itself and where the nearest neighbor is several miles down your driveway, several miles along the unpaved road and several miles up his drive way. It is a place, in short, where independence is prized greatly and threats to it are fought fiercely. And so the Sparks area, whose 38 landowners decide most school issues, has re sisted any consolidation attempt, including an abor tive one‐year trial with neighboring district three years ago. That ended in a bitter dis pute that saw old family feuds resurface and several ranchers secede from the school district. But independence has its problems. The total annual school budget has climbed from last year's $7,176.49 to $8,240. Teachers, a mobile group, are increasingly hard to find and keep here. “It's just not feasible any more to train any one person to teach so many subjects in that many grades,” says Mr. Olson in Lincoln. Mr. Turner of the Sparks board adds: “If they're trained in the big city, they don't come back to the coun try.” But even so, Mr. Turner says, next spring he may go to a big city himself, but only to look for a country teacher.

338-> CUP SOCCER FANS WORRY OFFICIALS
MEXICO CITY, June 9 (AP) —International soccer officials are beginning to express serious concern about the destructive behavior of fans during the cur rent world championship. Four murders—by fire and by stabbing — have been at tributed to arguments over the World Cup games in Mexico. Fans have broken into one of Mexico's major jewelry shops, stolen a 12‐foot soccer ball from the top of a hotel marquee and several hundred have been ar rested for stealing flags or for rowdy behavior. A survey by the daily news paper La Prensa among the country's leading psychologists showed most of them believed the wild jubilation at team vic tories was caused by “wrongly based nationalism . . .childish ness . . . and Latin tempera ment.” Dr. Luis Hero Leeb said that comments by players, coaches and journalists contributed to a climate “similar to war.” “We will end up like the Az tecs . . . with 50,000 victims sacrificed at Huitsilopochitli— the Aztec God of War,” Leeb added. Millions of Mexicans took to the streets Sunady night after their team trounced El Savador, 4‐0. Mexican newspapers reported that a British team manager was “livid with rage” in Gua dalajara because horn‐honking, trumpet ‐ blaring and samba dancing Brazilian fans celebrat ed their victory, last Sunday over the British near the hotels where the English players were trying to sleep.

339-> Economy Will Feel G.E. Woe
In many ways the strike against the General Electric Company has had less effect on the public than any other major strike in years. The average person in most major cities has been virtually unaffected to date. However, in Schenectady, Syra cuse and Utica, N. Y.; Pittsfield and Lynn, Mass.; and Louisville, Ky.; where G.E. is a major employer, just the op posite has been true. There, G.E. is a way of life. It is employer, and when it isn't working, employes hive no money. G.E's the nation's fourth largest employer outside of the Federal Government, and when it is idle, it hurts directly as many as 150,000 workers. However, the after‐effects of the strike will be felt elsewhere in months to come in power outages, blackouts, shortages of certain appliances and in product reliability. Donald C. Cook, president of the American Electric Power Company, ex plained the outlook in a recent talk before the New York Society of Security Analysts. In answer to a question on the effects of the G.E. strike on his own operations, he replied: “It is quite apparent that the length of this strike has been such that it inevitably is going to have a consider able effect upon the electric utility in dustry. This is almost axiomatic since there are only two producers in the United States of the very heavy, high voltage apparatus across the whole spectrum. Here I have in mind partic ularly circuit breakers. “If one of these producers is shut down for any considerable period, it necessarily means that there are a lot of products that will not get manu factured on time, will not get delivered on time and, therefore, will not get constructed on time,” he added. While it is difficult to estimate the precise effect on power demands, it is equally obvious that at least regional shortages may be expected. The New York‐New Jersey metropolitan area seems to be a prime target. The Consolidated Edison Company had eight jet turbine orders with G. E. with a total capacity of 130,000 kilo watts due for operation by June 1. The utility now feels it may get four of them by June 15 if G. E. production is picked up immediately. The big ques tion is what is the real effect of time lost during the strike: does one day lost in strike equal one day lost in pro duction once resumed? In order to cover its potential prob lem, Con Edison switched orders to Westinghouse and expects to pick up 96,000 kilowatts in the latter half of summe from them. Going into the future, the local utility exepcted to have 154,000 kilowatts of gas turbines on barges in the summer of 1971. This is now an “iffy” situation, as is joint own ership of two fossil‐fueled generating stations with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., and the Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation. The General Public Utilities Corpora tion changed its expansion plans in a hurry to help ward off such problems. It announced on Jan. 22 that it would begin immediately to erect about 400, 000 kilowatts of gas turbine generating capacity in order to have some of this capacity available for the summer of 1971. In line with this action, it also canceled plans for the first of two 400,000‐k.w. oil‐fired generating units at Union Beach, N. J., and canceled indefinitely construction of the second unit. The Westinghouse Electric Corpora tion announced last Wednesday that its backlog at the end of 1969 was 14 per cent higher than at the end of 1968 and was “particularly high” in power‐systems equipment and products sup plied to industry. While Westinghouse offi cials declined to estimate what percentage of the in crease could be traced to do the G.E. strike, observers felt that it represented a good portion of the gain. In the heavy appliance field, the strike may have proved to be something of a blessing in helping work off heavy stocks of certain items. G.E.'s giant Appliance Park just outside Louisville, Ky., has been able to ship out certain items almost daily, but company spokesmen acknowledge that individual healers may not be able to supply large appliances in the specific models or colors that customers might want. They asknowledge that there has been a strong inventory of the larger size TV re ceivers, but the small por table color sets built at Portsmouth, Va., have been in somewhat short supply. Fortunately for the company, this is a non‐union plant and production has continued uninterrupted except for company lay‐offs to get sup plies in line with demand. The room air‐conditioner supply has been strong, and undoubtedly has been worked off somewhat. It now is a question of how great will be the demand and how soon can production of new mod els get going again. These sets are usually built in September and October, and have already been put into the distribution pipelines. It is also impossible to determine how many work ers have been forced off their jobs because of breakdowns in the supply lines from G.E. The Carrier Corporation of Syracuse, N. Y., said it had to lay off some 350 employes because of a shortage of com pressor motors. Likewise, the Tecumseh Products Com pany of Tecumseh, Mich., was forced to lay off 300 for ‐the same reason. The com pany manufactures compres sors and could not get the motors from G.E. The list goes on and on, so it's im possible to fix the total un employment figure or dollar effects. G.E. itself laid off 1,500 workers in its aircraft‐equip ment division at Utica last week because of a cutback in defense contracts and the im pact of the strike. Some 4,000 other G.E. workers in two G.E. plants in Utica were out on strike. The side effects were felt as far away as Tokyo, where Hitachi, Ltd., and the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company (Toshiba) agreed to supply components for radio and TV vacuum tubes and communi cations equipment. The Jap anese indicated they would cooperate with G.E. “in every way possible” during the strike at the request of G.E. officials. Top executives of G.E. have warned workers all along that G.E. is the only re maining major United States manufacturer of radios and that history has shown that strikes have a tendency to eliminate domestic manufac ture of such items that can be produced abroad cheaper. Fred J. Borch, chairman, said that with each general wage increase, some G.E. jobs left the country.

342-> GOOD CHASE 1–5 FOR ADIOS FINAL
YONKERS, March 17 — George Wampetich, the trainer of Good Chase, who has yet, to lose a betting race since he arrived in North America from New Zealand last year, mere ly shrugged this morning, when he was informed that his charge had been assigned to the No. 8 post in Friday night's $25,000 final of the Adios Spring Pacing Festival at Yonk ers Raceway. Wampetich, who will call upon Del Insko to drive Good Chase in the eight‐furlong fi nale, flatly predicted another victory for the 6‐year‐old. Good Chase, 1–10 in his last appear ance here, is listed at 1–5 for his next. Good Chase, having captured his only start here last year and all four, including the $40, 000 Provincial Cup Pace at The Windsor Raceway in Ontaric in 1970, has the season's rec ord for one mile. The brown stallion won his only start in the Festival in 1:59 3–5. Wampetich directed Good Chase through three training trips over the rubberized track at Roosevelt Raceway this morning. Following separate stints of two miles and 1½ miles, the prohibitive favorite went eight furlongs in 2:16. Ed Parker, the racing secre tary at Yonkers, in keeping with the conditions of the an nual event, handicapped the eight finalists on the basis of average money‐winnings in the series. Good Chase earned $7,500 by finishing first in his only start. Adaptor of Australia, who will have Cardinal King of New Zealand as an entry‐mate from the Stanley Dancer Stable, was placed in the No. 7 slot. Adap tor was second in earnings, with $5,625. He and his stable mate are held at 10‐1. Diarac, another pacer from Down Under, and the one whose 2:02 success was the fastest in the Festival, will leave from No. 5 with Frank Popfinger and is second choice at 6‐1. In No. 6, with John Patterson Sr., will be Bygone, at 10‐1.

344-> BAN ON REACTORS DISCUSSED HERE
Witnesses disagreed at a City Council hearing yesterday on the danger of building nuclear reactors in New York City, but even those who felt the reactor posed a threat were not all willing to go as far as a bill being considered by the Council to ban them completely inside city limits. The hearing on the bill and on a resolution calling on the Atomic Energy Commission to refuse a license for a nuclear reactor at Columbia University — drew a packed audience of nearly 300 in the Council chamber and 136 persons signed up to offer testimony. The reactor that Columbia is building on its Morningside Heights campus has stirred con siderable community opposition and has been a major spur for new legislation. Experts from the Atomic En ergy Commission were kept on the stand longest with repeated questions from the Councilmen especially Theodore Weiss, the main sponsor of the legislation. Joseph DiNunno, an engineer with the commission, said pro hibiting the reactors was “quite unnecessary” in view of the al ready stringent A.E.C. regula tions. He said that while the com mission had not yet licensed any commercial power reactor to be built in populated areas, there were at least a dozen smaller research reactors al ready operating in the New York metropolitan area. Mr. DiNunno asserted there was no danger of a ‘reactor's exploding “in a nuclear‐bomb sense,” but he conceded there could be an explosion in the high‐pressure steam elements associated with a reactor, much as an explosion is possible in conventional steam boiler. In a typical reactor opera tion, steam is generated by the heat of the nuclear reaction and the steam in turn can be used to turn, say, a generator turbine. Mr. DiNunno said there was no extra danger of radioactivi ty from a reactor. “We live with radioactivity every day of our lives,” he said, noting that the average background emis sion from natural sources was 100 to 200 milirems, a standard measure of radioactivity. He said a working nuclear plant would add only about 5 mill rems to this total. The Councilmen questioned Dr. William Burr, a biochemist’ and physician with the A.E.C., on the effects of the added radiations. A Dissenting Scientist Dr. Burr said the probability of contamination from a re actor was very small. He ges tured toward the Council cham ber's ornate gilt and white ceiling and said “There is also a probability that the ceiling will fall on you or me, but it is a very low‐level probabil ity.” He added that he did not believe “we have any circum stance where we have zero risk,” but refused to speculate on what kind of biological damake the extra radiation From reactors would cause. “We just don't have that kind of information,” he said. But one scientist differed with Dr. Burr. He was Dr. John W. Gofman of the Univer sity of California's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. “There is no such thing as a safe amount of radiation,” Dr. Gofman said emphatically. “If everyone in the City of New York were to receive the amount of radiation currently allowed by the Federal Gov ernment, you can expect one extra cancer from this radia tion for. every 10 cancers oc curring spontaneously.” “This represents a step back ward in the health protection of residents of New York,” Dr. Gofman declared, “equal in the opposite direction to all the medical advances put together in the last 25 years.” Koch's Stand Others concerned with the danger of reactors felt that the problem might be controlled by something less than a complete ban. Representative Edward I. Koch, a Manhattan Democrat, said that reactor technology “is not so far advanced today as to remove any reasonable doubt that accidents might occur.” But he added “I would not want to preclude for all time the possibility of nuclear reac tors operating within New York City.” Representative John M. Mur phy, Democrat of Staten Island, said a complete prohibition would be “setting back the clock on technological develop ment” and would prohibit such things as nuclear‐powered ships from ever calling at New York.

346-> $50‐Million Sought By Illinois Central For Improvements
The Illinois Central Railroad expects to sell $50‐million of equipment trust certificates or borrow that amount on condi tional sales agreements “some time after the middle of the year,” William B. Johnson, chairman of both the railroad and its parent, Illinois Central Industries, Inc., said in an in terview yesterday. Mr. Johnson disclosed that collateral for some of the planned financing would con sist of rolling stock now on the railroad, which is owned out= right. “We have quite a bit of it,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that his predecessors at the I.C. “thank heavens followed a very conservative financial policy.” Mr. Johnson joined the rail road in 1966 and was elected chairman of the holding com pany in December, 1968. Proceeds from the planned borrowing will help the I.C. finance an $80‐million capital improvement program this year. Included in this program is a $14‐million locomotive servicing shop the railroad is building outside of Chicago. Mr. Johnson also disclosed that Illinois Central Industries since the start of the year has acquired more than 70,000 shares of its own stock. The purchases were part of a pro gram approved by I. C. I. di rectors late last year providing for the purchase of up to 250; 000 shares of the company's stock. “The purpose of the program, aside from the fact that we think the stock is low priced, is to avoid dilution,” Mr. Johnson explained. He noted that in ad dition to having quite a few stock options exercisable at prices below the market (the shares closed yesterday at 29¾), I.C.I. is committed to ac quiring H. G. Phillipsborn & Co. in exchange for common stock. The number of shares to be is sued for Phillipsborn is contin gent on future earnings of the new subsidiary, which is en gaged in mortgage banking and real estate. Mr. Johnson said that he hoped that Illinois Central In dustries would be able to com plete a “substantial non‐trans portation acquisition,” prior to the effectiveness of the merger of the Illinois Central Railroad and the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio Railway. A merger of the I. C. and the G. M. & O. now is be fore the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Illinois Central executive acknowledged that the commission's decision on the merger “could be a year away.” When asked to define what he meant by a “substantial” acquisition, Mr. Johnson replied he meant “in the neighborhood of $100‐million.” He pointed out that as a result of a series of acquisitions over the last 18 months, only about 36 per cent of Illinois Central Indus tries' assets now are repre sented by the railroad. “I would like to keep that figure somewhere around 36 per cent or 37 per cent,” Mr. Johnson said, “so that our company is well balanced.” In addition to the railroad, the holding company owns the Abex Corporation, the Chan deysson Electric Company, the Waukesha Foundry and Pepis Cola General Bottlers, Inc. Mr. Johnson said that in its acquisition search, I.C.I. would concentrate largely on com panies in the consumer products field, “because of fast growth.” He pointed out that Pepsi‐Cola General Bottlers, which I. C. I. ac quired on Feb. 2, through acquisitions of its own and through internal growth has been growing at a 12 per cent annual rate. The consolidated company in 1969 had sales of $736‐million and earnings of $40.6‐million, or $3.02 a share. Mr. Johnson said that the company is “shooting for a modest, but definite improvement in earn ings this year.” Last year's earnings were 9 per cent above those of 1968, when net was $38‐million. “I don't think we'll get a 9 per cent improve ment in 1970,” he said.

348-> Basel Bank's $30‐Million Loss Attributed to Its Cocoa Trading
PARIS, Sept. 9 — Auditors examining the books of a Basel bank that reported a $30‐mi lion loss last year have dis closed that some of the dif ficulties arose from trading in highly volatile cocoa futures the bank's American manage ment disclosed today. Frank King, chairman of the United California Bank of Los Angeles, said in Basel, Switzer land, that the facts in the case so far indicated that there had been no personal gain by any of the employes of the United California Bank in Basel, A.G. United California, the second largest bank West of the Rock ies after the Bank of America, acquired a 58 per cent interest in the former Salik Bank of Basel in May, 1969. A terse statement yesterday by United California attributed the loses, among the largest ever report ed by a Swiss institution, to “unauthorized commodity trading.” Unliike American banks, Swiss banks act as brokers and trade for their own accounts. Most Swiss banks, however, steer clear of commodity deal ings. The Basel affair is reminiscent of troubles the First National City Bank ran into in foreign exchange operations at its Brus sels branch in 1965. A loss of $4‐million was disclosed almost accidentally through publica tion required by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a New York stock issue. The Ibank's Brussell foreign exchange dealer had lost the $4‐million in large forward op erations in sterling. He was dealing for the bank's account. Mr., King said he did not know of the $30‐million in los ses in Basel until he had been informed in Los Angeles on Aug. 30 by Paul Erdman, vice chairman of the Basel bank. Mr. Erdman and Alfred Kalten bach, a manager, have resigned. Mr. King said he immediately dispatched auditors to Basel to investigate the situation and informed the Federal Reserve Board, Which shares banking jurisidction in the United States with the Controller of the Cur rency. The American bank's board met last Friday, Mr. King added, and authorized the drawing up of a plan to provide sufficient funds‐to prevent any losses to depositors end creditors. Mr. King said the Reserve Board had given assurances of full cooperation. Observers took this to mean the Reserve would authorize the Los Angeles bank to trans fer funds to the Basel bank, to shore up its balances. Swiss bankers interviewed today said the reputation of American banks in Switzerland would suffer enormously if the funds were not forthcoming. An official of the Swiss Bank ing Commission, which is con ducting its own investigation, said that if the money did not come the Basel bank would have to shut down. Henry Wieser, formerly the Los Angeles bank's internation al manager in New York who was named general manager of the Basel bank, said inves tigations so far had shown no irregularities in foreign exchange dealings, and that these were proceeding “in the normal manner.” One result of the affair, which is being followed close ly in Switzerland, is expected to be tighter regulation of new foreign banks setting up Swiss facilities. The Swiss Parliament is to debate banking legislation later this month.

349-> Dance
BY common consent this present dance season is the busiest and the biggest the United States has ever known. More people are going to dance than ever before. It is, as Alexander Ewing, administra tor of the City Center Jof frey Ballet, puts it, “the gold en age of American dance.” But that is about the only thing that is golden about American dance. American dance, both clas sic ballet and modern‐dance, is facing the most severe fi nancial crisis in its history. Even though it is perhaps the one art form in which the na tion effortlessly leads the world; even though, together with rock music and movies, it is one of the art forms most dear to the young; even though it is expanding and proliferating all over the country, dance is in grave trouble. The story is the same on all sides. There is not enough money to meet the growing annual deficits. Dancers are woefully underpaid. Musi cians and stagehands contin ue demand more and more. Production costs are soaring. Other artistic organizations such as orchestras and mu seums which are obviously more establishment‐oriented than dance could ever be, are successfully demanding a larger slice of America's mea ger cultural pie. Respectable organizations with largely 19th‐century affiliations (aft er all how much contempo rary music do orchestras play?) are naturally attrac tive to the older and more conservative elements in the community. Dance, unfortunately for its fund‐raising, does not happen to be a cultural dinosaur on its last gargantuan legs and, as a result, may well find itself discriminated against by dinosaur lovers at all levels of economic influence. President Nixon has called upon Congress to double the allocation of funds to the Na tional Endowment for Arts from $10‐million to $20‐mil lion. What is there in this for dance? Probably not much. Michael Straight, deputy chairman of the National En dowment, freely admits that even though it is expected that the over‐all grant will be doubled, this certainly does not mean that dance's share will be doubled. At present dance gets a fairly modest $800,000 out of the $10‐million. This is shared by many companies and in dividual choreographers. It is of course far less than the major European companies receive, particularly when an adjustment is made for the varying cost of living. It does not seem that dance will get much more in the new allot ments, even though it is ob vious that the Endowment is acutely conscious of dance's very special contribution to our cultural life and our in ternational image. However, in the new cul tural budget the orchestras will most probably have a greatly increased allotment, and the museums are also very likely to benefit dispro portionately to the admitted ly very modest assistance they are now receiving. It is hard to fault the National En dowment on this. Obviously big and fashionable orches tras or elegantly musty mu seums might well prove more attractive and respectable' to certain members of Congress and their wives than, say, the dance companies of Merce Cunningham or Paul Taylor. Yet times are changing, and with them certain previously accepted priorities. What does dance need for survival? The other day I sat down with a friend who hap pens to be both very inter ested and highly informed on these matters and we calcu lated that, for some of our major companies, we had to meet deficits of over $5‐mil lion yearly—our definition of a deficit being money “over and above that which is now being received from all sources.” We calculated that New York City Ballet and Ameri can Ballet Theater needed an extra million apiece, that City Center Joffrey Ballet re quired another half‐million, and that two and a half mil lion would have to be spread between the Martha Graham Company, Eliot Feld's Ameri can Ballet Company, and the troupes of Alvin Ailey, Merce Cunningham, Alwin Nikolais and Paul Taylor. This, of course, does not take into ac count all of the other import ant American dance compa nies all over the country. For this five million you get just nine companies—and the five million is not the total sub sidy needed but the addition al money required to secure the future. Why is this money needed? Partly to match the inevit ably rising costs. Partly to bring the salary of dancers up to a reasonable standard of living. Partly to expand ed ucation programs. Partly to develop the American dance repertory. Betty Cage, general man ager of New York City Ballet, is concerned because next season she has to face de mands by the company's or chestra which, at present, the company could not possibly, by any stretch of the imagi nation, meet. Orchestral play ers are apt to be very de manding of ballet companies. Not so long ago the concert master of the Harkness Bal let — an admirable violinist I am sure — was being paid more than the company's ar tistic director and principal dancer. Dancers are starving. Danc ers are expected to subsidize their own art. Only a week or so ago the young mod ern‐dancer Twyla Tharp told me that she couldn't see how she could continue with her dancers in their present state of pure poverty. Alexander Ewing of the Jaffrey Ballet says frankly: “Our salary scale is impos sibly low. Management feels that it cannot perpetuate this present state of things, but we just do not have the money to do better.” Miss Cage adds: “The dancers are wonderful, but we have a concern to do more for them.” City Ballet is in fact the best paid company in the country. The junior members of the company, by general standards, are not badly paid, but the principals — the top 13 members of the company, all of them leading dancers with international reputations — receive only an average of $16,008.78 yearly. Of course some of them have the op portunity to supplement that average figure with guest ap pearances and television fees, but the basic pay scale is not generous with regard to their distinction in their profes sion. But this is good. Last year the principals of American Ballet Theater took home an average of $7,406.55. These are principal dancers, some of them household names. The top 10 dancers at the Joffrey Ballet average $8,490. How is a man to maintain a wife and family on this kind of money? And these are the top, very top, salaries. There's a song by Noel Coward called “Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington.” Today there should be a rider that, if you do, don't put her into dance. These are just figures for principal dancers—the cream of the cream — in classic companies. Modern‐dancers are much worse off. The sal aries of dancers in Paul Tay lor's company — a troupe that has won perhaps rather more prestige for America abroad than General Motors —range from $6,280 per year at the top to $5,560 at the bottom. The dancers of the Murray Louis troupe — again a leading company — pick up an average of $3,856. The Alwin Nikolias Dance Thea ter varies between an aver age of $5,666 for the princi pals to $4,291.50 for the junior members. This, I submit, is ridiculous. Of course all the companies are concerned about the sal aries of their dancers. But dance is particularly expen sive for other reasons too. As Ewing points out: “The first problem that is crucial for us and any other company is the problem of creating a literature or a repertory. Be fore reaching the state that other arts — such as opera or symphony — generally start at, we are involved with colossal expenditure. Every time we create a new work — and think how many bal lets are created in America during any typical season— we have to make a gamble. We personally need a million a year to make up our box office deficit.” There it is. Dance — Amer ica's cultural ghetto.

350-> Lien Threatened on Papp's Theater
A construction company yesterday threatened to take over the New York Shake speare Festival's Public Thea ter at 425 Lafayette Street unless a bill of more than $400,000 for work done on the structure is paid “within the next few days.” Besides the threat of losing the building, the festival also is facing the possibility of having to cancel, at least in part, its summer season of free Shakespeare in Central Park because of a cutback in city funds. Joseph Papp, president and founder of the 15‐year‐old festival, has sent a wire to Mayor Lindsay seeking an emergency session to avert “the imminent loss” of the theater and the cancellation of its outdoor performances and its Mobile Theater. A City Hall spokesman said last night that the Mayor, who is attending the annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors in Den ver, had asked August Heck‐. scher, Parks, Recreation and. Cultural Affairs Administra tor, to “discuss both matters with Mr. Papp.” Mr. Heckscher said that he was “going to go over things with Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio and then I'll be in touch with the Mayor. This is a serious crisis. Joe Papp is a valuable resource of New York City. Summer without Shakespeare in the park would hardly seem like sum mer. The Public Theater has been an important innova tive force in the life of the theater.” Mr. Papp said that he had “no way of paying these bills” and that “some des perate measure must be taken to save the festival and the theater.” “What that is at the mo ment, I cannot presume to know,” he said, adding, “Whatever it is, it must hap pen fast or we go under.” The producer said that only major action by the city or state could resolve the crisis. The three‐story theater building, formerly the old Astor Library, was the first to be saved under the city's Landmark Preservation Law. It was acquired by the festi val in 1966 for $575,000. The festival has expended $2,560, 726 to renovate and restore it, and is contemplating an additional expenditure of $2,483,070 to complete the work. Upon completion, the Public Theater would contain four theaters — the 300‐seat Florence Sutro Anspacher (now in operation); the Estelle R. Newman Theater, also 300 seats (recently completed); a 110‐seat theater (currently The Other Stage) and a 105‐ seat film theater. The prospect of the festi val's dissolution, Mr. Papp said, developed yesterday when he received notice from the Yorke Construction Cor poration, 325 Lafayette Street, requiring payment of the debt for work performed on the Newman Theater. The corporation, of which Victor Goldberg is president, stated in its notice that it would impose a “mechanic's lien” on the building. If the lien is filed with the New York County Clerk, the cor poration could start fore closure proceedings for the sale of the theater building at its discretion. The lien, how ever, would no longer be in existence if not foreclosed a year after its filing. Mr. Goldberg said last night that his relationship with Mr. Papp has been a friendly one. “We agreed to carry the ac count as much as we could, but at the point when we finished the Newman theater there was almost $500,000 owed us. “Unless we can get some satisfactory arrangement within the next few days, we must reluctantly place a me chanic's lien against the prop erty. I'm not going to hang him (Mr. Papp), but this is a very serious thing with our business. It represents a de pletion of our working capital at a time when money is very tight. We hope it will not be necessary for us to take this extreme action.” Mr. Papp said that the pres ent situation arose two years ago when Mayor Lindsay as sured him that the city would acquire the Public Theater building and lease it back to the festival at a minimal rental. “The purchase by the city,” he said, “would have pro vided us with operating funds for at least two, years. Based on this assurance, I proceeded to renovate the building and create a beautiful new thea ter, the Newman, at a cost of $1,200,000.” When the City Council re cently refused to comply with the Mayor's request for the purchase of the theater, the festival “received a deadly blow,” according to Mr. Papp. “This is the chief source of our present crisis,” he ex plained. The situation became worse, the producer said, when he was informed this week by Mr. Heckscher that instead of the $500,000 re quested to cover the fes tival's summer programs only $350,000 would be made available for this purpose. The decrease of $150,000, Mr. Papp said, “meant that we could not complete the season, and I seriously con templated canceling it. On reconsideration, I have sought every means to at least bring both the Central Park and Mobile Theater pro grams to opening.” Mr. Papp said that the Chemical Bank is now considering a loan to the festival based on the city's appropriation of $350, 000. But the outcome of the bank loan, the producer said, “will not be known until next week.” In the meantime, Mr. Papp said he was busy “scratching and scrounging everywhere to get enough money to pay the actors and technicians for at least this coming week.” The festival's projected summer fare is entitled “The Wars of the Roses,” consist ing of Shakespeare's “Henry VI” trilogy and “Richard III.”

351-> SAFETY BRIEFINGS ON MINES DELAYED
WASHINGTON, March 4— The Interior Department abruptly interrupted today a series of mine‐safety briefings for the coal industry that had been under way across the country under plans drawn up by John F. O'Leary, who was dismissed four days ago as di rector of the United States Bu reau of Mines. The official explanation for the decision to interrupt the nationwide mine‐safety brief ings at midpoint was that aide of the Bureau of Mines who have been conducting the brief ings were suddenly needed Washington. A departmental statement said that the technicians had been recalled for “a final re view” of tough new health and safety regulations for the protection mine workers These are now being promul gated at the Interior Depart ment under the Federal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 which was signed by President Nixon on Dec. 30. Major parts of the compley new law become effective March 31. Detailed regulations must be published before then. Mr. O'Leary completed his rec ommendations for, the regula tions last Friday, about 12 hours before he was notified of his dismissal. The department statement did not explain how the first three mine‐safety briefings in Washington, Pittsburgh and Big Stone Gap, Va.—had been conducted before such a “final review” had been held. A spokesman said today that participants at those meetings had been told that ‘the inter pretations and information they had received were “tentative.” Decision Is Sudden The suddenness of the deci sion, however—a briefing at Madisonville, Ky., set for 9 A.M. tomorrow was canceled at noon today—and a disclosure that, officials regarded as “O'Leary men” were being eased out raised fears ainong mine‐safety advocates in Congress, most of, them Democrats, that the Nixon. Administration was bowing to mining industry protests and softening the health and safety standards. Interior department spokes men did not deny that the O'Leary recommendations were “being reconsidered.” An official of the House Labor sub committee, which has jurisdic tion over mine safety legisla tion, said that committee sources were “told told today that “on some of the regulations they are going to take O'Leary's rec ommendations and divide them by six—”water them down.” The spokesman. said that the subcommittee chairman, Repre sentative John H. Dent, Demo crat of Pennsylvania, had ‘al ready demanded from Interior “a complete record” of all ‘Pro posals’ and changes for hearings in implementation. of the act in April. Representative Ken Hechler, Democrat of West Virginia, who is leader of the mine safety re form group in Congress, charged that the coal industry was “in sisting that the regul4tions be rewritten and weakened before they are explained in the field briefings.” A Mr. O'Leary, 43 years old, a holdover from the Johnson Administration, submitted his resignation to the White House on Jan. 21, 1968, as did all Presidential appointees. It was not accepted, rejected or ac knowledged. Then, last Saturday, after Mr. O'Leary had prepared regulations tinder, the mine health and safety law that one of the nation's top coat execu tives privately called “assinine —just stupid,” the director re ceived a letter from Mr. Nixon thanking him for his services and accepting his resignation, effective Sunday. It was reported today that Mr. O'Leary's recent choice as assistant director for mineral industry health, Henry N. Doyle, was also being ‘dis missed. The last‐minute decision to interrupt the briefings meant that the three remaining stops in the bureau's project to ex plain the new law would be postponed for two weeks, the Interior Department said. The new schedule set the dates at Madiscinville for March 19‐20; at Beckley, W. Va., on March 23‐24, and at Deliver on March. 26‐27. But leading coal industry representatives here made made clear today that they understood the law, needed ‘no briefing, and were seeking to have the. Interior Department change its regulations before the briefings resumed. One of the most complex and sensitive provisions of the new law and the regulations centers on the, amount of respirable coal dust to be permitted in the air that miners breathe. Microscopic particles of coal dust have recently been found to be the cause Of pneumoconi osis, or black lung diease, a lisabling–ePidemic among soft coal workers. But the coal dust limit effec tive March 31—n‐ominally. 3.0 milligrams a cubic meter of mine air under, the law, but a monthly’ average, of 3.9 milli grams under the proposed regu lations—is regarded as so oner ous by the owners of “dusty’ p mines that a spokesman for the Bituminous Coal Operations Association ‘said today that some owners were “discussing” a strategy of inviting F,ederal closure orders for. dust viola tions. Another informed source said that the “strategy to ob tain relief” would involve re fraining from applying for the virtually automatic one‐year waivers provided by the law. This would allow up to a 5.9 milligram average dust reading for 12 months and the opera tors could thus precipitate such widespread mine closings that coal production would be significantly reduced: Charles Brown, an official of the National Science Founda tion, who beads the special panel of Government experts created to grant the waiver permits, said today that “we have received not one. applica tion.” The deadline for appli cations is May 1.

353-> ‘Grab the Money and Run’?
DISAFFECTION with “counter culture” ‐‐ the mishmash of myths, music and mishigas ani mating our youth — is beginning to manifest itself in the writings of the most observant and thoughtful of the younger rock critics. While the mass media go right on endorsing every fad and foible of a decadent pop cul ture, while “soul” is co‐opted by Coca‐Cola and “revolution” becomes a phrase in a pants commercial, the kids who have grown up on the rock scene are starting to register their disgust with its perversions and their despair of its ever attaining its ostentatiously proclaimed millennium. Recently, virtually an entire issue of Rolling Stone, the rock world's most authoritative journal, was de voted to an exhaustive inquest into the Rolling Stones' farewell concert at Altamont, Calif. The free concert —ballyhooed by Mick Jagger as “a Christmas and Hanukkah rite to American Youth” — resulted in the murder of an armed black spectator by a gang of knife‐wielding Hell's Angels (hired for $500 in beer to pro tect the vulnerable Mick), three ac cidental deaths from various causes and enough bad vibrations to shake the rock establishment to its founda tions. As one participant lamented, “There was no love, no joy. It wasn't just the Angels. It was everybody. In 24 hours we created all the prob lems of our society in one place: con gestion, violence, dehumanization.” Hardly noticed on the East Coast, Altamont grossed out the West. The Los Angeles Free Press expressed its view in a page‐length caricature of Jagger with flowers in his hair and an Adolf Hitler mustache, his arm flung fraternally around a ghoulish Angel, while a crowd of long‐haired kids hails the pair with the Nazi salute. * Rolling Stone, with a thoroughness rare in these days of capsule news dispatches, searched out the disas trous event in every direction. The picture that emerged of the rock establishment with its rapacious greed, its shifty, manipulative tactics, its utter unconcern for people's lives and decencies and its incredible megalomania was worthy of a muck raking masterpiece on the Robber Barons. The new Robber Bands, make no mistake, come from England bent on crass exploitation. Anyone who has traveled with these mu sicians or simply sat for an afternoon in their dressing rooms can testify to the con temptuous and paranoid view they hold of this country. “Grab the money and run” is their basic philosophy. Whether, like Blind Faith, they shark together in a so called supergroup, make a fast million in a single tour and then disband; or whether, like the Stones, they dictate outrageous terms through, their pushers and then pre tend to give something back to the people with a free concert (which is in fact a filmmaking project to coin even more money); or whether, like the Beatles, they take the attitude that only through making vast sums of (American) money will they be able to save the world, the freebooting of these rock bandits ought to end forever the idea that the counter‐culture is founded on some genuine ethical ideal, or that it marks in any significant way a break with the prevailing capital istic system. The other side of the dis content with counter‐culture, represented by Salingerian pathos over broken dreams and busted ideals, was beauti fully expressed by Ellen Willis, 27‐year‐old rock critic of The New Yorker, writing recently in The New York Review of Books. In a long, elegiac reflection, Miss Willis examined the myths and beliefs of the counter culture through the lenses of two current films, “Easy Rider” and “Alice's Restau rant.” Her conclusion is that “at this point, hate and love seem to be merging into a sense of cosmic failure, a pervasive feeling that every thing is disintegrating, in cluding the counter‐culture itself, and that we really have nowhere to go.” Under scoring the sense of lost op portunities that haunts the current moment, Miss Willis finds the dominant mood crystallized in the phrases: “What went wrong? We blew it!” Though Miss Willis forbears to mention such things, “it” includes , as exemplified by albums like the Beatles' “Sgt. Pepper”; , as induced by mind stunning discothèques like L'Oursin and the original Electric Circus; , as produced by the dozen or more Afro‐oriented dances that sprang up with soul mu sic and now, have died— along with all dancing in the white world. perished as an urban ideal with the decay of Haight Ashbury. suffered a setback when the cult of the Maharishi was exploded. was abandoned along with the early hippie mys tique. Spirit voyaging de clined after the first great excitement over psychedelics died down. has a pretty pathetic ring to it to day; was always a bad joke. The —yes, the silent majority which holds the power to elect a government headed by Richard Nixon. In sum, what the kids blew was a millennial moment—one of those rare opportunities when a crack appears in the mundane shell. The question, “What went wrong?,” takes us back to the fall, the fall of '67, when the exodus began from the Hashbury after a summer of paradisiacal joy. Then, if ever, the Woodstock Nation should have prevailed. In stead, what prevailed was apathy and drugs, petty crime, hustling, hassling, disease and madness. By the time of the pretended “Death of the Hippie” in San Fran cisco, and the very real deaths of Linda and Groovy in New York, the whole ideal of counter‐culture was on the ropes and sagging. Seen in this perspective, Woodstock was merely a three‐day revival meeting. What clinches the argu ment for the decline and fall of counter‐culture is the fate of rock music, which was the catalyst that quickened this whole world into being, sustained it and guided it through its short but kinky history. The fall of rock oc curred at the same time as the fall of the hippie. It was in the winter of '67‐'68 that the Beatles (read John Len non) decided to do an about face and retreat (with hip finesse) to their earlier man ner, or even further to the music of the old masters who preceded them, like Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Elvis Presley. Rocking from the failure of their tedious home movie, “The Magical Mystery Tour,” growing alarmed at the bad box office signaled by mounting prestige among intellectuals and declining popularity among teenybop pers, the Beatles decided to abandon the rich vein that had produced “Sgt. Pepper” and those fascinating com positions, “Strawberry Fields” and “I Am the Wal rus.” This act of creative apostasy announced the be ginning of Rock Revival, the great roll back to 1957 and the joys of being once again a simpleminded teen‐ager. Electing to scrape the old bubblegum off the wall and munch it into mulch again, the Beatles and their millions of followers became the first generation in history to de cline the great adventure of their destiny in favor of a premature return to child hood and the cloying pleas Today, as a result of the determination of the past two years, rock culture stands at the opposite pole from where it stood in its peak period. At its peak, the input of raw creative energy was so overwhelming that the elaborate system of filt ers, buffers and diluters that normally stands between the public and the creative mind momentarily broke down and the masses were mainlining pure, uncut musical fantasy. Rusty old Tin Pan Alley seemed to have sunk into the hole left by the rising Atlantis. But as the Ideals and myths that had sustained rock began to crumble, into the gap rushed the banished swarm of parasite producers, impresarios and financial wheeler‐dealers. In no time rock was computerized into the stalking zombie it is to day, lurching along without a thought, a purpose or a plan beyond that offered by the record rating charts and the airline time tables. By now, the music is a mass of nearly exhausted clichés that pours 24 hours a day from the radio like Muzak without strings. What is even more dis maying than this industrial ization of the art is the ac ceptance of the bubblegum mentality by even the finest rock musicians. The latest albums of rock geniuses (the Beatles, Bob Dylan) show an unhappy drift toward the purely commercial aspect of their music. Too much com placency, too many ego trips, too great a facility with the tucks and pleats of current fashion has led them toward a subtly specious mu sic that is attractive but not not convincing. As for the dozens of groups and per formers who are not so gifted, they present the col lective image of a mon otonously revolving kaleido scope, loaded with bits of hand‐cut, tie‐dyed, plastic gospel, blues, rock, jazz, pop, folk, pop, blues, and so on in endlessly shifting combi nations of this week's, last month's, tomorrow's “sound.” No Tin Pan Alley Svengali could have molded anything more plastically perfect than The Band, lauded to the heavens recently in a Time cover story. Endearing, amus ing, bouncy and bathetic by turns, packaged in homespun and hominy, peddled with homilies about integrity and respect for old folks, The Band, or The Bland, is a pro have to be edited, cooled, controlled, or explained; they run no risks of offending any one; they fit in perfectly with the worship of medioc rity that is beginning to take the place of the old devil cults. With their twangy, rub bery, pogo‐stick beat—pro duced, mind you, with an au thentic folk instrument called the electric wah‐wah pedal— The Band is ideal for the adult bubblegum market. It is beginning to look as though J. Edgar Hoover, Spi ro T. Agnew, Mayor Daley, Judge Hoffman and Ronald Reagan, the deans of our great universities and the po lice and sanitation depart ments of our cities no longer have any cause to fear an up rising from the red Maoist masses of American youth. The generation that three years ago seemed destined to uproot traditional moral val ues and revolutionize our cul ture has now begun to drift aimlessly along the lines of least resistance. We need no longer fear that the Wash ington Monument will be blown up or the White House levitated. The real fear should be that a generation which re jects its inherited culture with such facility will inevi tably reject or betray its own youth culture with the same jettisoning zeal. Coun ter‐culture is largely anti culture: one step more and it becomes non‐culture.

358-> State Limits Import Of Tax‐Free Liquor To Quart a Person
The State Department of Taxation and Finance said yes terday that state residents, returning from abroad, begin ning Sept. 1, could bring in only one quart of liquor free of state taxes instead of the gal lon previously allowed. The change is the result of new legislation designed to bring state law into conformity with Federal limitations. Both will let travelers returning from the Virgin Islands, Guam and Samoa bring in a gallon of liquor free of duty and tax. A department spokesman said it had a working arrange ment on enforcement with the BUreau of Customs. Under it, the customs declarations of re turning state residents are made available periodically for examination by the department. “Whenever we discover that someone is liable to a substan tial tax payment, we follow it up by letter,” he said. The state tax rate on high alcohol‐content beverages is $2.25 a gallon; on liquors under 48 proof it is 66⅔ cents; on natural sparkling wines it is 53⅓ cents; on still wines, 10 cents, and 4 4/9 cents on a gallon of beer. “So whenever we find some one who brought in a gallon of beer, we don't bother to send him a letter to collect our 4¼ cents,” the spokesman added. He pointed out that the new state law also requires resi dents to pay the state liquor tax on all alcoholic beverages purchased by mail or sent here as “baggage to follow.”

359-> Reward Posted in Bomb Attack On Prosecutor in West Virginia
MORGANTOWN, W. Va., Jan. 4—A $5,000 reward for information leading to the ar rest and conviction of persons who attempted to kill Monon galia County Prosecutor Joseph A. Laurita Jr. was posted today by the West Virginia News paper Publishing Company. The 32‐year‐old, crusading prosecutor was severely in jured Friday—a year and one day after he took office—when a “professionally wired” bomb device exploded as he turned the ignition key in his late model Datsun. Mr. Laurita was reported in “fair to good condi tion” in the intensive care unit at University of West Virginia Hospital, where he was being treated for severe leg and arm injuries suffered in the blast. Mr. Laurita, a Republican, defeated Kenneth Kincaid, Democrat who held the pros ecutor's post for eight years, after waging a strong law and order campaign in the Novem ber, 1968, election. Prior to his election in this county of 55,000, Mr. Laurita said, “There is a strong sus picion that gangland murders were plotted in Monongalia County and the bodies dumped elsewhere as the result of local gambling activity.” “It goes without saying that stronger gambling laws would be helpful in the assault on the citadel of gambling and related activities, but the strongest laws against gambling viola tions would be useless unless they were diligently enforced,” he said. “Here is the very heart of the problem in Monongalia County — the unwillingness of elected public officials to pur sue their public responsibilities to their completion.” The Dominion‐News, a Dem ocratic newspaper that advo cated Mr. Laurita's election and started an exposé of unmol ested gambling operations more than four years ago, said yes terday in a Page I editorial: “Mr. Laurita had precious little help against the rackets from anyone except Circuit Court Judge Marvin R. Kiger.” Judge Kiger, also a Republi can, defeated a 16‐year Demo cratic veteran on the bench, Don J. Eddy, in the 1968 elec tion in this coal and limestone mining center 55 miles south of Pittsburgh. Shortly before the election, a grand jury was impaneled to investigate the newspaper's ed itorial allegations and wound up criticizing The Dominion‐News as failing “to provide this jury with any evidence to support” the allegations and stating the opinion “that a reporting of this type mere opinion is not sufficient.” Morgantown and Monongalia County policemen asked in past months if there was organized crime here, have declined com ment or denied that there was. Only Sgt. Donald L. Lake of the state police, who is heading the investigation into the at tempted assassination of the young prosecutor, does not deny the existence of an or ganized underworld. Sergeant Lake questions only its strenoth now, a year after Mr. Laurita took office and be gan his campaign against crime, a campaign that has resulted in the padlocking of six private clubs for liquor law violations, 14 narcotics arrests and three gambling charges. The attack on Mr. Laurita came less than a week before he was due to go before grand jury to seek indictments in several gambling cases and at least eight narcotics charges. Edgar Heiskell 3d, sworn in yesterday as Mr. Laurita's as sistant, said the grand jury meeting may be delayed. Mr. Heiskell said he had talked briefly with Mr. Laurita,, the father of three children, on Saturday and that he hoped to speak at length with him “within the reasonably near future.”

SYDNEY. Australia, March 17 (UPI) — Ion Tiriac, the Ru manian who lives in Italy, pulled an upset today by oust ing Earl Buchholz of St. Louis in the first round of the $28,000 Dunlop international tennis ?? 6‐1, 6‐4, 6‐4. Buchholz became the third American to be eliminated, joining Dennis Ralston and Marty Reissen.

364-> Personality:
In the present state of the American mind, to say that it is possible to exaggerate the air pollution problem is some thing like being anti‐mother hood and pro the man‐eating shark. Charles M. Heinen or the Chrysler Corporation is bold enough to say it—and he may be right, at least as regards the automobile. He has been living with the pollution problem for the last 13 years. He says automo biles, his particular concern, no longer belong on the list of serious causes of air pol lution. His contention is that there are a lot better uses to which the country might put $12‐billion than installing afterburners on every fuel burning installation except the human lung. Mr. Heinen is aware he won't he regarded as an im partial witness. Nevertheless, his credentials as an expert are impressive. He is chief engineer‐emis sion control and chemical de velopment for Chrysler, which he joined in 1934 as a $65‐ a‐month stock clerk and floor sweeper. Mr. Heinen hag had his present title only since 1966, but for the last 17 years he has been Chrysler's prin cipal technical repregentative on matters of air, water and solids pollution control. “Smog discovered Charlie, and they've been partners ever since,” said one of Mr. Heinen's co‐workers. Mr. Heinen related during a recent interview how he came to be the company's pollution‐control expert. One Friday, late in 1958, he was instructed to at tend a meeting the following Monday in Los Angeles. The meeting had been called to review “a peculiar new form of air pollution” that the municipality was experienc ing. “The point had been raised,” Mr. Heinen said, “that the automobile might have something to do with it.” Those attending the meet ing recommended the forma tion of a committee to make a full investigation. There were 14 named to the com mittee. Mr. Heinen was one of three auto industry rep resentatives on it. “We talked to everyone we could reach for the next 2½ weeks. We went to any one we could think of who might have an angle. One of them was Haagen‐Smit” (A. J. Haagen‐Smit, professor of bio‐organic chemistry and di rector of plant environmental laboratories at the California Institute of Technology). Professor Heagen‐Smit had demonstrated that certain products of combustion from auto engines and other sources react with each other in the presence of sunlight to form completely new substances in the atmosphere. Mr. Heinen said that when the committee finished its inter viewing “almost everyone on it was convinced it was the automobile. “Until then, except for giv ing off smoke, which could be eliminated by good auto maintenance, we thought we were clean,” Mr. Heinen said. When the committee reported its suspicions that it was more than smoke and that “some thing should be done aboui it,” the job, insofar as Chrys ler was concerned, was given to Mr. Heinen. Mr. Heinen takes credit for getting all the auto makers starting in 1954 to pool their research efforts and to ex change all technical informa tion they developed individu ally concerning air pollution problems. He is quite bitter that the Justice Department last October ended this ex change because he feels that it was largely as a result of such an exchange of informa tion that the industry has been able to come up with the devices that have reduced the danger from each individ ual automobile. Mr. Heinen noted that in 1959 General Motors dis covered that the crankcase was responsible for about 25 per cent of the hydrocar bons given off from automo biles. “G. M. discovered this accidentally,” he said, “and the only coercion we resorted to was getting crankcase cont. trol devices starting with 1963 on all new cars. He figures that since it takes about 12 years to get all cars equipped by 1979 all crankcases will be “clean.” Right now, with the nurnher of pre‐1963 cars on the road according to his estimate, about 40 per cent of the pol lution from this source has been eliminated. Exhaust accounts for about 60 per cent of auto hydro carbon emissions and essen tially all the emissions of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. Mr. Heinen em phasized that beginning with 1966 models sold in Califor nia and 1968 throughout the country, autothobiles have been equipped with exhaust emission controls. He reported that starting with the current 1970‐model cars, evaporative emission controls have been put on carbutetors and fuel tanks of all new cars sold in Cali fornia and that these devices will be standard in 1971 mcidels nation‐wide. “The total picture indicates the automobile industry will be improving the atmosphere o Jar as hydrocarbon pollu tion goes right through 1983. By that time we will have achieved an 85 per cent re duction” in pollution, Mr. Heinen said. At this point, Mr. Heinen said he was most concerned “with the number of ama teurs raising Cain about the subject of pollution and jump ing to easy conclusions.” He spoke scomfully about a bill introduced, in the California Legislature to ban all auto mobiles from the highways by 1975. “This is sheer demagogic exaggeration,” Mr. Heinen declared. “It's time to take a look at where we are and what we have been able to do and not run off in all directions. We've got time to do a bit of bill studying and and to determine whether there is a need. The only way to do this is to produce good data. In making demagogic claims you don't produce anything.” Mr. Heinen's opinions are given with a positive air and he admits he began to de velop his good opinion of himself When he was in the Teaneck, N. J., high school, from which he was graduated at the top of his class in 1933. Aftei attending one semes ter at Bergen College in Hack ensack, N. J. (now Fairleigh Dickinson University) he went to Detroit to go to work for Chrysler, where his father was working in the export division. The elder Heinen urged his son to con tinue his studies at night at the Chrysler Institute of En gineering. At the end of four years Walter Chrysler awarded him a four‐year scholarship to the engineering school of the Uni versity of Michigan. “It was incredible for those days.” said Mr. Heinen. He said he received a basic wage of $125 a month, while attend ing college and had all cne employe benefits of full‐time workers, as well as a guar anteed summer job. On his return to full‐time employment, he was made a supervisor of a gas labora tory working on the Manhat tan Atomic Project. “This put me in the midst of some real theorists,” Mr. Heinen said, “and when some discus sions we got into involved some very deep mathematical problems, I asked for a mathe matics assistant, explaining I was dealing with real long hair material that was over my head. “They gave me one — a woman, who is now my wife and the mother of our seven daughters.”

365-> An ‘Artificial Nose’ Sniffs Out Bombs Hidden on Airliners
CHICAGO, March 11 — A sniffing device able to detect bombs aboard airliners has a been developed here under Federal contract. Aviation of ficials say that the system has been improved by Israeli scien tists and is being used by El Al Israel Airlines and a number of European airlines. The device samples the air in the passenger and cargo compai‐tments of an plane, and if it detects the odor of an explosive it flashes a warning to the crew. Meantime, the Federal Avi ation Administration, alarmed by the recent sabotage of two European airliners, is reported preparing to speed work on a still more’ sensitive version of the sniffing device and on one or two other types of bomb detectors. Scientists here who developed the “artificial nose,” as they sometimes call it, believe it could be adapted for detection of bombs in homes, autos and meeting halls. But the work done to date has concentrated on ferreting out bombs slipped into the confined compart ments of airliners. The project was undertaken in the mid‐sixties, with F.A.A. funding, by the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute, a nonprofit organization. The research and develop ment version was field‐tested for about a year at the avia tion agency's facility in Atlantic City. Just last September, accord ing to reliable Government sources, it was borrowed by the Israelis for adaptation by their engineers. Israel is under stood to have started using such a bomb detector long be fore the twin bombings of Feb. 21 — one on a Swiss airliner that crashed with the loss of 47 lives and the other on an Austrian airliner that landed safely at Frankfurt. The institute proposal that the aviation agency is consid ering is to build the prototype of a mass‐produceable sniffing device that could be ready for widespread use in a year or so. The agency is also expected to contract for advanced re search on an alternative approach called “neutron activa tion analysis.” Airliner luggage or cargo would be bombarded with neutrons, and the forma tion of radioactive isotopes would reveal whether explo sives were inside. Personnel Listed Two West Coast companies have done preliminary work on neutron devices. The institute's program was the brainchild of Dr. Andrew Dravnieks, a Latvian‐born sci entist who is director of the in stitute's Odor Sciences Center. Jay Fischman is chief engineer for the project, and Allan J. Gaynor is manager of the center. These men say that a prime advantage in their approach is that sniffing devices could be installed aboard every airliner. Competing devices now in use or under development— magnetometers, fluoroscopes, X‐rays and neutron devices— generally are installed at cargo ramps and boarding gates— stations that clever saboteurs might easily bypass. It is not known exactly how sniffing devices are being used by El Al Israel or other air lines. The device the aviation agency appears interested in having perfected would go to work only after an airliner had been loaded, the doors closed to seal the air in each compartment and the pilots had started to taxi the plane. The captain would then push a button marked “activate” and the equipment, installed in both passenger and Cargo com partments, would sample the air. If the analyzer detected the odor of an explosive, a signal would be flashed to the crew and the plane would be evacuated. It now takes about four minutes to detect a bomb's presence, but it is believed‐this could be cut to two and a half minutes. How Device Works Developers are also confi dent that they can compress the bulky research model into a practical device about the size of an attaché case,; It would weight about 50 pounds and cost between $5,000 and $10,000 in volume production. The de.,elopers are reluctant to disclose details of its'opera tion. This much, however, has been released: The device can identify chemical if that chemical makes up only one‐billionth of the air sample. Getting the explosive vapor inside a suitcase to mix with the air in the outer com partment can be aided by hav ing the crew partly decompress the compartment as the plane taxies. The analyzer knows the pre cise time when the vapor of an explosive chemical must reach its peak of intensity when be ing collected in the device. If the gauge shows a peaking at that moment that is evidehce that an explosive is aboard. If not, there is no explosive. Any chemical that shows peak reading at a different moment is not an explosive.

368-> 3 MIDTOWN B1ASTS DAMAGE BUILDINGS
Explosions occurred in three midtown office buildings almost simultaneously this morning at about 1:40. The explosions were al 150 East 42d Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues; 425 Park Avenue near 55th Street, and at 730 Third Ave nue, near 46th Street. Extensive damage was re ported at the 42d Street and Park Avenue buildings. The police said shortly before 3 A.M. that no one had been re ported injured, however. An unidentified male had telephoned a warning to police headquarters about half an hour before the explosions that bombs were planted in the buildings. The caller had fixed the time of the blasts almost exactly, the police said. The first explosion took place on the 34th floor of the Socony Mobil building on 42d Street. The floor is occupied by the ex ploration and producing depart ment of Mobil and the real estate firm of Galbreath and Ruffin. As a result of the telephoned warning police arrived at the building at 1:20 A.M. and evac uated 24 janitors and other workers before the explosion occurred. The Park Avenue explosion, where police also reported “heavy damage,” affected a 25 square‐foot area on the 12th floor, occupied by the Interna tional Business Machines Cor poration. The Third Avenue bomb went off on the 21st floor, occupied by the General Telephone and Electronics Corporation and its subsidiary, Sylvania Electric Products. At 730 Third Avenue, the block between 45th and 46th streets was completely covered with glass, a witness at the scene said. The police said a bomb may have been placed at a fourth site—at 415 adison Avenue, where the Bankers Trust Com pany and Litton Industries have offices. The police bomb squad was investigating. The Fire Department re ported heavy structural damage to the 42d Street building. Water was pouring down the elevator shaft, one report said. Twenty persons were evacu ated from the Third Avenue building before the bomb went off, according to the police. Police cars, fire engines and members of the bomb squad were at all three buildings by 2:02 A.M. the Fire Department reported.

369-> Vanessa: ‘Are People Right?’
I BEGAN to realize, when taking part in demonstra tions and when people asked me questions, that I had to work out why I was doing what I was doing and what I thought. I was asked questions way be yond my capacity to answer except in an instinctual way, and I started reading up and I realized that every thing I'd been taught was just absolute rubbish. It may be too late for the West; I'm not sure, I can't know. I just don't know enough. But it is possible for other ways to be found and we have it in us to behave differently. You don't need much information, you know, if somebody's murdering somebody. What information do you need? It's important in a drawing room when you're talking with professors and experts to be able to say, “Actually, it wasn't 3,201 who died of starvation in 1963, I believe you're off by .6044 points.” You say they died, and you've said it. You know that you— that the human race—is threatened by certain kinds of injustice, any injustice, and that it is terrifying injustice and it just must be stopped. And marching seems a very small thing to do, a very small thing indeed, but it's part of stopping it. * I very much wanted to have Franco's baby. That was very simple, really. I had some worries after, thinking, “Well, are people right, have I been irresponsible?” That kind of thing. I don't know about marriage as an in stitution. It seems to me that it must be something you work out for yourself and I wish society would put less pressure on people, you know, to get married. Undoubt edly it does put pressure on young girls who shouldn't have to get married at all. They shouldn't have to have a baby, either, if they've been told the right things. Well, all those things, that's how society does operate against us. It's very nasty about unmarried mothers. Indirectly. Oddly enough, it isn't through the people di rectly concerned. It isn't in the hospital. They were marvelous, you know. It's the people who give jobs and the people who have rooms and won't give them to un‐. married mothers. And that isn't my case, you know, be cause obviously I'm fine. I don't think, probably, I could live any other way. The thing is, I suppose, the general public. If they're put off by the things I do, if they don't agree, they won't, come and see me. I get lots of letters saying, “Your father:, should really be ashamed. I always admired your father, but you two sex maniacs, Lynn and Vanessa—I'll never see Sir Michael's films again.” They really do. It's kind of funny. And there are also, of course, a lot that are nastier and say things like, “If you ever appear in a West End theater again, there will be a group in the gallery that will make sure you will not be allowed to open your mouth.” * I think the first time I started to feel free was when I threw a plate at Franco and hoped I'd hit him. I didn't hit him, but I threw it, yes. It was a very, very un‐me kind of thing to do, although it's not un‐English. There's a certain little stratum of people in English society who throw plates and hairbrushes at each other, and cut crystal. But I didn't belong to that set. I behave differently when I'm speaking Italian and when I'm with Italians. I behave quite, quite differently. But that's because, indisputably, most of us are a little bit like chameleons and, being an actress, I'm probably even more like a chameleon. But if you give me warmth, I give you warmth back, right? It's how you feel about me, the feeling that I have from you. How you feel about me as a woman affects how I am to you as a woman. If you seem to think I'm awfully nice, I'm going to be awfully nice.

372-> NARCOTICS REFORM GOES TO COMMONS
LONDON, March 11—The British Government asked Par liament today for broad new powers to control the use of narcotics. Government Would Be Given Broad New Authority A proposed comprehensive drug bill would distinguish, for the first time in Britain, be tween possessing drugs and trafficking in them. Penalties would be reduced for the mere user but increased for the pusher. The bill would give the Home Secretary flexible powers to add new substances to the list of proscribed drugs. This pro vision is designed to meet what is considered the tendency of users to try new drugs as sup plies of old ones drop. The Home Secretary would also be given the authority to prohibit doctors from prescrib ing drugs if they have been prescribing “irresponsibly.” Overprescribing doctors would also be liable to the same crim inal penalties as traffickers. Under British laws dating from the 1920's, doctors are allowed to prescribe heroin to registered addicts. But in recent years there have been prosecu tions of doctors for prescrib ing so freely that their patients become sources of illegal sup ply. The decision to move now for a broad drug bill has both political and social significance. James Callaghan, the Home Secretary, is generally regard ed as a symbol of toughness on law enforcement questions. The governing Labor party is relying on this fact to counter Conservative charges that it is soft on “law and order.” Socially, the bill marks a recognition that Britain is be ginning to have a drug prob lem. It is tiny by American standards, only 2,782 addicts by official count in the whole country, but the use of heroin is increasing. The police and the Home Office say that over prescrip tion by doctors is the main reason for the recent growth of heroin addiction. They do not think smuggling is a major factor. Action Against Doctors The proposed law would let the Home Secretary act against doctors after a hearing before a panel of three doctors and possible appeal to a tribunal. The British Medical Association has indicated that it will not object to this system. In its new distinction be tween possession and traffick ing, the bill is in some ways similar to the omnibus drug legislation now before the United States Congress. But there are complexities. There would he three sepa rate categories of drugs, ranked by what, the Home Office thinks is their potential for human damage. In Class 1 would be opium, heroin, morphine and similar opiate narcotics, and, signifi cantly, such hallucinatory drugs as LSD. Also included would be injectable amphetamines, since authorities here feel injection of amphetamines is a dangerous phenomenon. Class 2 covers marijuana and stimulant pills of the ampheta mine type, such as drinamyl (purple hearts) and benzedrine In this category, also, is cod deine, in the weak form of tab” let commonly used to reliev pain. In the third class are what are termed “amphetamine‐like” drugs, so‐called pep pills, which are considered less dangerous under present knowledge. Trafficking in drugs of the first two classes would be sub ject to a maximum jail term of 14 years and an unlimited fine At present the maximum is 10 years and a fine of £1,000 ($2,400). Possession of heroin or the other Class 1 drugs could be punished by seven years in prison and an unlimited fine. The maximum sentences now are the same as for trafficking —10 years and a fine of £1,000. For possession of marijuana or other Class 2 drugs, the present maximum prison term would be cut in half, to five years, but again with an unlim ited fine. For those in Class 3, possession could be punished by two years and an unlimited fine. An official advisory commit tee headed by Lady Wootton had urged Mr. Callaghan. to re duce the penalties on mere'use of marijuana so that would no longer be a serious crime. The committee said it felt the fet; isting law was too hard, espe., cially on young people. The Home Secretary, while he did cut the maximuregn tence for possession in half, did not accept what he considered the too “permissive” approach of the Wootton. Committee. Using marijuana is still to be serious crime. However, the proposed stat ute would allow some new de fenses to prosecutions involv ing marijuana. For example, owners of house or other place where the police find marijuana could’ be convicted only if the prosecu tion could prove what laWyers call mens rea, guilty knowledge that the premises were being used for an illegal purpose. This clause was included4be cause of a recent case in which a woman tenant was convicted after marijuana had been found, in her apartment even though she had sublet it and iknew nothing about the matter. Ac tually, the higher courts have already reversed her conviction. Most of the 8,000 drug con victions in Britain last year were for possession. Few drew anything like the maximum sen tences. In fact, judges, perhaps reflecting the Wootton view, have been taking a more lenient line toward young users of marijuana. Home office experts fear, that fashions in drug‐taking may change rapidly. That is the rea son for the flexible clause al lowing the Home Secretary to add or subtract from the three classes of controlled drugs.

373-> Bridge
TAKING the low road is celebrated in song as the most effective road to Scotland, and in bridge books as the soundest policy for a defender in second position. Consequently play ers tend to play low automatically when a suit is led from the hand to their right. The rare cases in which it is right for the second player to play high are difficult to spot when the lead is made by the declarer, but even more difficult when the lead comes from dummy, and a player holding the king may be subjected to strong tempta tion. For example: If a small card is led from dummy it is poor defense for East to play the king. South cannot have jack‐ten when he plays in such fashion, and if he has the jack without the ten he will make exactly three tricks whatever East does. But if South does not have the jack he will be helped considerably if East plays the king, or even thinks about playing the king. The safest time to put up a king, although few players would think of it, is when dummy has no high cards in the suit. Such a play can hardly ever lose and may gain. It was the key to the defense on the diagramed deal played in a French tournament. The East hand was slightly too weak for a two‐level heart response according to the standards of Ameri can experts, who would simply raise to two spades. Over East's actual response South took his life in his hands by bidding three clubs. East‐West staggered on optimisti cally to four hearts, which would have been beaten by at least one trick and very likely two. But North finally emerged from obscurity with a bid of five clubs. He was not sure that four hearts could be defeated, and felt confident that South would come close to making five clubs. On the face of it South must lose two diamond tricks and a heart trick in five clubs doubled, but the de fense proved to be tricky. West's opening lead of the spade queen was taken by the ace, and South ruffed a spade in the dummy. The next lead was the diamond three, and East routinely played “second hand low.” South put on the jack and the queen won, leaving West with a problem. It would have been entirely reasonable for him to shift to a heart, but as it happens that would have presented South with his contract. The declarer would have been forced to play low from dummy, and when the queen won he would have drawn trumps and claimed his game. In practice West continued with a low spade, which was ruffed in dum my. South led to the club ace and returned to the club king in dummy. The position was then this: Another diamond was led, and East missed his second and last chance to play “second hand high.” West won with the ace, and the de fense was helpless. South was now in a position to ruff out the diamond king and discard his heart loser to make the contract. East should have realized early in the play that his partner must have the diamond ace. West had opened the bidding with a spade suit headed by queen‐jack, and presumably did not have king‐queen of hearts as he had not led the suit. And he could hardly have had the club ace in view of South's overcall. The play of the diamond king would have permitted East to lead a heart, and the contract would have been defeated. In the future he will know that the high road may sometimes be best, even when the low road seems obvious and tempt ing.

374-> Trinidad Presses Mutiny Talks As Dissidents Are Rounded Up
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, April 23—The Government of Trinidad and Tobago pressed its negotiations today with a hold out faction of black‐power ad vocates in the armed forces who mutinied on Tuesday. At the same time, the police con tinued to round up anti‐Gov ernment activists. A spokesman for the rebel soldiers said that talks had been going on since Tuesday with a delegation of Govern ment officials led by the Attor ney General, Karl Hudson Phil lips. The spokesman would not go into detail about what was being discussed except to say that Government officials were trying to get the rebels to give up their arms. Government officials declined to comment on the matter. At a police news conference this afternoon the officials only col lected questions. They promised to deliver answers tomorrow morning at another news con ference. The number of mutineers could not be learned. This nation, with a popula tion of close to a million, has 2,000 policemen, 720 members of the Defense Force and 160 members of the Coast Guard. One Government source said that, if need be, the Govern ment could arm at least 3,000 civilians. Meanwhile, six American warships, carrying 2,000 battle equipped marines, cruised the tropical waters off the northern coast of Trinidad. American Embassy spokes men said there was no current plan to bring the ships closer than about 50 miles offshore unless there was the need to evacuate American civilians. Embassy officials estimated that there were more than thousand American citizens res ident here and several hundred tourists, in addition to about 150 Air Force personnel at tracking station. The naval force is made up of a helicopter carrier, the Guadalcanal, two landing craft, one supply ship and a frigate. A state of emergency was declared Tuesday morning when the Government at tempted to block a black‐power demonstration that might have been joined by dissident labor union members and striking sugar workers. Relative calm has prevailed in this city for the last two days, although an occasional shot can be heard. Business was brisk this morn ing but shops at the commercial section closed for the day at noon. Shopkeepers and carpen ters were busy along the main thoroughfare, Fredericks Street, boarding up broken windows. The mutineers, who support the black‐power demonstrators, have taken over a part of the Defense Force's camp at nearby Teteron Bay. Many government offices here are closed. At least some public officials are under police guard and are inaccessible even by telephone. Among those arrested today was Geddes Granger, chairman of the National Joint Action Committee, an amalgamation of organizations. The committee, has led the series of black power demonstrations that brought about the current con troversy, Mr. Granger, who of fered no resistance, was ar rested while having breakfast in a restaurant in the town of Couva, 20 miles away. With Mr. Granger's arrest, Government forces have the four principal dissident leaders of the nation's black‐power movement in custody. The oth ers are Clive Nunez, a Cuba trained officer in the Transport Workers Union; George Weeks, chairman of the Oil Field Workers Union, and Chan Maharaj, leader of the National Freedom Organization, all are associated with the National Joint Action Committee. With the exception of Mr Maharaj, who is of East Indian descent, all are of African de scent. Trinidad and Tobago, an in dependent state within the Brit ish Commonwealth since 1956, is considered by mny a model interracial community. Negroes (45 per cent), East Indians (35 per cent) and Europeans, Chi nese and Syrians live together with a minimum of friction. Ne groes and Indians usually vote for their own political candi dates, however. Some 18 per cent of the population is of mixed blood and most of these are so‐called “Douglas” a nondisparaging term for a Negro‐East Indian Mixture. The current emergency began as a protest demonstration two months ago by university stu dents here who objected to a trial of West Indian students on riot charges in Montreal. Demonstrations followed al most daily. Soon the city's army of unemployed youths, dissident workers and civil servants joined the protests that very often cut across racial lines. Black ‐ powered demonstra tors pointed out many times that “we mean no harm to our black Indian brothers.” After two months of demon strations and many nighttime fire‐bombings, a massive march was planned for Tuesday that would have included elements of the urban black poor, mem bers of the 15,000‐member East Indian sugar cane workers union, who went on strke last week, and striking mailmen and utilities workers. The Government declared state of emergency Tuesday morning and arrested scores of the principals. When the police sought to clear the streets of people gathering for the march, the violence broke out. Although the battle cry in the Trinidad disorders was “Black power!,” close observers here feel that economic prob lems and unemployment would have brought the same result to Trinidad no matter what the slogans. Unemployment here is estimated at 20 to 25 per cent or more. Although Trinidad has a non white government, this does not deter the cries of black power. Dissidents allege that while the Government is black, it allows white economic exploitation of the country. White foreign in terests do control the oil, na tural gas, sugar and tourist in dustries of Trinidad.

375-> FULBRIGHT OFFERS LAOS RESOLUTION; NIXON CHALLENGED
WASHINGTON, March 11— Senator J. W. Fulbright, chair man of the Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a reso lution today challenging Presi dent Nixon's authority to com mit American troops or air craft to combat in Laos. The resolution would express the “sense of the Senate” that the President could not commit American forces to combat in or over Laos without “affirma tive action” by Congress. The resolution would not be binding upon the President nor would it inhibit him from tak ing any military action in Laos. It may become a focal point, however, for a concerted Sen ate attack upon the Adminis tration's policies in Laos. [In Vientiane, Maj. Gen. Vang Pao, commander of the American‐sponsored clandes tine army fighting the Com munist forces, was reliably reported to have asked the Laotian Premier, Prince Sou vanna Phouma, to consider evacuating the entire civilian population from the northern region that is his stronghold. The step was reportedly in tended as preparation for the general's defense of his head quarters. Page 3.] Mr. Fulbright's resolution will be referred to the Foreign Re lations Committee, where, as chairman, he will be able to press for approval. Sees Surrender of Power In a speech on introducing the resolution, Senator Ful bright declared: “The Senate must not remain silent now while the President uses the armed forces of the United States to, fight an unde clared and undisclosed war in Laos. “Acquiescence now in even limited use of air power in Laos will mean the Senate has surrendered one more legisla tive power to the executive.” In essence, the resolution presents a Constitutional chal lenge to the President, ques tioning his authority to commit forces to combat in Laos with out the specific approval of Congress. At least by implica tion, the resolution suggests that the President has exceeded his constitutional authority in authorizing the use of Ameri can planes in combat over Laos. “The President does not have authority, nor has Congress given him authority, to engage in combat operations in Laos, whether on the land, in the air or from the sea,” the Sena tor declared. In his policy statement on Laos last week, Mr. Nixon ac knowledged that American planes were providing tactical air support to Royal Laotian forces. At the same time, the Administration has insisted that no American ground forces were engaged in combat in Laos and that none would be committed without the specific approval. of Congress,. Senator Fulbright, however, dismissed as “specious” the “ef forts that have been made to distinguish between combat ac tion in the air and combat ac tion on the ground.” “If the President has author ity to engage American air forces in a country with which we have no treaty or other obligation and without the ap proval of Congress,” he said, “he has a similar authority to engage our ground combat forces. “The Constitution is clear. It is the Congress which has the power to declare war and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces of the United States. “If the Senate is to remain silent while the President uses air forces in an Asian country With his authority as Corn gress, we should remain silent about his use of ground com bat forces.” In arguing that the President had no constitutional authority to commit American planes to Icombat in the Laotian war, Senator Fulbright noted that the United States has “no treaty or other national com mitment to the Government of Laos or to any faction in that country.” Nor, he continued, has Con gress “granted authority to the President to wage war there.” With his authority as com mander in Chief of the armed forces, the President, the Sena tor acknowledged, has author ity to dispatch American forces abroad, but he argued this was only for the purposes of pro tecting American citizens. Says President's Limited One possible basis of author ity, he conceded, is the Gulf of Tokin Resolution of 1964, in which Congress gave its ap proval to “all necessary meas ures” that might be taken by the President to repel Commu nist aggression in Southeast Asia. The Tonkin Resolution, Sen ator Fuibright said, may be “broad enough to authorize the President to engage the armed forces of the United States in stooping North Vietnamese traf fie headed for South, Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh Trail.” But he argued that the reso lution did not authorize “the use of any United States armeo forces in action in Laos whiCh is unrelated to the war in Viet nam.” Repulbicans Reluctant For nearly two weeks Sena tor Fulbright has been consid ering introduction of a resolu tion as a way of focusing Sen ate opposition to the American military involvement in Laos. He had hoped to indroduce it with bipartisan sponsorship, bu finally decided to proceed on his own when he found Repub lican Senators on. the Foreign Relations Committee generally endorsing his approach but re luctant to become cosponsors. The Fulbright proposal draws heavily upon the National Com mitments Resolution approved by the Senate two years ago. That resolution specified that a military commitment to a for eign power could be based only on “affirmative action” taken by both the Executive. Branch and Congress, such as through a treaty or a convention. Similarly, the new Fulbright resolution‐specifies that author. ity to commit American armed forces to combat in or over Laos must rest upon “affirma tive action” taken by the Con gress as well as the Executive Branch. Text of Resolution Following is the text of the resolution: “Whereas, the United States has‘ not by treaty or other con stitutional procedure under taken to engage American military forces in combat in Laos; and “Whereas, United States Air Force and other American mili tary personnel have neverthe less become increasingly in volved in, and have suffered casualties as a result of, com bat activities in Laos distinct from the interdiction of mili tary supplies or forces destined for South Vietnam; and “Whereas,. the nature and extent of U.S. military involve ment in Laos has not been completely communicated to the American people: “Now therefore be it resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that the Con stitution of the United States requires that authority for the use of United States armed forces in combat in or over Laos must be predicated upon, “affirmative action taken by the executive and legislative branches of the United States Government through means of a treaty, convention, or other legislative instrumentality spe cifically intended to give ef fect” to the commitment of American forces in Laos as agreed to by the Senate in the so‐called Commitment Resolution.”

378-> CITY OPENS STUDY OF POLICING POLICE
Mayor Lindsay announced yesterday the formation of a special five‐man committee to review the city's procedures for investigating police corruption. The announcement followed a series of meetings in the last two weeks at City Hall and police headquarters after the administration learned that The New York Times had begun a survey of police corruption. Mr. Lindsay, in a press re lease issued without comment, said the new committee would “analyze the record in several corruption cases over the past few years to determine whether different procedures would have been helpful.” City Hall observers could not recall a previous occasion in re cent history when a Mayor of New York announced an inves tigation of how the city dealt with police corruption. The Mayor made his an nouncement after meeting with the city's five District At torney's, Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary, Investiga tion Commissioner Robert K. Ruskin and J. Lee Rankin, the City Corporation Counsel. The group also discussed existing legislation involving the control of corruption, including a provision in the city's Administrative Code that allows police officers to retire with pension on 30 days' notice even if they are being investigated for alleged corruption, the an nouncement said. The 30‐day requirement was added to the code in the early nineteen‐fifties following the disclosure by Harry Gross, Brooklyn bookmaker, that he was paying out millions of dol lars a year in graft to the police. As a result of his charge 77 policemen were indicted— from assistant chief inspector down, hundreds of policemen resigned and three committed suicide. Prior to the Gross scandal, a policeman could retire im mediately after giving notice. In the last few months, at least two policemen accused of accepting graft have by dif ferent stradagems managed to resign from the Police Depart ment before the completion of departmental trials. Experienced lawyers say the primary reason for avoiding departmental trial is that much less proof is required to dis miss or otherwise punish a policeman than to convict him of a criminal charge. Commissioner Leary this year unsuccessfully sought legisla tion in Albany that would have lengthened the period a police man may be refused permis sion to retire when he is under investigation. Mr. Rankin was selected as chairman of the special com mittee. The other members are Mr. Leary, Mr. Ruskin, Man hattan District Attorney Frank S. Hogan and Bronx District Attorney Burton B. Roberts. Mr. Rankin said he defined corruption as “wrongdoing for personal or other gain.” The Mayor's press secretary, Tom Morgan, said the admin istration expected the commit tee to report its find ings “soon.” A police spokes man said Commissioner Leary would have no comment on the new committee. In addition to considering how charges of police corrup tion are handled, the partici pants at yesterday's meeting also discussed the operation of the Federal‐state‐city Narcotics Enforcement Task Force. This group, announced by Attorney General John N. Mitchell and Mr. Lindsay just before last year's June primary, began its operations here eight months later, on Feb. 2, 1970. The task force is composed of Federal narcotics agents the state police and city detectives.

379-> The Undiscovered Country
The question: Is Julian Mitchell's novel merely bright, or does it say something important? A bit of both, perhaps, but not enough of either to get very far into the new year. It comes with the highest recommenda tions from Britain, where the late Aldous Huxley and similar intellec tual saints have been invoked in its praise. It arrives in an America so saturated in angst and so high on sex that Mitchell's literary gifts may go unheralded for having been em ployed in the service of yesterday's neurosis. At the age of 35, he writes like a truly wise man: a man of about 65, but truly wise. “The Undiscovered Country” is divided into two novels. The first, “A Friend in Need,” is straight real ism, narrated by a writer named Julian Mitchell; the fictional Julian corresponds in most ways to the authorial Julian. It deals exclusively with his friendship and chance meet ings with Charles Humphries over a period of around 20 years. The second half of the book is a fantastic satire entitled “The New Satyricon.” Allegedly written by Charles during the last several years of life, it sug gests the volcanic sexuality within him partly hidden during the later period of Julian's narrative. The two books are joined in one's memory by Julian's recitation of Charles's gradual sliding away from reality via conscience and the gonads. A homosexual, Charles becomes bi sexual, sadistic, and finally a suicide. Judging from “The New Satyricon” there was only one thing Charles's psyche couldn't induce—literature. It's a grinding bore (tedious vari ations of Nabokov, Kafka, Genet, etc.), and Julian's intense seriousness about it supports an earlier sus picion. He should have damned well stopped struggling and gone to bed with Charles. The two meet for the first time as boys in an English boarding school during World War II. Charles is a sophisticated rebel, fascinated by news of Nazi atrocities. Julian is a little Mr. Good Judgment. Later, they keep running into one another, as national service naval trainees (Julian, a midshipman; Charles on the Russian course), as students at Oxford and Cambridge, in Los Angeles as writer and wanderer, and finally back in England. Julian's movement is all upward: published poet, traveling fellow, suc cessful novelist and critic. Charles's progress is as a 20th‐century intellec tual dropout. Yet Charles always emits a faint signal—despite his sexual barbarism, his Hell's Angels bit, his nervous breakdown—of be coming something else. There is, indeed, an undiscovered country in him, and the mild fascination of this novel is in trying to understand what leads him to do his own self destructive thing so relentlessly. Much of the author's intelligence addresses this subject. Abandoning Cambridge because “academic life is for those who can't find satisfaction in the world as is,” Charles thinks “the only toler able approach to the human situation in our time is that of the wholly, devotedly, unfit man.” In California, where Julian finds Charles bugging out with the beatniks, Julian tells us Charles and his friends “seemed to be sleep‐walking through life, to be living only as symbols of revolt, never as revolutionaries.” The whole California scene gets hard knocks, as joyous bisexuals make it outside convention and with anyone handy. “They claimed that they were never jealous, but jealousy might at least have demonstrated that there was some real feeling between them.” Clearly, Julian means for us to take Charles as more than a gifted young man who goes wrong. He symbolizes “the logic of anti‐reason which allows the individual to do anything he wants because he wants it and denies the right of society to interfere with him in the pursuit of his pleasure.” Unfortunately, the author cannot successfully move Charles from this position of repre senting social nihilism to conviction as a human being operating accord ing to recognizable motives. One be lieves completely that some young men like Charles do behave as he does. One does not believe that char acter flaws, environment, human encounter inevitably drive Charles to suicide. His behavior remains an inexplicable mystery, a virulent The flaw is either in Mitchell's conception of Charles or in the form of the novel. We never see Charles except through Julian's eyes. We do not see him at those crucial moments of exercising choice. Instead, we wit ness the effect of choice after the essential action has been taken. The book becomes an elaborate and, I suspect, highly autobiographical so cial commentary, a minor investiga tion into the novel as vehicle of transmitting information, a work easily forgotten as one turns to hard news of social disasters inundating our youth. Charles has not been made worthy of our or Mitchell's attention—except that he was loved by the Julian Mitchell within the novel. Thus, this is an authentically homosexual novel. Loving. Inoffensive. No catalogue of sodomy. Socially responsive. A mar ginal achievement.

380-> MORTGAGE CEILING IN JERSEY RAISED
TRENTON, April 15—Warn ing that the construction of housing in New Jersey has fallen drastically, the State Banking Commissioner an nounced today that he was increasing the state ceiling on interest rates on conventional home mortgage loans from 7½ to 8 per cent. James C. Brady Jr., the new head of the State Department of Banking, said that the exist ing ceiling had “virtually elimi nated all conventional lending by our traditional mortgage sources.” “The figures were appalling,” Commissioner Brady said. “The housing starts in New Jersey were 50 per cent less than they were five years ago.” He said he was reasonably certain that the higher rate, which went into effect at midnight, would open up the home mort gage loan market in New Jer sey and attract investment funds from outside the state. The ceiling in New York is 7½ per cent and in Pennsyl vania 7 per cent. At 7½ per cent, a $30,000 mortgage over 25 years costs $221.70 a month. At 8 per cent, the same loan will ost $231.55. While officials of the New jersey Bankers Association were expressing some optimism that the higher rate would ease the housing crisis here, New York officials took a different attitude. William T. Dentzer, the Act ing Superintendent of the New Fork State Banking Board, said he doubted that a similar in crease in New York would make banks any more willing, to invest in home mortgages. New Jersey officials said that it was possible that the increase here would prompt similar in creases in New York and Penn sylvania to keep those states competitive with New Jersey's higher rate. However, legisla tion would be needed to raise the rates in New York and Mr. Dentzer said none was con templated. Even with the increase here, the conventional interest ceil ing will still be approximately 1 percentage point less than the loans insured by the Fed eral Housing Administration, and the Veterans Administra tion. Both Federal agencies have increased their ceilings to 8½ per cent. However, a 0.5 per cent insurance charge and the so‐called points that banks add to the cost of granting F.H.A. and V.A. loans, raise their ef fective rates to slightly above 9 per cent.

381-> Nationalists' Margin Cut in South Africa
DURBAN, South Africa, April 23 — Tile Nationalist party of Premier John Vorster has been returned to power with a re duced but still overwhelming majority in Parliament. For the first time in 22 years of rule it has lost a significant amount of support to the oppo sition United party. The voting yesterday reflected a shift in mildly leftward direction among many white voters ers. The Nationalists realized Mr. Vorster's aim of completely crushing far right‐wing splinter group, the Reconstituted Na tionalist party, formed last year by a former Cabinet Minister, Dr. Albert Hertzog. But Mr. Vorster failed in his attempt to bring English‐speaking whites into the Nationalist fold. The Hertzog group, which called for an end to diplo matic contacts with black Af rican states and an even more harsh brand of white suprem acy at home, failed to win a single seat. In the old Parlia ment it had four members, who were elected as Nationalists but bolted to form the new party. The Reconstituted National ists' 79 candidates managed to poll only a total of 50,000 votes. The liberal Progressive par ty's sole representative in Par liament, Mrs. Helen Suzman, was re‐elected with a greatly increased majority. The votes for the 18 other Progressive candidates showed a substan tial increase, mostly at the ex pense of the United Party. With only a few predictable results from outlying areas to come, it is clear that in the new parliamental Nationalist party, which advocates terri torial apartheid, or separation of races, through creation of separate independent states called Bantustans, will have 117 seats. It had 119 in the old Parliament. The united party, which re sists fragmentation of the coun try and advocates representa tion for Africans in Parliament by whites, will have 48, a gain of nine. In domestic political terms, the election appears to be severe personal setback for Mr. Vorster. By calling elec tions a year earlier than re quired, he had hoped not only a crush the Hertzog group but also to and the base of the Nationalist into a united white front, including the English speaking whites. He all but destroyed the Hertzog movement and he dem onstrated that the Nationalist party was able to hold the loyalty of most Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch settlers. But the English‐speaking whites rejected him and turned out with unfamiliar vigor to vote for their traditional par ties. Mr. Vorster had hoped that the English would react to the rightists by supporting him in an attempt to keep the extrem ists out. But the government majorities were reduced in vir tually every contest. This loss of support was viewed as a reaction to a re gime that is considered by some to be administratively flabby and inefficient, increas ingly careless about bread‐and butter interests of the elector ate and less and less concerned about softening or even con cealing injustices to nonwhites under the apartheid policy. The cautious United party can hard ly be called liberal, and by standards of the outside world the election result may seem to indicate little change. But viewed in the context of South Africa's static political tradi tion, it does at least reflect what the Rand Daily Mail of Johannesburg called in an edi torial today “a trend towards moderation.” The question now is whether er Mr. Vorster, conscious of the slight swing leftward as re flected in the failure of the Hertzog group and gains by the opposition, will press ahead more vigorously with his “out ward” diplomatic policies, which appear to be supported by whites of all parties, or whether he will press ahead with apartheid do an attempt to buttress his position within the Nationalist party. It also remains to be seen whether the United party, with the more liberal Progressives threatening it from the left, will adopt more liberal policies. While any shifts across the political spectrum will of course be an all‐white affair, the primary issue remains what it has always been — what to do about the nonwhites. As usual, they appeared pas sively unconcerned in public about the events of the last two days. The turnout among South Af rica's 2.2 million eligible white voters was put at nearly 90 per cent. None of the country's 14.8 million nonwhites — 12.4 million Africans, 547,000 Asians and 1.8 million coloreds (mixed races)—was permitted to vote.

382-> The Lambert Revels
What fun! You lucky lucky read ers. Here is a period piece, gay, sexy, comic and discriminating. Since these glimpses of a certain place at a certain moment are getting fewer, it is pure joy to come on one so sure in its handling and its ambience, even if the subject is as unlikely as this— English colonials in County Wicklow in the early 1950's. Admittedly, the joy is minor, but collector's items usually are. Both the connoisseur of comedies of manners and the arm chair sociologist will recognize Ter ence de Vere White's novel as vin tage stuff. The story unrolls with the mouth watering quality of exclusive gos sip, for it carries us into the Lam bert Mile, an Irish village jealously guarded by its Anglo‐Irish and Anglo inhabitants. The plot, if such it can be called, hangs on a bogus Count — who is neither Irish nor English— and his 11th‐hour attempts to ward off creditors and buy Mount Lambert (the Big House) to use as a stud farm. The complication is the arrival from Majorca of 21‐year‐old Elizabeth Lambert, daughter of the absent own ers of the House — who, like her mother, is a lover of the Count — and the arrival of the Coppingers (up starts by the standards of the Mile), who also want to buy Mount Lam bert. What fleshes out the story, just like life, are the dozen or so people who get involved in the bankruptcy, the purchase or the series of disas trous parties held in honor of Eliza beth. In these unfolding events the oneupmanship of the English charac ter is shown and shown up; the only thing that keeps some of the author's characters from seeming as horrible as those English people in “A Pas sage to India” is, paradoxically, his deadly humor, truly all‐embracing hu mor which includes in its scope such sacrosanct things as sex, money and the nonentity of most human beings, and which couldn't care less about nationality. The characters are so familiar they must be types, but if so they are types with the idiosyncracies of indi viduals; a laconic exact phrase here, a perfect reproduction of speech there, produces them in the round because the reader already recogniz es them. But what sparks our interest is what Mr. White so deliciously adds, not only the view from within this assorted group, but the view very much from without. For instance, the Canon is a bore, never mind him, but from his (of course) Long‐suffering wife flash some memorable considerations, such as: “She had seen him in his shirt and even less. . . . She had been his part ner in moments when his feelings got the better even of his syntax.” When the bulky Mrs. Browne, who is a par ticularly active social climber, and Captain Loftus, who is the lowest in the Mile pecking order, somehow share champagne: “After the first bottle, the Captain realized what never struck him or anyone before, that Mrs. Browne was a desirable woman. . . . Lying back in the chair her thighs had a certain magnifi cence . . . like the entrance to the War Office.” Or we recognize Barbara Bedding ton as a type, but a type seldom described. Here, with an exquisite blend of admiration and amusement, she is delineated for all time: the correct, beautiful and beautifully pre served spinster who is witty, poised, perceptive, self‐aware and eventually in love (with the Count.) But how accurately the Count sizes up not only her but himself when he thinks in a sort of travesty of Andrew Mar vell: “If Miss Beddington were to sur render, he would be involved in end less attentions, reassurances, misgiv ings, conferences, post mortems—it would become a confounded bore. If only she could be satisfied with a sample of his prowess, for he was loth to take and not give what would mean so much to her and cost him so little: and he had often done more to oblige someone to whom he owed only a civility. But Miss Beddington deserved and would expect to be treated as a great occasion. . . . He knew Miss Beddington — rather, he knew what he would know if he knew her; and he knew what an un holy fuss he would be expected to make over the treasure he could so without.” The Count himself is a rare achieve ment; not everyone can deal with a complex mesomorph whose phoniness is as convincing as his authority. Mi chael the gentle simpleton is deftly sketched as the only one in the story who sees clearly and acts rightly. But it is Elizabeth, a new‐style young woman, who is as real as this minute and as appealing — generous, hon est, unblinking, sexually free, wise beyond her years. Her authentic tone comes through in her conversation— perhaps most typically when the Count gives her an old pitch of his about comradeship. She says, “O cut it out, Ritzy. You know I can't live without you.” ■ As you can see, a civilized pleasure lies ahead.

383-> Syracuse Athletics Charged With 'Chronic Racism' in Report on Football Suspension of 8 Blacks
The suspension of eight black athletes who boycotted football practice at Syracuse University last spring was “an act of institutional racism unworthy of a great univer sity,” a special investigative committee at Syracuse has concluded. In a 38‐page report pre pared after 10 weeks of testi mony and published yester day in a student‐owned news paper, the 12‐member com mittee declared that “racism in the Syracuse University Athletic Department Is real, chronic, largely unintention al, and sustained and compli cated unwittingly by many modes of behavior common in American athletics and long‐standing at Syracuse University.” The committee noted that “the personnel of the athlet ic department showed un warranted insensitivity to at tempts by black players to question such [discrimina tory] treatment.” The committee's report was presented yesterday to Dr. John E. Corbally, the Syracuse chancellor. It is ex pected to be released offi cially by the chancellor's of fice this afternoon, and news conference has been called for tomorrow after noon by Dr. Corbally, pre sumably to comment on its contents. The report was published in Dialog by Alan Stamm; the editor and publisher, and one of the members of the committee. Stamm, 21 years old and a senior journalism major from New York City, said the text published in Di alog was reviewed and edited by the committee last week. The committee made nine recommendations, of which the following three are the most significant: Suspended black players should not be punished for focusing attention on the need for a racially diversi fied coaching staff, and re quests should be made to al low the athletes an addition‐. al year of eligibility. The present administra tive board on athletics should be dissolved as soon as pos sible and replaced by an Athletic Policy Board. This new board of faculty mem bers, students, alumni and administrators should have the responsibility for over policy and direction, con trol and supervision of in tercollegiate and intramural A new code for Syracuse athletes should emphasize that athletes enjoy the same basic personal rights as all other students at Syracuse, and thus such things as per sonal appearance, social ac tivities and political expres sion are matters of individual choice insofar as they do not interfere with the rights of others. The committee of three trustees, five professors, three students and one ad ministrator was formed on Sept, 24 by Dr. Corbally to study the events that prompted the boycott of spring practice by the eight blacks and led to their sus‐ Ben Schwartzwalder, the head coach. “The definition of the spring boycott merely as an issue of violating coaching author ity, and the penalizing of black athletes without taking into consideration the broad er context of their protest was an act of institutional racism unworthy of a great university,” the report stated. The blacks were officially reinstated after Dr. Corbally's intervention, but none ac tually joined the team and several were academically ineligible to compete. Among those eligible to return were Al Newton, a fullback, and Greg Allen, a halfback, who were the team's two leading ground‐gainers during the 1969 season. Syracuse lost its first three games this year and finished with a 6‐4 won‐lost record. The 61‐year‐old Schwartz walder, pictured as “insensi tive to changing student con cerns” by the committee, has declined comment. But one member of the athletic de partment, who asked for anonymity pending an offi cial release of the report, said the material published in the student paper failed to define the problems. “Maybe something's the matter with my thinking,” the source said. “But I don't see how one side can be exonerated completely and the other side condemned so completely.” Problems in the athletic department, the committee concluded, are hampered by ineffective communications between players and coaches and between coaches and ad ministrators. The report also said that coaches on Schwartzwalder's staff had a “negligible awareness” of players’ interest in decisions governing their lives, educa tion and careers. The committee studied va rious allegations made by the black athletes. These areas included name‐calling, poor medical treatment, uneven academic advisement and as sistance between blacks and whites, recruiting, coaching harassment and the failure of the athletic department to hire black assistant coaches. A black coach, Carlmon Jones, was hired at Syracuse last August, but the report said that the “legitimate re quest; made as early as the spring of 1969, that a black assistant football coach should be hired, was ignored; that the athletic department was grossly insensitive to the legitimacy and meaning of this request; that signs of in creasing estrangement be tween the black football play ers and the white coaching staff were ignored; and that an effective corrective meas use—the hiring of a black as sistant—was not taken until after the black athletes boy cotted spring practice.’ “It is the opinion of the committee that the disap pointment and frustration over the black coach issue were the primary substantive causes of the boycott of spring practice,” the report said. The report also said that “the lines of authority with in the athletic department were poorly structured.” “Further,” the report con tinues, “it [the committee] finds a totaly unsatisfactory response on the part of the athletic director [James Decker] to the year‐long crisis:” The committee recom mended that Chancellor Cor bally review the functions of the athletic director with the purpose of strengthening the authority of the office. The committee conducted 28 hearings and quzstioned more than 40 witnesses, in cluding current and former players, all football coaches, the athletic director, adminis trators and Dr. Corbally. Stamm said the complete tes timony totaled 604 pages.

386-> 3 Blacks in the House Admonish Nixon
WASHINGTON, July 24 — Three black Congressmen, un happy because the President has been unwilling to meet with them for five months, released today a joint letter to him saying the patience of many black Americans is exhausted.” They said his course was des tined to destroy all chance for national unity and urged him to listen to the views of black Americans. The sharply worded letter was one evidence of an apparent rise in discontent with The Nixon Administration among influential blacks. This discontent appears to have been fanned by remarks earlier this week by Whitney M. Young Jr., executive direc tor of the National Urban League. The critics regard his words as unjustifiably kind to the Administration. Mr. Young said Monday that the Administration was not consciously antiblack and that the time had come for black leaders tb meet with white leaders in an effort to solve racial problems. A group of black public figures contemplated issuing a public rebuttal to Mr. Young's statements but pulled back, at least for the time being, out of fear of creating an impression of divisiveness in the black community. Marian Wright Edelman, a Washington civil rights lawyer, spoke out today, however, calling the speech a disservice to blacks. The three Congressmen re leased their letter as President Nixon departed for San Cle mente, Calif. “Since you assumed office,” the letter said, “you have traveled to all corners of the earth emphasizing your concern for many problems . . . but you have not come to black America.” The signers, all Democrats, were William L. Clay of Mis souri, Augustus F. Hawkins of California and Louis Stokes of Ohio. They are among the nine black members of Congress who on Feb. 18 requested a meeting with the President to convey their views of social problems. “We didn't get an answer for two months,” Mr. Stokes said today. “And then we got letter from a staff assistant nobody has ever heard of say ing don't call the President, he'll call you.” The new letter was endorsed by at least some of the six other black Congressmen, who were out of town when it was sent last night. The letter said the Presi dent's course “is destined to destroy all possibilities of unity and brotherhood.” Alluding to Mr. Young's remarks, they said the important issue was not whether or not an individual black believed the Administra tion was antiblack but whether or not the President could jus tify policies “which are clearly detrimental” to blacks. Early this month, Bishop Stephen G. Spottswood, chair man of the National Associa tion for the Advancement of Colored People, called the Ad ministration anti‐Negro. Mr. Young took a more mod erate view, arguing that blacks should work with liberal forces inside the Administration. Mrs. Edelman said today that Mr. Young was wrong to praise “nebulous proposals” of the Administration and should in stead be pressing for concrete results. She released a statement, re sponding to the Administra tion's public rebuttal of Bishop Spottswood. The statement applauded recent school desegregation ac tions but challenged the Ad ministration's assertions on civil rights progress.

387-> ‘O.K., Amigos, Join the Jam!’
FALLOWFIELD, MASS. THOUSANDS of music lovers streamed into this tiny town in the Berkshire Mountains today to hear the final concert in the annual Interwoven Summer Festival of Classical Music. The crowd, which spread over several acres of neatly manicured grass, gave an enthusiastic response to the music, despite a few unexpected ?? changes. The ?? unorthodox ?? by the respected ?? de l'Haricot Vert, under the baton of JeanPaul‐Pierre Baton, reportedty was influenced by several young rock ‘n’ roll musicians who had performed at the festival the previous evening. According to a source close to the orchestra, the two schools of musicians met at a party given by the festival management late last night. “These cats may look weird,” said the orchestra's concertmaster, Bruno Andante, “but they're beautiful. Their sound is something else. Like they know how to let it all hang out.” The contemporary influence on the normally solemn French orchestra was evident even before the music started. The performers left their usual concert attire in their dressing rooms and walked briskly on stage, in a cloud of sweet‐smelling smoke, wearing see‐through shirts and lavender bell‐bottom trousers. Ignoring the announced allBeethoven program, which was to have begun with the “Leanore Overtures,” the orchestra led oft instead with a performance of “Variations on ‘Come On, Baby, Light My Fire'.” Cigarette‐like objects were observed being passed among the musicians, and there were frequent shouts of encouragement from the harpist, Yvette (“BoomBoom”) Chateauneuf, whose continual cry of “Do it, baby!” inspired both oboists to cut their lips. The 79‐year‐old Maestro Baton, acknowledging the long applause that greeted the “Variations,” jumped from the stage and made his way through the audience, warmly shaking hands with his admirers and telling them, “Zank you, zank you, muzeek lovairs. You are all make zee muzeek weeth us. You geeve us zed good vibrations.” While M. Baton mingled with the audience, three members of the renowned Belles Lettres String Quartet, with their instruments, walked on stage accompanied by the fabled master of the cello, Pablo Pablo. The audience was hushed as the cello‐less Senor Pablo fted a new harmonica to his mouth, gave a cue to the rest of the quartet and played a well ‐known blues number, “Oh, It Hurts Me, Mama, Just Like You Told Me It Would.” After the second chorus, he turned to the orchestra and shouted, “Okay, amigos, join the jam!” The 106‐piece ensemble joined in. The resulting 58‐minute performance is believed to have been the largest jam session ever to have taken place in the Berkshires. During intermission, the quartet's violist, Mischa Goss, sustained what doctors described as “an acute hallucinatory reaction, cause unknown.” Whistling “When the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day,” he tore the strings from his instrument and swallowed them. The final work, the only scheduled piece that was heard, was the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven. Augmented by a chorus from Miss Phoebe's Academy, of Laramie, Wyo., the orchestra engaged in a ten‐minute “rap session,” presided over by the conductor. By a vote of 110 to 72, with Mlle. Cha teauneuf abstaining, the group decided to start with the second movement. “Well, Man,” a second violinist explained later, “we like felt that to really communicate with like every thing that's happening, Continued on Page 18 you have to dig it. You know what I mean? Like really dig it.” For the chorale movement, the orchestra and chorus left the stage and filed through the audience to a small wading pool, where they removed their clothing and concluded the symphony. The festival's promoter, S. Meinkind, said shortly after the event that the festival had been “an unqualified success” and that he was particularly pleased by the final evening's performance. “Outasight!” he told reporters. “That Orchestra de l'Haricot Vert—they had their heads together! Did you catch the tympanist during his 128‐bar rest? Dynamite!” Local police officials reported two arrests during the largely peaceful festival. Both persons apprehended were charged with applauding between movements.

388-> A Costa Rican Find
COSTA RICA in 1965 released six stamps and a souvenir sheet to commemorate the XVIIIth Olympiad in Tokyo in 1964, it not being an unusual procedure for some countries to remember past events, especially when there are subject‐matter, or topical, collectors who dote on such stamp issues for events such as Olympic Games. The stamps were produced by offset or lithography by the Colombia printing plant of the British security printers, Thomas De La Rue of London. Each depicted an event of the Games, the 5‐ring Olympic symbol and runners, bicyclists, judo, basketball, soccer, hands holding torches with Mount Fuji in the background. Two of the latter stamps, in varying colors, were on the souvenir sheet. One of the stamps has been discovered with its lavender background missing, and the orange‐pink tones of Japan's Rising Sun, which formed part of the background within lines denoting a stadium, somewhat mottled. The discoverer is Marvin Seidelman, an engineer at WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times. The find was made in a batch of foreign stamps sent to him by a relative in California who works for a commercial firm that receives an abundance of overseas mail. A normal copY, with all its colors and tones, was in the same bundle of pieces of paper torn from envelopes. The variety is on the 10 centavos, showing three bicyclists. The black of the impression is clear, but somewhat mottled, as shown in the illustration at the right above. Both stamps were, apparently, from regular commercial mail, with other stamps affixed to pay postage on what might have been a heavier‐than‐normal mailing from Costa Rica.

391-> Athletes' Statement
We, the athletes assembled before you, members of the Ivy League teams competing here today, seek to call atten tion to our belief that busi ness as usual is not sufficient. As athletes and trackmen we understand that our sport is not, and must never become a hideout from our basic re sponsibilities as human beings. Since the last outdoor Hep tagonal meet, thousands have been killed in the unending war in Southeast Asia. Within that year, student opposition to the war has increased while the Administration con tinues to listen to a postu lated “silent majority.” Still there has been no Congres sional decision to enter the war, no less to pursue it across international frontiers. Since our last encounter, the spirit of division and in tolerance separating us from our national leaders has grown. The Administration has resorted to name‐calling and worse, in an effort to ig nore and silence the legiti mate opposition to war, conscription and senseless violence. We decry the killing of fel low students at Kent State University as a national trag edy and a focus of shame. We decry the growing intolerance which permits some to accept those sacrifices as necessary or justified. We further de plore the growing tolerance for repression directed against political and racial minorities, such as the Black Panther party and people of radical disposition in general. Those of use who compete here today do so in the hope that our concern with these vital issues will be expressed to all spectators, and to all who have found pleasure in track and field. We respect and acknowledge those mem bers of our teams who have felt that they cannot in con science participate in this meet.

393-> Nixon to Sign Pueblo Bill
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2— The Senate voted overwhelm ingly today to give the Taos Pueblo Indians title to 48,000 acres of Carson National Forest in New Mexico, land they have long claimed as part of their cultural and re ligious heritage. It includes Blue Lake, an area sacred to the Taos Pueblos. The vote was 70 to 12 in favor of legislation backed by the Nixon Administration and a bipartisan bloc of Sen ators. It followed the defeat, 56 to 21, of an alternative proposal that would have given the tribe “exclusive use” but not ownership of the property. The measure now goes to President Nixon, whose ap proval is assured. Senator Robert P. Griffin, Republican their everyday lives.” Mr. Bruce asserted: “The attitude of the B.I.A. bureaucracy—the tend ency to do things for Indians because ‘father knows best’— has been wiped off the slate.” What might be called the “In dianization” of Indian affairs resembles President Nixon's plan for “Vietnamization”. Both call for the withdrawal of outsiders and for gradually turning over to the people concerned the re sponsibility for their own lives. Many Indians regard the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a paternalis tic bureaucracy. Mr. Bruce acknowledged in an interview this week that it would take at least six months before he had some measure of the impact of his program on the 450,000 Indians living on the reservations. He was asked why he thought his plan would be ef fective when so many promises before had not been fufilled. He asserted that “previous Ad ministrations apparently were’ not willing to take such a strong position to help Indians, to make the almost total com mitment without which these kinds of changes cannot be made.” Earl Old Person, president of the National Congress of Ameri can Indians, said he thought that Mr. Bruce had got off to a good start and was headed in the right direction. But Mr. Old Person, who visi ted Washington from his home in Montana this week, said that many Indians were skepti cal because pledges in the past had done little to improve their lot. He said many were taking a wait‐and‐see position. An aide to Mr. Bruce said the “revolutionary” reform was generally in response to long standing dissatisfaction among the Indians and particularly to the demands of young Indian activists. Last July. President Nixon said that the story of the Indian in America had been marked with “the white man's frequent aggression, broken agreements, intermittent re morse, and prolonged failure.” “The time has come,” the President said in a message to Congress, “to break decisively with the past and to create conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is de termined by Indian acts and Indian decisions.” In October, Mr. Bruce re aligned the top management of the bureau, eliminating one deputy and six assistant com missioners and replacing them with two associate commission ers. At the same time, he brought 15 Indians, many of them under 40, into executive positions. In November, Mr. Bruce or dered authority withdrawn from the II area directors to shorten the lines of communication be tween the bureau and the res ervations. The area directors became staff men with respon sibilities for technical and serv ice advice. This month, Mr. Bruce or dered most of the 63 agency superintendents, many of whom have been at their posts for 10 or 15 years, to move to new posts. He established a policy under which the field adminis trators, as they are now called, will continue to be rotated every two to five years. Mr. Bruce considers the field administrators the critical men in making his plans work be cause they are in daily contact with the tribes and their lead ers. He has issued them a set of rules that, in effect, tell them to stop running things, become low‐key advisers, and work themselves out of jobs as the Indians take over. The mild‐mannered commis sioner has also set up a staff under William Mills, a 31‐year old Sioux who won a Gold Medal in the 10,000‐meter run in the 1964 Olympics. The staff will see that Mr. Bruce's in structions are carried out in the field. In addition, the commissioner has ordered greater emphasis placed on the “buy Indian” program to stimulate Indian in dustry, more opportunities for Indian tribes to take over schools and other services, and inclusion of Indian leaders in the bureau's budget‐making !process. Mr. Bruce's moves have gen erated some opposition. Some here and in the field have open ly resisted his instructions. He expects perhaps 30 per cent of the field administrators to re sign or retire rather than to move to new posts. There has also been some resistance from Indian tribal leaders, some of whom see Mr. Bruce's program as an opening for younger men to challenge them for leadership. Moreover, there have been rumbles of opposition from the Congress, which has long con sidered the bureau a choice ground for patronage appoint ments. Mr. Bruce has had full authority to make the changes he wants—but the bureau must have its next budget passed by the Congress.

394-> PRESIDENT TAKES OATH IN GUATEMALA
GUATEMALA, July 1—Col. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio, an anti‐Communist guerrilla fighter who was elected President in a free election took office before Guatemala's Congress today with a pledge of social reforms. Colonel Arana began a four‐year term taking over from President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro who finished the term to which he was elected. it was only the third time in Guatemala's 150 years of independence that this constitu tional succession has been cartied out. Strong security measures ground the Congress building, where three companies of soldiers and hundreds of policemen were on guard made the inaugural ceremonies tense. United States diplomats led by Ambassador Nathaniel pay's, arrived at the Congress with the armed police escorts that are accompanying diplomats here since terrorists kidnapped and killed the West German Ambassador Count Karl von Spreti in April. Colonel Arana and his bodyguard arrived in a bullet‐proof black limousine and the small crowd barely had a chance to glimpse the new President and cheer before armed guards hustled him into the Congress Hall

395-> Looting by Saigon Units Stirs Cambodian Hatred
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, July 1—Looting and pillage of Cambodian towns by South Vietnamese troops is increasing and has become a serious problem here at a time when the two countries, traditional enemies, are trying to establish an alliance against North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces. Publicly, both government say that the problem is uncle control, and there is clearly commitment at the top to to to contain it. But earlier this week, two regiments of South Vietnamese troops moving up from southern Cambidia to help out at a trouble spot 35 miles north of Pnompenh lef behind a trail of pillage in at least four villages and towns —and a residue of Cambodian fear and hatred. In one of the looted villages Prey Koth, about 12 miles southwest of Pnompenh, the farm people told a visitor how the South Vietnamese soldiers came into their thatch houses late on Sunday afternoon and, holding all protesters at gunpoint, stole gold, money and rice, and undressed some of the women to get at the jewelry they had hastily hidden inside their clothes. Similar Comments Made At a news conference Monday Premier Lon Nol of Cambodia said, when asked about earlier South Vietnamese looting, “Where there are injustices, the (South) Vietnamese command deals with them severely. There was some confusion at the beginning. But it is being regularized now.” South Vietnamese officials have made similar comments in this joint attempt to keep the mounting anger in the countryside from undermining the new alliance. A growing number of informed observers here—noting reports that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops have treated villagers reasonably well, paying for their food, For example, instead of stealing it—fear that the South Vietnamese pillage could spur some villagers into joining the enemy. So far, only four South Vietnamese soldiers are reported to have been charged with looting. These four, a battalion commander and three of his soldiers, are said to be awaiting court‐martial for the sacking two weeks ago of Kompong Speu, a provincial capital 30 miles southwest of Pnompenh. Some Western diplomats believe that the problem, if not checked, could seriously weaken the already uneasy relationship between Pnompenh and Saigon. And some foreign military experts feel that if the looting continues to spread, it could produce a situation in which South Vietnamese troops would be brought into Can bodia only for quick strikes in embattled areas and then would be taken back to South Vietnam immediately. There is a minority point of view, however, that holds that the situation is indeed fairiy well under control and that the behavior of the South Vietnamese is relatively normal for soldiers under battle pressure According to this view, the South Vietnamese troops are showing “considerable restraint” considering the massa cre of more than 1,000 ethnic Vietnamese here by Cambodian soldiers in the early stages of this war two and a haf months ago. In Prey Koth, where most of the villagers were robbed of their meager savings and valuables, there are 33 thatch houses. Twenty‐eight were sacked by the South Vietnamese. “Please help us,” an old farmer pleaded with a Western visitor, “Please do everything you can to stop this from hapoening to us again.” The South Vietnamese troops arrived in Prey Koth at 4 P.M. on Sunday afternoon. A half mile by dirt road off Route 4, Prey Koth is a poor but pretty village in the shade of tall trees and bamboo clumps; its 200 people depend for their livelihood on a scanty rice crop and the crude sugar they make from the juice of the palm‐tree fruit. The troops immediately began swarming through Prey Koth, grabbing chickens and sacking the houses, most of which are on stilts. One woman, Huy Kam, 33 years old, who seemed to be still in a state of shack and kept wringing her hands, said, “I hate them after this. I was so afraid they would kill me.” She said she had shoved all her savings, about $55 and a gold necklace in her pocket and had tried to run from the soldiers but that they had caught her and taken everything. Other villagers came forward to tell similar or even more pitiful stories. Some observem say that the ooting is understandable because the South Vietnamese soldiers are poorly paid and therefore look upon their campaign in Cambodia as a chance to enhance their income. But no matter what explanation is given, the fact of growing Cambodian hatred for the Vietnamese remains, and this is a bad sign now that American troops have withdrawn from Cambodia and the country— its own army poorly trained and equipped—is left largely dependent on the South Vietnamese.

396-> TV Mailbag
To THE EDITOR: YOUR story about the Lone Ranger in your July 12 issue was so convincing that it needs correction. No, we have not sold the rights to the Lone Ranger for the production of “an updated version.” The Lone Ranger was and still is a “great” radio series, a “great” television series and several “great” motion pictures. Rather than "lacks relevance,” the Lone Ranger enjoys more recognition today than probably at any time during his almost 40‐year history. Bigger than all of us, he will outlast all of his spoofers with his innate qualities of goodness and justice. As long as these have relevance, the Lone Ranger will, too. STANLEY STUNELL Assistant Vice President, Wrather Corporation Beverly Hills, Calif. COMPROMISE? To THE EDITOR: I have watched two of what ABC evidently hopes will be many more Smothers Brothers summer shows. I have no intention of watching again. I will he a senior in college next year, I am 21 and I am just as concerned about the problems on and off terra firma as the Smotherses, deep down, seem to be. But. The same people who were sad to see the Smotherses go last season no doubt parked themselves in front of their tubes a few weeks ago to see the debut of what had to be (“They wouldn't compromise would they?”) a biting, brilliant, topical new show. Uhuh. The one bright spot in the whole hour‐long, slapdash confusion was a short, humorous, genuinely absorbing film about the history of mankind. During the second show, even this film time was given over to a “film with message,” the history of the United States: war, oppression, hatred, violence greed, et al. Really! Do they think we're that stupid? I'm surprised there wasn't a little thing tacked on to the end saying: “Moral — the U.S. is evil.” It was just as insulting to sit and watch some denimed country boy pick at his guitar, drawl lyrics about businessmen and war and call them songs. IL was insulting to my intelligence, anyway, and maddening because we've heard all this before, we've heard it! If the Smotherses are so zealously indignant about what's going on — or what's not going on — even if they only want to produce something different in the way of a program, why don't they do it and stop interrupting every 15 minutes to say “Love” and “Peace” and “Right on” just to remind us they're involved and committed and concerned and saying something important? ?? done. Whether it's through the courts, or through Congress, whatever, people have got to realize that the problems aren't going to change just because we don't like them. Issues like Vietnam must no longer be the brunt of cute little jokes (“it's funny but it's got a message, Helen!”) any more than they should he the bases for killing, rioting or destruction. The Smotherses’ jokes, the songs and films of their guests are all flat now, we've seen that before. Don't patronize us, don't bore us. If you're entertainment, entertain FREDERICK ANDERSEN Haddonfield, N. J. RIDICULOUS To THE EDITOR: While the various women's liberation movements have something to he said for them as concerns economic equality and such, to take offense at the Alka‐Seltzer commercial, as one that puts women down, is ridiculous. ?? cial is to me an amusing and entertaining bit of comedy. Other TV commercial housewives are merely boring. Anyone with a modicum of intelligence will not take any commercial too seriously, and no one is going to categorize all women as gullible and not‐quite‐bright just because they may be so depicted On a TV commercial. Let's not lose our per spective. BLANCHE SIEGEL New York City. VIOLENCE To THE EDITOR: It is indeed shocking that TV programing on an average weekday can show so much violence. One evening recently, between 7:30 and midnight, these shows were among those offered to us by our TV industry: “A Matter of Vengeance,” “One Hour to Kill,” “A Target for Killing,” “The Killing,” “The Hunting,” and “Kiss of Death.” Such programs can promote nothing but more violence.

397-> 150 Youths Rampage Near City Hall
A band of youths scuffled with the police, mauled passers by and shouted obscenities in City Hall Park yesterday. Two boys were arrested. The disorders began when 150 youths invaded the offices of the Youth Services Agency at 38 Park Row, across from the eastern edge of the trian gular park in front of City Hall at 11 A.M. They said they wanted summer jobs. The agen cy operates the Neighborhood Youth Corps, which provides summer jobs for youths. After, throwing some type writers to the floor and scatter ing files and papers, the group left. Some headed for City Hall Park, which was filling with the first of the usual midday visitors. At least two young girls—one, her face and clothing smudged and a bloody scrape on her right elbow—said they were pushed around by the youths. Mrs. Andromache Traitouros, who operates a hotdog wagon at the entrance to the IRT sub way station, was surrounded. “They stole my Cokes,” she said angrily. “They tried to get my money.” Jesse Gray, a Harlem activist. worker had joined the youths at the Youth Services Agency offices and, according to offi cials there, had asked them to leave. He seemed startled as he left himself later when a man riding down the elevator with him told him that some young people had staged a rumpus in the park. Mr. Gray blinked, then said the young people who had been with him were from Har lem Backstreet Youth, a group for which he serves as an ad viser. “They're just young peo ple looking for jobs,” he said. The police, who had been alerted that something was going to happen near City Hall, emptied from a nearby bus and dashed toward the disorder. All the while a ceremony commemorating the 194th anni versary of George Washing ton's reading of the Declara tion of Independence was tak ing place on the steps of City Hall. “I didn't even know there was a riot,” the ceremony chairman, Porter Moore, said later. The milling group of youths spilled through the park fo ward the IRT station. Police men followed them down to the change‐booth level. Some boys vaulted the turnstiles, others pushed in through the exit gates. Some shouted obscene remarks. According to some observers there was a confrontation be tween some black and white policemen, the blacks warning the whites not to rough up a Negro youth who was under arrest. This youth was subsequently wrestled upstairs and into the lobby of the office building at 5 Park Place by four policemen, three of them white and one a Negro. Later the police at the Eliza beth Street station said that there had been two arrests—one a 14‐year‐old whose name was not made public because of his age and the other David Davis, 17, of 22 Lenox Avenue, who was accused of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and harassment. The 14‐year‐old, the police said, was identified by two young women as a purse‐snatcher who had struck and robbed them. Davis was arraigned later be fore Criminal Court Judge Jack Rosenberg and then released in his own custody for a hearing in the Youth Term on Aug. 10. A policeman hurt in the dis orders was treated for minor injuries at Beekman Downtown Hospital. At the youth agency offices afterwards, an official, sitting in an eighth‐floor office amid a litter of scattered papers, said: “It looks worse than it was.” In 1968, in similar disorders precipitated by demands for summer jobs, hundreds of youths at City Hall stomped on parked cars and harassed push cart merchants on nearby streets.

398-> Senate Approves a $9‐Billion Appropriation Measure for the Veterans Administration
WASHINGTON, July 9 (UPI) —The Senate has approved a $9‐billion appropriation for the veterans Administration that includes $1.8‐billion for medi cal care. This is $105‐million more than President Nixon re quested and the House ap proved. The measuer — providing funds for the business year that began July 1—was ap proved yesterday after heavy criticism had been leveled against conditions of V. A. hospitals and treatment given to Vietnam war veterans. In the House, Representative Lester L. Wolff, Democrat of Nassau, said he was “shocked” after taking a recent tour of the Kingsbridge V.A. hospital with the House Veterans Com mittee. He said that war veterans were “living in continual trag edy” in New York's veterans hospitals because of a short age of beds and staff. The Senate‐approved bill now goes to a joint conference committee where the $1.85 billion for medical care in the senate bill will have to be rec onciled with $1.77‐billion in the House‐approved measure. Other funds approved in the Senate bill were $5.4‐billion for compensation and benefits; $1.3 billion for readjustment bene fits; $5‐million for veterans in surance indemnities; $59‐mil lion for research; $19‐million for administration; 5239 mil lion for operating; and $59‐mil lion for construction. In the House, the Ways and Means Committee tentatively approved a proposal that would make it easier for industries and workers to get loans, tech nical assistance and tax re lief if they are injured by the economic repercussions of im ports. Under the proposal, in dustries and workers would only have to prove that in creased imports were a “sub stantial’ cause of injury, rather than a “primary” cause in or der to become eligible for help. The House Agriculture Com mittee approved a bill that would authorize the use of a S4.2‐million wheat‐tax fund to conduct a market research and promotion program for the crop. The fund, collected from lev ies on wheat exporters during the 1968‐69 marketing year. was originally scheduled to be distributed among some 823,000 wheat growers. Under the bill, however, any money unre quested by growers would be turned over to the new pro gram. Committee aids said the leftover funds might run as high as 822‐million. The House, in a 381.0 vote, instructed its ethics committee to look into campaign fund rais ing and spending and Congres sional lobbying with a view to improving the 1946 reorganiza tion controlling lobbying activi ties and campaign spending.

Mr. Ziegler said in the wake of the meeting that the United States sees “no Immediate chance of progress” in the talks in that today's discus sions “were not such to give us much hope.” The ambassador and Mr. Flanigan have been atempting to fashion a voluntary agree ment under which Japan would limit export of textiles to the United States.

402-> 73 Cities Told to Open Construction Jobs to Negroes
WASHINGTON, July 9 (UPI) —Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson said today more jobs for blacks must be opened in the construction trades this. summer or Federal quotas may be enforced in 73 cities. “There has been too much of a lag in this work and the big push is on,” Mr. Hodgson said The Labor Secretary said the 73 metropolitan areas in ques tion would be given time to develop voluntary job plans for construction work, but unless it was done soon the department would move to impose racial hiring quotas as it has already done in Philadelphia and Wash ington. “The labor department in tends to give metropolitan areas every opportunity and assist ance to work out agreements because its experience shows that they provide broader em ployment opportunities than im posed solutions, which are lim ited to Federal Government contractors, Mr. Hodgson said. He said the 73 areas that would be aided this summer were in addition to 18 others that had been selected earlier. Most of the cities had asked the Government for assistance in developing their own plans. Mr. Hodgson said about 30 Labor Department officials were being trained for the summer effort, and that seven of them were already in the field pro viding technical assistance to municipalities, minority groups, unions and contractors. “Our skilled manpower re serves are tight, but we are borrowing from other programs so that every one of these cities will get help in putting their good faith to work,” Mr, Hodgson said. The Labor Secretary said he was not satisfied with over‐all progress toward agreements, but was pleased that several agreements have been recently worked out, including one corn pleted Tuesday in Los Angeles. The 73 cities and areas are: Akron, Ohio; Albany; Albuquer que, N.M.; Bakersfield, Calif.; Bal timore; Baton Rouge, La., Birming ham, Ala.; Cairo, lll.; Camden, V.J; Carbondale, lll.; Charleston, S.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio, and Dallas.

The department has also ob tained a court order in Seattle to assure equal employment opportunity. Chicago and Pittsburgh, which are not among these 18 cities, also have reached home town agreements.

403-> TV Review
Anthony Quinn, the com pelling actor with a face compared to the proverbial relief map of the Alps, and Peggy Lee, the sultry singer, were paired last night on the Kraft Music Hall over the National Broadcasting Com pany network. Kraft, which actually is more adventurous in TV than many other spon sors, can concoct quite a salad. Mr. Quinn may be longer on virility than singing, which he tried, and dancing, which he didn't. The records of show business are replete with strong personalities for whom the quality of vocal cords can be immaterial—Rex Harrison in “My Fair Lady,” for instance. But even in a quasimono tone, reinforced by feeling that does come through, performer such as Mr. Quinn can hold his own with Miss Lee, no slouch herself in un derstanding that lyrics are no less important than a beat. In their climatic rendition, the duet managed to capture the elusive durability of love, no matter what the reasons. It was strangely effective and paignant oddity, well worth the waiting. Most of the rest of the Show was uneven, not to say dull. Mr. Quinn was cast in some unimaginative sketches on the woman‐and‐man rela tionship and did a reprise of a smidgeon from his film role in “Requiem for a Heavy weight.” But Miss Lee is a winning and experienced hand in retrieving awkward moments by drifting into a song that eases the strain. If Dwight Hemion, the di rector, had a hand in match ing Mr. Quinn and Mss Lee, more power to him. The in frequent spark is never caught without experimenta tion. Danny Thomas who made a couple of fortunes with “Make Room for Daddy,” sought last night on N.B.C. to extend the economics and family lineage. He opened in “Make Room for Grand daddy” and the show is quite clearly going to be dominated by the comedian and senti mentalist of Lebanese de scent. For plausibility's sake, the jump in generations will have the grandfather respond slightly more slowly than the father, but otherwise it'll be Mr. Thomas as of yore. The Columbia Broadcasting System news department showed last night that an hour‐long network evening news program is not impos sible. As often maintained by reluctant affiliated sta tions. The Walter Cronkite newscast was expanded by a half‐hour at a time of maxi mum audience, a procedure preferable to N.B.C.'s special at 11:30 P.M. The reason for the C.B.S. move, of course, was the crisis in Amman. Via satel lite, Mr. Cronkite talked with three correspondents who had been confined in the Hotel Continental in Amman and then airlifted to Beirut, a procedure also used by N.B.C. within its usual half hour format. Ironically, C.B.S. did not make the best use of the precious extra half‐hour. The reports of the frontline cor respondents unavoidably had a high degree of repetition, and the fact remained that they had not been allowed to see too much. In fact, the need for the additional time allocated by C.B.S. was the type of com mentary provided by Howard K. Smith of A.B.C. He con tended that no Middle East peace was feasible without offering opportunities to the Palestine guerrillas, to give them a country where their identity would be preserved and their refugees made a part of the community of cations. To agree or not with Mr. Smith was beside the point. The heart of the informa tional function includes pro vocative discussion of issues, not just the satellite relay of more gunfire and fragmen tary pictures, especially in good TV time.

404-> I.C.C. REFUTES CRITICS AS ‘IRRESPONSIBLE’
The Interstate Commerce Commission, in its first public response to widespread criti cism in Congress, charged yes terday that much of the criticism leveled against the Government agency was ‘'bi ased, political or uninformed, or has taken the shape of irrespon sible and ill‐founded carp and fulmination.” The charge was made by George M. Stafford, chairman of the I.C.C., in a letter dated Dec. 8 to Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Democrat of Wash ington, and chairman of the Committee on Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the agen cy. A copy of the letter was made available here. Mr. Stafford responded to a letter to the I.C.C. signed by the Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield and 29 other Sena tors contending that the agency “imperiled the future of rail transportation.” Senator Mans field is leading a move to abol ish the I.C.C. and turn over its functions to the Transportation Department headed by John A.

405-> Ulbricht Voices Optimism On Negotiating With Bonn
BERLIN, Dec. 9—Walter Ul bricht, the East German leader, indicated for the first time to day that there was a prospect for success in the arduous East‐West talks on the peren nial problem of Berlin. Policy Speech Is Said to Show Willingness to Compromise on Berlin “We are convinced,” he said, in a speech to the Central Com mittee of his Socialist Unity (Communist) party, “that talks and negotiations on the basis of equality and the other prin ciples of international law can yet get going.” He did not say how soon. The 77‐year‐old Communist leader's remarks in a 5,000 word policy speech were cau tious, but they showed none theless that he was willing to give way for the first time in the interests of an East‐West compromise solution. In lan guage and in fact he appeared to align himself with some of the Soviet Union's priorities on the Berlin issue, and to drop some of his own. Notably absent from Mr. Ul bricht's latest formulations was a demand for inclusion of the West Berlin city government as a third party to the German level discussions. He had called for precisely this only a month ago, but it did not work. Mr. Ulbricht also used a So viet formula on the Berlin issue that appeared for the first time in last week's Soviet‐bloc dec laration, expressing acknowl edgement of “the new require ments of the West Berlin popu lation.” It was evident in this and other formulas that Mr. Ulbricht had been compelled by his al lies, particularly the Soviet Union, to sacrifice some of his most cherished policies. He confirmed, for example, that future equal relations be tween West and East Germany would fall short of the “full dip lomatic recognition” he had sought so long. However, he re jected the West German termi nology of “inner‐German rela tions” between the two govern ments. In another passage Mr. Ul bricht accused the Polish lead ership of ignoring his own ef forts since 1948 to be a good neighbor and of courting Chan cellor Willy Brandt earlier this week ??t the signing or the War saw‐Bonn treaty. Mr. Ulbricht averred that his own party's view of Mr. Brandt's Social Democratic party as dangerous to the Eu ropean Communist community “remains unchanged.” The East German leader re iterated that West Germany must cease its political activ ities in West Berlin “to pave the way” for an agreement on the movement of goods and persons between the two Ger man states. East Germany holds that West Berlin is a separate inter national entity and that West Germany has no right to en gage in governmental meetings or visits in the city. Activities such as a recent meeting of West Germany's op position parties in West Berlin or a three‐day visit this week by President Gustav Heinemann have aroused East German pro tests. These have sometimes taken the form of traffic stop pages on the highways between West Germany and West Berlin, which is isolated 110 road miles inside East Germany. The Bonn Government's po sition has been that it cannot negotiate with East Germany on Berlin questions until given permission by the Big Four— the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France— which have been meeting on the issue since March. Their talks are to be resumed here tomorrow.

406-> U.S. Will Sue 8 Concerns Over Dumping of Mercury
WASHINGTON, July 24—Attorney General John N. Mitchell authorized today the filing of suits against eight companies in seven states on charges of dumping mercury into lakes and rivers. United States attorneys in those states are being instructed to file the suits under the Refuse Act of 1899, which prohibits the dumping of refuse, except in liquid form from streets and sewers, into navigable waters without a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. Shiro Kashiwa, Assistant At torney General for the Land and Natural Resources Division, said the suits would ask Federal District Courts to enjoin the dumping of the poisonous mer cury and require the alleged polluters to take remedial ac tion. Secretary of the Interior Wal ter J. Hickel, who submitted the names of the companies to the Justice Department last Tuesday, said that this was “just a start” in the effort of the Federal Water Quality Ad ministration, part of his de partment, to stop mercury pol lution of the nation's water ways. “These discharges must be stopped,” Mr. Hickel said. “They represent an intolerable threat to the health and safety of Americans.” The Secretary said the com panies had failed “to end mer cury pollution voluntarily.” He added, “We are developing hard evidence against a num ber of other companies.” When consumed, even in small amounts, mercury can cause numbness of the limbs, blurred vision, loss of coordina tion, deafness, speech impair ment, mental and emotional dis turbances and in more serious cases prolonged coma and “irre versible effects to the liver and kidneys as well as to the cen tral nervous system,” according to the Public Health Service. Ten plants were mentioned in the Justice Department ac tion. The companies, the plant sites and the waters allegedly polluted are: Allied Chemical Company, Sol vay, N. Y., Onondaga Lake. Diamond Shamrock Corpora tion, Delaware City, Del., Delaware River. Diamond Shamrock Corpora tion, Muscle Shoals, Ala., Pond Creek, which flows into Tennnessee River. Georgia ‐ Pacific Corporation, Bellingham, Wash., Puget Sound. International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, Chlor Alkali Division, Orrington, Me., Penobscot River. Olin Mathieson Chemical Corpo ration (now the Olin Corpo ration), Niagara Falls, N. Y., Niagara River. Olin Corporation, Augusta, Ga., Savannah River. Oxford Paper Company, Rum ford, Me., Androscoggin Riv er. Pennwalt Chemical Company, Calvert City, Ky., Tennessee River. Weyerhaeuser Corporation, Longview, Wash., Columbia River W. A. Oppold, vice president of Olin, said in a statement issued here that “these prob lems of mercury pollution weren't even known by the Government or industry until March of this year. Since then Olin has had under way crash program that spared neither manpower nor expense to solve the problems. “If the Government is inter ested in sincerity, intensity and progress made by a com pany along these lines, Olin should not be included in these actions,” he said. The Pennwalt Corporation said in a statement issued in Philadelphia: “At our Calvert City, Ky., plant, which uses mercury cells, we have been and are working on the subject of con tinuing compliance with the applicable state standards.” Peter de Angelis, manager of the International Minerals and Chemical plant in Orrington, Me., said: “We've been cooperating with the State Environment Improvement Commission, and with the F.W.Q.A., and even the Food and Drug Adminis tration's been up here to take samples. We've said we'll do everything it takes to solve the problem if we have one. This is why it comes as such a shock.” Spokesmen for Georgia‐Pa cific and Weyerhaeuser said the companies were using water‐recycling systems that eliminated mercury discharge. Allied Chemical said in New York that it had made sub stantial progress in eliminating mercury pollution and that was continuing to work on the problem. Arthur 13. Tillman, a vice president of the Diamond Sham rock corporation, said in Cleveland that the company was “doing everything we can to reduce the mercury content of the effluent from our plants.” The New York Times report ed Wednesday that Mr. Hickel had submitted the names of 13 companies. Mr. Hickel later con firmed the number, but today the Justice Department said Mr. Hickel had been in error. Interior Department officials said the largest polluter was the Georgia‐Pacific Corpora tion, which, they alleged, is dumping 41.5 pounds of mer cury daily into Puget Sound. They said that Olin was dump ing 26.6 pounds daily into the Niagara River and that the Ox ford Company was putting 26.2 pounds into the Androscoggin. Discharges by the other companies, they said, ranged from 1.5 to about 15 pounds daily. The Federal Water Quality Administration evidently be lieved these amounts created a danger that the tolerabe limits for mercury in drinking water and fish would be exceeded. The Public Health Service has tentatively set a safe limit of 0.005 parts per million in drinking water. The Food and Drug Administration has tenta tively set a safe limit at 0.5 parts per million in fish for human consumption. The 1899 Refuse Act provides for criminal penalties — fines of $500 and $2,500 or im prisonment from 30 days to a year. In 1960, the Supreme Court ruled that the Govern ment could seek injunctions in civil suits to halt pollution. Mr. Kashiwa explained to day that the department was instituting civil rather than criminal proceedings “because mercury pollution is a very serious matter” and because the maximum criminal penalty of $2,500 for a corporation is “re latively light.” At a hearing July 10, Mr. Kashiwa assured members of the Senate subcommittee on the environment that the 1899 act would be used to reinforce the slower procedures of the Fed eral Water Pollution Control Act. Slower Procedures Under these procedures, wa ter quality standards are set by each state and approved by the Federal Water Quality Administration. Numerical standards are set for some pol lutants. But there is a general prohibition against dumping “toxic” materials that produce undesirable physiological ef fects in plant, animal and hu man life. The statute requires that pol luters he given abatement no tices and a hearving. If they do not take corrective action aft er 180 days, they are subject to court order. An Interior Department of ficial said today that since the water quality agency began sampling for mercury pollution a few weeks ago, many com panies had achieved dramatic abatement. For example, he said that the GAF Corporation in Linden, N.J., had reduced mercury discharges from 28 pounds to about 20 pounds a day and that Detrex Chemical Industries in Ashtabula, Ohio, had achieved a reduction from almost 30 to just over pounds. Furthermore, he said, the amount of mercury being dumped into Lake Erie from plants on the United States shoreline has dropped from 280 to about 10 pounds a day. The dispute over mercury pollution arose last Mardi aft er a graduate student at the University of Western Ontario found that walleye pike caught in Lake St. Clair contained from 1.3 to 7 parts per million of mercury. The Ontario government on March 24 banned sports and commercial fishing in Canadi an waters of the lake, and Michigan took similar action on April 7. Michigan and Ohio have filed suits against the Dow Chem ical Company, whose Ontario plant was found to be dumping 200 pounds of mercury a day into the St. Clair River feed ing into Lake St. Clair, and against the Wyandotte Chem ical Company, which was dis charging 10 to 20 pounds day into the Detroit River emp tying into Lake Erie.

407-> Bonn's Budget for 1971 Estimated at $25‐Billion
BONN, July 1 (Reuters)—Informed sources said that the Finance Committee of the West German Cabinet agreed today on a budget for 1971 of 100.1 billion deutsche marks, or $25.2‐billion. About 2.5‐billion marks will be provisionally frozen and will be spent only if this does not conflict with the general aims of economic policy. The total budget compares with foreseen expenditures this year of 88.9 billion marks. If none of the frozen money is spent, the increase for next year would be about 9 per cent, the same rise as 1970 over 1969.

408-> Negroes and Storm Relief
BILOXI, Miss., Jan. 9—Part of the quandary of life In the United States for the Negro has been the pattern of discrimina tion that he beholds. That he is discriminated against is un challenged. But the black man has become increasingly per plexed in recent years over whether the antecedent of this discrimination is the color of his skin or his low economic standing. The latter argu ment gained a measure of support this week during hearings held here by a Senate Public Works subcom mitte investigating the role of Federal disaster relief agencies in the aftermath of Hurricane Camille. From the outset of the hear ings, there were complaints that racial discrimination worked against full Negro par ticipation in relief programs ad ministered by the Federal Gov ernment and the American Red Cross. But when one. Negro after another discussed in detail the frustrations inherent in a poor man's efforts to take full ad vantage of programs that had been designed with middle‐class Americans in mind, it became evident that their anger was directed not at racial bigotry as much as it was at class dis tinctions. There appears to have been corrosive acts of racism on in dividual and semi‐official levels in the wake of the hurricane. But, after three days of testi mony, the drift of the criticism by black leaders turned against the Federal Government and the Red Cross, not the segrega tionist government of Missis sippi. The real value of the testi mony may crystalize this com ing week in Washington when Red Cross officials and the in dividual Federala gencies re assess their relief work roles in relation to the poor as a result of the hearing and the attending publicity. The major issue, particularly in the case of the Red Cross, is whether relief should be dis tributed on the basis of pre disaster economic status or whether is should be granted strictly on the basis of indivi dual need with minimum stan dards for all disaster victims. The Red Cross manual for assistance to disaster victims is based on the doctrine that they be restored to normalcy; that is, they should receive aid in proportion to the standard, of living to which they were previously accustomed. On the surface this position sounds eminently fair to most middle‐class Americans. But to many Negroes, it is another manifestation of a rigged, white‐oriented society, the black leaders testified. The point that the Negroes raised was basically this: What is the value of returning family to their pre‐hurricane status when that condition was already one of wretchedness? The Negro mother needing clothing for her children is angry and bitter when she is given secondhand goods while the middle‐class white mother is issued new clothing, they said. Many white Mississippians have contended that the blacks were better off than before as a result of the hurricane relief. This assumption was based largely on the memory of poor families digging through piles of donated clothing that had been sent in from other parts of the nation soon after the hurricane struck last August. But the fact that a Negro is better clothed for the winter months than ever before is of little consolation when he re mains in a tar paper shack and watches the Red Cross pay for the construction of a new home for his white employer, the black leaders have argued. Similarly, the low‐interest loans available through the Small Business Administration have a written‐in bias against those whose prior condition was of low economic standing, they said. It has been argued that sufficient collateral makes good bisiness sense, but for the black man who has been systematically excluded from participation in Mississippi's white economic system, it is a cruel blow to watch the chance for a new economc start be denied by the Federal Govern ment. “The question we now face is whether to seize the opportuni ties presented by a disaster like Camille to correct some of the past conditions,” observed Sen ator Edmund S. Muskie, Demo crat of Maine, after hearing three days of testimony. “How far can the Federal Government go to rehabilitate a community? That's a concept that hasn't been fully, defined.”

411-> Wood, Field and Stream
William Humphrey's “The Spawning Run” (Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 80 pages, $4) is the most delightful work this reviewer has read in a long time. When first encountered, under a different title in Es quire Magazine, the grace and humor of “The Spawn ing Run” left me, after my initial search of pleasure had subsided, nearly ill with envy. No man, it seemed to me, should be able to write so engagingly of a fishing holi day in Britain. Readers of “The Spawning Run” will learn of the quiv ering, gaping courtship of the fabled Atlantic salmon and will also meet the sal mon widows. The women who, year after year, follow their husbands to fishing ho tels and who sometimes con tinue the annual ritual when they become true widows. Beyond any doubt, “The Spawning Run” will become a classic of angling (or should one say sporting?) literature. An altogether different book on the lordly Atlantic salmon is “Atlantic Salmon Flies and Fishing (Stackpole Books, 362 pages, $14.95) by Joseph D. Bates Jr. Joe Bates, who has de voted a lifetime to angling, has written a solid, informa tive and entertaining book that will be welcomed by both expert and neophyte. For the man who ties his own flies, there are hundreds of illustrations (plus direc tions for dressing) of old and new patterns, many in color, and included also are some basic patterns for the so called “tube fly” that made its appearance in Scotland 25 years ago but which has been slow to catch on in America. (One reason for the resistance to the tube fly on this side of the Atlantic is probably that it calls for a treble hook which is not permitted on some United States and Canadian salmon waters). There are chapters on sal mon fishing in North Amer ica and a listing of rivers in Norway, the British Isles, Finland, Iceland, France and Spain. Charles F. Waterman's “The Hunter's World” (Ridge Press, 250 pages, $15) is a sensitive verbal and pictorial excursion into the world of the hunter from northern Alaska to southern Florida. This is a big, handsome book and many of its profuse il lustrations, in both black and white and color, are magnif icent. The spirit of the book is captured in the following quotation from it: “For un less a man inquires into the many factors that have brought him and his game together, he is only a gun ner and not a hunter. If he does not know his quarry— its life cycle, the processes of its reproduction, the course of its migrations, and the subtlety of its relationship to other creatures and its en vironment — its death means markmanship.”

414-> Dance
HAVE no wish to sound alarms, or even to sound alarmist, but it does seem that 1970 might be the year we see our ballet companies sink gracefully down the drain one by one. I can see the gravestone now: “American dance: Born circa 1920. Died 1970. R.I.P.” The situation is becoming untenable. At the time of writing the New York City Ballet has been struck by members of the New York City Ballet Orchestra, Local 802, American Federation of Musicians. By the time you read this, it is always possi ble that the strike will have been settled, the New York State Theater will once more be a blaze of light, and New York City Ballet, with its fine orchestra in the pit, will once more be in business. But at the moment the situation is bleak. The New York City Ballet is not the only one of our immediate problems. The American Dance Theater of Alvin Ailey, which has just completed a highly acclaimed season at the Brooklyn Acad emy of Music, has announced, more in sorrow than in anger, its dissolution. The company at present is in great perform ing condition: Ailey has pushed its possibilities as far as they can go. * Ailey has got a great com pany. His own new ballet ranks among his best as su perbly vibrant, with none of the disconcerting backtrack ing of the past few choreo graphic years. He is also push ing his own young choreog raphers. This season he has given a chance to Miguel Godreau, John Parks and Kel vin Rotardier, and the exper iment has turned out roses. These kids have talent—one of them might emerge as the choreographer capable of sharing Ailey's burden. But, of course, the company is go ing to be destroyed. Who needs Ailey? Over the last decade he has created great company. It has gone all over Europe, showing our arts to the world. When the fashionable times were against him, Ailey pur sued an uncompromising po sition on racial integration. He is a great man, and a good choreographer. Now he says he is going to give up. He cannot stand the struggle. He has fought long enough. He can make money in musicals or television shows. Ailey is unlikely to starve. But are we not starving his vision? Money, money, money. Sometimes I think the world at large must think of dance as the eternal panhandler. And believe me the world at large is right. Dance needs money, and I cannot possibly say where it is coming from. American Ballet Theater is facing its most expensive sea son yet. It may not make it. City Center Joffrey Ballet, the Cunningham company, the Taylor company, all these are in specific trouble. The Harkness Ballet, from which Rebekah Harkness is withdrawing her immediate support, has been summoned home in the middle of a pres tigious European tour for a period of reappraisal and re adjustment. Miss Harkness, it seems, does not like the way the company is going. And after all, it is her company, so who should know better? Certainly not its directors, Benjamin Harkarvy and Law rence Rhodes, who are, after all, merely paid employes. Is there any note of hope that can be sounded? Well the National Ballet in Wash ington, D. C., has just given us a lively new “Cinderella,” choreographed by Ben Ste venson, and Marcel Marceau has just ended a stand at the City Center which once more effortlessly demonstrated the mystery and wonder of Mar ceau's theatrical genius. Mar ceau is moving into new areas of dance, mime and theater. For the rest, luckily, we have Britain's Royal Ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House, ensuring that ballet is not totally absent from Lin coln Center. I shall be writ ing about the Royal Ballet and its choreographer extra ordinary, Frederick Ashton, next week.

415-> Sports of The Times
AN DIEGO, Jan. 11—A tall man in a suede trenchcoat, his shoulders hunched into a wet wind, crossed a busy street against a Don't Walk sign. Half a block away, someone said, “That's Bill Bradley, coach. Can't you teach him to cross at the green?” Coach Red Holzman shrugged, “That's nothing. He doesn't even know what city he's in.” That was six days ago, in Baltimore, the first stop on the Knicks' longest trip. By now, having settled into the groove of airport‐hotel‐arena, hardly anyone—unless has a friend in town—knows what city he's in until he sees the opposing team's shirts. The trip began at Kennedy Airport, last Monday, where the Knicks took a National Airlines flight to Baltimore. They were booked into tourist class, and they scrambled for aisle seats, then fell asleep almost immediately despite the afternoon sun popring through the cabin windows. On the road, each Knick gets $16 a day meal money. A few save some of it by waking up late and missing a meal. But none approaches the parsimony of Cleveland Buckner, a Knick of the early '60's, who became legend when a doctor discovered why he was stooped and weak: He was saving money on less than $8 a day, and living, in New York, in an apartment with a 6‐foot‐6‐inch ceiling. He was 6‐foot‐9. On Tuesday night the Knicks whipped Baltimore, 129‐99. When Nate Bowman, the reserve center, sank a basket at the final buzzer, every member of the 12‐man squad had scored in the game. Back in the locker room, Dave DeBusschere said to Bradley, “You got people this town or do you want to go out?” “Someone's waiting for me,” said Bradley, “I don't know if he wants to go out or just say hello.” The T.W.A. flight from Baltimore to San Francisco on Wednesday was delayed only 20 minutes despite a snow storm. The flight itself was smooth. Bradley read “The Iceman Cometh.” Mike Riordan read “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.” Willis Reed became intensely involved in the inflight movie, “The Christmas Tree.” Dick Barnett played poker with some of the 11 newsmen and broad casters traveling with the club. Every so often Barnett would look up and say, “I'd have a hell of a hand if I had the right cards.” That night, before a near capacity crowd of 7,216 at the Civic Auditorium, the Knicks beat the Warriors, 99‐94. “We had to struggle for our lives for everything we got,” said Holzman afterward. It wasn't nearly that tough, but the Warriors, a physi cal team, had applied steady pressure. Nate Thurmond, their giant center, had held Reed to 6 points while getting 23, mostly on hooks he arched over Reed's frantic arms. But as so often happens, another Kick got hot—Barnett scored 25 points and supplied sudden bursts of energy. Thursday was an off day in San Francisco for the regulars, and an afternoon workout for the reserves. The weather continued rainy and chill. The Warriors went to San Diego that night, lost, and came back to play the Knicks Friday night. They had lost their zip. Thurmond continued to dominate Reed, but Bradley was hitting well from the outside and Walt Frazier was stealing balls again, two important reasons why a team with finesse can beat sluggers. The final score this time was 123‐93. Yesterday was the first sunny day of the trip, a dis astrous omen. The United Airlines flight to San Diego was delayed an hour, and the Knicks roamed restlessly through the air terminal. Frazier, who goes nowhere with out his radio‐tape recorder, found a corner for an instant concert, and Dave Stallworth, the heart‐attack victim, smoked a cigarette and stared at girls. Dan Whelan, the trainer, and the publicity men, Frank Blauschild and Jim Wergeles, managed to locate a Pacific Southwest Airlines flight departing for San Diego in minutes, and they rounded up the 27 and hustled them aboard. The Knicks arrived in San Diego near noon, but their baggage, still on United Airlines, did not arrive until 6 P.M., two hours before iast night's game with the Rockets. Elvin Hayes scored 31 points and relays of scrappy little guards ran the Knicks ragged. Reed, and then Bow man, got into foul trouble, and the Knicks began missing sure shots and hitting each other on the backside with passes. The final score was 123‐115. The Rockets, in win ning, had scored the most points the Knicks had yielded this scasun in regulation time. The next stop for the Knicks is Salt Lake City, where they will meet the Phoenix Suns tomorrow night.

DETROIT, Dec. 23 (UPI)—Ed Westfall and Fred Stanfield scored in the first 6 minutes 4 seconds of the first period to night end the Boston Bruins then held off the Detroit Red Wings to win their ninth straight National Hockey League game, 2‐1. Detroit's losing streak reached five games While Bos ton's winning streak is the longest since it won 11 in a row in the 1928‐29 season, the same season, the Bruins set the league mark of 14 games with out a loss or a tie. The Wings heard louder theirs for the Bruins than for themselves by fans angered over the team's sloppy play. Detroit hustled but could only score at 2:34 of the final period when Frank Mahovlich's 13th goal was deflected off Boston's defenseman, Don Awrey, behind the goalie, Ed Johnston. Westfall's 10th goal of the season came 41 seconds after the start and Stanfield's 11th came five seconds into a power play at 6:04. The Bruins took 39 shots against the rookie goalie, Jim Rutherford. Johnston faced 23 shots. ?? TORONTO, Dec. 23 (UPI)— The Toronto Maple Leafs ex tended their victory streak to seven games tonight and vault ed into a tie with Vancouver for fourth place in the National Hockey League East by defeat ing the Canucks, 7‐2. In the second period the Leafs beat the Vancouver goalie, George Garner, who had made 20 saves in the first pe riod, by scoring three times for a 4‐2 lead. Ron Ellis, Darryl Sittler and Jim Harrison got the tallies. ?? ST. LOUIS, Dec. 23 (UPI)— George Morrison, a rookie, scored at 15:24 of the third period tonight to give the St. Louis Blues a 2‐2 tie with the Montreal Canadians. Morrison, closing about 30 feet from the net, took a puck off the stick of Gary Sabourin, standing near the crease, and fired it past Rogatien Vachon, the Montreal goalie. ??

418-> Agnew Calls for Greater International Cooperation in Drive Against Disease
HOUSTON, May 24 — Vice President Agnew proposed to day that the “nations of this world, plagued by many ills— some of our own making, some born of nature” — declare the nineteen‐seventies the de cade against disease. Mr. Agnew urged that the world's youth channel into the pursuit of science “its impres sive drive to create a better world.” He said that without challenging the right of youth “to make their voices heard responsibly in the corridors of political power, I would draw their attention to the chal lenges of the laboratories of science as well.” The Vice President spoke at the opening of the 10th Inter national Cancer Congress of the International Union Against Cancer. Pointing out that cancer and other diseases do not respect national boundaries, the Vice President called for greater in ternational cooperation in the fight against disease. He sug gested an increase in the ex change of scientific informa tion and cooperative projects to avoid unnecessary duplication of unusual and expensive re search. Such international coopera tion could be used, Mr. Agnew said, to identify and eliminate environmental hazards. For example, he said, “The causal factors of cancer may reside to a significant degree In the surroundings in which we live.” Some doctors are investigat ing the ability of pollutants, particularly a combination of such chemicals, to cause can cer and other diseases. Solving cancer's riddles, he said, will take diligent research and a long‐term investment of time and energy. Describing himself as “a for mer student of chemistry,” Mr. Agnew emphasized the need for A “broad spectrum” of biomedical research in his pro posed battle aaginst disease. “No one can really predict the particular field of study that will give rise to tomor row's treatment of a specific disease,” he said. Mr. Agnew pledged more support for biomedical research “as soon as our economy per mits it.” He predicted that the “Federal investment in health research in 1971 will be high er than it ever has been.” Many scientists have com plained that previous Federal research cutbacks, coupled with inflation, have impaired bio medical research projects and discouraged younger scientists from doing what Mr. Agnew advised youths to do — accept the, challenges of laboratory science. Mr. Agnew said that the benefits from biomedical re search not only relieve human misery but also save billions of dollars that can be re‐invest ed in improvements in the de livery of health care. Mr. Agnew said that the pri vate and public sectors of this country must unite, with the Federal government as a cata lyst, to improve medical care. The Administration, he said, has proposed legislation “to en courage private efforts to im prove systems for the delivery of care.” Mr. Agnew noted that the governments of many of the 70 countries represented at this congress “had assumed com plete responsibility for the pro vision of medical care.” Ameri cans, the Vice President said, will benefit by examining the experience of such systems. “A totally governmental re sponse,” he said, “is not in our national character.”

419-> An Alleged Mafioso Loses Court Appeal To Be With ‘Family’
A lawyer's plea to hold off a client's one‐year jail term until after Christmas for family reasons was rejected yesterday when the District Attorney countered that the man was also an “heir apparent” to major Mafia family. State Supreme Court Justice Myles J. Lane listened for about 15 minutes to the contrary con cepts of “family” and then or dered the prisoner, Carmine Tramunti, to surrender at 10 A.M. today at the Bronx Coun ty Courthouse, where he is to be taken into custody by the Department. of Correction to serve at least two thirds of his one‐year sentence for con tempt of court. The lawyer for Tramunti, Philip R. Edelbaum, pleaded for his client in what is not an unusual request at this time of year—for a brief delay of imposition of what is generally considered a lesser jail sen tence. The lawyer said that while the District Attorney “might say that the only family Tra munti might have is the Lu chese family, this man has wife, children and three grand children.” In an unusual opposition to the leniency request, Bronx District Attorney Burton B. Roberts appeared personally in Manhattan to oppose any de lay of Tramunti's jail sentence. (Justice Lane had originally tried the case in the Bronx, but had since been assigned to Manhattan in normal rota tion.) Mr. Roberts, who did not originally try the case against Tramunti, said that “according to reports from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and in vestigative bodies of the New York City Police, Carmine Tra munti is the heir apparent to the family of Thomas Luchese.” The late Luchese had long been described by the Federal Government as the head of what the government then call a “Mafia family.” The Theater Development Fund has purchased $30,000 worth of tickets to Lorraine Hansberry's play, “Les Blanes,” for the first two weeks in Janu ary. The fund provides finan cial assistance to selected at tractions through the purchase of tickets for distribution at be low box‐office prices to stu dents, labor unions, underprivi leged youngsters and blue‐col collar workers.

421-> FIDELITY WEIGHS PLAN FOR MERGER
Executives of the Fidelity Corporation of Virginia met here yesterday to consider their next move following a deter mination of New Jersey's In surance Commissioner, Robert L. Clifford, that a merger with the Bankers National Life In surance Company of Montclair, N. J., would be prejudicial to Bankers policyholders. Ralph R. Lounsbury, chair man of Barkers, reached at his home, conceded that Mr. Clif ford's action was unexpected but that “there's nothing that Bankers National can do any thing about.” Fidelity, he said, had made the merger applica tion to the Insurance Commis sioner and “Fidelity will have to take whatever action it sees fit.” When the merger was an nounced in March, industry sources put a market value on the deal at the time of more than $35‐million. The action of the commissioner, however, has changed the picture and mar ket sources are unable to come up with a new figure. In trading on the over‐the counter market yesterday, Fi delity stood unchanged at 8⅛, while Bankers jumped 1½ to 16½. Sources close to both sides said that executives were “holed up somewhere in New York” considering their next move and that in probabili ty the commissioner's ruling would be appealed. Lawyers for both sides were said to be considering alterna tives open to them but that a decision on how to proceed would not be made “for a while.” Sullivan & Cromwell is act ing as counsel fo?? Bankers in the merger and in defending the company against two stock holder suits charging that Fidel ity did not make an offer to Bankers shareholders on terms at least as favorable to them as to shareholders who sold Fidelity a 36.2 per cent stake in the company last year at about $35.58 a share. The suits further allege that Fidelity did not make an offer to other Bankers shareholders within a reasonable time. Fidelity is being represented by its counsel in Virginia, Hirschler & Fleischer of Rich mond. In other merger develop ments, stockholders of the First National Bank, Yonkers, N. Y., and the National Bank of North America at separate meetings yesterday approved the consol idation of the two banks. The consolidation is subject to the approval of the Controller of the Currency. The French Government has rejected a bid by Helena Rubin stein, Inc., the cosmetics manu facturer, to acquire a control ling interest in Parfum Rochas of France. No reasons were given. The British Government will not oppose the British‐Ameri can Tobacco Company's offer to acquire the outstanding shares in Wiggins Teape, Ltd., it does not already own, it was announced yesterday. The to bacco concern owns about 33 per cent of the common and 32 per cent of the preferred stock of Wiggins Teape, a large producer of specialty papers.

A one‐day deer hunt sched uled for this Saturday in the Great Swamp Wildlife Refuge Wilderness in Morris County, N. J., was temporarily barred yesterday. Federal Judge John Sirica granted an order in Washing ton against the Department of the Interior, which approved the plan for the hunt in the 3,750‐acre refuge. In its suit filed Friday, the Humane Society argued that the wildlife refuge should not be permitted to use licensed hunters, selected by computer, as a means to control a rapidly growing deer herd. Attorneys for the society said that they were, not against controlling the deer population by hunting, but that they pre ferred that it be done by na tional park rangers using systematic method. It was hoped that 135 deer would be eliminated in the hunt because there is not enough food now for all the deer in the refuge. Attorneys for the Interior De partment said they would ap peal Judge Sirica's decision within 48 hours.

423-> ITALIANS CAPTURE 2‐MAN BOB TITLE
CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy, Jan. 4 (AP)—Italy's Gianfranco Gaspari and Mario Armano streaked down a snow‐battered track four times tonight to win the European two‐man bob sledding championships. The Italian team's combined time for the four runs was 5 minutes 23.12 seconds. The Italians edged the Ger man team of Horst Floth and Bepy Bader by three one‐hun dredths of a second. Another German team, Wolf gang Zimmerer and Peter Ut shneider, placed third. The championships were marred by an accident involv ing the British team of William Walker and David Powdrill, whose bob jumped the icy Cristallo curve. Both men were taken to the hospital with serious injuries. Walker had internal injuries and Powdrill two broken legs and a fractured pelvis.

424-> In The Nation: The Pollution of Promises
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's State of the Union em phasis on improving the en vironment ought to be a major gain for that cause, since Pres idential leadership still can be one of the most effective steps toward getting anything done in the lumbering American polity. It Is not yet clear, how ever, that Mr. Nixon's plans are equal to his oratory. He told Congress that his “$10‐billion nationwide clean waters program” would be “the most comprehensive and costly” in American history. Available information suggests, however, that only $4 billion of that amount will be put up by the Federal Government, stretched over the fiscal years 1971–79. This would average about $445‐ million a year, and the fact is that even in the current fiscal year Congress appropriated $800 million for the same pur pose (although Mr. Nixon ap parently does not intend to spend anything like that amount). Nor is the Nixon program either as comprehensive or as costly as that of Senator Ed mund S. Muskie of Maine, long a leader in this field and a man who could be Mr. Nixon's op ponent in 1972. Mr. Muskie would have the Federal Govern ment put up $12.5 billion over five years, with state and local government to match that sum. On the face of it, the Maine Senator's figure appears nearer the actual requirement than Mr. Nixon's. The cities and states already are asking for about $2 billion a year in each of the next five years, to say nothing of about $760 million that Washington now owes local governments that have “prefinanced” clean water proj ects in good‐faith expectation of receiving promised Federal grants. Moreover, inflation and the steady rise to be expected in construction costs are weighty factors; Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York esti mates, for instance, that the water‐pollution program for which his state voted a $1.7‐ billion bond issue now will cost about twice that much. But straight comparisons of Mr. Nixon's dollar proposals with the program now in ef fect, or even with Mr. Muskie's plan, may not tell the whole story. For one thing, the vast sums that politicians toss around seldom mean what they seem to mean, anyway. In this fiscal year, as only one sorry example, Congress has author ized $1.25 billion as the Federal share of the clean‐water pro gram; but in fact it only appro priated $800 million, while Mr. Nixon asked in his budget for a mere $214 million, and left unsaid what part, if any, of the other available $586 million he will actually spend. The au thorization of $450 million over the Congressional appropria tion, of course, goes completely, to waste. The President's proposals may therefore be more realistic as to what Congress can be expected to do in future years; and they probably take more closely into account the amounts likely to be available for this purpose. Undoubtedly, Mr. Nixon in planning for his antipollution program was feel ing the pinch of the huge reduc tions in expectable revenues that Congress has just voted, unwisely and irresponsibly, in the so‐called tax‐reform bill. Moreover, a recent report of the General Accounting Office demonstrated graphically that municipal waste‐treatment fa cilities cannot do the antipol lution job if heavy concentra tions of industrial polluters continue to foul the waters. Administration sources say Mr. Nixon plans to deal with in dustrial pollution by imposing something like an effluents tax, derived from a British model, and somewhat similar to the proposal put forward recently by Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin. Such a tax would rise with the amount and the polluting effect of a manufacturer's dis charges into lakes and streams, and would have the effect of making it cheaper for him to devise nonpolluting methods of waste disposal. In the Prox mire proposal, at least, the proceeds from the effluents tax would be devoted to financing municipal treatment plants. It remains to be seen whether a Republican Administration will crack down in this tough man ner on the nation's industrial ists. Mr. Nixon's speech also sug gested that he will propose some formula whereby manu facturers will pass to the con sumer the cost of disposing of such “solid wastes” as old auto mobiles, tires, plastic contain ers and beer cans. That is one way to finance the program publicly, since Congress insist ed on reducing taxes and Mr. Nixon failed to Stop it. What really matters in the long run is not so much any one of the specifics with which Mr. Nixon must now come for ward, but that he should meet the obligation he undertook to “make our peace with nature” by beginning “to make repara tions for the damage we have done to our air, to our land and to our water.” That is the high standard to which the American people now are en titled to hold him, without re gard to the arcane language of authorizations, obligational au thority, appropriations, match ing grants and other political legerdemain. The redemption of this obli gation is vital not only in the antipollution cause, important as it is, but because of the visi ble decline of faith in the Amer ican people that their leaders and Government can or will make good just such pledges as Mr. Nixon's. He has said of the new decade that it is “now or never” for the environment; and the same might well be said for the American political system itself. Both have been polluted long enough by empty promises. “The thinker”

425-> ...Some Closed Libraries
The importance of preserving the objectivity, and thereby the credibility, of United States Information Agency libraries is illustrated in India, where the Government has just bowed to leftist demands and closed down five American cultural centers, charging they were engaging in “undesirable activities.” The charge was never sustained, but the current effort to politicize the libraries with “conservative” works could give it a credence it does not deserve. The Indian Government clamped down on the Amer ican centers in a clumsy attempt to cover its embar rassment over an unauthorized Soviet cultural center which it was compelled to ban after the building col lapsed while under construction. Hundreds of Indians, including scholars and state government officials, pleaded for preservation of the American centers with their well‐stocked libraries, offering eloquent testi mony to the effectiveness of the balanced, low‐key policies of the past. Any effort to make the overseas American libraries overt instruments for political propaganda will only alienate such loyal patrons and encourage other timid governments to yield to the noisy objections of Amer ica's political foes.

426-> U.S. JUDGES TOLD TO DISCLOSE FEES
WASHINGTON, March 18— Federal judges will be required to make semiannual public re ports of fees for outside serv ices, gifts and other possible conflicts of interest. The new reporting system was adopted yesterday by the Judicial Conference of the United States and announced today by its chairman, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Under the new system, the more than 500 Federal judges below Supreme Court level will be required to file their first disclosures June 30. The re ports will be placed on public file in the court where each judge sits, in the office of his judicial circuit and in Wash ington. The procedure replaces a plan adopted last June at the urging of Chief Justice Earl Warren after Associate Justice Abe Fortas resigned under criticism for having accepted a $20,000 fee from the Wolfson Family Foundation. Under the earlier procedure, he judges would have been required to file on May 15 a much more extensive list of financial data, including statements of their 1969 income, investments, assets, gifts and bequests and a statement of all liabilities. These reports would have been kept confidential within the judicial brancti. The procedure announced to day will require judges to state their total income from all out side sources, including pay ments for lecturing, teaching, writing and serving as execu tors, trustees and directors. Any gift or fee in excess of $100 will be listed separately, with a statement of the off‐the‐bench time spent by the judge to earn the fees. Judges will also be required to disclose and explain any instances in which they know ingly sat on a case involving companies in which they owned stock or in which they pur chased stock while the case was pending before them. Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, was criticized last year during the Senate debate over his Supreme Court nomination because he had purchased shares in the Brunswick Cor poration while a case involving it was on appeal to his court. The new procedure will also require disclosure of judges' positions in business or chari table organizations, regardless of whether or not compensation is received. This is the third position on judicial ethics taken by the hierarchy of the Federal judi ciary since the Fortas and Haynsworth controversies made the behavior of Federal judges a public issue. Many Federal judges had complained about the rules adopted last June at Mr. War ren's urging. The rules forbade all outside fees without special permission, required public disclosure of any such fees and called for confidential reports by May 15. Last November, the Judicial Conference, a 25‐member group of judges that serves as the policy‐making arm of the Fed eral judiciary, canceled the prohibition against outside fees and left open the matter of financial reporting. That action was criticized by Senator Joseph D. Tydings, Democrat of Maryland, and others as a retreat on judicial ethics. Today's action, which will require the first public re porting of off‐the‐bench activi ties by Federal judges, appears to be a compromise between the other policies. The new procedures will not require disclosures by Supreme Court Justices. The Judicial Conference takes the position that its jurisdiction does not include the Supreme Court. There is uncertainty as to what powers, if any, exist to enforce the Judicial Conference's rules if any judges fail to file reports. In a related action today. Federal District Judge William E. Miller of Tennessee, who was mentioned last year as a possible Supreme Court nom inee, was accused in public tes timony of having violated the canons of judicial ethics by participating in a speculative stock transaction with two Nashville lawyers. The accusation was made by Fyke Farmer, a Nashville law yer, in a hearing before a Sen ate Judiciary subcommittee that is considering Judge Mil ler's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Farmer charged that Judge Miller had acted unethi cally by purchasing, at 50 cents a share, “insider” shares of stock in Minnie Pearl's Chicken Systems, Inc., which rose to $57 per share and then dropped “precipitiously” to about $9. The Minnie Pearl company, named for the entertainer, was formed by two lawyers, John Jay Hooker Jr. and his brother, Henry. John Hooker was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Gov ernor of Tennessee in 1966 and is running for the same office this year. Mr. Farmer charged that the controversy over the decline in the stock and Judge Miller's purchase from a lawyer‐politi cian who had practiced in his court had brought discredit upon the court and had raised questions of propriety. Judge Miller testified in reply that he purchased $500 worth of shares for his daughter after the Hooker brothers told him they were quitting law practice to go into business. He told reporters he sold some of the shares for about $39 a share on the day they were offered for public sale and gave all of the money and the remaining shares to his daughter. He said he did not remember how many of his 1,000 shares he had sold or how much money his daughter had re ceived. In answer to a question, Judge Miller said he did not think that his involvement in the stock transaction had influ enced the decision to name Judge G. Harrold Caswell and not him to the Supreme Court.

428-> Songmy Captain Accused Of Responsibility in Deaths
WASHINGTON, April 1— Capt. Ernest L. Medina was ac cused by the Army today of being “responsible” for the mur der of Vietnamese civilians al legedly killed by members of his infantry company in the vil lage of Songmy two years ago. Details of the new charges lodged against the 33‐year‐old officer were not made public, but the Army said they involved the 102 alleged victims of First Lieut. William L. Calley Jr., the 30 civilians whom S.Sgt. David Mitchell is accused of killing, and murders allegedly commit ted by at least five other enlisted members of Captain Medina's company. The men were members of Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, which was under the command of Captain Medina when it swept into Songmy on a combat operation. In an evening news confer ence in Atlanta, Captain Medina denied the charges and dis closed that they accuse him of the premeditated murder of not fewer than 175 Vietnamese civilians. He repeated his denials of having participated in or or dered or seen any mass killings in Songmy. “I did not order a massacre and I did not see a massacre take place,” he said. “I will rely on the truth to prove my innocence. I am a professional soldier. I am loyal to my coun try and I have nothing to hide.” The Army is already investi gating an earlier charge that accuses Captain Medina of four murders, a maiming and an as sault during the Songmy opera tion on March 16 and 17, 1968. The new charge, however, conceptually broadens the Army inquiry by apparently placing the blame for most of the mur ders believed to have taken place upon the commander of the men who allegedly did the killing. The Army today withdrew an earlier charge that Captain Medina concealed from his su periors knowledge of slayings at Songmy. The charge was withdrawn because, according to the Army, “it is not common practice to chage an individual with the commission of an of fense and its concealment.” The new charge of premedi tated murder does not mean, according to Army spokesmen, that Captain Medina is accused of personally murdering any in dividuals. Rather, the spokesmen said, the charge “involves deaths al legedly caused by Captain Me dina as a principal.” As defined by the Army, “a principal is one who counsels, commands or procures another to commit an offense sub sequently perpetrated... whether he is present or absent at the commission of the of fense.” The new charge against Cap tain Medina carries a possible maximum penalty of death, as do the murder charges lodged against him last month. Under the Army's judicial procedure, the next step is to initiate an Article 32 investi gation, roughly the same as a grand jury proceeding, to de termine whether Captain Me dina should face a court martial. So far, he has not been ordered to stand trial on any of the accusations that have been made against him. Announcement of the addi tional charge was made jointly at the Pentagon and at Third Army headquarters at Fort Mc Pherson, Ga. Captain Medina told reporters he was in At lanta to keep a social engage ment, but he did not elaborate upon it. He is now stationed at Fort Benning, about 100 miles from Atlanta. Altogether, 13 military men have been charged with com mitting murder and other crimes in Songmy. In addition, 12 other officers, including two gener als, are accused of involvement in suppressing information, about the alleged mass killings in Songmy by American soldiers. Army sources indicated today that Captain Medina was not accused of being responsible for “all’ of the killings that the Army believes occurred, but of “most of them.” Lieut. Gen. William R. Peers, who headed an Army board of inquiry on Songmy, told a news conference on March 17 that the inquiry established that “a tragedy of major proportions” took place there. A heavily censored version of the report made by General Peers was publicly released. An article about the uncensored version appeared, last week in The New York Times and said that the report identified an officer as having introduced a “revenge element” into the Songmy operation. ATLANTA, April 1 (AP)— Captain Medina again denied tonight that he had participated in or witnessed a massacre at the Songmy hamlet in 1968. Speaking briefly before a news conference, he issued the following statement: “I did not order a massacre and I did not see a massacre take place. I will rely on the truth to prove my innocence. I am a professional soldier. I am loyal to my country and I have nothing to hide. “My family and I will con tinue to rely on the truth, and I am sure with God's help this will prevail. I hope the Ameri can public will withhold its judgement until the true facts are established in a court of law.” Captain Medina refused to comment further or answer questions after making the statement.

429-> Even Today His Music Sums Up the Condition of Man
Is Beethoven still relevant 200 years after his birth? Even to pose the question seems ludicrous, for his works remain a staple of the repertory and in the tradi tional hierarchy of values they represent one of the glo ries of civilization. But to a former music critic like my‐ self, the Beetho ven symphonies, An concertos a n d Appraisal sonatas had be come such an oft told tale that for years I avoided them. And the young people who make up the vast new audiences all over the world: Don't they worship new idols—the frantic gods and goddesses of rock—and are they not right, after all, to seek an expression of their drives and passions in the music of their own time? Of course, they are! And yet. In an honest effort to un derstand the Now music that moves these young people, I have listened to it conscien tiously. For example, last Sunday I tuned in on a pro gram called “Fanfare” on Channel 13, devoted on this occasion to rock. It came after the latest segment of Kenneth Clark's discourses on “Civilisation,” which, by coincidence, was called “The Smile of Reason.” The rock program, taped in San Francisco, brought together three well‐known groups, the Jefferson Air plane, the Grateful Dead and Santana, and though a lot of agonized grimacing and writhing was visible, there was certainly no smile of rea son. As for the music—grant ed that this was only an hour's sampling and granted that one could hear striking effects that reminded one of India's sitar—it was funda mentally limited, repetitious in invention and development and a crushing bore long be fore its courage was run. The next morning, driving down from the country, tuned in on WQXR and happened on a performance by the American pianist, John Browning, of Beetho ven's “Appassionata” Sonata. If there was any Beethoven I had had enough of, it was the “Appassionata.” I cannot recall how many hundreds of times I sat through it in concert halls in performances by pianists great, modest and unspeakable, and I had not willingly heard it in years. But it immediately seized me. Never mind the per formance, which was good enough. It was the music, relentless, in its momentum and fierce in its intensity. Here spoke a sovereign dramatist in tone, pouring his revolutionary fervor into fresh musical molds. Here was the voice of a man dis contented with the decorum and even, if you like, the smile of reason that had marked much of the manners and art of preceding decades. Here was an uncouth, ram bunctious fellow telling it passionately and violently for what he knew in his bones was a new day and a new world. Old hat today? The new day and new world that Beethoven was heralding at the beginning of the 19th century when he wrote the “Appassionata” and other heaven‐storming works look constricted and slow‐moving to our turbulent, hectic time. But the “Appassionata,” de spite the familiarity of its ideas and structure, con tinues to be overwhelmingly dynamic and urgent. Beethoven's greatest music —there is so much of it— sums up the condition of man, as it was when he himself lived, as it is today and as it will be in genera tions and centuries to come. If in his one opera, “Fidelio,” he made explicit his unde viating preoccupation with freedom, his instrumental music implicitly sings of man's yearning to be un violated and whole. In Beethoven's music, how ever troublesome his own problems and personality were, man is ennobled, not fatuously and sanctimonious ly but with an uncompromis ing, yet loving awareness of what he is and can be. Beethoven sings of our ca pacity for joy and pain, grandeur and simplicity, struggle and tenderness. And at the end, in the slow move ment of the Ninth Sympho ny, the last quartets and last piano sonata, he leads us, like Moses, up to a mountain top and reveals, unlike Moses, that the promised land lies within ourselves. I am aware that it is unfair to equate rock with Beetho ven. But I wonder whether rock will be around, let alone relevant, a few years from now. But Beethoven? Does a force of nature disappear? He will be relevant as long as men have ears to hear and hearts to inspire, for his music expresses—indeed, is —the. human spirit trium phant.

431-> O'BRIEN CLARIFIES ROLE OF 2 PANELS
WASHINGTON, May 24— Lawrence F. O'Brien, the Dem ocratic national chairman, said today that two new commit tees named last week were created “solely for the purpose of speeding implementation” of the reform proposals of party commissions working toward the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Mr. O'Brien said that the two new ad hoc committees created Friday by the Democratic Na tional Executive Committee, each consisting of five members of the party's national com mittee, would have “no power to alter, dilute or in any way veto” guidelines already draft ed by one reform commission and under study by a second. Mr. O'Brien made this pledge in a letter to Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota, chairman of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, and Representative James G. O'Hara of Michigan, chairman of the Commission on Convention Rules. When the new ad hoc com mittees were announced, Mr. O'Brien and national committee aides said that the new groups would recommend to the na tional committee the reform proposals they thought should be adopted and that the na tional committee, in turn, would maket its recommendations to the 1972 convention. Senator McGovern and mem bers of his commission have maintained that its guidelines were binding on Party organi zations in the states and were not dependent on any further action or approval by the na tional committee or any sub committees. Mr. McGovern proposed yes terday that the guidelines be written into the call for the 1972 convention by the nation al committee. Among other things, they propose greater convention representation for young people, women and mi nority groups. In his letter to the commis sion chairmen, Mr. O'Brien cited a legal memorandum pre pared for him by Joseph F. Califano Jr., counsel to the Democratic National Commit tee, on the question of the status of guidelines already is sued by the McGovern coin mission. The O'Hara commis sion has not yet reported. The Califano memorandum does not address itself to the question of whether these guide lines can be altered by the national committee or a sub committee but says that the 1972 convention “is likely to adopt some or all of the provi sions of the guidelines” in de ciding whether a given state delegation should be seated.

432-> Bridge:
The current feeling that injustice is widespread in our society finds an occa sional echo at the bridge table, and the diagramed deal is an example. The players sitting East and West were members of a team that was leading in the final round of a Swiss team cham pionship in a recent Con necticut tournament. After South had opened in fourth position with one heart, the bidding proceeded with considerable optimism. North was entitled to jump to three hearts since he had passed already, but South was venturesome when he made a cue‐bid of four clubs. North's cue‐bid of four diamonds suggested the ace, and was therefore slightly eccentric. So was East's double. He was suggesting a diamond lead, but was more concerned to discour age North‐South from bid ding a slam that from East's angle seemed likely to suc ceed. However, North‐South paid no attention. South should have been content to bid four hearts over the double, knowing that his partner would continue if he held ideal cards for slam—the two missing aces and the heart king. The jump to five hearts was based on the as sumption that North held the diamond ace, and com manded that player to bid the slam if he held some control of the spade suit. North obeyed instructions, but he might have passed if he had considered that he had already misled South slightly by bidding four dia monds, and that a diamond lead was obviously coming. West led the diamond ace and South had no trouble. With any continuation, he was able to draw trumps, discard a spade loser on the diamond king, and finesse in clubs to make the slam. If West had led a spade instead of the diamond ace South would have been un able to avoid the loss of a spade trick. But he would have avoided the loss of a diamond trick by drawing trumps, ending in dummy and finessing in clubs. Dum my's diamonds can then be discarded on clubs. “That was a terrible slam,” said West accusingly. “It's probably cost us the cham pionship,” he added, rightly as it turned out. East had been doing some quick arithmetic. “He needed the diamond ace right, the club queen right, the clubs three‐two and the trumps not worse than three‐one. That's about 15 per cent, not counting the fact that my double suggested I had the diamond ace. There's no justice in this game. I think I'll take up chess instead.”

436-> First of Huge Buoys Is Installed Here
The first of seven buoys designed to replace lightships reported for duty off Sandy Hook, N.J'ester day. Its arrival began the age of the mammoth buoy for the Coast Guard, for which it will serve as a permanent aid to navigation. The device, which weighs 140 tons, was anchored at the point that had been oc cupied by Scotland Lightship until 1966. At that time the vessel was withdrawn and replaced by a large experi mental buoy, now no longer needed. The new Coast Guard buoys have a diameter of 40 feet and a tower 38 feet high. At Ambrose, the entrance to New York Harbor that was originally guarded by the Ambrose and Scotland Light ships, the new buoy supple ments the Ambrose Light station, a permanent Texas tower type structure in serv ice for several years. Several places now guarded by lightships — including the entrance to San Fran cisco Bay and the Humboldt Bay area in northern Cali fornia—are soon to have the large buoys installed. However, the Coast Guard plans to retain a limited number of lightships at such sites as Nantucket, Mass.; the Columbia River in Oregon and Cape May, N. J. Development of the large navigational buoy as a light ship replacement was dic tated by economics. Built by the General Dynamics Cor poration, it costs about $250,000 and does not have to be manned. A modern lightship would cost about $3‐million to build. In addition, it would require 15 to 19 men as well as support personnel ashore. The new buoy's tower houses a 7,500‐candlepower light, visible for 10 miles, a fog signal and a radio‐beacon antenna. Power is supplied by a continuously running diesel generator using pro pane gas. Refueling is re quired once a year. The buoys can be fitted with sensors to gather scien tific data.

437-> DATA ON PANTHERS SOUGHT FROM C.B.S.
The Justice Department Is making additional efforts to get information on the Black Pan thers from members of the news staff of the Columbia Broadcasting System. A department attorney called Mike Wallace, the C.B.S. news reporter, from Washington on Thursday to ask him to tes tify before Federal grand jury investigating the Panthers in New Haven. Last Tuesday, a similar re quest was made to Paul Loe wenwater, the producer of the series known as “60 Minutes.” That program on Jan. 6 carried a television report on the Black Panthers, including an inter view by Mr. Wallace with El dridge Cleaver, a leader of the Panthers who is now living in Algeria. A Justice Department spokes man confirmed yesterday that contacts were made with the C.B.S. officials in recent days and acknowledged that the possibility of serving them with subpoenas was being con sidered. But, he said, no final decision had been made. He said that Mr. Mitchell was fully aware of these deal ings and that the Attorney Gen eral did not think they con flicted with his statement of Feb. 5 that no further sub poenas would be issued without an attempt first to negotiate an agreement on their scope. However, Jay Topkis, a New York lawyer for C.B.S. retained last week by Mr. Wallace and Mr. Lowenwater, when asked if the recent conversations be tween the department and his clients could be characterized as the kind of negotiations promised by Mr. Mitchell, said “Certainly not.” Mr. Mitchell had blamed a “breakdown” in previous pro cedure for a series of wide ranging subpoenas for confi dential journalistic files on the Panthers and the Weatherman faction of the students for a Democratic Society. The sub poenas were served on C.B.S.; Earl Caldwell, a reporter of The New York Times; four Chi cago newspapers and Time, Life and Newsweek magazines. The subpoenas prompted sharp protests from news or ganizations. Mr. Mitchell, in response, said that henceforth “no subpeonas will be issued to the press without a good faith attempt by the department to reach compromise acceptable to both paties.” Richard S. Salant, president of C.B.S.'s News Department, expressed dismay over the Government's latest action. This is hardly a way to give us any reassurance,” he said. Mr. Salant noted that C.B.S. had already complied with an earlier subpoena for the unedit ed news film of the program on the Panthers, although he said the material had been made available as a result of a misunderstanding with the company's lawyers. Mr. Topkis said yesterday that he had received a call from the Justice Department re questing that Mr. Wallace and Mr. Loewenwater testify on their knowledge about the Panthers. “I told them that if they wanted to serve my clients with subpoenas they should put them in the mail,” Mr. Topkis said in response to an inquiry. “But I made no prom ise that we would comply.”

Eikenberry, a young, enlightened lawyer long active in community work, mounting his second challenge to incumbent John Rooney, a high‐ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. In his long years on Capitol Hill, Repre sentative Rooney has often been an obstructive force and has made small contribution to the national wel fare or to that of his district. Giving promise of progressive leadership that Mr. Rooney has, never fulfilled, Mr. Eikenberry merits support. Eighteenth District. Representative Adam Clayton Powell, cited by ten judges for “monstrous defiance of the law,” “abuse of legal procedures,” “promoting tragic disrespect for the judiciary” and similar, activities, is being challenged by State Assemblyman Charles B. Rangel. Mr. Rangel is an articulate, responsible lawmaker who has the respect of his colleagues Albany. He deserves preference over Mr. Powell, whose record is replete with contempt for the voters as well as for the courts. Twenty‐first District. This is the new triboiough district, embracing portions of Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, created by the State Legislature at its last session. Herman Badillo, former president of the Borough of the Bronx, stands head and shoulders above any of the other candidates. An architect of the “new politics” who believes in seeking change through the political process, he has been an innovator, conciliator and forceful leader, espousing numerous reforms par ticularly in the vital area of the state's electoral laws. Twenty‐second District. Gerrymandered out of the Twenty‐first District by the State Legislature, Repre sentative James H. Scheuer now is forced to seek nomination against the incumbent, Representative Jacob H. Gilbert. While their voting records are remarkably similar, they are in other ways political opposites. Mr. Scheuer is a spokesman for enlightened reform, Mr. Gilbert a holdover of the old Bronx Demo cratic organization. Mr. Scheuer, author and sponsor of important legislation in areas of criminal justice and education, clearly deserves preference. Twenty‐sixth District. The Republican incumbent, Ogden Reid, faces the challenge of a conservative, Mike Coffey, whose campaign literature offers the choice of “a real Republican.” In his four terms in the House, Mr. Reid has made an impressive record as a real Congressman rather than as a real partisan, a record that in every way entitles him to the renewed support of this Westchester district.

439-> SCIENCE ‘FASHION’ CALLED HARMFUL
FONTANA, Wis., Sept. 10 (AP)—A Latin‐American scien tist attacked “scientific fash ion” today and said it often resulted in the wdong kind of research in underdeveloped countries. “One sometimes falls into the trap of developing with foreign aid a scientific establishment which is not concerned with the problems of that country,” said Dr. Carlos Varsaysky of Buenos Aires. Dr. Varsaysky is the only Latin American among the more than 100 scientists from 35 na tions attending the 20th annual Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs at this re sort on Lake Geneva. The con ferences take their name from the site of the first meeting‐ Pugwash, Nova Scotia. Dr. Varsaysky, an astrophysi cist, is a member of the con tinuing committee for these conferences, founded by the late Lord Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher. “There are kinds of scientific development that are not good for a country,” he said in an interview, adding that “some times you simply develop science.” He said that only 2 per cent of research and development ef fort in non‐Communist coun tries was carried out in under developed countries. In highly developed countries, more than half of the research effort is devoted to defense, space exploration and nuclear energy, he said, and noted that this kind of research was of little use in developing coun tries. Since most of the money for research is available in these fields, most scientists pursue these interests and they “set the fashion in science,” he said. Such interests are self‐per petuating he said, since students work with professors who have these interests and then enter the same research field. Dr. Varsaysky formerly was director of the National Radio Astronomy Institute in Argen tina and a college professor. He was educated at the University of Colorado and Harvard. He said there is an “internal brain drain” as well as an “ex ternal brain drain.” The for mer, he said, refers to scholarly research that is not relevant to the problems of the scientist's country. The latter refers to em igration from the country. More Argentinian scientists, as well as‐:those from other de veloping nations, should work for industry and do technologi cal research to develop their countries rather than being in volved so overwheliningly in ac ademic research, he said.

440-> SHIFT IN DUMPING OF SLUDGE URGED
A scientist at the laboratory that did the study showing that a vast “dead sea” was result ing from the offshore dumping of sewage sludge said yester day that the only way to find out what to do about the waste was to try dumping it in a new area so that its action on the environment could be studied from the beginning. John Clark, the acting direc tor of the United States Marine Laboratory at Sandy Hook, said that in any case the dumping should be ceased at the present site near Ambrose Light be cause the dumping area was within the narrow coastal band of the ocean that is the richest in sea life. Mr. Clark said the dumping grounds should be moved to beyond the 20‐fathom depth because water shallower than that contains most of the ocean's life. The dumping grounds are now 8 to 12 miles from land. Going beyond the 20‐fathom depth would mean hauling the sludge 30 miles from land. Scientists have agreed that the sludge deposits have killed marine life but some have said that moving the dumping grounds would only transfer the problem to another, maybe even more dangerous, location. But Mr. Clark said in an interview that the under‐20‐ fathom area was so rich in sea life that it should be declared a “no‐tolerance zone” where no pollution would be allowed. He said that changing the dumping grounds to a “virgin” area farther out would allow scientists to check what hap pens from the time waste is first dumped. The dumping grounds at the harbor mouth have been in use for some 40 years and it is hard to tell the effect of the sludge on the natural environ ment because the dumping has been going on so long. If the sludge can be studied scientifi cally in a new area, Mr. Clark said, it might be possible to find a better way of handling it. While much attention has been focused on water pollu tion recently, Senator Charles E. Goodell warned at another environmental meeting yester day against concentrating on the “sexy, popular issues of air and water pollution.” He urged attention to problem areas where there were no standards. “In a number of vital en viromental fields, the Republi can Senator from New York said, “there simply are no Fed eral standards or enforcement procedures. This is true in the case of solid‐waste pollution.” Senator Goodell spoke at a Northeast regional meeting of the Student Council on Pollu tion and the Environment, an organization of college and high school students sponsored by the United States Department of the Interior. At the meeting, held in Co lumbia University's McMillan Theater, Senator Goodell drew the strongest applause from the audience of 350 when he said that none of the environmental problems would be solved “un til we cut down on military spending and get out of Viet nam.”

442-> LOSS IS SHOWN BY FOUR SEASONS
The Four Seasons Equity Corporation announced yester day that it would cease the de velopment of additional nursing centers because of “a serious liquidity problem.” The Oklahoma City ‐ based company also reported that it had a loss of about $905,000 in the 10 months ended April 30 and that John W. Johnston had resigned as chairman and presi dent. It said Joel I. Carson, formerly a vice president, had suc ceeded Mr. Johnston. Four Seasons Equity partici pates with Four Seasons Nurs ing Centers, Inc., in the devel opment of nursing centers. The stock of Four Seasons Nursing has been suspended from trad ing on the American Stock Ex change since April 30, when that company said it expected to report a loss for the quarter ended March 31. Four Seasons Nursing, which later revamped its top manage ment and board of directors, still has not issued a report for the March quarter. A spokes man said yesterday that drafts were submitted last week to the American Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requested additional information. The announcement by Four Seasons Equity said its ability to raise capital for new projects had been “jeopardized” by the suspension of trading in Four Seasons Nursing stock, by tight money conditions and by law suits filed against both com panies. As a result, it said, “addi tional closings of long‐term commitments by institutional lenders may not occur.”

445-> Burns Indicates Reserve Is Easing Curb on Money
WASHINGTON, March 18—Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, disclosed to Congress today that the Reserve had already moved to relax somewhat extremely restrictive mone tary policy and to permit resumption of growth in the nation's money supply. Mr. Burns said it was his view that present circum‐I stances called for a growth in money—currency and demand deposits—of at least 2 per cent, though he disclosed no details of exactly what the Re serve had decided to aim for in this or other monetary meas ures. Until the last few weeks, there had been no growth at, all in the money supply since last June. Testifying before the Senate Banking and Currency Commit tee, Mr. Burns presented what he called a “cautiously optim istic” assessment of the eco nomy. After examining individ ual sectors from automobiles to defense spending, he concluded that, “while a sluggish pace of economic activity may con tinue a while longer, it seems reasonable to expect a resump tion of economic growth in th relatively near future.” He also concluded that, “while there is little basis fo expecting an end to inflation this year, there is reason to expect substantial progress in slowing the rate of price in crease.” Mr. Burns's disclosure that the restrictive monetary policy pursued for a year had been re laxed somewhat followed only a day after President Nixon an nounced a modest switch in the Government's fiscal, or budget, policy in the form of a release of $1.5‐billion in construction funds, previously frozen. The economy, including a rise in money will go mainly for high ways. Both moves followed clear evidence of a slowing in the unemployment. Mr. Burns did not say in so many words that the Reserve had already made a switch in its policy. But he left no doubt on the point. There had already been hints—but no more—of change, contained in the week ly banking statistics. In his prepared statement, Mr. Burns pointed to some rise in recent weeks in the “monetary aggregates” such as money sup ply, total bank deposits (includ ing time as well as demand deposits) and bank credit. The main weapon that the Reserve uses to influence the growth of the money and other monetary aggregates is daily buying and selling of Govern ment securities in the open mar ket, which puts new money into the banking system or with draws money from it. Mr. Burns gave no hint of a change in the use of the Reserve's other and more dramatic weapons—a change in bank reserve require ments or a decrease in the dis count rate. When Senator William Prox mire, Democrat of Wisconsin, noted that there had been no growth in the money supply in January and February, Mr. Burns suggested that he look at weekly, rather than month ly, figures. The weekly figures for the last week have shown an increase, he pointed out, adding, “[his new trend is of some importance, and there I'll stop.” Third, when asked by Sena tor Robert W. Packwood, Re publican of Oregon, whether the Reserve was “leading” the recent decline in market in terest rates or merely allowing it to take place, Mr. Burns replied, “We have not been idle at the Federal Reserve Board, and I shall stop there.” He told Senator Proxmire that a recommendation of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that the Reserve maintain money‐supply growth within a range of 2 to 6 per cent a year was a “good rough general rule” that should apply “ordinarily.” Then he volun terered, “if you ask me whether it should apply now, my an swer is yes.” In saying as much as he did, Mr. Burns departed from the custom established by his pred ecessor, William McChesney Martin Jr., who never dis cussed current monetary policy. Mr. Burns even disclosed, without giving details, that he had “achieved unanimity” in one of the two meetings of the Federal Open Market Com mittee over which he had pre sided but not in the other. The committee establishes the day to‐day operating policy of the Reserve—the policy that Mr. Burns indicated had been mod ified in the direction of less restraint. In his prepared testimony, he emphasized the “marked de cline that has taken place in interest rates.” He conceded that this decline had recently been reversed for longer‐term bonds, but said that “such tem porary reversals are not uncom mon, representing as they do swings that occur in market psychology and short‐term changes in the supply of new securities.” Under questioning, he said he expected mortgage interest rates to be “a little lower” by the end of this year and “ap preciably lower” by 1972. He also said he expected the prime lending rate of banks to be lower by the end of this year and he added that he hoped it would he reduced “fairly soon.” These were some of the high lights of Mr. Burns's analysis of the current state of the economy and the outlook: ¶The downturn in consumer durable goods, chiefly auto mobiles, “may already be in large part behind us.” and “pros pects seem favorable for an early pickup in buying.” This sector “could well become a source of stimulus” for the economy.” ¶Housing construction “may decline somewhat further in the months immediately ahead,” but “there are grounds for be lieving that some improvement in the trend of home‐building will begin this summer.” He noted that there was some im provement in the deposits of banks and thrift institutions, which are major mortgage lend ers. ¶Defense expenditures will continue to decline but “other Federal expenditures are sched uled to rise, and they will more than offset the decrease in de fense spending.” ¶Although business invest ment in plant and equipment is unlikely to be as strong as indicated by the Government survey published last week, it will “nevertheless remain at a very high level throughout this year.” ¶State and local government expenditures are growing less rapidly than usual, but may show more strength “later this year.” Assessing the current situa tion and the outlook, Mr. Burns said, “we must be prepared for some relatively unfavorable economic news in the weeks ahead” but the adjustment now under way does not seem to have the pervasive or cumula tive characteristics that mark a business recession.” Although he said he was “heartened” by the slower climb of wholesale prices in February, Mr. Burns cautioned that “we obviously cannot con clude from the evidence of at single month that a significant further reduction in the rate of price advance is just around the corner.” But he said that “past history assures us that market forces will slow the rate of price advance, provided we avoid a renewed outbreak of excess demand for goods and services.”

446-> British Troops Fire Tear Gas In Fight With Belfast Catholics
BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Thursday, April 2 (Reuters)— British troops fired tear gas to break up a fierce street battle with hostile Roman Catholics here early today. At least eight shots were fired in a four‐hour battle. The army rushed in re inforcements, bringing the num ber of troops to nearly 1,000, in an effort to check an un ruly crowd of about 600 Catho lics. Reports said the gas was having little effect dispersing the crowds, which had been hurling bottles, bricks and pav ing stones at the soldiers. Several soldiers were injured, none seriously. The pitched battle erupted in the predominantly Catholic Ballymurphy Housing Estate, where more than 20 soldiers were injured in another violent flare‐up early yesterday. Dozens of policemen were sent into a Protestant area across the road from the hous ing estate to prevent Protes tants from joining the battle. It was the first time shots had been fired in Belfast since severe rioting last October.

451-> 3 Officers Exonerated by Army On Songmy Cover‐Up Charges
WASHINGTON, June 23—The Army dismissed criminal charges today against a briga dier general and two other of ficers implicated in an alleged cover‐up of the Songmy inci dent. Two of the officers, Brig. Gen. George H. Young Jr. and Col. Nels A. Parson, had been accused of failure to obey law ful regulations and derelection of duty. The third, Maj. Robert W. McKnight, had been charged with false swearing. The decision to dismiss the charges was made by Lieut. Gen. Jonathan O. Seaman, com manding general of the First Army, “upon his evaulation that the charges were unsupported by the evidence,” the Army an nounced. In a separate announcement, the Army disclosed that charges of prem ditated murder and assault with intent to murder had been lodged against two junior officers who had already been accused of at tempted murder in connection with a 1969 incident in South Vietnam. The two officers, Capt. Vin cent N. Hartmann and First Lieut. Robert G. Lee, who are assigned to the Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga., were accused of the premedi tated murder of a Vietnamese female and assault with intent to murder a Vietnamese male. Captain Hartmann, 34 years old, and Lieutenant Lee, 22, were charged on May 28 in connection with an incident that took place on or about June 15, 1989, in a hamlet in the Mekong Delta area of South Vietnam. According to the earlier charges, the two men ordered soldiers under their command to fire into buildings “used for human habitation.” The new charges, which also stem from June 15, 1969, raise the prospect that the two of ficers may have to face the death penalty for premeditated murder if it is decided to place their cases before a courts‐mar tial. The announcement that charges against General Young and the two other officers had been dismissed was made at Fort Meade, Md., headquarters of the First Army, and at the Defense Department. The three officers have been assigned to Fort Meade since a special Army panel disclosed the charges against them on March 17. The panel had been appointed to determine wheth er mass killings took place in the village of Sbngmy, South Vietnam, in March of 1968 and whether such killings had been hushed up. As a result of the panel's investigation, 14 officers were accused of involvement in the suppression of information. The charges against one of them were subsequently dismissed. Today's announcement leaves nine officers accused of in volvement in suppression of in formation and 12 other soldiers accused of actual participation in the alleged kil lings. Only four of them have been ordered to face trial. The others are under investigation. “This is the stage where the responsible commander makes his evaluation, based on the advice of his own legal staff, of whether there is sufficient basis for further processing of the charges,” the announcement continued. The dismissal was made before a proceeding com parable to a grand jury inves tigation was held. General Young, was the sec ond highest‐ranking officer charged as a result of the Army inquiry. Maj. Gen. Samuel W. Koster, who was accused of failure to obey lawful regula tions and dereliction of duty, is on duty at Fort Meade while the charges are being investigated. At the time of the Songmy incident, General Young was as sistant commander of the Americal Division in Vietnam, and General Koster was the commander. General Koster was Superin tendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point when the charges were disclosed. According to the Army, the officers cleared of improper ac tions will be restored to normal duty and assigned to activities comparable to those of their veers.

452-> ‘Boom War’ May Break More Than Mideast Windows
— The Middle East reverberated last week to the relatively routine thunder of a sonic boom. This one was made by a Syrian MIG‐21 over Haifa, however. It was the first such Arab aerial incursion since the 1967 war. Some Israeli assumptions were shattered with the win dows on the western slopes of Mt. Carmel. Only a week ear lier, Deputy Premier Yigal Allon had assured the nation that its air defense system was among the world's best. Speaking in Parliament, he said that even if some planes were able to penetrate the Israeli early warn ing system, they would not be able to return to their base. But the Syrian jet left as neatly as it had arrived. The Israeli reaction, as far as the man in the street was con cerned, seemed to be one of shock followed by wry amuse ment. A nation that can swipe a radar station from a hostile neighbor knows when it sees ft. Within an hour, Israeli jets were over Damascus, plowing the air to break windows in the Syrian capital. Later that night, in a strategic version of “any thing you can do I can do bet ter,” they swept over five Syrian cities, including Aleppo, 275 miles from Haifa, to con tinue the drama. The “boom war,” as Israeli commentators were calling it, was part of a more serious po litical and military contest, however, that continues to op erate on several levels. The political level, as far as Israelis are concerned, seems to have become less important in recent weeks. Major power talks continue, but with no apparent achievements. This pleases Is raelis who believe that they only serve to draw attention away from the necessity for the parties to the Middle East dis pute to settle it themselves. If any political event inter ested the Israelis last week, it was the statement by President Nixon to a gathering of Jewish organization leaders in Wash ington. Reaffirming American support for Israel, Mr. Nixon said the United States was “pre pared to supply military equip ment necessary to support the efforts of friendly governments, like Israel's, to defend the safe ty of their people.” The President amplified on these remarks at his news con ference Friday, saying, “We are neither pro‐Arab nor pro‐Israel. We are pro‐peace. We are for security for all nations in that area.” Indicating concern over the French decision to sell 100 or more jets to Libya, he said the Israelis' request for additional American arms would be consid ered in the light of “the threats to them from states in the area. That decision will be made within the next 30 days” Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, asked if he thought this represented any change in American policy, replied that he will know better when Washing ton made up its mind on an Is raeli request made four months ago for more arms. Although the Nixon state ment fundamentally represented nothing new, his reasons for making it attracted speculation here. Some suggested that he was repairing links with Israel that had been damaged in the diplomatic exchanges over Unit ed States and other Middle East peace proposals. It was also thought that Mr. Nixon was reminding the Rus sians that the United States had a stake in the Middle East and was not prepared to abandon it. France's apparent bid to regain her influence in the area through the sale of arms to Libya also might have motivat ed Mr. Nixon. Premier Golda Meir, at any rate, welcomed the Nixon state ment enthusiastically, calling it an “eloquent expression ... noted with gratification.” Per haps it was an effort on her part to dramatize the links be tween the two nations and to offset the impression of Israeli isolation. Political moves also were evi dent from the Arab side of the Middle East conflict with re ports that President Nasser of the United Arab Republic visit ed Moscow recently. The Israelis declined to say whether or not they knew of the reported visit, but they saw good reasons for such a meeting. The Israelis be lieve that they are succeeding in making life difficult for the Egyptian leader. Mr. Dayan, answering news men's questions on Wednesday, denied, however, that Israeli jet strikes around Cairo were in tended to topple the Egyptian President. He gave two strategic reasons for the raids: To help Israeli troops hold the front line along the Suez Canal, and to con vince the Egyptian leaders that they are in no position to launch an all‐out war. Mr. Dayan said the aerial at tacks that began Jan. 7 around the Egyptian capital, were “not to bring the fall of Nasser per sonally. I can't see that as an objective, and I don't really think we can do it.” He did say, however, that the raids also were intended to have a psychological effect, to bring the war home to the Egyptian people. Israeli strategists say the Egyptian leaders have long avoided giving their people the unpleasant truth of the conduct of the war. Israeli officials have been pre senting the view that it does not matter much to them whether Mr. Nasser stays or goes. Some have suggested that his succes sor could not be any worse from Israel's point of view. But the consequences of Is rael's psychological war against the Egyptians is considerably less important to the Israelis than the results of the military con frontation. They believe that pol itics and diplomacy flow from strength, and not the other way around. The tactical objective, neutralization of the Egyptian military machine, remains par amount in the view of most observers. Psychological objec tives, such as a change of at titude in Cairo, continues to stand as a secondary aim.

453-> Safety Standards For Home Devices Urged on Congress
WASHINGTON, June 23— The National Commission on Product Safety, concluding a two‐year, $2‐million investi gation, urged Congress today to authorize mandatory Fed eral safety standards for products used by household ers and their families. A new regulatory agency to be called the Consumer Product Safety Commission would write and enforce the standards under legislation proposed by the seven‐mem ber study group. Prompt and “adequate” action was immediately prom ised by the chairman of the Senate Commerce Commit tee, Warren G. Magnuson, Democrat of Washington. He announced that the commit tee would start public hear ings tomorrow on the legis lative recommendations. The investigating commis sion, established by Congress and consisting of private citizens appointed by President Johnson, made the recom mendations in its final report to Congress and President Nix on. The report included a draft of the proposed legislation. The new regulatory commis sion would have authority to promulgate safety standards for all products sold at retail and used in or around the household except those already covered by Federal safety laws. The commission would first have to determine that Federal regulation of a product was necessary “to prevent or re duce unreasonable risk of death or injury.” Then it could issue a standard or other regu lation applying to the prod uct's performance, contents, components, design, construe tion, finish and packaging as deemed “reasonable neces sary.” Without specifically recom mending standards for any particular product, the investi gating commission listed 16 categories of products as haz ardous. In each of the categories, the commission said it had found “makes, models and types of products which constitute an unreasonable hazard to the health and safety of the con suming public.” The list, as printed alphabetically in the re port, follows: Architectural glass (used for shower enclosures, storm doors, sliding doors and the like); color television sets (fire hazards); fireworks; floor fur naces; glass bottles; “high‐rise” bicycles (featuring a small front wheel, small frame and high handlebars); Hot‐water vaporizers; household chemi cals; infant furniture; ladders; power tools; protective head ger; rotary lawnmowers; toys; unvented gas heaters and wringer‐washers. Congress, responding to an interim commission report, has passed legislation to regulate toy safety. Other consumer products covered by existing Federal safety laws are food, drugs, cosmetics, motor veh icles insecticides, firearms, cigarettes, radiological devices and flammable fabrics. The commission held that in dustry self‐regulation in the safety field was “legally unen forceable and patently inade quate,” That state laws were impractical and that federal authority was “virtually non existent. “Because of the inadequacy of existing controls on product hazards,” the report said, “We find a need for a major Federal role in the development and execution of methods to pro tect the American consumer.” In addition to its standard setting role, the proposed regulatory commission would be empowered to bar products from interstate commerce if adequate protection of the pub lic safety could not otherwise be effected. It could also seek temporary or permanent injunctions in Federal courts against the mar keting of unreasonably hazard ous products. Manufacturers, under the proposed legislation, would be required to notify buyers of any “substantial” safety defects in their products and of the failure of any product to meet a Federal standard. Manufac turers would then have to re pair or replace the product without charge or refund the purchase price. Willful violators of safety standards would be subject to criminal penalties ranging up to $50,000 in fines and 180 days in jail. Other violators would be subject to maximum civil penalties of $2,000 for each violation and $500 for any re lated series of violations. Injured consumers could sue individually or as a group in class actions, for treble dam ages against willful violators. Other provisions of the pro posed legislation call for the following: ¶Representation of consumer interests before the regulatory commission by a consumer safety advocate appointed by the President. ¶Accreditation by the com mission of private laboratories to test products and certify them as complying with stand ards. ¶Establishment of a facility for research, development of test methods and analysis of consumer products for safety under the commission's juris diction. Authority for the commission to inspect manufacturing facili ties, conduct public hearings and subpoena witnesses and documents, establish an injury information clearing house to collect and analyze data on ac cidents and disseminate infor mation to the public about hazardous consumer products. The report also suggested that the Federal Trade Com mission issue regulations to en force truthfulness in the cer tification or endorsement of the safety of consumer products by private organizations using, seals, symbols and other methods. The report included a sepa rate statement by Hugh L. Ray, a commission member who re tired last January as director of Sears, Roebuck and Com pany's merchandise develop ment and testing laboratory. He questioned the need for mandatory standards at this time. Otherwise, no dissents were recorded. Arnold B. Elkind, a New York Lawyer, is chairman of the commission. Other mem bers are Emory J. Crofoot of Portland, Ore., a lawyer; Sidney Margolius of New York, a syndicated columnist; Henry Aaron Hill, president of the Riverside Research Laboratory, Haverhill, Mass.; Michael Pert schuk, chief counsel of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Dana Young, senior vice president of the Southwest Re search Institute, San Antonio, Texas. A commission spokesman said Mr. Ray had verbally made some reservations but was “in virtual agreement” with the report as a whole. Despite the Senate Com merce Committee's quick re sponse, it was uncertain whether Congress would com plete action on the legislative recommendations this year. The House Commerce Committee is “awfully busy” and will not be able to start hearings for some time, according to the chair man, Representative Harley O. Staggers, Democrat of West Virginia. But we'll get to it,” he added. “We'll get to it this year. “I'm all for helping the consumer.”

454-> PAY BILL PASSED BY SENATE PANEL
WASHINGTON, April 7 (AP) —Acting quickly in the after math of the first postal strike in history, a Senate committee approved unanimously today bill to give all civilian and military Federal workers a Per cent pay increase. The measure, ma as an amendment to a bill already passed by the House, did not touch on postal reform, a fur ther 8 per cent pay rise pro posed for postal workers or the Administration's bid to pay for part of the cost by charging a dime to mail a first‐class letter. But the legislation approved by the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee would extend the 6 per cent raise to the 29,000 Capitol Hill em ployes—not including members of Congress—as well as to the five‐man staffs of ex‐Presidents and to judges in the District of Columbia. It would be retro active to the pay period ending last Dec. 27. The committee chairman, Gale W. McGee, Democrat of Wyoming, said he expected little or no opposition when the bill reached the Senate floor tomorrow or Thursday. He said there was a possibility the House could act and send the measure to President Nixon by the “end of the week. “We could see no merit in foot‐dragging on this,” Senator McGee said when asked wheth er the quick action had any thing to do with continued restlessness among postal workers, especially in New York City where the large scale walkout began. “I realize the increase of per cent will not bring the salaries of Post Office and other Civil Service employes up to a level comparable to private industry,” a committee mem ber, Senator Frank E. Moss, said. “However, the committee has agreed to continue our con sideration of further adjust ment,” the Utah Democrat added. The collective bargaining ses sion with officials of postal em ployes unions — the first ever agreed to by the Federal Gov ernment—tied an additional per cent raise for postal em ployes to reorganization of the Post Office—specifically, crea tion of a postal corporation to run the system on streamlined business principles. This proposal and Mr.Nixon's 10‐cent stamp idea face tough Congressional in‐fighting.

455-> The Text of Democrats' Draft Resolution on Vietnam
Despite the Administra tion's claims of progress, Vietnam remains our most urgent overseas problem and our most divisive and bitter domestic one. Our national interests require that the war in Vietnam be brought to a close at the earliest practical moment. The loss of life, the diversion of resources from critical domestic needs and the disunity of our country must be ended. The withdrawal of some U.S. troops is a desirable first step and we support this decision. But future U.S. de cisions, affecting American lives and resources, should not be dependent on either North Vietnamese or South Vietnamese action. U.S. with drawal should not be depen dent upon the progress of the Paris peace talks, the level of violence, or the prog ress of so‐called Vietnamiza tion. It should depend wholly and exclusively upon the in terest and policy of the United States. That interest and that policy require a firm and unequivocal com mitment to the American people that all U.S. forces be withdrawn from Vietnam. We see no reason why this withdrawal should not be completed within 18 months. The resolution of the Viet namese tragedy cannot be found in military measures alone—whether those of the United States, or, through Vietnamization, those of South Vietnam. It can be found in political arrange ments which brought the South Vietnamese Govern ment to the point where it is truly representative of all the people. To equip the present Thieu Government, as we are now doing, so that it can con tinue its rule through miltiary, means with U.S. military sup. port is not only unjustifiable but delusive. The U.S. should be interested in ending the violence in Vietnam, not pro longing it. And so long as the present Government believes that it can count on U.S. mili tary support for an indefinite period, we believe it will not take or permit others to take the domestic political meas ures in South Vietnam which are essential to peace. There are questions unan swered regarding negotiations as well. It is puzzling that President Nixon stated in his Nov. 3 address that Ho Chi Minh's letter to him “flatly rejects” his approach. We had been faced with a North Viet namese demand that a settle ment “must bey ... in ac cordance with the National Liberation Front program.” ... But Ho Chi Minh's letter stated, “The 10‐point pro gram ... is a logical and reasonable basis for settle ment.” Furthermore, his let ter ended by stating, “With good will on both sides we might arrive at common ef forts in view of finding a correct solution to the Viet nam problem.” Was this a rejection, or, in fact, an in vitation for further negotia tion? By failing to appoint a successor to Ambassador Lodge, the Administration has created the widespread impression that it has down graded the Paris talks and “written off” negotiations. We believe that the President should immediately appoint a high‐level negotiator to head the Paris delegation. Among the subjects that should be pressed are steps to reduce the level of combat and vio lence, leading to a cease‐fire. President Thieu has de nounced and taken action against Vietnamese political leaders who have urged a ne gotiated compromise settle ment. Yet there is evidence that a majority of South Viet namese desire such a settle ment. Even in the 1967 elec tions, over 60 per cent of the people voted for civilian can didates who ran on some type of peace platform. We believe that the United States should now insist on the inclusion in the Saigon Government of men who represent wider public opinion desiring a peaceful solution and who are prepared to negotiate such a settlement.

456-> U.S. Reply to Israelis on Jets Is Now Scheduled for Monday
WASHINGTON. March 18— The Nixon Administration's lung‐awaited decision on Israel's request to buy new jet aircraft in the United States is expected to be disclosed by Secretary of State William P. Rogers on Monday. The State Department an nounced today that he had scheduled a news conference then, and officials indicated that it would be the forum for the statement on the jets for Israel. President Nixon said on Jan. 30 that a decision on the sale of jets would be made within a month. Until this morning, the plan for Mr. Rogers was to issue the jet announcement tomorrow. The White House reportedly de cided last weekend that it would be the secretary of State and not Mr. Nixon who would publicly handle the controver sial subject. Today, however, officials said that Mr. Rogers decided to postpone the news confer ence until Monday because of the pressure of other engage ments. But informed Adminis tration quarters attributed the new delay in equal measure to the still‐unsolved problems on how the jet announcement is to be worded. It was widely believed here that Mr. Nixon would at best offer the Israelis a highly quali fied answer on their request to buy 35 supersonic Phantom fighter‐bombers and more than 100 Skyhawk fighters. The Administration, which initially was known to lean in favor of granting the Israeli request, has shifted to the posi tion that it will be up to the United States to determine, on the basis of its own assess ment of the military situation in the Middle East, when Israel will require additional aircraft to maintain an adequate de fense.

457-> Remington didn't like the way Custer was dressed
Last summer I visited the Gilcrease Collection of West ern Art in Tulsa, and found myself thrilled by the Indian battle paintings of a man I had never heard of, Charles Schreyvogel. I had thought that Frederic Remington and Charles Russell were the great painters of the post‐Civil War West. Now here was their unknown equal. Who was he? I found out from this ad mirable presentation of his life, and of most of the works that he created between 1891 and 1912 on the roof of his home in Hoboken. My ignorance was disgraceful. In his day, he was judged at least Remington's equal, and it was my own fault that I had to go to Tulsa to discover him. James Horan has written a text that piles up pathos like a Chaplin movie and gives us an immensely appealing Schrey vogel. The artist was born of German immigrant parents on New York's dreary East Side. He grew up in the German American town of Hoboken and studied in Germany at the in sistence of his mother and brothers, who could not really afford it. He was a frail asth matic and he came close to dy ing periodically after his re turn in 1890. From childhood, he had dreamed of cavalry and Indians. When his doctor or dered him West for his health, he prepared himself by sketch ing Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and Army pageants on Governors Island. In 1893, he spent the first of several sum mers out West, returning to Hoboken with (the author writes) “an incredible amount of Indian and cavalry memo rabilia.” He decided to devote the rest of his life to his family, the simple pleasures of Hobo ken and the creation of drama tic and accurate scenes of Indian warfare. If he couldn't be a hero, he would paint those who could. The author describes Schrey vogel's incessant work on his Hoboken roof, using neighbors and clay horses for models and the brown Palisades for scene ry. He tells of his extreme modesty, of his deep and recip rocated love for his family and friends, of his joy in playing Santa Claus for his children at Christmas, with simulated rein deers landing him on the roof. He produced only a few war fare paintings each year and sold them to his neighbors for just enough to keep his family from starving. Suddenly, after a bleak Christmas of 1899, his painting “My Bunkie” won the Thomas B. Clarke prize of the National Academy of Design. He was instantly famous, joined Rem ington as the most popular of Western painters, and lived comfortably thereafter until he died of blood poisoning in 1912, aged 51. Mr. Horan presents one fas cinating incident. In 1903, Schreyvogel, who had become a friend of General Custer's widow, Elizabeth, and of Cus ter's one‐time aide, Col. J. S. Crosby, unveiled at Knoedler's a painting of Indians and caval rymen called “Custer's De mand.” The great Remington, perhaps the most beloved and best‐paid illustrator of all time, was enraged by the painting, and wrote a letter to The New York Herald on April 28, 1903, charging his Hoboken rival with many inaccuracies in the 1868 dress of his principals. The reaction was immediate and massive. Among others, Elizabeth and Crosby rushed to Schreyvogel's defense. One of Crosby's published comments had the nation laughing: “Of course it must be very annoy ing to a conscientious artist that we were not dressed as we should have been, but in those days our uniforms in the field were not according to regulations and were of the ‘catch as catch can’ order, and our clothes were few and far between, and were not changed as regularly as Master Frederic Remington's probably were at that date.” The memoir contains 38 Schreyvogel paintings in color and 64 monochromes of his prints that sold well every where. There are photos of the artist and a model amid the skylights and chimneys of his rooftop, and a touching series of comic sketches that he made for the wedding anniversary of some friends. All in all, fine Americana — amusing, heart warming, poignant. ■

458-> LITTON AWARDED NAVAL CONTRACT
WASHINGTON, June 23— The Navy announced today that it was making a long‐de layed contract award of $2.[0‐9]‐ billion to Litton Industries to build 30 destroyers over the next eight years. Navy spokesmen called the proposed ships the “backbone of the Navy's destroyer forces in the nineteen‐seventies and beyond” and said that the contract was the largest sin gle peacetime award for ship building in the history of the Navy. When the cost of Govern ment‐furnished radar and weap onry is included, the total eventual price for the 30‐ship fleet will be $2.55‐billion. That is a price of $85‐million for each ship. The new destroyer class, pre viously known as the DD‐963, will be named after the late Adm. Raymond A. Spruance, who led Navy forces in the his toric defeat of the Japanese at Midway in World War II. A subsidiary of Litton, In galls Shipbuilding Division, whose yards are at Pascagoula, Miss., will build the ships on an assembly line of “modular” technique similar to that used by such shipbuilding countries as Japan. The modular concept involves the building of large sections of the ship separately and then assembling the units. The main competitor of the Mississippi shipyard company that won the contract was Bath Iron Works Corporation of Bath, Me. Since Senator Mar garet Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, is the ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee, the prob lem of deciding on a con tractor posed a delicate political problem for the Administration. The dimensions of the new class of ships‐560 feet long, 54 feet across the beam and with a displaement of 7,000 tans—are about those of the Navy cruisers of World War II. The Spruance class destroyers will be larger because “they will be expected to do more,” according to the Navy. Although initial funding for what was then called the DD 963 was approved earlier by Congress, the Government had not decided to whom the con tract should be awarded or how the work would be dis tributed. Financial and political com plications have contributed to the delay in starting the work. In February, Secretary of the Navy John H. Chafee reported to a Congressional committee that it had originally been esti mated that the ships would cost “in the neighborhood of $6[0‐9]‐ million each, but it is now esti mated in the neighborhood of $80‐million.” The rise was attributed to the fact that detailed ship de signs submitted by bidders led to more accurate—and higher— cost predictions and to inflation and generally increased ship building prices. A second hurdle was posed by Congressional insistence that the ships be built in at least two different United States yards, thus undermining the Navy's concept of “single source funding,” which Navy planners believe is a more eco nomical approach. Two months ago, the House of Representatives approved an amendment proposed by Repre sentative Louis C. Wyman, Re publican of New Hanepshire, that would have made construc tion in more than one shipyard mandatory. Sometime in the last two weeks, however, the Senate Armed Services Committee, working in closed session, voted to strike the amendment from the $20.2‐billion defense pro curement authorization bill. The chairman of that com Irnittee, Senator John C. Stennis, a Mississippi Democrat, was believed to have been consider ably instrumental in having the amendment stricken. At a news conference this evening, Navy officials said that the cost of each Spruance‐class ship would rise to more than $100‐million if Congress de cides to have the ships built in more than one commercial yard. A Litton official said that the Navy's contract award would mean 4,000 new jobs in the Mississippi shipyards from now, until 1974, half of them going to blacks. The issue of where and how the money for the ships will be spent was stressed today in the (Navy's announcement of the contract award. After noting that the Litton subsidiary would be the main contractor, the announcement said “more than 60 per cent of the dollar value of each ship will be used to purchase ma terial and equipment from sub contractors spread over 45 states.” “The contract provides for funding the ships in five sepa rate procurement increments, each subject to Congressional approval from fiscal year 1970 through 1974,” the Navy said. The first ship in the Spru ance class is expected to be ready in the fall of 1974, ac cording to the Navy. The Spruance class, the first general purpose destroyer con struction program since the late nineteen fifties, will have anti submarine warfare capability as its primary mission. Special to The New York Times AUGUSTA, Me., June 23— —Gov. Kenneth M. Curtis to day called the awarding of the Navy's destroyer contract to Litton a “horrible disappoint ment.” “Officials in Washington have once again turned their backs on the people of Maine, he said. In Washington, Senator Ed mund S. Muskie said that the failure of the Bath Ironworks to receive any of the contract was “a dreadful disappoint ment.” Maine's two Democratic Rep resentatives, Peter N. Kyros and William D. Hathaway, called the contract award “part of the Administration's South ern strategy.” In Bath, William D. Hushing, vice president of the Bath Ironworks, said “layoffs [at the yard] are inevitable.” Maine's fourth member of Congress Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith, said she we's “keenly, disappointed” The Bath shipyard has 3,000 employes, 2,000 in production and 1,000 white collar workers.

459-> NIXON, IN CHICAGO, AIDS SENATE DRIVE
CHICAGO, Sept. 17 — Still buoyed by his reception yester day at Kansas State Univer sity, President Nixon bounced around Chicago today for series of appearances designed in part to help the political fortunes of Senator Ralph T. Smith. The Republican Illinois Sena tor is regarded as an underdog in his race with Adlai E. Stevenson 3d, the Democratic nominee. Awake much of the night be cause of the tense situation in Jordan, Mr. Nixon began his day with a brief meeting in, his suite at the Sheraton‐Black stone Hotel with the editors of three Polish‐language news papers and the heads of four Polish‐American fraternal or ganizations. This city's inhabi tants include 1.2 million Polish Americans. At noon, Mr. and Mrs. Nixon played host to some 140 per sons of diverse ethnic origins who were about to be sworn in as United States citizens. Mr. Nixon gave each a small American Flag, similar to the one he wears in his own lapel, and spoke on the privileges and duties of citizenship. Hails Immigrant Feats The President spoke of his own roots and the origins of the Milhous and Nixon families — “We are Heinz, 57 varie ties,” he said. He lauded the contribution of immigrants to “the greatness that we know today in this country” and ticked off the names of famous im migrants to prove his point, ranging from Knute Rockne (Norwegian) to Bob Hope (Brit ish) to Dr. Henry A. Kissinger (German) his own national se curity adviser. He spoke, too, of the “oppor tunities’ of citizenship and the guarantees and “protections” provided United States citi zens by their Government. In this context he condemned the Palestinian guerrillas who have released some Americans but held others who are of Jewish origin. “We do not accept the proposition,” he said in part, “that some American citizens shall be treated one way and some shall be treated another way, because they happen to have been born in another country.” Senator Smith stood in the receiving line with the Nixons and candidly conceded the benefits of proximity to the President. In the last seven days, Republican strategists in Washington have sent not only Mr. Nixon but also Vice Presi dent Agnew and 12 of Mr. Smith's Senate colleagues into the state. Mr. Nixon also met this morning for an off‐the‐record session with the editors of the Chicago Sun‐Times and The Chicago Daily News, and this afternoon with editors of The Chicago Tribune and Chicago Today. Emarging from the Sun Times offices, Mr. Nixon sighted some construction workers across the street. One yelled, “Mr. President, come across the street and meet some hard hats,” and he did. One worker celebrated the President's arrival with a blast from a battered bugle. Mr. Nixon traded small talk, ask ing one black worker, “Do you have a good job?” When the man nodded affirmatively, the President asked, “Plenty of work here for you fellows?” The answer was obviously yes.

460-> Europe's G.N.P. Exceeds Expectations of the U.N.
GENEVA, March 17—West ern Europe's economy will ex pand faster this year than na tional forecasters expect, ac cording to the researchers of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe. One mistake national econo mists have made is to exag gerate the negative impact that the expected United States bus iness slowdown will have on Western Europe's exports, the researchers said in the commission's annual economic survey. The commission's experts predict a 5 per cent expansion in the combined gross national product of Western Europe's in dustrialized countries in 1970 in terms of constant prices. Such a growth rate in the to tal output of goods and serv ices would fall short of the per cent recorded in 1969, one of Western Europe's four “boom years” since World War II, according to the commission. Nevertheless, it would still be significantly higher than the 4.3 per cent over‐all rate to which the individual national fore casts add up, it was found.

461-> Cleaning Out a ‘Sanctuary’ Is Not an Easy Task
The foray last week of Ameri can and South Vietnamese forces into Cambodia is unlikely, in the view of qualified sources, to have in itself more than a transi tory effect on, the course of the war. The objective of the operation, as enunciated by President Nixon in his speech to the nation on Thursday night, is “to clean out major enemy sanctuaries” that lie along the Vietnamese border. According to the President, these include “major base camps, training sites, logistics facilities, weapons and ammunition fac tories, airstrips and prisoner of war compounds,” as well as “the headquarters for the entire Com munist military operation in South Vietnam.” As he spoke, some 5,000 Amer ican troops, spearheaded by the swarming helicopters of the First Air Cavalry Division, were sweeping across the border into the triangular salient of Cambo dian soil called the Fishhook about 65 miles northwest of Sai gon. To the south, Vietnamese infantry and armor, supported by American helicopters and air strikes, were pushing into the flanks of another salient, called Parrot's Beak, the tip of which, as the President pointed out, lies only 33 miles west of the capital. But while the American com mand in Saigon reported that its troops in the Fishhook had sur rounded the area in which the Central Office South Vietnam, or COSVN, the headquarters that the President spoke of, was thought to be situated, there were few contacts with Vietcong or North Vietnamese troops in the first 36 hours of the opera tion, and the feeling was growing that once again the prey had eluded the trap. While the President's words may have summoned up visions in the minds of his audience of Vietcong and North Vietnamese military installations in Cambo dia comparable to those that have been established by Ameri can forces in Vietnam, the facts are otherwise. “Base camps” consist of little more than thatch and bamboo huts and lean‐tos, and widely dis persed tents in which food and ammunition arc hidden, dispersed widely in dense jungle. These camps are seldom occupied by enemy formations for more than a few days at a time and are often deserted. The allusion to “weapons and ammunition fac tories” is regarded as somewhat fanciful, since these articles have for several years now been sup plied almost entirely by Peking and Moscow. In short, there is little that the enemy would not, immediately abandon once faced with an overwhelming attack, particularly when the President took the trouble to emphasize that the Cambodian operation would be limited both as to dura tion and to penetration into Cam bodian territory. Because of the elaborate prep arations required for conven tional assaults against such camps, surprise is almost im possible to achieve, as has been demonstrated countless times in side Vietnam. At the same time the Vietcong and North Vietnam ese troops have shown that al though they must rely on their own feet for the most part, they can cover 25 miles or more in a night's forced march when stimu lated by the fact that American forces are closing in on them. Major assaults against enemy staging areas date back to the middle of 1966, when the Ameri can build‐up passed the 400,000 mark and tactics shifted from the essentially defensive to of fensive. In January, 1967, in Operation Cedar Falls, American units in overwhelming strength swept through the so‐called Iron Triangle, a Vietcong base area centered on the village of Ben suc, about 30 miles northwest of Saigon. The village was razed and its population forcibly re moved to refugee camps, but no major enemy formations were encountered and relatively few supplies caches were found. A few months later the largest operation of the war, Operation Junction City, was begun in Tayninh Province southwest of the Fishhook. More than 20,000 troops, predominantly American, took part. While the bulk of these men drove toward the Cam bodian border, other units were landed by helicopter along the border—a battalion of Vietnam ese paratroopers made one of the few combat jumps of the war there — in hopes of trapping whatever enemy formations were in the area. At that time also, the American headquarters said that COSVN was also a target. Once again the dispersed. However, while the mines that were left behind caused many cas ualties among American troops and knocked out scores of tanks and armored personnel carriers. Junction City was gradually phased out, and while the Ameri can command asserted that it had been a success, no attempt was made to repeat it on a simi lar scale elsewhere in the coun try. The general in command of the operation left Vietnam soon afterward and disappeared into the Pentagon labyrinth. Ironically, one thing that Junc tion City did accomplish was to push the enemy base camps into Cambodia where for three years they remained safe from overt attack, although secret opera tions have been launched against them from time to time by Spe cial Forces units. In the face of the current of fensive, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese would appear to have two options—either to retreat further into Cambodia for as long as American and Vietnam ese forces remain across the border or to slip past them, as happened in the months before the Tet offensive of 1968, and set up their camps closer to Saigon.

462-> “Putt‐Putt” Replaced by Purr
EWLY developed lawn mowers, garden trac tors and other out door power tools that are driven by electricity rath er than gasoline have led some people to predict (or maybe hope?) that the silent whirr of the electric motor may some day replace the buzzsaw‐like roar of the gaso line engine in suburban yards and gardens. Electric lawn mowers and power tools such as hedge clippers, grass trimmers and edgers have actually been available for many years. However, several new prod ucts recently introduced, as well as improvements and re finements made in older mod els, have added new impetus to the trend toward electrics. Among these are several interesting new “firsts”—an electrically powered yard and garden tractor, a cordless electric lawn mower and a cordless electric hedge trim mer, grass shear and combi nation lawn trimmers and edger. Probably the most dramat ic innovation — the electric tractor—is actually a byprod uct of research being con ducted into the eventual pos sibility of developing an elec tric automobile. Just intro duced this spring by the Gen eral Electric Corporation, the electric tractor comes in three sizes or models that are de signed to compete with con ventional gasoline tractors of 10‐, 12‐ and 14‐horsepower in price, as well as in per formance. Power for this new elec tric tractor if supplied by a long‐life 36‐volt battery pow er pack that will enable it to mow up to three acres of lawn on one charge. A built in solid state charger will then restore full power to the batteries in about five hours when it is plugged into any 115‐volt household out let (three‐fourths of the charge is restored after 3½ hours). Speed is controlled by levers that provide a high or low range of from ¼‐mile per hour (for heavy plowing or snow blowing) to seven miles per hour when riding level. In addition to the obvious advantages of silent opera tion, instant starting and min imal maintenance, the elec tric tractor also eliminates the nuisance of having to carry or store inflammable fuel. Built‐in circuits provide for smooth acceleration, but pre vent jerky starts, and a safe ty switch stops the machine completely if the operator gets off (or falls off) his seat. As with a gasoline tractor, this new electric model has a full range of attachments available, including rotary and reel mowers, snow blow ers and plow blades. There are also a variety of portable power tools available that can be plugged into the pow er pack. These include chain saws, sprayers, drills and similar tools. To keep from getting stuck when working at a distance from the nearest 115‐volt out let (needed for recharging) there are two gauges on the panel; one tells the amount of charge left in the batteries, the other tells the rate at which power is being used. The cordless electric lawn mower was also put on the market this spring. It is made by Black & Decker and is an 18‐inch reel type mower that supplies power to the cutting mechanism only—to move it forward, the mower must still be pushed by hand. Like other electric mowers, it is silent in operation and starts at the mere flick of a switch, but unlike other electric mowers, it has no cord to drag around. Power for this mower is supplied by a 12‐volt storage battery that fits across the top of the reel mechanism. It will cut up to 10,000 square feet of grass on one charge, and a recharging unit sup plied with the mower will re store full power when plugged into the house current over night. There is a safety lock switch to prevent accidental starting and a button that must be continuously de pressed to keep the reel turn ing (releasing this button stops the motor automat ically). * This cordless mower has small wheels at the rear (in stead of the usual roller) to increase maneuverability and make for easier pushing. An optional grass cutter is avail able and the cutter sharpens itself by simply reversing the direction of rotation. The mower is priced at $130, with charger. In addition to cordless elec tric mowers and yard trac tors, there are also battery powered hedge trimmers, grass shears and lawn trim mers and edgers. Most have the power pack (rechargeable battery) built right into the body or handle of the took. The cordless electric grass shears (made by Disston Divi sion, H. K. Porter Company) sells for $35, complete with charger. The hedge trimmer (made by Black & Decker) has a double‐edge blade and sells for about $80, plus $15 for the charger. The long handled lawn trimmer and edger (made by Toro Manu facturing Company) sells for $45, with charger included. In addition to the obvious advantage of eliminating the need for a cord, all of these battery powered tools also completely eliminate all pos sibility of shock hazard. * This same extra protection —elimination of shock hazard should an accidental short oc cur inside the machine—is also available on many of the new model conventional elec tric machines that do use house current. These are tools that have special double‐in sulated construction in wiring and housing. This eliminates the need for a three‐wire cord and the need for ground ing. A conventional two‐wire cord and plug is used, yet it provides the same safety as normally afforded by a three‐wire cord, Tools avail able with this feature includ ed hedge trimmers, grass shears, lawn edgers and trim mers.

463-> Culinary Cultural Revolution Topples the Chinese Standbys
It is, of course, part of a cultural rev olution, this extraordinary and unprece dented interest in Chinese cooking in America during the last decade or so. Happily, gone are the days when most of the public, in its naivete, would set tle for the numbered combination plat ters, the spareribs, egg roll, chow mein and so on. There is many a Manhattan kitchen now equipped with a wok and bamboo steamer; Chinese restaurants of special quality abound from one end of the city to the other; and there are as many (or more) cooking classes here that of fer Chinese fare as (than) any other. One of the most recent and welcome additions to the cooking scene is Mrs. Virginia Lee, a native of Shanghai who grew up in Peking and studied in Tien Tsin. She has been privileged through out her life to dine on much of the fin est foods of her homeland, and she now teaches cooking in New York, She spoke of her years in China, one day this week, over an exceptional col lection of dishes that included a platter of snow white, gossamer chicken velvet studded with emerald peas; a spicy dish of beef steamed with rice and star anise; and an exotic smoked duck. “My husband,” she said, “was for many years manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and we were rather late in getting out of China. It was 1957. We were able to leave because my husband became quite ill, and we had to take him to London for treat ment; he died a year later. “Yes, now that you ask, the food in 1957 was still good in China in the restaurants, but there weren't many courses. “All of my life I've liked to cook, and after I was married, we entertained a lot because of my husband's position and his interest in fine food. And in our day, we had some of the finest chefs of China in our kitchen. And they taught me how to cook. Wherever we were, I would send my cooks to the kitchens of restaurants to learn how to make certain dishes and as often as now, I'd ask to go myself.” Mrs. Lee, on this particular day, had as a guest Mrs. Wellington Koo, the wife of the man who was, for several dec ades, the best known of China's diplo mats. “We were students in Tien Tsin to gether when we were children,” Mrs. Koo said. Mrs. Lee interrupted and smiled, “Mrs. Koo comes to my home to criticize my food. In fact, I've named a dish for Mr. Koo. Here In this country you have a dish called beef Wellington, the meat baked in pastry. I bake Chinese cab bage in pastry and call it cabbage Koo.” It's delicious. Mrs. Koo, a handsome, patrician looking woman in black dress, helped herself to that commendable dish of chicken velvet, which was crowned with a sprinkling of finely minced ham. “Mrs. Lee cures her own ham on the terrace here,” she added. “Most Chinese chefs use Smithfield ham,” Mrs. Lee commented, “but I think it's too smoky. The best Chinese ham comes from Chin Hwa in the province of Chekiang. I've tried to reproduce it here.” “Her man is so good,” Mrs. Koo said, “I've tried to get her to cure it com mercially.” Mrs. Lee's cooking series begins dur ing the week of Sept. 13, and applica tions are being accepted now. Each series of eight lessbns costs $88. The morning series on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday from 11 A.M. to 1:30 P.M.; the evening series from 6 to 8:30 P.M. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and from 3 to 5:30 P.M. on Saturday. A total of 24 dishes are taught in each series, and students dine on the foods prepared. The classes will be conducted in a new kitchen above the Oriental Country Store at 12 Mott Street. The store, which sells Chinese cooking utensils, is owned by one of Mrs. Lee's two daugh ters, Mrs. Mailan Tan, the wife of a doctor. Here are four of the dishes to be dem onstrated by Mrs. Lee during her series. 1 3‐to‐4‐pound duck 2 tablespoons salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground Szechuan peppercorns (available in Chinatown) 4 slices fresh ginger 2 scallions, each cut into 2‐inch lengths ½ teaspoon saltpeter (available in drug stores) ½ cup water 3 tablespoons dry Sherry or Chinese rice wine Oil for deep frying ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup dark tea leaves 1 cup raw rice. 1. Rinse the duck under cold running water and wipe dry. Combine the salt and peppercorns and cook in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring until salt is a shade darker. Rub this mixture inside and outside the duck. Place the ginger slices and scallion pieces in the cavity of the duck. 2. Combine the saltpeter with water and wipe the duck with this solution. Place the duck in a dish and cover with a clean cloth. Place a weight such as a heavy lid or skillet on top of the duck and refrigerate with the weight 1% to 2 days. 3. Rinse the duck once more in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place the duck in a bowl, pour Sherry over duck, and sit this inside a large kettle with a lid. Pour water around the bowl and cover the kettle. Bring the water in the kettle to the boil and let the duck steam for 11,4 to 2 hours. Poke the thigh of the duck with chopsticks to determine if it is tender. 4. Line a wok or a large oval Dutch oven with aluminum foil. Sprinkle the bottom with the sugar, tea leaves and rice. Place a round rack on the bottom of the wok or an oval rack in the Dutch oven. Arrange two chopsticks about two inches apart in parallel fashion over the rack, then place two chopsticks in the opposite sense on these. This is to sup port the duck. Add the duck. Cover the wok or the Dutch oven tightly. Turn on the heat and let the duck smoke without lifting the lid for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat but do not remove the ‐ lid. Let duck stand twenty minutes longer. 5. Heat the oil in the wok or other utensil and cook the duck on all sides until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve the duck hot or cold. To serve, cut it into pieces (with the bone) about 2‐inches long and 1‐inch wide. Yield: Eight to ten servings. 3 ounces dried scallops (available in Chinatown) 2 tablespoons dry Sherry or Chinese rice wine ⅓ cup water ¼ pound fresh mustard greens Oil for deep frying ½ teaspoon each salt, sugar and monosodium glutamate (optional). 1. Soak the scallops for several hours In wine and water. 2. Drain. In a small steamer, steam the scallops about 20 minutes. Remove the scallops and let cool. 3. Using the fingers, separate the scallop flesh into the finest possible shreds. 4. Remove or cut away the tough stem from the mustard greens. Cut the mustard greens into fine shreds. 5. Heat the oil to quite hot but not smoking and add the scallop shreds. When golden brown, drain on absorbent toweling. Cook the mustard greens similarly and drain well. 6. Place a bed of mustard greens on a platter and add the scallops in the center. Blend the remaining ingredients and sprinkle overall. Serve hot or cold. Yield: Six, or more servings. 1 whole chicken breast, skinned and boned 1½ tablespoons plus one teaspoon cornstarch ⅓ cup fresh or canned chicken stock 1½ teaspoons salt ½ teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon dxy Sherry or Chinese wine ½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (optional) 8 Oil egg whites ½ cup fresh or frozen peas Finely chopped ham for garnish. 1. Cut the chicken into small pieces and place them in the blender. Blend while gradually adding one and one‐ half tablespoons of cornstarch, one cup of the stock, salt, sugar and wine. Stir the mixture down with a plastic spatula to make sure it Is smooth and well blended. 2. Spoon the mixture into a mixing bowl. 3. Beat the egg whites until they stand in very soft peaks and fold this into the chicken mixture. 4. Have a colander ready to drain the chicken mixture. Heat about two cups of oil in a wok or deep skillet and when hot but not smoking, turn off the heat. Wait about 10 seconds and add the chicken mixture. Turn the heat back on to moderate heat and stir quickly and vigorously Just until chick en velvet turns snow white. Drain in the colander. 5. Have ready one teaspoon of corn starch mixed with two tablespoons of water. 6. Pour off the fat from the wok or skillet and wipe it dry. Add two addi tional tablespoons of oil and add the peas. Return the chicken velvet and the remaining third cup of stock. Add the cornstarch mixed with water and stir quickly until all is well blended. Serve immediately garnished with finely minced ham. Yield: Six or more servings. ½ pound thick flank steak 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon light soy sauce ½ teaspoon Chinese chili paste with garlic (Szechuan hot paste). available in Chinatown ½ teaspoon sugar ½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (optional) ¼ cup vegetable oil 4 to six pieces sliced ginger 1 teaspoon ginger Juice 4 cloves crushed garlic 3 sprigs scallions cut into 2‐inch lengths 1 dried hot red pepper shredded 1 cup whole grain, uncooked rice 2 star anise (available in Chinese markets in Chinatown) Dried palm leaves, soaked in water or fresh Chinese cabbage leaves (available in Chinatown) or fresh corn husks. 1. Place the meat on a flat surface then cut it into thin “butterfly” slices. That is, cut one thin slice but do not cut all the way through the bottom of the meat. Now, cut another thin slice, this time all the way through. Open this up, butterfly fashion. Pound lightly to flatten. Continue until all the meat has been butterflied. 2. Combine the two soy sauces, the chili paste, sugar, monosodium gluta mate, oil, ginger, ginger juice, garlic, scallions and dried red pepper. 3. Add the meat to the sauce and let stand until ready to cook. 4. Meanwhile, add the rice and anise seeds to a dry wok or skillet and cook, stirring, until rice is brown. Do not use any oil for this. Spoon the rice and anise mixture into a blender and blend thoroughly. 5. Pour half the rice mixture into a pie dish and dredge each piece of meat in the mixture. The remaining rice mix ture will keep well in a jar for another occasion. 6. Line a bamboo or other steamer with the leaves and arrange the meat pieces over all. Cover and steam 10 minutes. Serve hot. Yield: Four to six servings. Craig Claiborne's annual list ing of cooking schools in Manhattan and the suburbs will be published next Tues day and Wednesday.

464-> Letters to the Editor of The Times
Postmen's Patience To the Editor: So customary is the modera tion and reasonableness of Times editorials that the hys teria in your references to the postal workers' stoppage is disillusioning. “Anarchy,” in deed. Did you borrow that one from The Chicago Tribune? Each of us is Inconvenienced seriously by the strike; other wise it would have no effect. But responsibility for this irri tating inconvenience does not rest with the postal workers. The postmen have lobbied, petitioned, and pleaded for at tention to their just requests. Their long delay in calling strike is a monument to their patience, their dedication to service, and their misplaced faith in the sense of responsi bility of Congress and the President. The knee‐jerk reaction of our elected leaders in refusing to negotiate, threatening use of troops, obtaining court injunc tions and all the rest betrays their lack of sensitivity to the postmen's condition. Your March 21 editorial men tioned the criminally low sal aries: it failed to note that men often never reach the ab surdly low ceiling, even after a quarter‐century of service. Where is your outrage that scores of those men are so poor ly paid that they qualify for welfare? Where is your scorn for the President's sanctimoni ous acceptance of a 100 per cent raise. Where is your de mand for prompt governmental action to give these men enough money to live decently—before requiring a return to work? Where is the traditional Times defense of the underdog, anyhow? CHARLES GUZZETTA Brooklyn, March 23, 1970 • Mixed Rail Service To the Editor: Wherever the Interstate Com merce Commission authorizes discontinuance of passenger trains completely, I suggest they require the railroads to attach passenger cars to their profitable freight trains. The expense would be nil and the added income all gravy. Many freight trains have tight schedules, especially the piggyback runs. What is one car more or less? Of course, the passenger would have to recognize he is being treated as freight, which is evidently pretty good and on some lines better than he gets now. Most important, we would still be able to get between all major cities by train, and the scenic areas of the country would still be accessible to those who feel the rail lines are the most interesting. True, the frills would be gone, but the trains would still be available, and the buffs and tourists mol lified. EDWARD C. SOSMAN Montclair, N. J., March 12, 1970 • Goldberg's Candidacy To the Editor: The announcement of Arthur J. Goldberg's candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Gov ernor of New York poses some perplexing issues. The public is entitled to know the source of Mr. Gold berg's political support. Mr. Goldberg's statements at his March 20 press conference con tained several tortured refer ences to this subject, all of them less than candid. For ex ample, Mr. Goldberg told the press that he had not “initiated one phone call” on the subject of his candidacy in the last ten days and that he would not know some of the city's county leaders if he met them. If these remarks were in tended to convey the impres sion that Mr. Goldberg has not been seeking and encourag ing support from Democrats throughout the state, then they were misleading. If Mr. Gold berg does not wish the support of the city's county leaders, he should publicly state that de cision and end the justifiable speculation that the contrary is the fact. Mr. Goldberg's view that majority vote in his favor in the Democratic State Committee is a proper condition to his entry into the race may represent that antiquated view of New York politics which Democratic reformers have been trying to supplant. Where the state's pri mary law has ended the viabil ity of designations by party committees in favor of a vote by enrolled members, what dif ference that Mr. Goldberg re ceives a majority under the old, discredited system? Reformers and “new politics” Democrats would answer that to accord any status to conven tion votes is to unduly exalt a system that should be (and, practically speaking, has been) discarded. The state's Democrats should carefully examine Mr. Gold berg's view that no one else can lead the party to victory in November. Other than Mr. Goldberg's assertion, there is simply no basis for such a statement. In fact, an Oliver Quayle poll taken this year shows Deputy Mayor Robert M. Morgenthau beating the Gov ernor by 16 per cent. Mr. Goldberg has never stood for public office. His perform ance as a candidate—if meas ured by his performance as a noncandidate—may be distant, arrogant, haughty and, what is far worse for the state's Demo crats, unsuccessful. Mr. Goldberg's attention to the foregoing issues in the next few days may help to clarify his candidacy. THOMAS H. BAER New York, March 20, 1970 U.S. Bombing of Laos To the Editor: Secretary Melvin Laird's statement that he would rec ommend continued bombing of Laos, even against the wishes of a new Government, should be understood in all its signifi cance. If adopted, it would mean that the United States takes the same attitude toward international law as the U.S.S.R. did when occupying Czecho slovakia without request from the incumbent Government. In either case, a superpower protects its “national interest” and in fact proclaims its sovereignty over any country that it includes in its sphere of interest. As Laos is tens of thousands of miles away, this would not be even an adjacent country, like Czechoslovakia or Cuba. Such action, a further con sequence of the U.S. involve ment in Vietnam, would of course destroy any pretense of observance of international law. WOLFGANG FRIEDMANN Prof. of International Law Columbia University New York, March 20, 1970 • Court's Stature To the Editor: Fundamental to maintaining law and order in the United States is acceptance of the de cisions of the Supreme Court as the law of the land. That acceptance depends on popular recognition of the independ ence, intellectual integrity and legal competence of the mem bers of that Court. Each United States Senator must now de cide for himself whether the stature of the Supreme Court will be increased or diminished by making Judge Carswell a member of that Court.

465-> INQUIRY ON PRICES DUE ON CEMETERIES
Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo said yesterday his office would investigate Brooklyn rabbi's charge that cemeteries involved in the six‐ week‐old gravediggers' strike were engaging in “unscrupu lous price gouging.” The allegation had been made by Rabbi Samuel Schrage, chairman of the Emergency Committee for Jewish Burial. He said that some cemeteries were charging a $25 “supervi sion fee” while members of the family were digging the graves. The rabbi also said that a $25 fee was being levied for a special plastic bag in which the body was placed. Mr. Lomenzo pointed out that the State Cemetery Board had to approve any additional fees “a cemetery under its jur isdiction intends to levy.” He declared: “We will not tolerate any gouging or profiteering in sor row caused by the present emergency of the cemetery strike.” Early yesterday, an 18‐hour negotiating session broke up at 4 A.M., with both sides still at loggerheads in the grave diggers' strike at 44 area cemeteries. Last night, the ne gotiations were resumed at the State Mediation Board, 270 Broadway.

466-> Terms Unchanged, Arab Says
BEIRUT, Lebanon, Sept. 17— A spokesman for the Pales tinian hijackers said today that the heavy shelling in Amman made no difference in the hi jackers’ terms for release of the 54 or 55 airline hostages presumably still held in or near the embattled Jordanian capi tal. “It is very dangerous for them,” said Ghassan Kanafani, editor of the weekly newspaper of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who re turned from Amman last night. In an interview in the Popu lar Front's office, here, Mr. Kanafani denied that the guer rillas had caused a deadlock in the negotiations over the hos tages by refusing to give de tails of their demands for the release of guerrillas held by Israel. He said the basic problem was that Israel had not ac cepted the principle of an exchange. Once this is done. he said, the Popular Front will divulge the names of Palestinian pris oners it wants exchanged. This list would presumably be the basis for further discussion. The other conditions being demanded of Israel, as restated by Mr. Kanafani, are the re lease of a Swiss charged in Haifa with spying, the release of two Algerians taken off a British airliner in Israel last month and the release of 10 Lebanese soldiers taken prison er in January. He also reiterated the Popu lar Front's other demarnd for the release of seven guerrillas held in Western Europe in re turn for British, Swiss and West German hostages. But he dwelt on his charge that the next move was up to Israel. “I am not ready to give our list until they announce in prin ciple they will release our peo ple,” Mr. Kanafani said fervent ly. “The bombing makes no dif ference.” Speaking of the hostages in Amman, he said, “they are on the same level as our men. We could not give them bet ter shelter than the shelter we give ourselves.” He reiterated that the Ameri can hostages “are being treated on the same basis as the Israelis because the United States Gov ernment is an enemy.” He said that the Americans would be released with the Israelis only when Israel accepted the com mandos’ terms. However, a source familiar with commando thinking sug gested that the commandos were well aware of possibly se rious counteraction from Israel and the West should the hos tages be harmed. This source suggested that the hostages might indeed be getting special shelter. Mr. Kanafani, who has been a leading Popular Front spokes man in Amman this week, op erates from a large, crowded of fice on the second floor of six‐story apartment building in a middle class neighborhood of Beirut. One wall is plastered with portraits of Ernesto Che Gue vara, Ho Chi Minh, and Mao Tse‐tung and with posters of the Palestine Liberation move ment bearing such slogans as “Peace and Justice in the Mid dle East!” A large United States seal, said to have been wrenched from the American Embassy in Amman, hangs on one wall. Numbers of young Palestinians in their 20's and 30's, dressed in short‐sleeved shirts and light trousers, came and went as Mr. Kanafani talked.

469-> Science
“Strong interactions” was the subject of one of the sessiors last week at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society in Chicago. That refers to the force that binds the atomic nu cleus. But the paper presented at the session dealt with strong interactions of quite a different sort, as it's title made abund antly clear. It read: “I pledge that I will not partic ipate in war research or weapons production; I further pledge to counsel my students and urge my colleagues to do the same.” The paper was written by Dr. Charles Schwartz, of the Univer sity of California in Berkeley, and it focused on an issue that disturbs many American scien tists. The title was published as sub mitted, following a long‐standing tradition of the society. To give unorthodox ideas a chance, sub missions to the meetings are un censored. Copies of the Schwartz pledge (see illustration) were circulated in the corridors of the Palmer House, where long‐haired activ ists mingled with sedate physi cists from the Naval Research Laboratory, the Air Force Cam bridge Research Laboratories and various Atomic Energy Commis sion centers. At one session, where a physi cist from the Los Alamos Scien tific Laboratory (birthplace of the atomic bomb) was presenting a paper on plasma physics, sev eral young men stood up, holding placards denouncing those who work on weapons. Someone de manded that the men be ejected but the chairman said they had agreed to be orderly and they were allowed to remain standing in their silent gesture of protest. Yet the greatest concern of those at the meeting seemed to be the mandatory ending of mili tary support for basic research as called for in an amendment to the defense appropriations bill introduced by Senator Mike Mansfield, Democrat of Montana. To many the amendment deep ened the gulf between the mili tary and the mainstream of sci entific and academic progress. In World War II, American physicists, through such dramatic contributions as the atomic bomb and radar and other innovations such as submarine tracking equipment and antiaircraft fuses, affected almost every phase of warfare. Today, in the age of the nuclear‐armed intercontinental ballistic missile, dependence on scientific ingenuity is even greater. Senator Mansfield himself ex pressed the hope that his amend ment would “contribute signifi cently to a healthier attitude In our society toward those who perform research and those who sponsor it” Apparently he felt, as do others, that dependence of universities and other institu tions on defense funds for sup port of their basic research is unhealthy. Other agencies of the Government, he said, should take over the burden of such support. What has generated consterna tion among physicists is the evi dence that, in the present budget squeeze, no agency, with minor exceptions, is going to take over this burden. Many research pro grams will have to be dropped and newly‐graduated physicists now will find job‐hunting in creasingly difficult. Strange to say, one of the more eloquent justifications for Defense Department support came last week from Dr. Schwartz, the man who present ed the pledge against war re search. His pledge came up at a business meeting of the society when it was proposed by activist members that the total member ship be polled on whether the society itself should ask its mem bers not to engage in military research (a step that would place in a difficult position those mem bers working in laboratories of the Air Force, Army, Navy and Atomic Energy Commission). The proposal was shelved, but during the discussion Dr. Luis Alvarez, who chaired the meet ing as outgoing president of the society, recalled past pendulum swings of public opinion, such as the 1933 pledge by Oxford Uni versity students that they would not “fight for King and country.” It was not long, the said, before those same lads were heroically defending London as Spitfire pilots. Dr. Alvarez then provoked a burst of laughter when he asked Dr. Schwartz if he would care to comment on support of his own research by the Air Force. The Berkeley physicist said that, while his work had no evident applicability to warmaking, he had become concerned lest the Air Force assume that it could count on his help and advice in other areas. Dr. Schwartz, long‐time opponent of the war in Vietnam, said he felt obliged to state his views to an Air Force general concerned with research. The genera!, according to Dr. Schwartz, assured him that the Air Force was concerned only with the quality of his work, not his politics. No strings, he added, were attached to the research grant. “If Congress does not have enough sense to support basic research,” the general was quot ed as saying, “the Air Force is prepared to do so on the grounds that it is in the best interests of the country as a whole.” This has been the philosophy of the Air Force Office of Scien tific Research and of the Office of Naval Research since World War II. American supremacy in such fields as high energy phys ics was largely dependent on the support of those agencies. Now, Dr. Schwartz said, he could no longer accept Air Force funding of his work. Actually the support was almost certain to be cut off to conform to the Mans field amendment. There are superficial reasons for the alienation — academic fears of military dominance on the one side and Congressional suspicion that a conspiracy be tween Pentagon and civilian sci entists is subverting Congres sional control over research spending. But the real roots lie in widespread abhorrence of the Vietnam war and the unaccepta ble nature of modern warmaking techniques. There is also a fear that the shutting off of an important source of research funds will throttle American scientific orig inality. One weakness of many European nations—in particular the Soviet Union—has been that a young researcher with an un orthodox idea often has only one place to go for funds. If he, or his ideas, are unpopular with officials, his ideas are shelved. With a variety of funding agencies, military and non‐mili tary, an American researcher has been able to knock on a number of doors in search of help. Henceforth this will no longer be true.

470-> Major Leagues to Name a Black Manager Within 3 Years Study Forecasts
Major league baseball's first black team manager is likely to be named within the next three years, possibly as early as 1971, according to a two part report released in Nash ville, Tenn, by the Race Rela tions Information Center. The study, entitled “The Black Athlete‐1970” also fore. sees “a substantial number of blacks” moving into “coaching, scouting, and front‐office posi tions in both the National and American Leagues, within the next few years.” The report covers race rela tions in three major profession al team sports — football, bas ketball and baseball — and intercollegiate sports in the Southeastern Conference. In the 10‐university confer ence, the study cites grievances among black athletes that in the absence of policy changes at the institutions, could sur face in the future as black participation in sports in creases. The S.E.C. which in cludes several Deep South uni versities, was chosen for the study because it was the na tion's last major intercollegiate conference to desegregate. Bernard E. Garnett and Frye Gaillard, staff writers, wrote the report for the center, a pri vate, nonprofit journalistic re search agency in Nashville. Garnett, who once covered professional sports for the Washington Afro ‐American and Jet magazine, wrote Part I, titled “Blacks in Pro Sports.” Part II, “Crumbling Segrega tion In the S.E.C.,” was writ ten by Gaillard, a former Ala bama Press Register reporter. Gaillard wrote on the deseg ragation of the S.E.C. in 1966 67, while a student at Vander bilt University, for Vanderbilt's newspaper, The Hustler. Later, he covered S.E.C. sports for the Associated Press. Garnett wrote of a bold, be hind‐the‐scene drive to advance blacks into coaching (including manager), scouting and execu tive slots. The drive, accord ing to major‐league sources, is spearheaded by Baseball Com missioner Bowie K. Kuhn. One baseball executive said Kuhn had instructed all 24 major league team owners to recruit and train minority candidates and to report their findings to his office by next spring. The report raises the possi bility that three National League stars, Willie Mays, Er nie Banks and Maury Wills, could be likely candidates for “first black managen,” Others possibly eligible, according to the report, are Elston Howard, Larry Doby and Jim Gilliam, now coaches, as well as Bill White and George Crowe, for mer big‐league player. “The Black Athlete — 1970” reports that such a minority advancement scheme, “along with tangible results,” would be necessary to restore the black athlete's faith in the man agement of baseball, football and basketball. Stating that blacks are “no longer impressed with ‘how good the game has been to the Negro,” the report lists a number of grievances to illus trate that black professional athletes are dissatisfied with the way they are treated as players and the opportunities for them to advance. Management, including blacks in coaching and execu tive positions, often tends to disagree with the players’ gripes, according to the report. Team executives point to the numbers of blacks playing pro fessional sports, including su perstars, and the doors that are opening in the front offices. Lack of interest and of quali fications hampered minority advancement in the past, many of them contend. The black coaches and exec utives, however, did tend to agree that advancement could be more rapid. In the report, Phil Wrigley, owner of the Chicago baseball team, blames the New York Yankees for slowing desegre gation of the Americn League in the late nineteen‐forties and early fifties. Wrigley is cred ited with saying that many Yankee officials opposed inte gration at that time and were influential enough to persuade other league team owners not to hire black athletes as rapid ly as the rival National League. Black pros are not drama tizing their grievances through protests, the center reports. In stead, many prefer to aid black communities through such en deavors as youth aid activities, off‐season participation in Southern Christian Leadership Conference sponsored sports exhibitions, and black economic development projects spon sored by the Black Economic Union, which was founded in 1966 by professional football layers. In his survey of the South eastern Conference, daillard found integration slow, but steady. Only 41 black athletes are listed for participation in eight sports at 10 member uni versities, and critics of the league berate this as tokenism. Last summer, the University of Alabama's Afro‐American Association filed a Federal suit against the university's athlet ic director and football coach. Paul (Bear) Bryant, charging him with failing to recruit black athletes with the same diligence that whites were recruited. The case was continued to May, 1971 pending action by the uni versity to enroll black sports participants over the next year. The report lists the absence of black coaches, the small per centage of black nonathlete students, lack of campus life for black students, relatively low salaries paid nonacademic personnel, and abuse of black players by fans in some areas (notably Mississippi and Louis iana) as some gripes that black S.E.C. members discuss in pri ate. Perry Wallace, a Vanderbilt basketball player and the first black athlete in the S.E.C. to complete his three years of varsity eligibility, has com plained that his four years at Vanderbilt were characterized by acute loneliness because of he social environment. In addition, the study found resentment smoldering beneath the surface among black foot ball players at the University of Kentucky, which is the most integrated team in the confer ence. The Kentucky players say they feel that their coach, John Ray, does not truly understand them and places too many re strictions on their freedom. At the same time, according to the report, sports officials at member schools insist that many blacks considered for athletic scholarships either were academically or athletically not qualified and that integra tion had progressed without ny problem.

472-> Aiken Says Giant Utilities Seek To Monopolize Nuclear Power
WASHINGTON, March 4— Senator George D. Aiken charged today that “certain giant corporate utilities” were seeking to “monopolize and completely control” the devel opment of nuclear power. This nuclear gold rush for control of atomic power is fur ther compounded,” Mr. Aiken said on the floor of the Senate “by a struggle among the in dustrial giants—the oil, coal and utility interests—for what in effect would be monopoly control over all electric power.” The Vermont Republican, when he was Governor of Ver mont from 1937 to 1939, had a record as a champion of con sumer interests and a foe of big, privately wilted utilities. As a Senator, he has supported strict enforcement of the anti trust laws. In support of his charge to day, Mr. Aiken cited the stead fast opposition of the utility corporations to legislation that would subject the utilities to what he called “reasonable regulatory controls under the Atomic Energy Act.” Senator Aiken has proposed the legislation over the last two years. The Federal Power Commis sion licenses only hydroelectric plants. The Atomic Energy Commission, which sets the health and safety requirements for atomic reactors, licenses nu clear power plants. Member of Joint Panel Mr. Aiken, a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, said’ that there were now 70 atomic’ power plants generating power or under con struction, and that there would be 92 by June 30, 1971. By 1980, he said, the Atomic Energy Commission estimates that there will be 200 installed atomic power units capable of generating 150 million kilo watts. At today's prices, he said, the total investment in these plants by 1980 would be 540‐billion More than 52.3‐billion in Federal money, Mr. Aiken said, was invested in the research to Make these power 1:eactors profitable, and that “this in vestment of public money was made by Congiess in hopes of develciping commercially ‐ fea sible, competitive atomic power.” “Therefore,” the SeriatorcOn‐z. tinued, “the municipals, rural cooperatives, and small, in resto r‐owned utilities have an Inalienable right to Shard in the Denefits of nuclear power,” Later today, Senator Philip A. Hart, Democrat of Michigan, innounced that the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Sub committee, which he heads, would investigate the electric generating industry. While conceding that the Atomic Energy Act needed up dating to make certain that nuclear power plants were Made subject to antitrust con trol, Mr. Aiken was sharply critical of the Atomic Energy Commission for not taking the steps it could under existing law “to protect the public interest.” All that the A.E.C. has to ‘do, he said, in order to bring the atomic power plants within the purview of the antitrust laws is find that the plants have “practical value in a com mercial sense” and then issue commercial license to operate after the ‘plant has been finished. But, Mr. Aiken said, the A.E.C. has not once made sztch a finding or issued such a license. Instead, it hag ‘licensed each new plant “as a research project under the niedical:ther apq section of I the law.” Furthermore, he said, “thrs de liberate policy of delay in issuing commercial licenses]. is ‘further cornPounded by ‘., the issuance of research licenses of.40 years’ duration.” “The failure of the A.E.C. to make any practical‐value’ finding naturally pleases the utilities and their friends, be cause it leaves them free from antitrust regulation,” Mr. Aiken said. A.E.C. officials, when ques tioned today, acknowledged that there had not been single finding of “practical value,” not a single commercial license issued, for, a nuclear plant. In explaining why this was so, they cited three sec tions of the Atomic'EnergyMt. The first section gives the A.E.C authority to lidense power reactors for “research and development activities leading the demonstration of the practidal, value of such facilitieS for industrial or com mercial purposes.” 7711‐6. second section says,that, when the AX.C. has made a finding. of practical value in writing, its may issue a coin mercial license. The third section says that, when the A.E.C. is going to issue a commercial license, it must get the Attorney Gen eral's opinion on whether such a license “would tend to create or maintain P asituation in consistent with the antitrust laws.”

473-> GORDON IS HIRED TO COACH STARS
MONTREAL, June 9—Jackie Gordon, the former assistant general manager of the Rangers and one of the American Hock ey League's most successful executives, signed a three‐year contract today to coach the Minnesota North Stars. The 42‐year‐old Gordon will become the Stars' fourth coach when the team begins its fourth season next fall. There have actually been five coaching changes since the Stars entered the National Hockey League in 1967. Wren Blair, the general man ager, held both duties during the Stars' first season. He then appointed John Muckler as coach, but dismissed Muckler and took over the post. Mid way through last season, Blair appointed Charlie Burns as the interim player‐coach. Gordon was assistant to Emile Francis on the Rangers until 1968. He left to return to the Cleveland Barons of the American League. Gordon has spent 17 years in Cleveland as a player and executive, and his teams won the American League playoffs four times. He was named the league's Coach of the Year four times. Boom Boom Geoffrion will be leaving New York, but will re main with the organization. The Boomer will become a Ranger scout in Montreal. He had been given the title of assistant man ager for the 1969–70 season, which was the final one of his $27,000 contract. He coached the New Yorkers for half the 1968–69 campaign

474-> The Auto Talks Begin
General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler have opened their new contract talks with the United Auto Work ers in an atmosphere clouded with concern over inflation, the threat of increasing loss of sales to foreign cars, and criticism of the auto industry for its record on safety, performance standards, and pollution. These are threats to both labor and management— to both jobs and profits. In launching the negotiations, both labor and management representatives appeared anxious to move the talks swiftly into serious and realistic negotiations. There was a welcome lack of bluster on both sides. This year's collective bargaining is a crucial test for Leonard Woodcock, Walter Reuther's successor as U.A.W. president. Mr. Woodcock has a reputation to establish as a leader who can get the most for his men without inflicting lasting damage on the industry. The heads of the auto companies feel that the very survival of their industry is at stake. Rather than buy a settlement so expensive as to undermine their cost structure and force them into price hikes that would put them out of reach of competition with cheaper foreign cars, auto management appears quite ready to take a strike, which could be long and bruising. But Mr. Woodcock is also racing strong pressures from his own rank‐and‐file who know only too well the huge settlements that unions in fields such as construction, trucking, and printing have got. Auto workers and their families have also felt the pinch inflation and of layoffs and short‐time, which have been cutting sharply into their take‐home pay. One of the most critical problems to be resolved will be the cost‐of‐living clause in the new contract. The union is determined to get the eight‐cent cap off annual cost‐of‐living hikes which was screwed on during the 1967 bargaining, after Ford took a strike rather than have an open‐ended escalator clause. But inflation vastly overleaped the eight‐cent limit. Man agement agrees that the union is entitled to 26 cents to make up for past inflation, but it wants that 26‐ cent hike to be regarded as part of the new package, not as simply catch‐up on the old one. The U.A.W. will also be after improvement in pen sions, early retirement provisions, dental care, year‐ end vacations—the type of benefits that usually deco rate their contracts. But the basic issue will be the over‐all size of the wage package. Washington means to stay well out of the Detroit negotiations. Auto management would probably wel come some jawboning from the White House to coun sel union restraint, but it seems unlikely to get much from Mr. Nixon or Secretary Hodgson. If there is be a reasonable settlement in autos this year, it will be a result of the recognition by both parties of what cost inflation and foreign competition can do even America's greatest manufacturing industry.

475-> Sludge Emergency Declared by Cahill; U.S. to Send Tugs
TRENTON, Feb. 7 (AP)—Gov. William T. Cahill signed a dec laration of a state of emer gency in New Jersey tonight SO huge sludge accumulations at the state's sewage treatmen plants might be disposed at sea. An aide said the Governor took the action after the White House informed him that it had ditected Rear Adm. Mark A. Whelan, commander of the Eastern Area of the Coast Guard, to put a tugboat or tug boats at the Governor's dis posal. The tugs are needed to haul barges with the waste to sea. The proclamation empowers state officials to take over the privately owned barges. The sludge has been building up at state plants and filling the barges since the start of a strike of tugboat crewmen in New York Harbor Monday. The mounting accumulations posed a health hazard. Cahill had asked leaders of the National Maritime Union for one tugboat to haul the barges away, but was refused. Richard Sullivan, director of the Division of Clean Air and Water of the State Health De partment, had said yesterday that the plant most immediate ly threatened with a shutdown because of sludge accumula tions was the one at Sayreville, which treats 65 million gallons of raw sewage.

476-> Superagencies at Issue
The unexpected resignation of Hospitals Commissioner Jo seph V. Terenzio, and his com plaints of lack of access to the Mayor and lack of influence in critical decisions, raises” anew the question of the effective ness of the reorganization of city government into ten super agencies. Some or the questions beii raised by Dem cratic critics al experts on urb; affairs are: ¶Have these superagencie designed to encourage ration planning in city governmer merely added to the red tai and imposed another bureai cratic layer between city off cials and the Mayor? ¶Have they discouraged ab men from taking commissioner ships? ¶Is Mayor Lindsay, in fac less accessible to his commis sioners than was Mayor Robei F. Wagner? Commissioner Terenzio’ complaints have been voice by many other Lindsay corn missioners, past and presen1 City Hall sources say Mr. Ter enzio was recently forced t/ wait a week before he coulc get an appointment to see Mr Lindsay, who had not consultec him on the appointment of Gor don Chase as Health Service: Administrator. In fact, the sources say, Mr. Terenzio sought unsuccessfully to get an appointment witt Budget Director Frederick O'R Hayes to protest pending cute in the Hospitals budget. Had to Share Audience When Mr. Terenzio finally saw the Mayor, he did not re ceive the private audience he had requested, but rather shared Mr. Lindsay's ear with Mr. Chase and Werner Kramar sky, the Mayor's health/liaison. “Commissioners are not ever happy that there's somebody between them and the Mayor,” Dr. James G. Haughton, first’ deputy Health Services Admin istrator, said before Mr. Teren zio's resignation. A former commissioner of another agency confirmed the resentment that some commis sioners felt toward the super agency administrators. “My effectiveness ended the day that became admin istrator‐designate,” he said. “I was bypassed by the unions, the professionals, the people I'd been dealing with, who felt that I lacked the Mayor's ear.” However, Lyle C. Fitch, Dep uty Mayor under Mr. Wagner who drew up Mr. Lindsay's white paper creating the super agencies, says that commission ers also complained of lack of access during the Wagner ad ministration. “A mayor could only see small number of his commis sioners,” said Mr. Fitch, “presi dent of the Institute of Public Administration. “A far larger number of people see Lindsay than saw Wagner.” Re‐examination Urged The superagencies require careful re‐examination, Mr. Fitch says, but he still believes in them. “I don't see any way to manage things other than hooking together things that are interrelated,” he said. Mr. Fitch believes that Mayor Lindsay's difficulty ‘in recruit ing people, and his difficulties in keeping them—more than 40 top mayoral aides have re signed since Election Day— are caused more by the man and the circumstances through which he became Mayor than Dy the reorganization of city government. “I don't think Lindsay is good administrator,” said Mr. Fitch, who is an admirer of the VIayor, “but this is partly be muse he had no political or ganization to get things done.” Mr. Fitch said that the May or's recruiting efforts also were hampered by “the Lindsay reputation as a dilettante in the hard business of govern ment.” In this connection, Mr. Terenzio's last meeting with the Mayor included an agenda of five items, but the Mayor's attention began to wane after the second item. Mr. Terenzio thereupon switched to the fifth and crucial item—the hos pital budget. The Mayor's recruiting prob lems are also attributed by City Hall observers to the city's rep utation for being impossible to govern. “This is a town that eats peo ple alive,” said one former Lind say commissioner, “and the strewn reputations of men once considered national experts lit ter the public arena like used up. abandoned old cars.” Pay Discourages Some The city pay scale also has discouraged some men from be coming public officials and Mr. Lindsay's initial proposal to de crease the salaries of officials did not enhance’ the attractive ness of city jobs. Mr. Wagner, in fact, supple mented the salaries of some of his commissioners with unpub lished grantsfrom private foun dations. Last week, Mr. Lindsay gave $5,000 raises to his com missioners and top aides. Because of the superagencies, the Deputy Mayor‐City Admin istrator's job has‐been changed From that of a city manager to that of one concerned with in novating programs. The office of. City Administrator was set up by Mayor Wagner to carry, on ‘high level supervision ‘performance evaluation” and “operations and systems analy sis.” “A city manager is an anach ronism, particularly under the reorganization,” Mr. Lindsay has said.’ He reasons’ that these um brella agencies are intended to police themselves. The Health Services Administration, for ex ample, is supposed to oversee the Hospitals, Health, Mental Health Departments and Medi cal Examiner's OffiCe. Some City Hall observers be lieve, however that the super agencies simply are not doing this:;'job They say. that the Lindsay adMinistration,has suf fered precisely bedause of the lack of an agency to oversee the city departments, and lack of follow‐through on May oral directives Would End Superagencies Partly because of these de ficiencies, two specialists rec ommended last month that the superagencies be abolished and the city departments be placed under four Deputy Mayors. “We would restore many of the operating departments to their status preceding creation of ‘the superagericies,” said Adam Walinsky and David Hertz in the report commis sioned by the Institute of Pub lic Adininistration, “and re group them under four Deputy Mayors’ in ‘a “way. that will ex press the programmatic priori ties of the city.” Mark Cannon, another ex pert on urban government and executive director of the in stitute, said yesterday of Mayor Lindsay's superagencies: “You can credit the Mayor with wanting to improve crder by creating ‘the superagencies, but you. have to fault him for thinking that this would have a magical effect. “

477-> 4 Contemporary Piano Pieces Add New Tone to the Whitney
The Whitney Museum of Amer ican Art made an apt setting last night for a program of “Works for Three and Four Pi anos” by Christian Wolff, Mor ton Feldman, Earle Brown and John Cage, four mature masters of what might be called the New York school of contempo rary tone painting. All the com posers except Cage, who was represented by his “Winter Mu sic” (1957), were represented by works that were being hung, or heard, for the first time in New York. Mr. Wolff's “Tilbury,” evi dently a series from which four pianists performed two ex cerpts, or versions, made capi tal of a Satie‐like immobility, making stepwise movements, drawing gulps of silent breath, and beckoning the listener in side its attenuated sounds to hear their essence. The per formers were allowed much lee way, but no license. Mr. Feldman, who appeared at one piano in his 1962 com position, “Piece for Four Pi anos,” and in “Two Pieces for Three Pianos” (1967), is of course the master of this hyper delicate genre, the apotheosis of the diminuendo. Making sensitive use of the spatial separation of the four in struments, Mr. Feldman brought isolated tones and groups of sounds together and then sepa rated them with the expertness of a brain surgeon, while man aging to sustain interest despite petus, tension, harmony orom an almost total lack of im petus, tension, harmony or mel ody in any older sense. After a while, one began to hear or imagine tiny tones that may or may not have ben sounding. It was the sort of music in which a mystic may hear the spheres creaking, or a gourmand detect his ongoing digestion. Earle Brown's “Corroboree” (1964), shifted the evening's mood sharply, alternating a good deal of violence with its delicacy. In its arm‐induced tone clusters, harping on the pianos' innards, and other ex plorations of the “total piano,” the work located itself in the American tradition of Ives, Cowell, Cage, and provided a completely fascinating experi ence. One could imagine a pow erful, primitive ballet to “Cor roboree,” if only because the title alludes to an Australian “nocturnal festivity.” Besides Mr. Feldman, the pro gram's superlatively adept pian ists were Philip Corner, George Flynn, James Tenny and Fred eric Rzewski.

478-> Iraq Recognizes Kurdish Autonomy
BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 11 —The Iraqi Government to night recognized the autonomy of the Kurdish people within the Iraqi state, and declared a national holiday tomorrow to celebrate the event. The Iraqi President, Lieut. Gen. Ahmed Hassan al‐Bakr, in a radio and television address following months of negotia tions with the Kurds and years of rebellion, said that they would exercise their national rights within a unified area in the north of Iraq. He said that one Iraqi Vice President would be a Kurd, that Kurds would have proportional representation in a future Iraqi Parliament and that the Kurdish language would be an official language, along with Arabic, in Kurdish areas. All this and more, the Presi dent said, will be written into new Iraqi constitution recog nizing that the country is formed of two nationalities, Kurds and Arabs. A representative of the Kurds read a statement over radio and television, asserting that the declaration had the full sup port of Gen. Mustafa al‐Barzani, the leader of the Kurds. Fighting for Centuries If it is carried out—as pre vious accords have not been— the declaration will end eight and a half years of sporadic warfare between the Baghdad Government and the Kurds. Iraq has a population of 8.6 million people of whom 1.5 million to 2 million are Kurds. Five million other Kurds live in Turkey while it is estimated that three mil lion live in Iran. Kurds have been fighting Turks, Persians and Arabs for centuries. They rose in a series of futile rebellions in Turkey after World War II in quest of independence and managed in 1946 to form a short‐lived re public in Iran, in the region be tween Soviet and British occu pation zones, but with Soviet support. The Kurds in Iraq, however, have continued the fight since World War II not for inde pendence but for autonomy within the Iraqi state. General. Barzani, a tribal leader, began fighting the Brit ish in Iraq 40 years ago and continued to fight the Iraqi re public. He united the Kurdish tribes and gained de facto autonomy in 1961. The final negotiations on which President Bakr based his declaration today were between General Barzani and Sidan Hussein Taarit, the Assistant Secretary General of the Iraqi Baath party, who is reputed to be the most powerful man in the country. He is also Vice Premier, and vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, the ruling government body. On his return to Baghdad from these talks the Vice Pre mier announced that he had reached agreement not on truce or cease‐fire but on a “total and final” settlement of the Kurdish question. Kurdish sources cautioned, however, that the declaration was unilateral, by the Govern ment, and that it was up to the Government to carry it out. The Kurds emphasized that their armed force, known as the Pesh Merga, or the devoted ones, and numbering about 10 000 men, would remain intact while the agreement was being carried out. The question of whether the town of Kirkuk, center of the Iraqi oil fields, should be in cluded in he Kurdish area re mained open. Government to Keep Oil But the Government made clear that it would keep con trol of the oil, by stating that “the’ development and exploita tion of the national resources of the area is the responsibil ity of the republic.” The. Kurds’ agreement for coming to terms is that, no matter what some Kurds may think of. the Baath, the chance to reach agreement with any Iraqi Government that recog nized Kurdish autonomy was historic opportunity. Moreover, General Barzani is getting old. While his age is given as 66, some believe that he is older And the Kurds, with thousands of their villages in ruins from fighting and from aerial bombardment, and with a generation growing up almost without education, are weary. If the declaration does ntt lead to final peace, it will at least give them a respite.

479-> Education
Each year, amid much trauma, well over one million high school seniors labor for three hours over the Scholastic Apti tude Tests, the multiple‐choice examinations that are supposed to predict a candidate's verbal and matliematical capacity. The SAT's are required as an im portant college admissions clue by the more than 800 member institutions of the College En trance Examination Board, a 70‐ year‐old nonprofit organization. The importance of the tests has grown as more and more high school graduates have tried to crash the selective, high‐pres tige colleges. Like all hurdles which keep some people out, the tests were often attacked, usually on the ground that objecti've questions tend to favor conventional over non ‐ conformist or creative minds. More recently, the tests have drawn fire as a form of discrimination against those with merely different backgrounds— the ethnic minorities. Much ex pert testimony does indeed in dicate that slum‐bred young sters, reared with little benefit of relaxed conversation and good books, are at a disadvan tage when measured by custo mary yardsticks of verbal so phistication. Last week, the SAT's suffered a symbolic setback that could forecast a crumbling of the test ing dike. Bowdoin College, the highly selecti've school at Bruns wick, Maine, announced that its faculty had voted to drop Col lege Board tests as a require ment for admission, effective im mediately dkpplicants will have the option of submitting their SAT scores. The faculty's reasoning is im portant to any assessment of fu ture trends. For many years, its statement admits, the scores have been regarded as extremely helpful. The scores made it easier to tell what the same classroom grades earned at different schools might ac tually mean. They also served as a warning flag when a stu dent with a very low school record did extremely well in his aptitude tests: He might be a better risk than his teachers thought. Perhaps they just never knew how to motivate his tal ents. It should be added that math ematicians and scientists in par ticular found the mathematical aptitude prediction of the SAT's highly accurate. Then, why the change — at Bowdoin and probably soon at many other colleges? “Times and values change, and so must emphases,” said Richard W. Moll, Bowdoin's Di rector of Admissions. These days, he added, the colleges search for students with a far greater range of backgrounds “who best combine intellectual vigor with the rather intangible character istics of daring and discipline, sensitivity and purpose.” In this kind of search, the value of standardized scores be comes questionable. Indeed, for the better part of a decade, a number of colleges, while still calling for the scores, have been admitting growing numbers of “risky” applicants outside the regular requirements. There have been similar di agnoses elsewhere. For example, an editorial in Brown Univer sity's undergraduate daily had suggested: “The changing nature of education . . . and the increas ing involvement of students in socio‐political movements makes it essential now that the entire range of admissions be re‐ex amined.” Amherst's Eugene Wilson, considered in the profession as the dean of the admissions deans, has said: “Test scores do not guarantee the presence of those human qualities and in tellectual abilities we value the most.” It should be added that no good admissions officer ever re lied exclusively on the scores or on any one indicator of suc cess. They looked at the total package of scores, academic rec ords and outside activities. But at the height of the admission crush, some four years ago, the tests often may have counted more than they should have. The pressure for change has been building up for some time; but it has become virtually ir resistible under the impact of demands of black students and other minority groups for greater slice of the college pie. Bowdoin said bluntly that it wants to “avoid requiring from any individual evidence which might be inherently misleading.” But while the downgrading of standard tests is clearly in the wind, it would be misleading to view the change as an enlight ened break with a bad system. Historically, objective testing was widely hailed as a triumph in the battle against earlier forms of discrimination. It was through objective standards that the prestige colleges, less than 40 years ago, were forced to admit more than token numbers of Jews and Catholics, or other socially less acceptable appli cants to the clubby enclaves. A different kind of discrimi nation, resulting from a special form of educational and envi ronmental deprivation, now calls for a more subjective policy. But it would be naive not to ex pect some new problems and grievances to arise from such a policy. It takes strong admis sions officers, with high marks for integrity, to defend decis ions which cannot be supported by the numbers. Moreover, the highly personal approach is rel atively easier at small colleges like Bowdoin than at large uni versities. Despite these difficulties, the pendulum's swing from the ma chine‐processing to a more per sonal approach was inevitable. It is part of the revolt against computerization of man's condi tion. The question that concerns many observers is how far the pendulum should be allowed to swing, from the safety of stand ard freshmen to the chaos of a class of egocentrics doing their own thing. The Bowdoin faculty, even as it dropped the test re quirement, urged caution. “We must remember that originality is the most easily faked of all character qualities,” said one professor. Finally, what is likely to be. the reaction of the College En trance Examinations Board to these rebellious trends? The board has anticipated the demand for change. A commis sion of outside advisers has been analyzing the testing evidence for over two years. While it is too early to predict the exact outcome, it seems clear that the board will in future design tests to be used, not to keep students out of the colleges of their choice, but to find better ways to tell students more about the right colleges for them. This trend was underscored yesterday when Arland F. Christ Janer, the College Board's new president, stressed the tests' use fulness in determining a stu dent's need for special tutoring and other help. As higher education is opened to the majority of high school graduates, the problem of matching student and college, and the perfection of instruments to diagnose and guide students throughout their school and col lege careers may take the place of the dread old hurdles. The day may come when students will volunteer for tests, as many now rush for their horoscopes.

480-> National Guard Deployed Again at U. of Illinois
CHAMPAIGN, Ill., March 4—About 450 National Guard troops were called to the University of Illinois campus tonight for the second night in a row to enforce a curfew as student demonstrations continued. The deployment of the guardsmen followed a two hour marcr through the cam pus area by about 1,500 demonstrators, during which several windows of the university armory and the win dows of some parked cars and a police car were broken. A display at the Illinois Bell Telephone Company office near the campus was also shattered. State policemen and the guardsmen were making mass arrests for violation of the 10:30 P.M. curfew. Earlier in the day, the policemen had reinoved more than 100 demonstrators from the Stu dent Union Building. The protesters had as sembled on the third floor, where recruiters for the Gen eral Motors Corporation, the Standard Oil Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation conducting job interviews. One factor in last night's disorders was the university trustees, refusal to let Wil liam M. Kunstler, a defense attorney in the recently con cluded Chicago conspiracy trial. sneak on campus.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (AP)—An eight‐month tug‐of war between Congress and the White‐I‐louse ended today when the Senate completed action on an appropriation bill that was due last July 1. The bill carries fundi for the Labor. Department and the Health, Education and Welfare Department for the fiscal year ending this June 30. The Senate and House agreed on a compromise bill appropriating $19.4‐billion for the two departments and various other agencies, retro active to last July 1. This is still $680‐million over Mr. Nixon's budget, but the White House said he would accept it, since Con gress added a provision au thorizing him to withhold 2 per cent of the funds.

482-> Bridge Detroit Team's Upset of Circus Was Highlight of Recent Tour
The most surprising fea ture of the recent tour by Omar Sharif's Circus, which included three of the Italian world champions, was not that it was beaten by the Dallas Aces but that it lost three out of the six matches it played against local teams. The losses in Los Angeles and Philadelphia were not un expected, for the apposition was provided by players with international reputations. But the Europeans were no doubt surprised to be beaten in Detroit, particularly be cause the ‐ local organizers fielded a ‘team of 14 player: in preference to selecting four or six; Russell Roosen, Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Remey, Helen Shanbrom, Sylvia Stein, Clifford Bishop, Charles Burg‐. er, Edwin Smith Jr., Phil Leon, Don Hocevar, Ray Zoller, Carl Hudecek, Floyd Sayed and Erik Coon, with Albert Silber as non‐playing captain. Won by 34 LP.M.'s The Detroit team won the 56‐deal match by the convinc ing margin:of 34 international, match points. One of its big gest’ gains occurred on the diagrammed deal, when the choice of opening lead proved crucial. At both tables South be came the declarer in three no‐trump with spades the only suit bid by the oppo‐. nents. In one case Claude Del moully South for the Circus, was given no chance when Leon as West led the diamond seven. The declarer took a club finesse at an early stage and made only the six obvious tricks two clubs, two hearts, one spade and one diamond. He could have done better, but there was no way. in which he could have come close to making nine tricks. When the hand was re, played, Sharif as West chose to lead the club seven instead of the diamond seven against the bidding shown in the dia, gram. He may have consid ered that he was less likely to give away a trick by lead the weaker of his minor suits, but this is an arguable point. Remey, as South, put up the club jack in dummy and decided to try to establish spades as his best chance for nine tricks. He made the good play of the spade five from dummy, planning to finesse later, and this happened to put pressure on Leon Yallouze, who was East for the Circus. He. put up the spade king, no doubt fearing that South held the jack., This was a nat ural play, but a wrong one. It was most improbable that South held more than two spades, as he had refused to support the suit. If he held a doubleton jack, or even doubleton jack‐ten, East's play would make no differ ence in the long run. To play low ‐ from the East hand would lose only in the un likely event that South held a singleton jack. „ Thinking this out takes time, and it would take a very alert expert to play low on the spade lead quickly enough to avoid betraying possession of the king. East's play of the spade king not’ only helped South in the spade suit but hurt the defense If West had won the trick he would have known that a shift to dia monds was advisable. East could not know that his part ner held the king‐queen of diamonds and was afraid that his partner held the diamond king but not the queen. He shifted to a low heart in the hope of finding his partner with at least one heart hon or, but found he had given the declarer a cheap trick. Remey continued with spade leads, surrendering a trick to West This gave him his contract, with three spade tricks, three hearts, two clubs and a diamond. Detroit gained 11 international match points, and the audience of some 700 local enthusiasts cheered wildly.

483-> GOLDBERG. AND PATERSON WIN; OTTINGER TOPS 3 SENATE RIVALS; POWELL AND FARBSTEIN BEATEN
Arthur J. Goldberg won a close victory over Howard J. Samuels yesterday for the Democratic nomination for Governor as State Senator Basil A. Paterson and Adam Walinsky easily won the party's nominations for Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General. Goldberg 491,006 Samuels 445,578 13,161 of 13,735 E.D.'s. Paterson 576,275 Ambro 235,070 13,003 of 13,735 E.D.'s. Walinsky 490,821 Meehan 235,582 12,968 of 13,735 E.D.'s. Mr. Goldberg, a former As sociate Justice of the Supreme Court who only 10 days ago had said his polls showed 2‐to‐1 victory, won by a rela tively slim margin built with pluralities in city and suburban Jewish neighborhoods. With only about 26 per cent of the state's 3.6 million en rolled Democrats voting, Mr. Paterson, a Negro, proved to be the day's top vote‐getter. This led politicians to conclude that there was only scattered white backlash voting in his contest against Jerome A. Ambro, the white Supervisor of Huntington, L. I. Mr. Walinsky, a 33‐year‐old former speechwriter for Sen ator Robert F. Kennedy, ran 3‐to‐2 ahead of his opponent, Rockland County District At torney Robert R. Meehan, in most parts of the state. The gubernatorial race was close enough so that Mr. Sam uels, who led Mr. Goldberg by more than 15,000 votes outside the city, refused to concede formally early this morning. But he did make a tearful ap pearance before campaign workers at the Commodore Hotel and said: “If the vote shows that Arthur Goldberg won the nomi nation, then I wish him success in his fight against Nelson Rockefeller because I think it's important that the policies of Richard Nixon be repudiated in New York ... “I have to admit how dis appointed I am—to him goes the major responsibility of developing a new party that puts principle above party.” Mr. Goldberg did not claim victory, but he did appear be fore his supporters at the Americana Hotel to say that Mr. Paterson's victory “wrote glorious page in American his tory.” The voters' decision yester day gives the Democrats a ticket that is completely unbal anced in traditional ethnic and geographic terms. Of the five statewide candi dates, four are Jewish — Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Walinsky, Repre sentative Richard L. Ottinger, who became the candidate for United States Senator, and Con troller Arthur Levitt, who was unopposed for renomination. All five men live either in New York City or Westchester County. The Republican ticket in November was unchallenged in the primary and includes four incumbents—Governor Rocke feller, Senator Charles E. Goodell, Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson, Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz—and one new comer, Edward V. Regan, the candidate for Controller. The Liberal party ticket will be made up of Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Paterson, Mr. Goodell, Mr. Lefkowitz and Mr. Levitt. The Conservative party ticket is Paul Adams for Governor, Ed ward L. Leonard for Lieutenant Governor, James L. Buckley for the Senate, Leo Kesselring for Attorney General and Anthony R. Spinelli for Controller. The imbalance of the Demo cratic ticket is certain to be used as an issue by the Republi cans in the coming campaign. As the tallies came in last night political professionals wondered about the effective ness of the Goldberg primary campaign. Members of the Gold berg staff began the campaign with private polls showing Mr. Samuels would get only about 20 per cent of the vote. But after an energetic campaign the underdog received more than 48 per cent of the vote. An analysis of 34 election districts around the state indi cated that Mr. Goldberg's vote was built on solid support in city and suburban areas with predominantly or substantially Jewish populations. Mr. Samuels, on the other hand, ran best in most upstate counties and in Irish, Italian and Polish urban areas that have favored more conserva tive candidates in recent years. In a heavily Jewish district in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Mr. Goldberg re ceived 126 votes to Mr. Sam uels's 58. In a district in Forest Hills, Queens, where the turn out was about one third of those eligible, Mr. Goldberg easily defeated Mr. Samuels by a vote of 163 to 92. Outside the city, Mr. Gold berg ran best in suburbs with large percentages of middle aged Jewish voters. In Long Beach in Nassau County, he polled 3,560 votes to 1,802 for Mr. Samuels, while Mr. Pater son was defeating Mr. Ambro, 3,271 to 1,107. In suburbs with heavy, but relatively younger. Jewish pop ulations, the Goldberg‐Samuels race was closer. In Great Neck (18th A.D., 16th E.D.), Mr. Goldberg won 111 to 82, while Mr. Paterson was winning 158 to 23. But those suburbs had sig nificant impact on the election because more Democrats came out to vote there than in other areas. The turnout in Great Neck was 50 per cent and in Long Beach it was 38 per cent. Mr. Samuels defeated Mr. Goldberg in several New York City districts that had voted for conservative candidates—such as Mario A. Procaccino or John J. Marchi for Mayor—in recent elections. In the 13th Election District of the 35th A.D., in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, Mr. Samuels received 122 votes to Mr. Goldberg's 64. This district is populated by lower‐middle‐income Poles and Irish who voted heavily for Mr. Procaccino. In the predominant ly Italian Second Election Dis trict of the 86th A.D. in the Wil liamsbridge section of the Bronx, which also went to Mr. Procac cino last year, Mr. Samuels re ceived 17 votes to Mr. Gold berg's 6. In a district in Buffalo's heavily Polish‐American Sev enth ward, for example, Mr. Samuels received 27 votes to Mr. Goldberg's 20, and Mr. Paterson received 22 votes to Mr. Ambro's 15. This was a turnout of about one third in an area that had been ex pected to support Mr. Goldberg, who was backed by the organi zation of the Erie County lead er, Joseph F. Crangle. Similarly, in the First dis trict of Utica's 13th Ward, a middle‐income housing project populated by Italian‐Americans and blacks, Mr. Samuels re ceived 46 votes to Mr. Gold berg's 24. Mr. Paterson re ceived 24 votes to Mr. Ambro's 21. An analysis of the vote for Lieutenant Governor showed that some predictions of mas sive white voting, especially among lower‐income groups, against Mr. Paterson were es sentially unfulfilled. In one district of suburban Tonawanda, for example, a town of middle‐income and blue‐collar workers north of Buffalo, Mr. Paterson drew 50 votes to Mr. Ambro's 15. Sim ilar patterns prevailed in other areas, such as a district in the rural farming town of Gaines, where the Paterson vote totaled 31 to 13 for Mr. Ambro. Mr. Paterson also won in sonic city neighborhoods that had gone for Mr. Procaccino in last year's Mayoral race. In one sample district in the Williams bridge section, which is pre dominantly Italian the tally was 16 for Mr. Paterson and 12 for Mr Anihro. In the Flatbush ?? Brooklyn, a district of older and somewhat conservative Jews that went for Mr. Procac cino last year, Mr. Paterson beat Mr. Ambro by a vote of 87 to 60. There were exceptions, how ever. In a sample Staten Island district, mostly middle‐income Irish and Italians, Mr. Ambro won with 40 votes to Mr. Pater son's 30. Mr. Procaccino had won handily there in the May oral primary. The election yesterday was the first full application of the state's 1967 primary law, which ended 50 years of nominating statewide tickets at party con ventions. The primaries for Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General were the first since 1920, although the new law was used for Demo cratic and Liberal Senate pri maries in 1968. Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Sam uels were the survivors of a field of seven men who an nounced, at one time or anoth er, their candidacies for Gov ernor. The dropouts were for mer United States Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and Nas sau County, Executive Eugene H. Nickerson — who were both guaranteed places on the bal lot but could not raise enough money for the campaign — Wil liam vanden Heuvel, Queens District Attorney Thomas J. Mackell and Joseph Ettinger, a Brooklyn lawyer. Candidates began dropping out on March 20, when Mr. Goldberg—who had said last December that he would not be a candidate for statewide office—announced that he had changed his mind and would run. Behind the Goldberg candi dacy were two powerful forces: He had the support of such im portant county leaders as Meade H. Esposito of Brooklyn, Patrick Cunningham of the Bronx and Joseph F. Crangle of Buffalo, and his private polls showed him easily defeating any primary opponent in June and Governor Rockefeller in November. With the support of the lead ers, Mr. Goldberg easily won the endorsement of the Demo cratic State Committee at a chaotic meeting at Grossinger's Hotel in April. Mr. Nickerson won his right to a place on the ballot by re ceiving more than 25 per cent of the delegate vote at the meeting. Mr. Samuels and Mr. Mor genthau won that right by fol lowing the petition provisions of the 1967 law—each man col lected at least 10,000 signatures of enrolled Democrats, with at least 50 signatures from 47 of Ithe state's 62 counties. The rest of the ticket select ed at Grossinger's was Mr. Paterson for Lieutenant Gover nor, Theodore C. Sorenson for the Senate and Mr. Walinsky for Attorney General. The candidates — except Mr. Sorensen—were among the mi nority of New Yorkers who bothered to vote yesterday, and each man went through a familiar polling place ritual— joking with election workers, commenting on the weather, posing for pictures with the family and, finally, voting for himself and predicting victory. “It's voters' weather and that's Goldberg weather,” said Mr. Goldberg as he voted with his wife at Temple Emanu‐el. He said that he was glad the primary campaign was over and that he just wanted “to get a little more sleep than I've been getting.” If he won, he was asked, would he change his campaign style because of the criticism of other politicians who said he should be more vigorous? “No,” he replied, “you're go ing to have the same Goldberg as always. I can't change my self, I can't brainwash myself. I am the man I have been and I shall be the same man. I will not adopt an image.” Mr. Samuels and his wife flew from the city to Rochester in the morning, then drove to the little village of Chapin in Ontario County. They were the first of the 143 enrolled Demo crats in the district to vote and Mr. Samuels walked out of the booth saying, “Now if we can get the other 141 out today we have this thing wrapped up.” Only three of the four Senate candidates voted. Mr. Sorensen was in Washington with his family because of the death on Monday of his mother, Mrs. Ann Chaikin Sorensen. Representative Richard Max McCarthy voted two minutes after the polls opened in a school in his North Buffalo neighborhood. Then the candi date, his wife, Gail, and their five children headed for a fam ily home at Crystal Lake on the Canadian side of Lake Erie to—in Mrs. McCarthy's words — “run around and eat potato chips, 90 sandwiches and 600 Cokes and be sick the next day.” Paul O'Dwyer and his wife voted in a private school at 3 West 95th Street, where they met an elderly woman who warned him: “You better win this time, you have to win this time. I refuse to vote for you again after this.” Mr. and Mrs. Ottinger voted the Bear Ridge School in Pleas antville near his rambling, pre Revolutionary estate. Then the candidate threw a baseball around with his sons at home before climbing into a tree house and sipping iced tea.

484-> CHICAGO 12 FUGITIVE SEIZED HERE BY F.B.I.
Linda Evans, one of the 12 members of the Weathermen wanted in Chicago on Federal antiriot charges, was arrested here yesterday morning by the Federal Bureau of Investiga tion. Miss Evans, 22 years old, was seized near Tompins Square Park in the East Vil lage and thus became the first of the group indicted April 2 to be captured. Taken into custody with her was Thomas Niehman, 22, of 254 Sycamore Street, Staten Island. The F.B.I. said that Mr. Niehman had attempted to in terfere with the arrest and at tacked an agent. In a separate action, Dionne Donghi, 21, also a member of the Weatherman faction of Students for a Democratic So ciety, was arrested in the Eale Hotel in the West Village on a charge that she had pur chased an airline ticket with a forged check. Miss Evans, Mr. Niehman and Miss Donghi appeared be fore Commissioner Earle N. Bishopp in the United States Court House at Foley Square. Miss Evans was held in $75,000 bail, and bond was set at $20,000 for Miss Donghi and $10,000 for Mr. Niehman.

487-> Growers Burn Potatoes In Idaho War of Prices
RIGBY, Idaho, March 10—A potato price war is raging in the Snake River Valley, and in this normally tranquil town of 5,000, the atmosphere is as chilly as the wind that blows endlessly down from the Rockies. Three weeks ago, local po tato growers—almost all mem bers of the National Farmers Organization — acted to drive up prices by withholding stocks from the market, or, in a few extreme cases, by destroying them. The animosity that the action wrought is almost palpable here in this little town of squat farm implement stores and county office buildings. Down at Walker's restaurant, the potato farmers traditionally spend the chilly weeks until spring, sitting elbow to elbow with the produce buyers in warm affability. But this year, the warmth is gone. At lunch the other day, a potato grower and a buyer who had known each other since childhood did not speak. At a corner table, a grower talked about “shutting down” a buyer and relayed a rumor about a mysterious telephone caller who had offered to “do the job for a price,” and had suggested, “just put an ad in the paper that says, ‘Bill, come home.’ Wife Is Threatened At another table, a buyer complained that someone had slashed the tires on his auto mobile and had threatened his wife. The high feelings here in Rigby are not isolated. N. F. O. members across the country, particularly in the big potato areas of Maine and Oregon, have joined the war for higher prices. How successful the tactic of withholding has been is almost impossible to ascertain at this point. The marketing picture is extremely confused at every level. Adding to the confusion is the fact that potato prices normally rise slightly in March, whatever action the grow ers may take. Thus, while the price of 100‐pound sack of top‐grade potatoes has increased by 25 cents to about $3 in many areas in recent weeks, no one can say precisely why, though many tried. “It's because this is the most successful withholding action ever,” contends Oren Lee Staley, of Corning, Iowa, the president of the N.F.O., which is the most militant of the sev eral major farm groups in the United States. Varying Opinions “It's both the N.F.O. and the seasonal rise,” commented Ray Miles, a potato buyer from Yucon, Idaho. “It's only a seasonal in crease,” said Riley Westergard, a potato processor from Idaho Falls, Idaho. The N.F.O., which refuses to state the size of its membership on the ground that disclosure would weaken bargaining lever age, has previously withheld milk and hogs from the market in an effort to increase prices. Results were mixed and con fusing, as is currently the case with the potatoes withheld. And in desperation some milk and hogs were destroyed, ac tions that evoked severe criti cism from organizations con cerned with eliminating hunger throughout the world. Thus far in the potato with holding action, the only de struction of stock has taken place in Idaho. One of the N.F.O. leaders here, Del Ray Holm, says that mare than five million pounds of what he in variably calls “spuds” have been burned. The most recent destruction took place today on a wind swept stretch of farmland near American Falls. The action, re ferred to as a “bake,” was liber ally seasoned with histrionics, hyperbole and humor. It was study in some of the things that bother many American farmers today. Convoy at Burning Site The potatoes and their grow ers arrived at the burning site in a two‐mile‐long convoy of trucks and automobiles, most of them late models whose shiny newness seemed to con tradict the numerous crudely lettered signs contending that farmers were on the verge of economic ruin. Asked to explain, Larry Boam, of Idaho Falls, said: “A lot of these cars and trucks are owned by the bank. It's all we can do to keep up our payments and what with interest rates and other costs going up, some of us just won't make it this year. “Those of us who do will realize only 2 or 3 per cent return on our investment, and we figure that's just not enough. We could sell our land and equipment and invest the money and get at least 5 per cent. We're fed up with this cost‐price squeeze. We want a bigger share of the take.” As the trucks and cars moved in to dump their loads— the quality of the potatoes was extremely poor and the non N.F.O. consensus was that the potatoes did not total three mil lion pounds — several farmers who were organization members berated neighbors who were not. “We're going to beat these damn buyers without your help,” one man yelled to the smiling occupants of a passing car and added: “This is the new stuff, boys — farm bargaining. The more the merrier. The only strength is in organized members.” Then he turned back to the dumping operation, cursing under his breath. Buyers and processors throughout the country say they have nothing against farm organization in principle, but a random survey found that most studiously avoid signing contracts with N.F.O. members. In fact, many bragged that they had been able to under cut the organization by quietly persuading some hard‐pressed members to sell potatoes at prices well below what the N.F.O. considers fair. An Idaho Falls buyer, who asked not to be identified, said: “The prices we pay are fair enough. We're going to do every thing we can to avoid ever signing N.F.O. contracts. We know. where that would lead— to another union, In effect, and we've already got enough of them to deal with.”

488-> Gains by Rojas Are Shaking the Colombian Elite
BOGOTA, April 22—On a cold afternoon 11 years ago, the Colombian Senate censured a retired lieutenant general as un fit “because of his misconduct in the presidency of the re public.” News Analysis That general—Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, now 70 years old—has come back this week, claiming victory in the pres idential election last Sunday and charg ing that fraud was being used to turn the very close elec tion against him. His leading supporters have asserted that they are ready to wage civil war to return him to power. No matter who is declared the winner, the results at the Polls and in street disorders Monday and Tuesday have shaken, if not shattered, the unquestioned control over Latin America's fourth largest nation traditionally exercised by a loosely knit political and eco nomic elite. Paradoxically, the Govern ment under President Carlos Lleras Restrepo, which is strug gling to keep democratic insti tutions alive—a state of siege tis in force—has been recog nized internationally as a model of Latin‐American technical ad ministration and social invest ment. There were reports today that the traditional political leaders. President Lleras among them, had realized that more social investment with faster results would be needed to counteract General Rojas. “Investment in social pro grams over the next years has to be very large and very fast,” Misael Pastrana, the governing coalition's candidate, who is leading in the official count, said in an interview. Politically, what has hap pened this year is this: The elite, overconfident after 12 years of government by a con stitutional coalition of the two traditional parties, Liberals and Conservatives, was surprised by a strong populist campaign against them and ignored it until the last minute. “There are probably more than a million and a half Colombians unhappy with their lot,” a politically experienced man who had worked hard on the campaign said the other day. “We just didn't know that Rojas had the organization to get that many to vote for him.” Socially, what has happened is that the familiar demands for a better life right away crystallized behind the unlikely figure of a former military dic tator. “That was a social revolution at the polls last Sunday,” said a politically influential man who is an enemy of General Rojas. “Colombia will never be the same again.” The general's strong show ing was based on the frustra tions of the urban poor, un employed or underemployed and hungry, and on the resent ment of the lower middle class —in the cities and on the small farms—against the use of taxes to finance social reforms. Taxes have slowed the rise in the standard of living for indus trial employes and industrial development has pushed up liv ing costs. The vote, in terms of an economic program, was in favor of current consumption and protest against the generally successful investment in long range economic development managed by President Lleras. General Rojas's campaign used that protest to attack the civilian politicians who wel comed his military coup d'état in 1953 and engineered his res ignation in 1957 under the pres sure of a general strike. The Rojas dictatorship is con troversial in Colombia. The gen eral is credited with having halted the undeclared civil war between Liberals and Conserv atives, but violence began again, in some parts of the country two years after he came to power. “Rojas was a dictator but he was good for the really poor,” a middle‐aged Bogotd taxi driver said before the elec tion. “If you had any money, you didn't make out under him, and that might be good again.” Another man, was spent the Rojas years as a rural traveling salesman, recalled that food may have been cheaper but lift was more dangerous. He re membered that if one went into a bar where there were armed Rojas supporters, one had to shout “Viva el Excelentisimo Seiior Presidente y Jefe Su premo General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla?” Nothing less would do, he said. The general himself made a proud confession of the secret of his populist methods of gov ernment before the election. “There's not a twon in Co lombia without some public works project of mine,” he said during a national television appearance. “I made sure that each and every mayor had something ready for inaugura tion on June 13, the anniver sary of my rise to power I told the myors if they didn't have a project ready, they'd be fired.”

491-> Britons Plan to Raise Titanic Electronically
BALDOCK, England, Jan. 11 — A group of salvage en thusiasts today announced plans to raise the liner Titanic, which sank in 1912 when it hit an iceberg about 430 miles southeast of New foundland. Douglas Wooley, 33 years old, said that the cost would be £2‐million ($4.8‐million). “We have reached the final stage, to get the photographs of the vessel from the bot tom of the sea,” Mr. Woolley said. “This will cost about £10,000, which we have been promised by a firm in West Germany. We are taking up that offer.” Mr. Wooley and his team have registered a company called Titanic Salvage. Mr. Wooley said that he would give up his job and that the team would probably leave for the site in April. “The salvage operation will be done with electronic equipment,” he said. The salvage could take six months, but if all goes well the Titanic should be up at the beginning of next year, Mr. Wooley said.

492-> Tropical Fish and Fowl Enhance Hialeah's Appeal
MIAMI BEACH — People used to say that the winter season here began when the horses started running at nearby Hialeah Race Course. That old saying hasn't rung true in years, for the season begins considerably earlier now. But the Hialeah track, which opened its 40‐day meeting last Friday, still is the queen of the pari‐mutuels in Florida, and it is fair to say that the season is at its height when Hialeah is operating. This year, the lush 200‐acre park offering two new stakes races, making a total of 18 for the meeting. It also has boosted the Turf Cup prize money from $75,000 to $100,000, thus giving the track three $100,000 races this season. Among the champion horses cheduled to race here this winter are Arts and Letters, 1969's “Horse of the Year”; Silent Screen, the 1969 2‐year‐old champion, and Ta Wee, best sprinter of the year. But Hialeah's appeal is not limited to those who have monetary interest in how the horses finish. It is, quite aside from racing, a major sightseeing attrac tion here. One of the few race tracks in the na tion open the year round, Hialeah also numbers among its attractions its famous flamingos, an aquarium, an aviary and 209 acres of lush tropical plantings. The track is a stop on most commer cial bus tours. On nonracing days, ad mission to the track is free; a guided tour via tram is available at 75 cents a person. An indication of the track's popularity is that more than 2,250,000 post cards are mailed from the track during the nonracing season. Almost as famous as the race horses here are the pink flamingos that live on four small islands in the track's infield. The colony of 400 birds is the only one inhabiting a civilized area by choice; they are free to fly away, but never do. Other birds also are on view at the track. Eight cages of multicolored tropi cal species from Africa and Central and South America grace the aviary. The track also is an Audubon Society sanctu ary, and at this time of year hundreds of migratory birds live on the grounds and infield lake. Hialeah's aquarium re‐creates the cab in of a sunken clipper ship. From inside the simulated cabin, visitors gaze “out” at a collection of tropical coral‐reef fish. Hialeah's distinctive architecture is legacy of Joseph E. Widener, who in 1931 redesigned the track to be “a pub lic park in which horse‐racing would be conducted a part of the year.” And so Mr. Widener relandscaped the course, lining the drives with 1,250 royal and Washingtonian palms and 9,475 Australian and Cunningham pines. He then visited race tracks the world over in order to incorporate the best features into the new Hialeah. Mr. Widener replaced the original stark stands—they were built in 1925— with a 900‐foot‐long Mediterranean‐style grandstand and clubhouse. From the fa mous Longchamps race track near Paris, he copied the walking ring and grand staircases at the rear of the grandstand. Saratoga's infield lake and tree‐lined clubhouse were used as patterns, the saddling stalls and paddock track tun nel were adopted from Epsom Downs in England and other elements were bor rowed from France's Chantilly and Deauville. Other attractions on the grounds in clude an Indian dugout canoe, a 36‐foot gondola from Venice, a French walking ring with a tartan surface and silks of the world's greatest racing stables. For special events, English carriages are placed on display. Among them are the State Landau, built in 1865 and used for 90 years by the British royal fam ily, and the dress coach once employed for British state functions. A Parisian style, self‐service sidewalk cafe is open the year round. Parl‐mutuel attractions like Hialeah are among Greater Miami's most popu lar lures. Special buses make runs be tween Miami Beach's hotel row and these sports facilities. Also now operating in this area are five other pari‐mutuel establishments. At Pompano, the trotters are running night ly until April 11, while jai alai, the fast Basque game, is played each evening at frontons in Miami and Dania. Two dog‐racing tracks are currently open. Biscayne, in Miami, has just com pleted $2‐million of improvements, in cluding enclosing and air conditioning its mezzanine and grandstand.

493-> Shipyard's Plan for Hiring Minorities Called Inadequate
WASHINGTON, April 15 (AP) — The Labor Department said today that it had rejected as inadequate a minority hiring program worked out by the Maritime Administration with the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. “It didn't meet the equal opportunity requirements under the President's executive or der,” a Labor Department spokesman said. He said the Maritime Admin istration had agreed to resume negotiations with the Virginia company and a union, the Pen insula Shipbuilders Association, to bring the agreement within terms of the executive order. The Presidential order pro hibits job discrimination by rea son of race among contractors and subcontractors on Federal contracts.

494-> Population Explosion Reaches
IN this era of overpopulation when almost everything is crowded—air ports with people and planes, high ways with bumpers nudging bump ers—it possibly should not be surprising to hear skiers complain that their wide open mountain slopes are also becoming crowded. Not quite overpopulated yet, but on the way. Population Explosion Reaches Ski Slopes A recent survey of recreational skiers disclosed that crowded slopes ranked as the chief complaint of 36 per cent of those interviewed. An additional 10 per cent lamented the long lift lines, but 13 per cent maintained that they had no complaints about anything. The grumbling about crowds referred principally to those weekends and holi days when all roads in Snow Country, U.S.A., seem to lead to the ski areas. The statistics give cause for concern; what has happened to those quiet weekends of yesteryear when a trip to the ski country provided the opportunity to commune with nature against a back drop of lonely mountains and wooded trails? Members of the increasing ski‐touring fraternity have found an answer. They get away from it all by pointing their skis away from the bustle around the lifts and base lodges and heading for the back country. But while ski touring may be extreme ly rewarding for those seeking a change from the tumult of city living, most snow enthusiasts contemplate the rigors of climbing uphill while cross‐country skiing with the keenness of a busy 76th floor executive who has just learned that the elevators are out of order. The strange thing about the press and crush on weekends is that, while the number of ski areas has at least doubled in the last 10 years, the number of skiers in the United States is still generally estimated at 3,000,000—the same figure estimated in 1960. “Anyone can see that there is some thing wrong with that arithmetic,” said a seasoned skier who has been enjoying the sport since the 1930's. “But skiers, like fishermen, are prone to exaggerate. That figure of 10 years ago probably was dreamed up by someone who had just skied into a tree.” Since crowded slopes detract from the skier's pleasure, many centers have taken steps to cope with the problem. For example, two areas in New Hamp shire — Attitash and King Ridge — sell their lift tickets for weekends on an advanced reservation plan. They halt sales at a predetermined figure that pro vides ample space for everyone. To com pensate for the loss in revenue in play ing host to fewer skiers, the two areas have increased the price of their tickets. One disadvantage of overcrowded slopes is that they increase the possibil ity of injury. Skiers need room to roam, and an abundance of traffic automati cally heightens the danger of collisions. There is no doubt that the problem would not be so acute if something could be done about the reckless schuss boomer, the breed of skier (almost al ways a youngster) who thinks nothing of hurtling down a mountain at top speed even though the slope is busy with other skiers, including beginners. At Hunter Mountain in the northern Catskills, a 30‐member Courtesy Patrol has been established to help solve the problem of crowded slopes and impa tience on the lift lines. One of the pa trol's jobs is to contain the exuberance of those skiers who seem to forget that they are not on the trail of the lonesome pine. That overcrowding and inconsiderate schussbooming are not just American problems is evidenced by word from Austria, as well as other European coun tries. Prof. Walter Kuenzel, head of the Aus trian Institute for Maintenance of Ski Trails, reports from Vienna that Austria had 84,000 skiing mishaps last winter, double the figure for road accidents in the same period. “Some kind of legal ski trail supervision has to be instituted soon,” he said. Professor Kuenzel and some of his col leagues favor empowering the police to arrest reckless skiers on the spot. “Most of the accidents are caused by ski row dies going too fast and knocking over fellow skiers on busy slopes,” he said. The professor agrees that police in volvement in a pastime such as skiing is highly controversial and that no one wants to encumber fun with rules. “But,” he added, t'in view of the sport's increas ing popularity, some kind of supervision must be introduced. After all, skiing must still be fun.” Fun and the continuation of the ski explosion are two of the themes of America's sixth annual National Ski Week, which started last Friday and continues through next Sunday. Resorts, ski shops, department stores and ski clubs across the country are all joining in the celebration. The shops are staging fashion shows, some ski areas are offering reduced ticket prices, and the ski school directors are scheduling all kinds of hijinks rang ing from torchlight parades down the mountain to broom hockey games on ski‐area skating rinks. Probably not typical, but certainly all inclusive, is the program that Mount Snow in Vermont has set for National Ski Week. On the agenda are ski racing, a beauty pageant, an ice‐sculpture con test, snowmobile races, a fashion show, an obstacle race, a foxtail chase and gelandesprung (jumping) event. “We have programmed everything that can be done with a ski celebration,” said John Christy, manager of Mount Snow. “And everyone is welcome—ex cept reckless schussboomers.”

495-> A. C. L. U. Challenges U.S. Over Mail Inspection
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a suit here challenging the constitutionality of proposed Federal regulations that would authorize customs officials to open mail from overseas without the recipient's permission, which is currently required. In announcing that suit had been filed in the Federal Dis trict Court here, Melvin L. Wulf, legal director of the civil rights organization, said yes terday that he had received evidency that the proposed regulations were already in ef fect, even though Post Office Department officials had de nied this. David A. Nelson, general coun sel of the department, said by telephone from Washington that the regulations were still under consideration as part of a series of measures the Nixon Administration hoped to enact to stop the growing flow of pornography mailed into this country. Mr. Nelson, recalling that the proposal had aroused some opposition in Congress, said: “we're dealing with an uncommonly sensitive problem that may require much more discus sion before it is adopted. Mr. Wulf is simply wrong about this—the regulations have not been adopted.” But the union's legal direc tor insisted that Post Office officials were already turning suspicious material over to the customs authorities under the provisions of the proposed regulations. He said he would seek a preliminary injunction to halt this alleged practice. “The A.C.L.U. maintains that regulations allowing the open ing of first‐class mail without a search warrant violate the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment prohibiting un reasonable search and seizure,” Mr. Wulf said. “And because of the inhibiting nature of the illegal search and seizure, the union charges that First Amendment freedom of press rights are violated because the regulations will discourage publication of material written abroad.” Three other plaintiffs were brought into the suit by Mr. Wulf to underscore the impact he believes the new regulations would have on various seg ments of the community. They are Pantheon Books, a division of Random House; a New York University professor who re ceives scholarly materials from Latin America, and a house wife with relatives abroad. Andre Schiffrin, managing editor of Pantheon Books, said yesterday that he considered the proposals to be “terribly harmful” to the publishing in dustry. “They may well be opening our mail now without our knowing it,” he said. “Under the guise of searching for por nography they may end up in hibiting the mailing of all kinds of manuscripts from abroad and cause great hardship to an industry based on free ex change of iueas.” Mr. Schiffrin said he was also opposed to “arbitrary con fiscation” of materials consid ered pornographic on the ground that “it should be up to us to decide what we want to publish, just as it's up to us to determine if a manuscript is libelous.” Another sponsor of the suit is Laurence Birns, professor of Latin‐American studies at New York University. The house wife is Deirdre Wulf, a British citizen who is the wife of the A. C. L. U. legal director. “My wife engages in regular correspondence with her fam ily and friends abroad,” Mr. Wulf said, “I believe she has a right to defend her privacy.” A spokesman for the Post Office Department said the proposed regulations would re quire that postal officials turn over any overseas mail sus pected of containing prohibited matter to local customs of ficials, who would then open it. Under present regulations, the addresses would have to authorize the opening of the mail, otherwise it would be re turned to the sender.

497-> In The Nation: One‐Two Punch in the Senate
WASHINGTON, July 1—Seldom if ever has a President suffered the sort of one‐two punch with which the Senate smote Mr. Nixon on Tuesday —passing the Cooper‐Church amendment on Cambodia and overriding the President's veto of the health aid bill, 76 to 19. (To be fair, the Senate on the same busy day also gave Mr. Nixon postal reform, which was a good piece of work, but by no means good enough to balance the President's score against the other two votes.) Damaging Impact In the first place, defeat has its own kind of damaging impact, aside from the substance of the issue. In vetoing hospital construction money, Mr. Nixon almost surely miscalculated, for instance, the temper of Congress; or, if he didn't he recklessly diminished the political power of his veto by expending it in a hopeless cause. Either way, the defeat is bound to have lessened the wary political respect in which a Congress, for best results all around, ought to hold a President; and in Mr. Nixon's case, there was already far too little such respect going for him on Capitol Hill. The Cooper‐Church amendment was an even more serious blow, struck as it was in the foreign policy area, where every President since World War II has been able to operate with almost unchallenged authority. Again, aside from the substance of the amendment, the fact of defeat is damaging; despite his sustained opposition to the amendment, during which he even invoked the almost mystical notion of “the powers of the Presidency,” Mr. Nixon was unable to prevail. And in this case, the ineptitude of White House opposition made things worse. Despite the lesson of the first amendment of Senator Robert Byrd, for instance, the Nixon forces repeated the mistake of backing a loser. The Byrd amendment, watering down the Cooper‐Church proposal, had tacit White House approval, if not outright endorsement, but still was defeated days ago. Then, in the last stages of the battle, Senator Robert Griffin produced another wateringdown amendment, this one to permit the Administration to pay for Thai or other foreign troops fighting in Cambodia. The minority leader, Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, said on the Senate floor that its adoption would go far toward removing Mr. Nixon's objections to the whole Cooper‐Church rider. The Senate nevertheless voted down the Griffin amendment, too. Mr. Scott's statement in support of the Griffin amendment strongly suggests that Mr. Nixon also has been hurt by the substance of the Senate's action. If authority to pay for foreign troops fighting in Cambodia would have substantially removed the Administration's objection to the Cooper‐Church rider, then it is plain that providing a proxy army—probably Thai—to support the Lon Nol Government is under active consideration. Under current authorizing and appropriating acts, Mr. Nixon has authority to pay for equipment and to provide allowances for Vietnamese and “other free world forces” in Vietnam; this covers, for instance, the Korean and Thai contingents. The President can also provide equipment and allowances for “local forces” in Laos and Thailand. But he has no specified authority to make such expenditures for foreign troops operating in Cambodia. Three Options Open Passage of the Cooper‐Church amendment leaves Mr. Nixon three options, if he persists in trying to obtain Thai forces for duty in Cambodia. He could let the Thais, out of their own deep commitment to the free world and to Cambodian integrity, pay their own expenses; but they have already made clear that this is no deal. An Alternative Risk Or the President could risk the wrath of the Senate and his Presidential credibility by clandestine transfers of other funds, even if he had no specific authority to hire a mercenary army to fight in Cambodia. This would go farther L secret dealings and arbitrary policy even than President Johnson went in his under‐the‐table financing of the Philippine contingent in Vietnam; Mr. Johnson at least had legislative authority to pay “free world forces in Vietnam,” even though he did not tell Congress that he was doing so. Finally—as backers’ of the Cooper‐Church amendment hope —the President could go to Congress with a straight‐forward proposal for financing the Thais, together with whatever facts he had to support the request. What the amendment means is that one house of Congress will not vote funds after the fact for a war extended to Cambodia by Presidential fiat; and it still takes two houses of Congress to make an appropriation.

HE more we earn, the less we work, the more we play, right? As work time approaches zero, play time ap proaches infinity right? Before too long, our days will be spen picking daisies, read ing books, cultivating ??urselves, right? And since a utopia of leis ??re seems not wholly undesirable, sane economic policy dictates that we go on increasing productivity, that we go on watching the gross‐national product indices in the fervent hope that they swell and burgeon. Right? No, wrong. Wrong, says the frazzled suburbanite racing from school to supermarket to train station to martini in the wagon her hus band spent last Sunday morning polishing at the sacrifice of a golf match or a sail. Wrong, says Swedish economist Staffan B. Linder in his little bombshell of an essay, “The Harried Leisure Class.” Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. The problem, according to Mr. Linder— an associate professor in the Stockholm School of Economics and member of the Swedish Parliament who has taught at Yale and Columbia—is that “economists typical ly regard consumption,” what one does when one is not engaged in production, “as an instantaneous act without temporal con sequence.” In conventional economics, there is “work time” and “free time,” and free time is regarded as infinitely elastic. Anyone who has ever felt restfully relieved to be back at his desk Monday morning knows that free time isn't so free. Mr. Linder attempts to explain why. “It is important to realize that consump tion requires time just as does production,” says Linder. “Such pleasures as a cup of coffee or a good stage play are not in fact pleasurable, unless we can devote time to enjoying them.” In fact, from the economic point of view, time is also a commodity. It is finite. It is subject to the laws of sup ply and demand. “It must be subject to the economic laws that prevail in the econ omist's universe.” If time is subject to economic laws, then it follows that “one tries to economize with one's time resources.” One tries to distrib ute them so as to maximize their yield. If you don't believe that, or find it too harshly materialistic, you may stop reading this review. If you do stop, you will have proved the point by judging it a waste of time. (That's Mr. Linder's ploy, not mine.) Now for the braintwister, somewhat oversimplified. If time is trapped in the irons of economic law, Mr. Linder argues, then it follows that the more valuable one's producing time becomes (i.e., the more one earns per unit of time spent producing), the more valuable one's consuming time becomes. And the “method of raising the yield on time used in consumption is to increase the amount of consumer goods to be enjoyed per time unit.” In other words, the man who used to spend his leisure time reading now uses his increased affluence to read on his yacht with his tape deck playing. Yachts and tape decks require servicing and maintenance. That takes time. Life gets more compli cated. Hence, the harried leisure class. I know. It doesn't seem strictly logical to conclude that a man is required by eco nomic law to consume more goods per time unit, regardless of how much more he may earn. There seems to be some sleight‐of hand there. But that's probably because I've missed something. Mr. Linder makes few concessions to the layman (or the Lehmann‐Haupt). is the way he puts it finally. And his prose reads as if it had been written in Swedish and then translated into English—which, in fact, it was. ?? Yet his conclusions do make sense, on both a grand and frivolous level. Time consuming activities that can't be greatly improved by the addition of goods—like eating and making love—do seem to be on the decline in the new industrial society. (Witness the leap in the birthrate that occurred nine months after New York's 1965 blackout.) Attitudes toward time do vary wildly among the rich nations and the poor, among the upper and lower classes. The bum in the park laughing up his rags at the hurrying businessman is no false stereotype. And the utopian vision of America's new leisure does not seem to be materializing. In spite of continuing economic growth, the average work week has not gotten any shorter since World War II, according to Mr. Linder's figures. And “various statistics aside, it seems reasonable to remain skep tical of the culture boom.” Indeed it does. “Economic growth subjects culture time to an increasing competition, and the time devoted to cultural exercises is probably declining.” But most important is his conclusion that if we continue to be bemused by “analyt ical tools” that “are unsuitable for the creation of any eschatological system of thought in economics,” “there will be a new form of economic ‘unfreedom,’ marked not by a fight for economic survival, but by an obsession with growth that sometimes forces us, in the name of registered in creases in economic growth, to allocate our economic resources, including time it self, in destructive ways—to destroy God given bases for life, i.e., air, water, earth, natural beauty and our own heredity.” “The Harried Leisure Class” seems to pro pose some essential additions to those tools.

499-> CASE OFFERS BILL TO DISCLOSE PACTS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2—Sen ator Clifford P. Case today in troduced legislation, first spon sored by conservatives 16 years ago, that would require the executive branch to transmit all international agreements to Congress. The New Jersey Republican argued in a Senate speech that this would eliminate much of the acrimony between Congress and the President over foreign policy responsibilities. At present, the President is required to submit treaties to the Senate for its approval. One complaint in Congress, particularly in the Senate For eign Relations Committee, is that increasingly the President has bypassed the treaty route by entering into secret agree ments and commitments with foreign countries without in forming Congress. A proposal similar to Senator Case”s was introduced in 1954 by Senator William F. Know land of California, a conserva tive Republican, as an alterna tive when the Bricker amend ment to the Constitution was rejected by the Senate. The Knowland bill was approved by the Senate in 1956 but died in the House. Now the proposal has been introduced by a Senator who is regarded as a liberal Repub lican and an internationalist. Between the conservatives of 15 years ago and the liberal internationalists of today there is a common concern over the President's ability to enter into foreign agreements without the consent or knowledge of Con gress. Just as the conservatives were worried during the long Senate fight over the Bricker amendment that the President would use his treaty‐making powers to override domestic laws, now the liberals are con cerned that the President will use his foreign policy powers to get the nation involved in foreign commitments and wars without the consent of Con gress. The constitutional amend ment offered by Senator John Bricker, Republican of Ohio, would have provided that a treaty or executive agreement would prevail as domestic law only through subsequent legis lation by Congress. The Case proposal is far more modest, providing only that all international agreements other than treaties must be trans mitted to the Senate and House within 60 days of their ex ecution. To a large extent, the Case proposal grows out of the ex perience of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Na tional Commitments, headed by Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri. During the course of its hear ings over the last two years, the Symington subcommittee has discovered that the Presi dent, without informing Con gress, has entered into under standings, commitments or agreements with foreign coun tries, such as a military con tingency plan with Thailand, pledge of support for the Ethiopian Government, and military aid for South Korea in return for sending troops to South Vietnam. As defined by Senator Case, his proposal would require the executive branch to inform Congress of any such agree ment or understanding with foreign government. He de fined an “international agree ment” as “any kind of agree ment, oral as well as written, tacit as well as expressed” that is “intended to induce a re liance by another government upon the United States.” His purpose, he explained was “not to clip the wings of the President” but “to broaden the scope of consultation be fore he involves us in certain foreign commitments.”

We all have our favorite ages. I have long thought that it would be very pleasant to be a fifth‐century (B. C.) Athenian, with a handful of Phoenician slaves to do the household chores and an uncomplaining wife to rear the kids. Rising early and shaking the dust of the slums off my feet, I'd wander off to the agora, take in a neat wrestling match or two in the stadium or watch a couple of stylish discoboli, and then, after a leisurely lunch and bath, listen to that old gadfly Socrates provide an afternoon's entertainment: “Tell me, Charm ides, is not readiness of the mind a sort of nimbleness of the soul . . . ?” If I were Charmides, I'd take my time answer ing that one. A man could live pretty decently in 18th century London, too, provided someone back home harvested the crop and paid rent on the ancestral acres. If the old pater had a government sinecure or two, that wouldn't hurt either. I'd get John Cleland to show me the sights. In be tween I'd loll around the coffeehouses and maybe catch the irascible Dr. Johnson turning on his young friend: “Sir, you have but two topics, yourself and me. I am sick of both.” Jack Finney has a favorite age, too, New York City in the eighteen‐eighties and out of his interests he has fashioned a fanciful novel, a blend of science fiction, nostalgia, mystery and acid commentary on supergovernment and its helots. The ingredients have not been entirely homog enized, and (to mix the metaphor a little), some of the joinery shows. But his book is an inviting and highly readable piece of seasonal entertainment. Si Morley, a painter who is only a cog in a large advertising agency, is tapped by the military for a highly secret project. After some testing and other huggermug ger, Si is let in on the thinking behind the enterprise. Suppose, the head of the operation tells him, suppose time is not a sequence but a simultaneity, with the past, present and future existing at the same instant. Time then, it is explained to him, would be like a river, the future a bend in the waterway to come, the past also a bend a little way back. Therefore if a way could be found to go back, a man could live as easily in the past as in the present. Of course, he would have no right to monkey with that past or become in volved with it or anything that could change the course of history. Si agrees to join the project and picks his own favorite period: New York City in 1882. There are reasons; they include mysterious and cryptic letter that was mailed in 1882 and a troubling death and funeral never convincingly explained. Si wants to locate the clues that will help clear up both the letter and the death. Working out of the famous Dakota apart ments on Central Park West, Si manages to make his way back to his chosen year, finds, the people he is after, and, contrary to orders, does get involved with them. The plot becomes more and more in voluted, the mysteries thicker, the solu tions more unexpected. The roster includes a blackmailing, a serious downtown fire (one that actually did take place), a murder and a genuine two‐reel cops and robbers chase. I must admit that I felt a mite cheated when Si and his eighteen‐eighty girl friend, trapped by a scoundrel, manage to escape by a handy manipulation of the time factor. That wasn't quite fair. However, when he gets back here (I guess that's right), Si discovers that once involved with these high‐level projects, it is not easy to become disengaged—not on one's own terms at any rate. Now that the military has managed to get a man where they want him, they wonder whether it would be feasible to tamper with history just enough to make the present lean a little more in their favor. (Suppose we had bought Cuba in the last century instead of setting it free, we wouldn't now have to worry about Rus sian missiles right off our coast, etc.) Si is asked to try, and his decision involves an ingenious twist to the story that puts its own stamp to the conclusion of the book and hoists the military on its own petard. But more than plot and plotters, what fascinates Si and his creator is old New York in its tangible form: the streets, the horse‐drawn carriages, the shops, lighting, food, all things bought and sold, every thing in short that conveys not what peo ple thought but how they lived. Mr. Fin ney's heart is really in this evocation of the past. He has meticulously worked out El routes, for example, and described shop by shop an area as it was then from 23d to 14th Street. He has assembled contem porary photographs and prints and has worked these illustrations into the text as if they were paragraphs in the book—a sample of mixed media in elementary but effective form. Every New Yorker ought to love it. Virtually all the ingredients of his fic tion are time tested and have proved out. The return to the past was a romantic device in “Berkeley Square,” the play by J. C. Squire and John L. Balderston, and if I'm not mistaken the same language about time and the river was used then in the movie version of the play. Never theless, Mr. Finney has turned all the elements to his own purposes and created a piece of nostalgic suspense that is not without its special poignancy.

503-> Controversial Israeli
JERUSALEM, Dec. 9—With a quick good‐by to his col leagues, the Israeli Minister of Defense hurried out of a Cabinet meeting a few Sun days ago on his way to some delicate negotiations deep in the Arab quarter of Old Jerusalem. His curtained olive‐aran sedan made its way through the narrow streets with dif ficulty. At the address the Minister, Moshe Dayan, and his bodyguard disappeared into the Arab house. Others at the Cabinet meet ing may have been thinking that day about the chances for peace talks with the Egyptians or the Jordanians —a subject that, indeed, took Mr. Dayan to the United States today—but he had set off then to see one of his favorite Arab antiquities dealers about the purchase of a new archeological find for his vast private collection. Whether it be a Mycenaean vase or a new plan for a cease‐fire with the United Arab Republic, the 55‐year old Mr. Dayan has an in triguing—if sometimes mad dening — style, unabashedly pursuing his own interests, stating his own mind, doing things his own way. He has become the most popular and the most con troversial man in Israeli pol itics. No estimate of what Israel is likely to do in any given situation can be com plete without consideration of the charisma—and the enigma—of Moshe Dayan. “Moshe is neither a hawk nor a dove,” said one of the old associates who cling to him with fervent loyalty and who endlessly try to explain the shifts and turns in subtle thought processes that Mr. Dayan chooses to keep ob scure. “He has a devout sense of Jewish history, of the Bible, of the Jewish destiny —but he has no ideology that gets in the way of his practical judgments.” Adamant in the belief that Israel must have secure, de fensible borders and not just return automatically to the pre‐1967 cease‐fire lineS, Mr. Dayan, an inactive lieutenant general, is struggling in the Cabinet to make negotiations as easy as possible for the Arab Governments. He is far more convinced than his col leagues that Cairo and Am man are truly ready to reach a settlement. Mr. Dayan is the architect of the low‐profile occupation policy in the territories‐ con quered in 1967, a policy maintained against strong criticism. At the same time he is opposed to present‐day conciliators who’ want to give local autonomy in those territories. It is only one of the ironies surrounding Mr. Dayan that, despite his years, he is con sidered a champion of the younger generation in Israeli politics, a modern man in the midst of the older ruling establishment. That surely stems from his pragmatic and familiar atti tude toward the Arab people in and around Israel—in sharp contrast to the more suspicious and rigid outlook of the Zionists who migrated here with views established afar and who still dominate public life. Moshe Dayan, born May 20,, 1915, was the second baby in the first kibbutz of Zionism, Degania, near the Sea of Galilee. Though he was sickly as a child, when he was a teen‐ager he worked beside his parents at farming, completing the per sonal credentials so desirable for an Israeli public figure. His military credentials were equally correct: trained in a British officers’ school, imprisoned by the British as a leader of the Jewish under ground in Palestine, released to fight with the British Army in World War II. During the Allied invasion of Syria he lost his left eye in action. The black patch and the barrack‐room repu tation as an enthusiastic womanizer remain to supply endearing’ color amid the drabness of Israeli politics. As Chief of Staff of the armed forces from 1953 to 1958, Mr. ‘Dayan supervised the swift Sinai campaign of 1956, gaining a military repu tation that stayed alive for 11 years while he dabbled in politics, as Minister of Agri culture from 1959 to 1964, then in ineffective opposition. Though Mr. Dayan seems to have mellowed in politics, he remains a loner. His few intimate friends are holdovers from his early army days, neighbors in the army suburb of Zahala, outside Tel Aviv, where his three children grew up—Yael, a successful novel ist, Assaf, an actor, and Ehud, who stayed in the family tra dition of farming. His wife, Ruth, is active in the field of Arab‐Israeli cultural re lations. What next? “Of course Moshe is ambitious —what what would he be doing in politics if he weren't?” an old army friend said. “But he is far too impatient, go around flattering people or currying favor with so‐called important people. If he gets to the top, it will be on his own terms.” Even his most fervent ad mirers are divided on two questions: Will he become the next Premier? If he makes it, will he be a good one? Even his most outspoken opponents—there are few in Israel who are neutral about him—keep a close watch on his moves and pay heed to his views.

504-> Nixon to Issue ‘New, Clear Policy’ on Accepting Political Refugees
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2—The White House said today that President Nixon would set forth a “new, clear policy” on politi cal refugees to prevent recur rence of the incident last week in which the United States Coast Guard refused sanctuary to a Lithuanian sailor. Ronald L. Ziegler, the White House press secretary, said the new policy would be issued after the President studied final report of the incident. The report was presented to him late today by the State Depart ment and Department of Trans portation. Even before the report ar rived, Mr. Ziegler said, the President—after reviewing pre liminary reports of the inci dent off Martha's Vineyard, Mass., on Nov., 23—described “the whole matter as ‘outrage ous.’” Other Administration sources characterized the President's reaction to the events even more strongly. One official said that when Mr. Nixon learned of the incident, nearly a week after it happened, he expressed anguish that it would be interpreted outside the United States as a sign that Americans were losing their moral fiber and resolve. The President's dissatisfaction was echoed by Congress, where a House foreign affairs subcom mittee announced it would open hearings on the incident tomor row. The rejection of the asylum request appeared to be without precedent. A State Department spokesman said he could not recall an earlier case in which a person with “clear grounds” for defection had been denied sanctuary. The spokesman also said, however, that he knew of no other attempt at defection that involved American and Soviet ships tied together. The President asked the State and Transportation Depart ments on Monday for a report of the incident, which took place when the Coast Guard cutter Vigilant and a Soviet trawler were linked with haw sers for talks on North At lantic fishing rights between representatives of the two nations’ fishing industries. The White House did not say what was in the report, but Administration sources djs closed that the sailor, Simas Kudirka, 35 to 40 years old, was a radio operator aboard the Soviet vessel. According to the sources, he gave officials of the Coast Guard cutter several documents prov ing his identity, including photograph of himself, and radio messages from his family, The Lithuanian sailor leaped from the Soviet vessel to the cutter and pleaded for asylum, but after eight hours, it was reported last weekend, Soviet crewmen were permitted to come aboard the United States ship and forcibly return the sailor to their own craft. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Chester R. Bender, subsequently said that the decision to return the sailor had been made by Rear Adm. William B. Ellis, Commander of the First Coast Guard District. Admiral Bender also said that, the Soviet captain had accused the sailor of having stolen the ‘equivalent of $2,000 from the ship's funds. As he had on Monday, Mr. Ziegler said that the President was “extremely disturbed” over the handling of the incident by United States officials and would take “appropriate ac tion.” He declined to specify whether the White House would seek to pinpoint blame. On the basis of the prelimi nary reports it was clear, Mr. Ziegler said, that “the proce dures followed were inadequate and the action taken inade quate and the judgments used were bad.” The State Department indi cated earlier that at least part of the difficulty lay in the vagueness of the standing in structions for receiving would be defectors, particularly at sea. As a general rule, the de partment's spokesman said, United States officials ap proached by potential refugees are supposed to check with higher authority. At the State Department, a spokesman insisted there had been no change in United States policy regarding refu gees and expressed pride that more than a million people had been granted asylum since World War I|. Mr. Ziegler said that there had been, to his knowledge, no protest to the Soviet Union. Asked what had happened to the seaman, Mr. Ziegler said he did not know but “we ‘would be curious” to find out.

505-> Head of Legal Aid Unit for Poor Here Scores O.E.O. Dismissals
John DeWitt Gregory, chief counsel and executive director of Community Action for Legal Services, charged yesterday that the dismissal of Washing ton officials heading the national program dedicated to supplying free services to the poor was part of “an alarming attempt to subject lawyers representing the poor to local political pressures.” Mr. Gregory made his charge in a statement in which he announced he was resigning from the agency, which op erates in the city, effectivel next June 30. But he stressed that his decision to resign had been made before the “recent political upheavals” in the national legal services program. The 39‐year‐old Harvard Law School graduate was al luding to the Nov. 20 dismissal by Donald Rumsfeld, director of the Office of Economic Op portunity, of Terry F. Lenzner as director of the O.E.O. legal services program for the poor, and of Frank N. Jones as deputy director. Mr. Rumsfeld said he had acted because the two were “either unwilling or unable” to carry out his policies and be cause Mr. Lenzner had exceeded his authority. But Mr. Lenznerl and a number of legal organ izations accused the Nixonl Administration of sacrificing the needs of the poor to po litical interests. Critics of Mr. Rumsfeld also charged that regulations he had issued were designed to make legal services personnel and and some of the program's processes subject to approval by regional O.E.O. directors. “Regional directors would be much more susceptible to po litical pressures than lawyers,” Mr. Gregory asserted. `When we see politics rear its ugly head in Washington, we don't know how far it will go. I find the prospect frightening.” Mr. Gregory who has been chief counsel and executive director of C.A.L.S. since its founding in October, 1967, said it was a “taxing job” and he had decided some time ago “to do something else.” He is to join Hofstra University's School of Law at Hempstead, L. I., Sept. 1 as an associate pro fessor. The agency consists of a cen tral corporation at 335 Broad way and 10 operating corpora tions that have maintained law offices serving 26 designated poverty areas in this city. About 200 lawyers are em ployed in the city. Mr. Gregory said that some of the 26 offices were being combined because his agency was not getting sufficient funds from the O.E.O. “to maintain even our present inadequate services to the poor.” He said the O.E.O. was allocating only $4.3‐million to it for the current year even though it had asked for $4.8‐million. “We ought to be spending more, and not less, to see that poor people really do get equal justice in our courts,” he said.

506-> Observer: A Blue‐Ribbon Investigation
WASHINGTON, July 1—After the President's expansion of the.war into Cambodia had created intense controversy throughout the country, President Nixon announced that he would look into the Cambodian invasion at the end of June and report to the people. We now have President Nixon's findings and they completely justify the President's decision to invade Cambodia in the first place. The Nixon report does not say so in as many words, but it strongly suggests that the President's Cambodian venture was the first truly inspired project undertaken by the West during the last eighteen or twenty years of the Indochina war. The report, coming from such a distinguished American as President Nixon, seems likely to squelch war critics who have been calling the Cambodian affair a major Presidential blunder. Doves Eat Crow Persons who had said that critics of the operation would have egg on their chins or would have to eat crow when the Cambodian campaign had been reported upon appear to have been correct. Every restaurant in Washington was besieged today by humiliated doves eating crow in the wake of President Nixon's report. Senator McGovern, eating a plate of Southern fried crow in the Senate dining room, said the Nixon report left him feeling so wrong that he intended to place some egg on his chin after dessert on account of having once said that the invasion indicated incompetence in the White House. Background Report President Nixon, the man whose investigation and report confirmed the wisdom of the President's policy, was not available to interviewers today. One of his staff assistants agreed, however, to answer questions provided his identity were withheld. The aide — let's call him Smith—said that, yes, President Nixon had always realized that he would be under intense pressure from the White House to bring in a favorable report on the Cambodian venture. “President Nixon realized when he took on the study that reporting on a Presidential policy decision of such a controversial nature would place him in a very delicate position,” Smith said. “President Nixon knew that if he found the President's policy a disaster, he would be vulnerable to bitter criticism from the Administration. He also knew that a favorable finding on the President's policy would probably outrage the doves.” Smith was asked why President Nixon, knowing all this, had agreed to get involved with the report. “When the President first asked him to do the report,” Smith said, “President Nixon said it was out of the question.” “What changed his mind?” “The President told him there was no one else in the country to whom he could turn with complete confidence.” Smith said that before President Nixon took on the assignment, however, he insisted on one condition. “What was that?” “He wanted to be assured that the Army would give him all the information it wanted him to have.” The President hesitated at this point. He explained to President Nixon that the Army had various sorts of information to give investigators. On any given operation, for example, it had information proving that the campaign had been brilliantly successful, as well as information proving that it would require just one more surgically precise operation to turn the corner. By giving the Army freedom to supply the President information of its own choice, the President noted, President Nixon might very well come up with a report indicating that one more surgically precise operation would be essential to success in Cambodia. Presidential Solution Since he was already committed to withdrawing American troops by June 30, the President explained to President Nixon, that sort of report would be misleading in a most embarrassing way. “I see,” said President Nixon. “Well, if there is one thing won't be associated with, it's misleading report. “In that case,” the President suggested, “why don't we tell the Army simply to give you all the information I want you to have?” “By George, you've got it!” President Nixon cried. “I think you've got it!” Was the President pleased with President Nixon's report? “What he told me,” Smith said, “was, ‘I'd like that fellow to do all my reports.”

507-> Chicago Symphony Opens Ravinia
CHICAGO, July 1—History may wonder what strange compulsions drove the American people, not notably an art‐worshiping race, to search endlessly for the acoustically perfect symphonic hall, like medieval alchemists in their search for the philosopher's stone. One more chapter in the story of the hunt for the acoustical chimera has been written here, with the reopening of a remodeled and face‐lifted outdoor music pavilion at the Ravinia Festival, and judging from last night's concert in the pavilion by the Chicago Symphony, Orchestra, the Ravinia structure approaches the American dream more nearly than any recently built outdoor facility that one has experienced at first ear. Visually, the pavilion stage is striking, though more debatable, presenting a vista of translucent Plexiglas, acoustical panels that bathe the stage in fluorescent light and affront the audience's eyes. The lighting esthetic might seem to have been suggested by a modern 50‐pump service station. But the stage has been widened and deepened; audience capacity has been increased by 330 seats to 3,259; a pit seating 85 musicians has been installed and an air‐conditioned backstage area now offers dressing and lounging facilities that would meet or beat those of many major indoor symphony halls. The pavilion is the work of the architectural firm of John A. Holabird and Christopher Jaffe, the sound consultant. As part of their rethinking they removed the “clouds” that had been installed some years ago by the acoustical expert then entrusted with Ravinia's sound. A clear gain, that. The concert of Russian music led by Okko Kamu, a 24‐year‐old Finnish conductor making his American debut, did not offer the ultimate in performing conditions. The day had been one of those equatorial nightmares that Chicago's weathermen seem to enjoy cooking up for unwary visitors. Expressway pavement buckled under 94degree heat, and stalled cars littered highways in scenes reminiscent of Godard's “Weekend.” Mr. Kamu, a scraggily bearded blond, conducted Tchaikovsky's “Pattietique” Symphony in a black tuxedo and white turtle‐neck, as if he were home in Helsinki. No doubt the brain‐frying conditions chopped deeply into his efficiency and that of the orchestra. Still, the young Finn (who took first prize in the first Von Karajan conducting competition) did well enough to indicate that he is one of those highly talented maestros who have been pushed forward too fast for his own good. Flamboyant in podium manner, but plainly musical, Mr. Kamu struck one as brilliant, though not yet good. He also conducted the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2 in which he was mispaired with Michel Bloch, the pianist. The soloist's attempt to paint the concerto in delicate pastels did not accord well with Mr. Kamu's more heavily inflected ideas and his outgoing interpretation. But the pavilion, while it could not balance a soggy piano with this orchestra's sonorous outpourings, did reinforce one's impression that the Chicago Symphony can stand comparison with any in the world. Mr.,Kamu disregarded one old injunction: Never encourage the brass or the percussion. But the orchestra's tone was full and homogeneous, and the ear could also go deeply into the textures and pick out details that one does not expect to hear in outdoor concerts. The Ravinia Festival's manager, Edward Gordon, said that a capital‐fund drive with a $2.2‐million goal (first in the festival's 35season history) had already passed the $1.6‐million mark.

508-> Another Piece of Moon Missing at Space Lab
WASHINGTON, July 1 —The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has reported that another piece of the moon is missing. A small gray fragment of lunar rock brought back last year by the Apollo 11 astronauts has disappeared from a laboratory at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. It is not yet known whether it was stolen or simply mislaid. The fragment is a quarter of an inch long and weighs two one.,hundredths of an ounce, according to an announcement today by the space agency. The loss was discovered during an inventory of samples last we4k. It is the second piece of lunar material lost since Apollo 11 returned to earth with about 48½ pounds of the substance. The first missing piece, which was stolen at an exhibition, was recovered.

511-> F.B.I. INVESTIGATES RECORDED MESSAGE
WASHINGTON, July 1 (AP) —The Justice Department today ordered an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into a recorded telephone message suggesting that antiwar Senators ought to be “shot between the eves.” The American Nazi party, now the National Socialist White Peoples party, lists Senators George S. McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, J. W. Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas, and Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, as the vanguard of treason and says they should all be shot. “McGovern, Fulbright, Hatfield, the whole rotten bunch, need a bullet right between the eyes,” says the “white power message” available to those who dial a number at the party's headquarters in nearby Arlington, Va. The Justice Department said Senator McGovern had asked it to investigate. A federal law imposes a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 for “whoever transmits in interstate commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another.”

513-> Median Barrier Installed on Bridge
The first section of a 32 inch‐high steel median barrier, designed to prevent head‐on collisions on the eight‐lane upper level of the George Washington Bridge, was low ered into place yesterday. It will replace the low con crete barriers that separated the two central lanes from the three lanes on either side of the span over the Hudson River. The old arrangement permitted the Port of New York Authority to switch the pattern from four lanes in each direction to three or five lanes depending on changing traffic loads between New York and New Jersey. “We are sacrificing flexi bility to safety,” a Port Au thority spokesman said. In 1969, three persons in a car entering the bridge from Manhattan were killed when a sideswiped truck going the other way jumped into the car's path. In 1966, one per son died in a car struck by another that was going in the opposite direction. No overall fatality records are kept. Last year's bridge traffic averaged nearly 200.000 ve hicles a day, nearly 20,000 of them buses. The Schiavone Construc tion Company of Secaucus, N.J., has the $1.73‐million contract for the steel barriers, specially made by Standard Steel Sections, Inc., of the Bronx, and for the concrete barriers on the approaches. The steel barriers are de signed to add as little weight as possible to the bridge. The job is to be completed by early November, in ad vance of wintry driving con ditions. The lower deck of the bridge has only three lanes in each direction, with a median Strip two lanes wide, and pre sents no problem, the author ity spokesman said.

The merged corporation will issue 1.58 shares of its common stock for each of the 2,436,000 outstanding shares of Bush Universal and one share of its common stock for each of the 1,406,000 shares of Hamil ton Watch publicly held. Hamil ton is a leading maker of wrist and pocket watches.

515-> Show at the Modern Raises Questions
“Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina policy be a reason for you not to vote for him in November?” This question —not the sort one is usually invited to entertain in an art exhibition—is, quite literally, the first question a visitor to the new “Information” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art is asked to consider. The exhibition, organized by Kynaston McShine, associate curator of the museum's Department of Painting and Sculpture, is said to be “an international report on recent activity of young artists.” It opens to the public today. The poll of museum visitors on Mr. Rockefeller's political popularity is part of no, come to think of it, it's the whole of—the contribution of Hans Haacke, a German‐born artist who has lived in New York for some years, to the “Information” show. A transparent plexiglass box is provided for the “Yes” and “No” ballots. Yesterday, at the preview for museum members, the “Yes” votes were slightly more numerous than the “No” pile. This, presumably, is the bit of information Mr. Haacke wishes to convey to us. After Mr. Haacke's poll, the visitor encounters an “information machine,” otherwise called a “visual jukebox,” provided by the Olivetti Corporation. This round structure contains 40 individual screens through which one can view films ranging from the merely boring to the thoroughly stupefying. This is information? So, at least, it pleases the museum to allege. Beyond this point, I am not sure I can give a very accurate or coherent account of what the visitor to this exhibition is invited to look at, listen to, sit down on, clamber over, go to sleep in, write on, stand in front of, read, and otherwise connect with. There are a great many blowups of junky photographic materials, much written matter, same green telephones on which one can dial‐a‐poem, documents — photographic and otherwise—of earthworks, all manner of facetious games, much in the way of Xeroxography, closed‐circuit television on which the visitor can view himself, on delayed tape, answering various questions, and a table of political pamphlets denouncing war, racism, etc. The exhibition is, in its way, amusing and amazing, but only because it upholds an attitude one had scarcely thought worth entertaining: an attitude toward the artistic process that is so overweeningly intellectual that it is, in its feeble results, virtually mindless. Here all the detritus of modern printing and electronic communications media has been transformed by an international gaggle of demi‐intellectuals into a low grade form of show business. It leaves one almost nostalgic for a good old‐fashioned hand‐made happening. What, you may well wonder, is politics doing in this potpourri of mind‐flattening gags, gimmicks and games? Is this the politicalization of art we have of late been hearing so much about? Pos sibly, but I doubt it. For what we are offered here is, if anything, a development even worse to contemplate than the politicalization of art—it is the estheticizing of political cliches. Having trivialized the very concept of art, the exhibition takes perhaps the next logical step by ingesting a large diet of serious social and political issues and transforming them into a waste product of esthetic trifles. There are more than 150 artists — or “artists” — from 15 countries represented in the “Information” show. Clearly, the disturbance in the esthetic atmosphere they represent is something that needs to be noticed. But there is a fundamental contradiction involved in devoting a large museum exhibition to a phenomenon that is, in its essence, a polemic against the whole concept of museum art and the museumization of art. It is too much, I suppose, to expect the Museum of Modern Art to recognize this fact, for such recognition might lead to a calamitous conclusion, namely, that there are just conceivably some esthetic fashions that have not earned the right to be given museum hospitality. What a radical ideal! Certainly too radical for the museum to contemplate. What this unhappy development really represents is a yearning to be delivered from the problems and complexities of modern industrial civilization. For all its indulgence in the paraphernalia of technology and communications systems, this so‐called “Information” movement is nothing but an ill‐conceived attempt to turn modern technological culture into a form of pastoral. It is, in other words, the latest species of esthetic escapism—in this case, an escape from mind itself. It would be lamentable even if it were not so egregiously boring, but in the end it is the sheer weight of its boredom that is most repellent.

516-> Jazzmobile Begins Season in Harlem on a High Note
It may have gone unnoticed in the rest of the boroughs, but yesterday was Jazzmobile Day in Manhattan, and in honor of the occasion Harlem rocked to some of the hottest jazz this side of Basin Street. Billy Taylor and Friends provided the music, but the Harlem community provided the color and zest for the one‐hour jazz festival that kicked off the Jazzmobile's sixth annual summer series of free concerts. Before the summer is over, the Jazzmobile will have visited all five boroughs, providing two concerts a day, 80 for the season. Neighborhood people began arriving early in front of the Baptist House of Prayer at 126th Street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues. Sign Greets Anniversary Several youngsters hung a sign on a building across the street: “Happy 6th Anniversary Jazzmobile.” Hundreds of balloons with the Jazzmobile legend on them had been distributed by the Chemical Bank of New York, a co‐sponsor of the event with the Coca‐Cola Company. In the open street, they floated motionless over the heads of the sweltering crowd. A hot dog vendor did a brisk trade along the street, and pretty girls in bright bandanas and dashikis sipped soft drinks in the hot sun. But there wasn't a Coca‐Cola in sight. As the temperature rose, one young man turned to another, wiped his hand across his brow, and said: “Man, the Coke people sure blew it.” About 400 people were on hand when the Jazzmobile drove into the street, about 40 minutes later than its scheduled 1 P. M. arrival. The crowd didn't seem to mind. Friends Come Through For the next hour, the audience was treated to some fine jazz by Mr. Taylor and Friends, the friends being Kenny Barron, on piano, Billy Hartman on trumpet, Frank Foster on tenor saxophone, Earl May on bass, Al Hartwood on drums, Benny Powell on trombone, and Buck Clark on conga drums. Mr. Taylor, musical director for “The David Frost Show” on television and president of Jazzmobile, doubled as host and pianist. There was also music by 40 neighborhood youngsters from Jazzmobile's music workshop held Saturdays at I.S. 201 in Harlem. The workshop is one of several projects carried on throughout the year by Jazzmobile. The two co‐sponsors contributed $40,000 to this year's project. Other contributors are the New York Council on the Arts and the Mayor's Urban Affairs Project.

517-> MORTON THREATENS SUIT AGAINST C.B.S.
WASHINGTON, July 9 (AP)—The Republican National Chair man has threatened to sue if the Columbia Broadcasting Sys tem does not answer promptly his demand for free air time to reply to Democratic broadcasts. In a telegram to C.B.S. the chairman, Representative Rog ers C. B. Morton of Maryland, charged last night that the net work had abandoned journal istic judgments by not policing the format and content of an equal‐time broadcast by Law rence F. O'Brien, the Demo cratic National Chairman. “This ‘show amounted to an unprecedented, inaccurate, per sonal attack on the President of the United States; yet your network promoted it as a ‘pub lic service,’ “ Mr. Morton said in a telegram to Dr. Frank Stan ton, president of C.B.S. Mr. O'Brien, commenting on Mr. Morton's move, urged that Mr. Morton “join us in our request to the Federal Com munications Commission for rule under the fairness doctrine that would require networks and broadcasters to seek out opposition party response to all Presidential telecasts and broad casts Such a ruling, Mr. O'Brien said, “will be to his benefit when the Democrats‐are back in the White House.”

519-> Film: 'Boatniks' Opens at Ziegfeld:Robert Morse Is Star of a Marina Tale Phil Silvers Appears as a Comedy Thief
I've never seen a good movie about boating. Except for a few moments of Polanski's "Knife in the Water" and the lovely flotilla of Cal 20's that Preminger uses during the closing credits of "Skidoo," I've almost never seen anything good about boating in a movie. And in general, despite world-shattering advances in the art and politics of the cinema, movie boating remains at the level of that 30-year-old masterpiece (I forget the name) in which Bette Davis takes her sloop into a storm and sails through several complete circles without ever jibing or coming about.Norman Tokar's "The Boatniks," which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld, isn't a good movie about boating, and it doesn't really try to be. It isn't good situation comedy either, though it does try to be. The only advantage of its assumed subject (weekend boating) and particular locale (Newport Beach and Balboa, a crowded southern California yachting inferno) is that there are a lot of small boats to look at to help you pass the time between the depositing and the withdrawal of each verbal or visual gag."The Boatniks" concerns a young Coast Guard ensign (Robert Morse) who does nothing right but who nevertheless wins a beautiful marina maiden (Stefanie Powers) and foils the overwater and underwater escape plans of three comic jewel thieves (Phil Silvers, Norman Fell and Mickey Shaughnessy).Along the way, he also enrages his commander (Don Ameche), resists the profferred temptations of an aging playboy (Wally Cox) and his sybaritic power cruiser, and alternately sinks and swims—always with the aim of provoking the nervous laughter that in the view of the amusement brokers seems to pass for good clean fun.I'm sure that good, or at least bearable, movies have been made along the lines of "The Boatniks," and probably with casts less competent than this rather attractive one. The trouble is not that Phil Silvers' dialogue, for example, consists 98 per cent of one-liners, but that they are such dull one-liners, so obvious and without sustaining wit.And the young lovers, who never make love; and the plot windfalls, which rarely make sense—like the many humorless vignettes and all the plastic pleasure craft on Newport Bay—point toward that moment in mass production when the forms are still imitated, but the spirit has been lost.

520-> Coca‐Cola Will Improve Status Of Its Migrant Farm Workers
WASHINGTON, July 24 (AP) —The president of one of the largest orange juice processors, Coca‐Cola, condemned today the treatment of its migrant farm workers. He told a Senate subcommittee that his company would improve the workers' lot. The goal, said J. Paul Austin, is to transform the migratory work force into a stable, year‐ round group with the same fringe benefits as other Coca Cola employes — health insur ance vacations and job security. Mr. Austin said an N.B.C. documentary last week correct ly painted the housing and working conditions of migrants as deplorable. But he said the farm workers' crusade in Cali fornia had prompted him in 1968 to investigate Cocal‐Cola's own Florida workers. When he found them as bad or worse off than those in Cali fornia, he ordered long‐range plans prepared into said these would be put into effect in Sep tember and he completed in sev en years. The N.B.C. documentary was criticized by a Florida grower. George H. Wedgworth of Belle Glade, and he drew a rebuke from Senator Walter F. Mon sale, Democrat of Minnesota, chairman of the migratory labor subcommittee. Mr. Wedgworth contended the show was biased and that it ig nored what he called substan tial improvement in the mi grants' lot. He also deplored the entrance of outsiders to film the show. “What kind of help is it when you show someone calling mi grants bums?” Mr. Wedgworth asked. Senator Mondale flushed and interrupted: “In the do cumentary, wasn't this a young child who said—of himself—he was a bum? What kind of a system is it that pro duces that reaction?” Banging his fist on the table, Senator Mondale told Mr. Wedgworth, “That is a child whose life is being mangled— and I'd like to hear some ex pression of concern from you about that.” Mr. Wedgworth said nothing and Mr. Mondale continued: “How do you explain Coca Cola? They found their own conditions deplorable. Are they outsiders?” When Mr. Wedgworth still said nothing, Mr. Mondale asked if he or the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative or the fruit and vegetable growers would sup port unemployment insurance for migrants, or higher wages. Mr. Wedgworth said he would have to look at proposals first.

521-> Citizens Committee for. Broadcasting is Moving
The National Citizens Com mittee for Broadcasting, a citi zens’ group that has been one of commercial broadcasting's more consistent gadflies, is moving to Washington, where the ongoing change in its stance from public to legal ad vocate will become more ap parent. The change of scenery from New York to Washington indi cates, according to sources within the committee, a grad ual lessening of the role of Thomas P. F. Having, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the committee's chair man. Mr. Hoving, outspoken in his criticism of commercial broadcasters, has been accused even by his admirers of “shoot ing from the hip.” One source at the committee, however, said yesterday that the physical move to Washing ton may put distance between Mr. Hoving and the committee,) but denied that this in any way downgraded Mr. Hoving's par ticipation. He said the reverse would be true, with the new executive director, Warren Braren, “doing the research in the areas we have been active in that will give Tom something to bite on.” Nevertheless, it is a fact that Mr. Hoving, months ago told the committee's board that he intended to give up his chairmanship, but was per suaded to stay on, because of the public drawing power of his name and presence. Mr. Braren, former manager of the New York office of the National Association of Broad casters Code Authority, is said to be less inclined to shoot ahead with public pronounce ments than was his predecesor, Ben Kubasik, and more inclined toward educational’ and re search programs. Mr. Braren has been functioning with the committee for several‐weeks, but formally moved into its of fices here yesterday. I Mr. Braren and the rest of the committee staff will move to Washington within a few weeks, it was learned, to join office space, research staffs) and common cause with Albert H. Kramer's Citizens Communi cations Center. Mr. Kramer, although he has been in accord with the citizens committee on most‐‐issues, pre fers the route of legal petition, rather than public oratory. It is expected that Mr. Kramer will devote most of his time to the law, allowing the committee to do research for him. On the other hand, the citizens com mittee has no full ‐ time legal arm, although one of its board members; Earl K. Moore, does legal work for it. So Mr. Kra mer's half of the trade will be to contribute his knowledge of law. “We're not talking about merger of the citizens commit tee with the Citizens Communi cations Center,” a source in the citizens committee said, ‘nor are we talking about one Organization being submerged. What we are talking about is combining management func tions. Both of our budgets are :fight. We'll both be helped by )ur consolidation.” The names of both groups will be retained. Another indication of the di rection being taken by the citi zens committee has been the expansion of its hoard over the last few months. The Rev. Everett Parker, director of the office of communications for the United Church of Christ, and Mrs. Peggy Charren, secre tary of Action for Children's Television, have been added recently. Both the United Church of Christ, through Mr. Parker, and A.C.T., have • petitioned for broadcasting reforms through the Federal Communications Commission and through the courts. It is further reported that the well‐known American Broadcasting Company corre spondent, Edward P. Morgan, will join the citizens commit tee's board, perhaps as early as this week. No president has been se lected as yet. Kenneth A. Cox, former F.C.C. commissioner is said to have refused the post, as did the former Newsday pub lisher, Bill Moyers. A source said that there would be no president at least for the near future, with Mr. Braren func tioning as the N.C.C.B.'s execu tive face, and Mr. Hoving as its articulate spokesman. Mr. Braren. despite a reputa tion for thoroughgoing re search. is also adept at public pronouncement. Less than two months ago, at a television con ference in Boston, he severely attacked the N.A.B. and its Television Code. He said: “Sure, the association talks about ‘the need for research in each successive testimony on Capitol Hill, but it tactfully avoids any commitment of re sources. “Their orientation is to the marketplace. pure and simple. Truth to them • is a business truth—one of economics. It is to this end that one .must al ways return when broadcasters talk about freedom. the First Amendment, the public interest, and their own Radio and Tele vision Codes.” Mayor Lindsay acted as nar rator yesterday for the first of a series of nine presentations of Charles Dickens's “A Christ mas Carol,” at the Beacon Theatre, 74th Street and Broad way. The show, produced by the Robert F. Kennedy Theater for children for the last four years, will be narrated by others in subsequent perform ances.

522-> Bullets Top 76ers, 112‐111
BALTIMORE, Jan. 24 (AP)— The Baltimore Bullets scored the final 5 points of the game tonight, the last a free throw by Mike Davis with 19 seconds left, and beat the Philadelphia 76ers. 112‐111. The 76ers overcame an 18‐ point Baltimore lead in the first half and scored 11 consecutive points to go ahead, 111‐107, with 1:02 remaining. But Earl Monroe sank a field goal for the Bullets and then fed Wes Unseld for the tying basket with 33 seconds remain ing. After Gus Johnson rebounded a shot by Archie Clark, Davis was fouled and made good on one of two attempts. Clark and Hal Greer, who led both teams with 35 points, both missed shots for Philadelphia in the closing seconds. ??

523-> Long‐Moribund Insurance Plan For Poor‐Area Investment Stirs
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Sept. 23—A long‐moribund plan for an international system of insurance for private investment in the less‐developed countries has suddenly come to life. Both public speeches at the annual meet ing here of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or World Bank, and private assessments by officials involved indicate that there is now a fair chance that the plan can be negotiated. The big change in the situa tion was the expression of sup port by the United States—first by President Nixon in his mes sage to Congress on foreign aid last week and then yester day here by the Secretary of the Treasury, David M. Ken nedy. The official name of the new plan is the International Invest ment Insurance Agency, with the World Bank in charge of negotiating the details. In the end, if negotiations succeed, the articles of agreement of the insurance plan will ba sub mitted to nations as a treaty. Mr. Kennedy said yesterday, “We urge early agreement to proceed with an International Investment Insurance Agency, and I hope that it will have support from both investing countries and developing coun tries.” What will probably prove to be the crucial issue is whether enough of the poor countries are willing to join the plan, which means contributing some small share of the insurance payments when a claim is es tablished by a private company. While the leading industrial countries now support the plan, some of them have made their adherence firmly condi tional on participation by the less‐developed countries in the financial risk involved. Some of the poorer countries resist this. It would mean, for example, that Indonesia would have to pay something if Peru seized an American company and did not pay adequate com pensation. The amount would be very small, but the princi ple is important—both to some industrial countries and to some less‐developed countries. Several of the poorer coun tries gave their support to the plan in speeches at the annual meeting here, but there was no generalized support. The insurance would com pensate against expropriation, war and the lack of converti bility of earnings into usable currencies. Many of the industrial coun tries, including the United States, already have insurance plans of their own to promote investment in the less‐devel oped countries. United States officials said today that a multi national plan would be pref erable, both for political rea sons and to reduce the poten tial cost of the United States Treasury if an American com pany were expropriated. The idea of such insurance has been discussed for years and the Organization for Eco nomic Cooperation and Devel opment proposed a plan sever al years ago. Some leaders of United States industry par ticipated in drawing up the plan. Its basic aim is to foster more private investment, though no one here holds out hope for dramatic results, if the plan were to be agreed upon. Yugoslavia Urges Aid to Poor COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Sept. 23 (AP) — Yugoslavia's Secretary for Finance, Janko Smole, urged today at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund here more aid to poor countries. Yugoslavia, the only Com munist country among 116 na tions represented at the meet ing, gave her support to the poorer countries wishing to use the Special Drawing Rights (S.D.R.'s) issued by the I.M.F. as a form of aid for them selves. But Mr. Smole added cautiously that this would not compromise the aim for which this “paper gold” was created — to add to nations’ monetary reserves and help the growth of world trade. He also urged that the World Bank give some attention to helping poor countries finance their exports.

524-> SCHOOL LIBRARIAN ASKS FEDERAL AID
DETROIT, July 1 — Almost half of the nation's 92,000 elementary schools lack adequate library facilities because they cannot afford to hire trained personnel, the American library Association was told today. “The Federal Government must provided funds not only for the purchase of materials but for personnel and adequate facilities that are still lacking in so many schools,” said Roberta E. Young. library director of the Colorado State Department of Education. Mrs. Young, who is the new president of the American Association of School Librarians, said that the Administration's educational reform bill had made $80‐million available for the acquisition of books and other materials for school libraries in 1970, almost double last year's amount. “The problem we face now is who is going to catalogue the new books, who is going to teach the children where to find them and how to use them,” she said. She spoke informally during a luncheon honoring the winners of the 1970 Encyclopaedia Britannica School Library Awards at the 89th annual convention of the American Library Association, which is being held this week in Detroit. In announcing the awards, Charles E. Swanson, president of Encyclopedia Britannica, said “millions of American youngsters are being denied the opportunity of quality education because their elementary schools lack libraries.” “Since 1963 there have been many forces palling attention to the important and essential role which the school library plays in a program of quality education,” he added. “Yet, there are still about 40,000 taxsupported elementary school buildings without adequate library facilities or services.” The expanding educational role of school libraries, particularly in disadvantaged areas, was stressed this morning in a panel discussion by ?? Harriett D. Brown, librarian of the Ocean Hill‐Brownsville School District in Brooklyn. She told of devices used by the library program to attract students, most of them blacks and Puerto Ricans. They included karate clubs, courses in photography, film showings and readings to music. Next Monday, she said, the school will begin a summerlong program in which authors and illustrators of children's books will visit the neighborhood in teams to tell stories to youngsters in the hope of keeping alive their interest in the school library. She said that the program would be financed by a grant from the Council for Interracial Books, a private organization in New York. Genevieve Casey of the department of library science at Wayne State University, Detroit, gave a report on behalf of the association's library education division. The report urged new efforts to recruit students with backgrounds in sociology, anthropology and psychology for library programs for disadvantaged children instead of limiting the field to specialists in library science.

528-> Aaron Zeroes In on 3,000th Hit
ATLANTA, May 9 (AP)—Henry Louis Aaron, on the threshold of one of base ball's greatest achievements, says, “I only hope it's a clean hit.” He's talking about the 3,000th hit of his major league career. Aaron entered a weekend series against the St. Louis Cardinals needing 12 hits to reach the magic mark and become only the ninth player in history to do so. The list includes eight Hall of Famers, and the superstar of the Atlanta Braves virtually assured a spot in the Coopers town museum when he becomes eligible for induction. Ty Cobb heads the list with 4,191 hits, followed by Stan Musial with 3,630, Tris Speaker, 3,515, Honus Wagner 3,430, Eddie Collins 3,311, Nap Lajoie 3,251, Paul Waner 3,152 and Cap Anson 3,081. However, The Hammer would be the first player ever with 3,000 hits and 500 career home runs. But San Francisco's Willie Mays, who has 603 homers, needs only 56 hits to reach 3,000. Hammerin' Hank, 36 years old, has reached what normally is the twilight of a baseball career, but he's remained physically fit and easily could have five more seasons as a regular. “Did you ever look at his waist?” Mickey Mantle asked last winter. “Lean and tough, and he's durable. He's the sort who never gets hurt.” The 180‐pound Aaron has added only 10 pounds since he broke into the National League in 1954 when the Braves called Milwaukee home. He spent only two years in the minors, batting .336 at Eau Claire and .362 at Jacksonville before the Braves began reap ing returns on their $10,000 investment— the amount the Braves paid the Indianapo lis Clowns of the Negro American League for Hank's contract. Aaron had hoped to hit No. 3,000 at Atlanta Stadium, but that's now unlikely. Following the three‐game home set with the Cards, Atlanta begins a 12‐game road trip facing Chicago, Cincinnati, San Fran cisco and Los Angeles. “If I don't get it on the road trip,” Aaron said, “I'll be in one hell of a slump.” “Hank can pass me,” Musial said re cently. “He can play four or five more years. He stays in good shape and he gets lots of hits. I think he's got a shot a my record.” But Aaron isn't sure about that. “I don't know about reaching Stan's rec ord.” Aaron said. “It all depends. The closer you gel to 3,000, the more you notice how long it takes. And pitchers don't want to pitch to you.” Aaron has, however, jumped off to one of the better starts in his career, cracking out 32 hits in 97 trips, including 11 home runs. Aaron has said he's eying Ruth's life time homer record of 714. But Hank says he must have two more good home run production years to do it. One of his 565 home runs stands out as the most memorable hit so far. “The hit I remember most ... that's hard to say because you want to say all of them,” Aaron said. “But the one I guess will always stand out in my mind was the one in 1957 that clinched the pennant. It was a home run in the 11th inning off Billy Muffett of St. Louis.” Aaron doesn't resemble a home‐run hit ter in appearance. But he makes up for brute strength with quick, strong wrists that enable him to whip his bat around on a fast ball and pull it to left. But his 11th homer this year cleared the right‐field fence, prompting Aaron to say, “I guess I'm getting old. I can't get around any more.” Aaron's lifetime totals compared with those of Mays in games through last Wednesday, which happened to be Willie's 39th birthday: In 2,451 games. Aaron had 9,533 at‐bats, 1,729 runs, 2,988 hits 5,480 total bases, 1,816 singles, 516 doubles, 91 triples, 565 home runs, 227 stolen bases, 1,751 runs batted in, a .313 batting average and .574 slugging average. In 2,555 games, Mays had 9,605 at bats, 1.841 runs, 2,944 hits 5,‐183 total bases, 1,713 singles, 465 doubles, 132 triples, 603 home runs. 307 stolen bases, 1.723 runs batted in, a .306 batting average and a .5170 slugging percentage.

529-> McCall's Is Cutting Its Rate Base
Faced by probable postal increases and advertiser re sistance to high page rates, McCall's magazine will cut its rate base by a million, to 7.5 million, with the Septem ber issue. It is also planning to cut the page size to that of its sister publication, Redbook, but no date has been set for that change. McCall's will still have more circulation than its major competitors, The Ladies Home Journal, with 6.8 million, and Good Housekeeping, with 5.6 million. McCall's page rates will be cut from $45,900 to $40,500 for four color and from $34,870 to $30,770 for black and white. In announcing the plans, Edward E. Fitzgerald, president of the McCall Publishing Company, pointed out that the circulation cutback will come purely from attrition and that no subscriber will be stricken from the rolls. He also noted that reduced subscription efforts would “achieve a large cost saving for the company.” In recent months, Cowles's Look, Curtis's Holiday, the Farm Journal and Successful Farming have announced circulation cuts.

531-> 2 IN HOUSE FAVOR ’50 DETENTION ACT
WASHINGTON, Sept 10 (AP)—Support by the Nixon Administration for repeal of the Emergency ‘Detention Act was criticized today by two mem bers of the House Internal Se curity. Committee. The act, passed in 1950, em powers the Attorney General to order detention of individual potential subversives in time of declared war, invasion of the United States or insurrection aiding a foreign government. Advocates of repeal contend that the law could be used as a repressive measure against dissenters. Assistant Attorney General J. Walter Yeagley, head of the Justice Department's In ternal Security Division, said today that repeal of the law would quell unfounded rumors that it might be used against Black Panthers and other radicals and would not pre vent action against sub versives in time of war. But Representative Richard H. Ichord, Democrat of Missouri, who is chairman of the House committee, sug gested that the law was needed, although it might need revision. He said that if the opposition to it was unfounded, the answer was to educate the public on what it really does. “We've witnessed a number of acts of bombings in recent months — some of them by members of organizations that advocate the overthrow of the. Government,” Mr. Ichord said. “Where is the law that pro tects the Government against these people in time of war?” Mr. Yeagley cited 14 laws that he said would still be in force against saboteurs and espionage agents, but Mr. Ichord said that these laws per mitted the Government to act only after subversive acts had been committed. Representative John M. Ash brook, Republican of Ohio, said that Mr. Yeagley's arguments for repeal of the act “almost convince me” that the act should not be repealed. “You refer to them [the op ponents’ fears] as alarmist, un founded, unwarranted,” Mr. Ashbrook said, “and then turn right around and recommend the act be repealed.” Mr. Ichord and Mr. Ashbrook contended that the act's safe guards — under which sus pected saboteurs must be for mally a.ccused and given hear ings — would be wiped out by repeal and that the Presi dent would be left with the same power that President Roosevelt used during World War II to put 112,000 Japanese‐Americans into deten tion camps. Mr. Yeagley said that he knew of “no way” the act could be used against Black Panthers or any dissenters run less they were individually charged with subversive acts in support of a foreign govern ment in time of national crisis. Mr. Ichord said he was con sidering amendnients that would keep the act in force but clarify that it could not be used against dissenters. He said he; would also try to strengthen Rh safeguards for Accused saboteurs.

533-> New Jersey Water Project In Peril as City Withdraws
The Jersey Central Power & Light Company announced yes terday that the future of its Longwood Valley pumped stor age project is in doubt now that Jersey City has decided to with draw from the project. The utility, a subsidiary of the General Public Utilities Cor poration, has been working with the city on the project since 1956. It was planned as a joint water supply and 130,000‐ kilowatt pumped storage plant.

The game was played at Cardinal Spellman High where the Jaspers are at home when not in their own gym or Madison Square Garden.

536-> 10‐Month Deficit Listed
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 23 (UPI)—A financial report cov ering the first 10 months of the year showed today that the Penn Central railroad has gone deeper into the red with losses of $252‐million. The railroad listed total li abilities of about $4‐billion as of last Oct. 31, including a shareholder's equity totaling $1.6‐billion. The 10‐month loss of $252, 875,627 put the railroad $195 million deeper into the red com pared with the similar 1969 period, when losses were listed at $57,117,737. The financial statement placed the line's total assets at about $4‐billion, including special funds, investments and several properties. In October, the railroad suf fered net losses of $19,184,562, or??about $11‐million more than in October, 1969, when it real ized losses of $8,085,423. The statement was submitted by four court‐appointed trustees of the Penn Central Transporta tion Company in accordance with requirements established by the Federal court here. Fed eral Judge John P. Fullam was assigned to oversee operations of the railroad after it filed for reorganization last June 21 un der Federal bankruptcy laws. The financial report was filed one day after the House of Rep resentatives approved a $125 million Government‐guaranteed loan to keep the giant carrier operating in 16 states and Can ada. The measure was approved 165‐121 despite “mismanage ment” claims leveled against a subsidiary of the Penn Central in a report released during the weekend by the House Bank ing Committee. The loan bill went to the Senate where similar legislation guaranteeing bank loans for the carrier was under consi deration.

537-> 6 Police Who Refused Bribes Lauded
Four narcotics cases in which six policemen refused to take bribes totaling close to $10,0001 were cited yesterday by Dis trict Attorney Burton B. Rob erts of the Bronx as evidence that the “overwhelming ma joiity of New York policemen are honest.” It is nara to appiaua a man who does his job, who does what he is supposed to,” Mr. Roberts said. “These men don't want applause, but they de serve recognition.” The District Attorney, say ing he had selected the four examples at random from a number of similar cases during the last few months, introduced the six policemen during a news conference in the State Supreme Court Building in the Bronx. Six of the eight defendants in the four cases were ar raigned yesterday before Jus tice Edward J. Greenfield on a variety of charges, including bribery, which carries a maxi mum sentence of seven years. The mood of Mr. Roberts's news conference contrasted with that of Wednesday when —for the first time in the mem ory of court observers—the district attorney demanded that bail be imposed on two police men arrested in the alleged theft of $100,000. Unless charged with homicide, police men traditionally are paroled. “Much has been written re cently about police corruption, and deservedly so,” Mr. Rob erts said. “But it is time for the community to recognize that most policemen are dedicated and I thought it made sense to bring to the attention of the public some policemen who were offered bribes and did not ac cept them.” In the first case cited by the district attorney, Patrolmen Francis L. Capalbo and William Watson, both 30 years old and both assigned to the Patrol Bor ough Bronx Task Force, stopped two men for driving through a red light and said they found more than a pound of cocaine on the floor of the car. On the way to the precinct station, Patrolman Capalbo said, one of the defendants of fered $1,047 if they were let go. Justice Greenfield set bail at $50,000 for each of the defen dants. In the second case, the Dis trict Attorney said Patrolman John Hart, 35, and Joseph Tuero, 25, assigned to the 42d Precinct Narcotic Enforcement Unit, arrested a man for pos session of an ounce of heroin. According to the prosecutor, the suspect offered them $500 immediately, $500 the next Sat urday and two cars, a 1957 Cadillac and a 1968 Oldsmobile. The man was allowed to call his wife, who allegedly came to the precinct and offered the down payment. The defendant is being held on $10,000 bail, and the woman was paroled. Mr. Roberts said the third case involved $1,000 offered to Patrolmen Lawrence Depaolis and Ronald Savignano, both 29 and working in the Bronx Bor ough Narcotic Patrol Unit. The two defendants were held in $7,500 bail. The fourth case also involved Patrolmen Depaolis and Savig nano. In this instance, the bribe offered was said to be $6,351. The defendants, who were ar rested and arraigned but have not yet been indicted, were found with a pound of heroin and a loaded pistol, Mr. Roberts said.

538-> BANKER'S CONVICTION IS UPHELD BY COURT
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2 (UPI)—The United States Court of Appeals has upheld the em bezzlement conviction of Don C. Silverthorne, now 70 years old, the man who founded the San Francisco National Bank and left it broke 30 months later. The court not only affirmed Silverthorne's conviction on eight of 11 counts yesterday, but also commented that “the evidence of the appellant's guilt is overwhelming.” Silverthorne was found guilty in 1966 and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The Court of Appeals overturned that con viction because of pretrial pub licity. A second trial also resulted in conviction and he was sen tenced a year ago to eight years in prison. Silverthorne's financial em pire collapsed in January, 1964, when the Controller of the Cur rency, James J. Saxon, seized San Francisco National's $58‐ million assets. Government at torneys said Silverthorne had misappropriated $400,000 for his own use by taking high risk loans, charging high bank fees and pocketing the excess over the regular, lower fees. The banker insisted he was innocent.

542-> Scimitar First in Catamaran Sailing
ROWAYTON, Conn., Sept. 23 —The three boats that fared best in the two opening events of the world championship for Class C catamarans yesterday fared best again today. Among them, Scimitar was the winner once more. With Otto Scherer of Laurel, Md., at the tiller and Gene Miller of Annapolis, Md., as crew, Scimitar led most of the way to become a three‐time winner. The course was re duced to 15 miles from 20 be cause of fainting spells in southwester that was always light and spotty. The boats that remained clos est to Scimitar were Yankee Flyer, sailed by Greer Ellis of Great Neck, L. I., and Warren Ackerman, to second place, and the Australian contender, Red Roo, said by Bill Hailer and Bruce Geddes, third in this one. The point scores were 2¼ for Scimitar, 7 for Yankee Flyet and 8 for Red Roo. Four races remain. Hollier and Geddes won the Little America's Cup in Den mark before hey came here and they were clearly among the best for the season's second Class C event of international importance. They led round the first two legs and then were nailed by the Scherer‐Miller combination for what developed into a close match for the lead. It ended when the Australian cat fell into a windless hole on a run that became the next‐to‐last leg. Yankee Flyer inherited the runner‐up position as a re sult, beaten by a quarter‐mile by Scimitar. A catamaran that had spent last winter under the ice of Chesapeake Bay joined the flotilla and lasted for the first two legs. She was Herb Mul queen's Sprinter, built in 1963 and thus aged for these high powered but frail racing ma chines. Mulqueen said that he was persuaded to enter the cham pionship and did after repair ing one of the hulls and a pro fusely perforated wing mast.

544-> Personal Finance
If you have been putting off efforts to obtain a student loan because of the hard time you got the last time you tried‐‐ even as recent as just a few months ago — delay no longer. You may find the lenders have changed their tune and now are delighted to see you. In fact, some lenders are beginning to advertise widely that they are actively seeking applications for student loans. Part of the reason is that funds are flowing into finan cial institutions of all kinds at a far greater rate than last year. Also, ??nterest rates are coming down, meaning that money is more readily avail able now than it was not too long ago. Of course, the more general availability of credit does not apply strictly to student loans but, rather to all loans. As an indication of the gen eral easing in student lending, the Dollar Savings Bank ad vertised the other day: “If your child has the will, we have the money.” • The First National City Bank, by far the largest con sumer lender in the metropol??tan area and a major force in student loans, has gone as far as to publish a four‐page pamphlet on “What You Should Know About Stu dent Loans.” “It's getting easier all the time to borrow for education al purposes,” the bank said. Confirmation of this fact— at least as far as New York State is concerned — comes from Elwood D. Hollister Jr., executive director of the New York Higher Education As sistance Corporation, the state agency that guaran tees student loans. “Right now,” Mr. Hollister remarked,” we have no indi cation of any problem in get ting student loans.” Last year, he said, some students were unable to get loans in parts of Long Island and in western New York. But?? this year, he added, there have been “no complaints at all.” The same holds true for colleges and universities. Last year, many complained that students were unable to ob tain loans, he said. This year, no complaints have come in. Terms under state guarantee programs are particularly generous. For example, in New York State you can borrow up to $1,000 a year during your first two years in college and then $1,250 and $1,500 in your next two years. You can also borrow $1,500 a year for each year of grad uate work, but not more than a total of $7,500. The best part about the deal is that you pay no inter est on your loan while in school and for nine months thereafter. Then you start paying interest at the rate of 7 per cent a year. But you have as long as 10 years to pay and may pay as little as $30 a month plus the interest. Another point to keep in mind is that you—the stu dent—are the borrower; not your parents. But to qualify for this type of loan, your family's adjusted gross in come must not exceed $15, 000. New York State will make a few exceptions when several children in one fam ily are in college at the same time. Generally, state guaranteed student loans are only for college or approved voca tional schools. But the list of vocational schools in New York, for example, is extensive—cover ing business, computer tech nology, nursing, beautician courses, medical and dental technology, radio and elec tronics and auto mechanics. Normally, however, these are one‐year courses, with a maximum of $1,000 in loans available that must be paid off in about three years or slightly less. • The First National City Bank pointed out, too, that needy students can obtain National Defense Student Loans through lenders up to $1,000 a year or a total of $5,000 for undergraduate work—with forgiveness for all or part of the debt. Those who go into teach ing may be able to get for giveness for one‐half the loan, the bank said. Those who teach in designated low income schools or in recog nized schools for the handi capped may be forgiven all of their debt at the rate of 15 per cent a year. At the other end of the economic scale, where your family earns more than $15,000 a year in adjusted gross income, your parents are able to borrow under special student‐lending pro grams made available by most lenders. The interest rate, however, may be somewhat higher than the 7 per cent deferred rate you pay on guaranteed loans of the state and Federal Government.

545-> BOND INSURANCE SOUGHT IN TALKS
A break seemed to be de veloping yesterday in the im passe between the Continental. Insurance Company and some major New York City banks threatened by a loss of cover age on Government securities. Representatives of the New York Clearing House Associa tion met in the morning with men from Continental. The session produced, according to a bank spokesman, “a crack we might exploit to obtain con tinued coverage on a modified basis.” A spokesman for Continental Insurance said simply, “There is movement.” Carroll Young, a vice presi dent in Continental's bonding department, confirmed that his company had agreed to modify one of its planned policy re visions limiting insurance after Jan. 4. But he said that it was holding fast on perhaps the most crucial point — that it would pay claims for lost or stolen securities only after all other, means of recovery had been exhausted. Earlier this month Continen tal gave 30 days’ notice that coverage on bearer Government securities would be excluded for brokers and sharply limited for banks. Most of the restrictions go into effect Jan. 3. The giant insurer, which writes a major portion of the blanket coverage of this type, cited losses here that ran four to six times premium income., The insurance policies in ques tion provide coverage against theft and other perils. On Monday the Irving Trust Company formally reported the “loss” of $5–million in Treas ury bonds that had been missing for three weeks. Under present law the Treas ury can not reimburse an in surer for a loss until the bonds come due, but it has proposed Federal legislation to allow earlier replacement so that the insurer would not be out the use of the money at today's high interest rates. The Treasury has already moved to speed by regulation merly vioe president–consumer foods group, was promoted to executive vice president re sponsible for the Gorton Cor. poration, a seafood products subsidiary. He will also be in charge of advertising and mar keting services, trade policy and customer relations and purchases, as well as the six divisions that comprise the con sumer foods group. Earnings of the General In strument Corporation for the third fiscal to ended Nov. 30 declined to $1,232,396, or 13 cents a share, from $1,716,484, or 21 cents a share, in the year earlier period, the report noted yesterday. Net income for the nine month period ended. Nov. 30 increased to $4,189,249, or 47 cents a share, from $4,080, 450, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $69,540,955, up from 369,265, 663, bringing the nine–month volume to $201,429,584, up from $120,234,464. The report of the Sherwin Williams Company disclosed yesterday an increase in net income to $3,506,985, or 61 cents a share, for the first fis cal quarter ended Nov. 30 from $2,917,585, or 50 cents a share, for the year–earlier period. Sales were $124,329,334, up from $194,622,984. Operations or the Federal Company for the six months ended Nov. 30 resulted in A sharp decline in net income to $462,000, or 22 cents a share, from a year–earlier net of $3, 733,000, or $1.79 a share, for the poultry processor and flour miller. The company attributed the drop in earnings on depressed poultry prices. Sales improved to $123,854, 000 from $121,489,000.

546-> Boat Show Opens As Early Arrivals Brave 20° Weather
At 10:01 A.M. yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. James R. McQueen Jr. snipped a purple ribbon in the lobby of the Coliseum, a group of about 30 United States Power Squadron and Coast Guard Auxiliary members posed for pictures and Ed Collier of South River, N. J., the first per son in line, raced up to the fourth floor to see the Romany 21, an English boat. The 60th National Boat Show was under way, for nine days through Feb. 1. “I came up by train and got here at a quarter to eight,” said the 35‐year‐old Collier, who wore a cardigan sweater under his suit and overcoat. “For a half‐hour there was no one else here, but then this fellow ar rived, and I had company.” The second man was Walter O'Donnell, 63, of Altoona, Pa., who, like Collier, had seen every boat show at the Coli seum. “Three years ago,” he said, “I walked around the whole building and found the end of the line at the front door. I didn't want to do that again,” Collier said he had read a joke book to keep his mind off the 20‐degree temperature, but his feet got cold anyway. The weather may have been respon sible for a smaller crowd than usual at a boat show opening. However, by noon, the aisles had filled with visitors, and the larger‐boat exhibits had that familiar packed‐in look. Each of the four floors, plus the mezzanine, which housed more than 500 boats, hundreds of engines and thousands of accessories, seem to hold some thing special for somebody. On the first floor for instance, there was the smallest boat, the 6½ Guppy ($129) and the most powerful outboard motor, from Kiekhaefer Mer cury (135‐horsepower). On the second floor could be found the most expensive boat, the Hatteras Triple Cabin at $103,485 (although the Bay Head skiff of the New Jersey Yacht Corporation had peen stuffed with so many extras its price had risen to $125,000), as well as the largest craft of the show, Thunderbird's 47‐foot Drift‐R‐Cruise house‐yacht. The mezzanine revealed the unusual air‐cushion vehicle for $1,250 and the nine‐foot Hydro Cycle, which at $500 looks like a cross between a motorcycle and a hydroplane. The third floor, traditionally filled with doohickeys, gim cracks and thingumabobs, also included a one‐man submarine by Vast, Inc., priced at $14,750, and psychedelic water skis with bikinis to match. On the top floor, a 20‐foot ketch‐rigged cruising boat by Nautica Corporation sold for $3,200, while 25 British compa nies formed a veritable empire, featuring the only round‐the world solo sailor, Robin Knox Johnston. McQueen, the president of the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers, which sponsors the show, took over the ceremonial opening in the absence of celebrities, such as Mayor Lindsay who was un available. McQueen, who was named man of the year by the New York Marine Trades Association for “outstanding achievement in boating,” announced at the annual dinner meeting of the N.A.E.B.M. Friday that negotia tions were under way for a merger of his group and the Boating Industry Association. Until last year the two groups were rivals. McQueen also discussed the rising tide of “consumerism— action on behalf of the consumer against manufacturers who fail . . . to perform ade quately.” Two potential consumers at the boat show, who seemed more able than most to spot “inadequate” performance and “poor” workmanship, were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Van Valken burg of Springfield, Mass. A dentist who has been boat ing since he was 7 (he's now. 32), Van Valkenburg and his wife, Judy, were seeking to move up in boat size and qual ity. They had begun with a Pacemaker 26, sold it for a Pembroke 32 and now, with two young boys in the family, they wanted a larger one. Van Valkenburg, a wood boat fancier who does his cruis ing and fishing out of Mystic, Conn., headed straight for the Post Marine Company's 40‐foot Sport Fisher as soon as the Coliseum doors had opened. With a price of $32,500, it made an instant hit. “If I can find the money,” he said, “this is the boat I'd buy. Wood has so much more character and looks warmer than fiberglass. It will last longer too if you take care of it.” The Van Valkenburgs took quick looks at the Bertram (“the best fiberglass boat here”) the Egg Harbor (“See how wood makes a boat look bet ter?”), a Luhrs and an Alglas (“not bad for glass”) and then stopped short at the Lang yacht display. “Wait a minute!” he ex claimed. “This is really some thing.” He pointed to the Lang 280 and 330, both made by the Maine Shipbuilding Company of Rockland, Me. “For $12,250 and $20,000, these could be the scoop of the show. “Look at those lines. They're really tender. I know it's fiber glass, dear, but look at that hull. I may just get one of these, after all.”

547-> Civic Group Urges Assistance to Avert Crises Among Aged
The Federal, state and city government were urged yester day to set up programs to provide services to the elderly, to prevent the aged from hav ing to face personal crises. The Community Service So ciety made the appeal in a public report on the success of a demonstration effort that served 1,000 elderly tenants of four low‐income housing proj ects in the South Bronx. The experiment was designed to show “how old people may be kept reasonably‐ happy and out of nursing homes.” Every, year, the report said, 8,000 aged men and women are ad mitted to mental hospitals in New York State. It estimated that half of them were “there only because they can no long er maintain themselves with out services which they need to have readily available in the community.” The civic group's demonstra tion was financed largely by the National Institute of Mental Health. The project used a pro fessional social worker as supervisor, and five women, aged 48 to 60, trained as serv ice workers. An analysis of 1,986 prob lems discovered in the first 19 months of a two‐year period showed that 33 per cent of them involved the older persons' inability to make use of re sources without guidance from others; 27 per cent, ill health, and 19 per cent, insufficient funds. The report said that 78 per cent of the problems were solved; 9 per cent were still pending, and 13 per cent could not be handled. Physical health problems taxed the project's abilities more than any others, the re port said, with “many diffi culties in obtaining medical attention.” Fears about person al safety generally defied solu tion, with only 17 per cent of such cases resolved. Loneliness was termed a pervasive problem.

548-> Augusta Links Changes Expected to Favor Long Hitters
AUGUSTA, Ga., April 7— Jack Nicklaus resumed prac tice today for the Masters Golf tournament and admitted re cent changes to the course were advantageous to him. A minor controversy has de veloped on how the remodeled 520‐yard 15th hole will affect the scoring in the event that begins here Thursday. Most agree it will favor the long hitting Nicklaus. Arnold Palmer says the par‐5 hole, where water is in front and back of the green, should play 20 yards longer this year, since the tee has been moved back. But the most significant alteration has brought two huge mounds to the right side of the fairway with five smal ler ones nestling around them. Nicklaus, who played 63 holes in practice last week, is expected to boom his drives away from the mounds and reach the green in two, just as he has in past years. Palmer, the only competitor to win four Masters crowns, said, “The long hitter—I mean Nicklaus and probably Tom Weiskopf—should have a two‐ stroke advantage at the 15th on the rest of the field in four rounds. They will be able to get home in 2, with a possible eagle and probably birdie putt on this hole. The short hitters will play short of the water, pitch on in 3 and be content with a par 5. I'm not sure if the change there will help me.” Palmer had the only practice round today he has had over the Augusta National Golf Club course this year. This is the briefest pre tourney ses sion Palmer has had since 1958. He won that year on his first, bid, after he played only 27 holesin practice. Nicklaus said he didn't wish to offer any criticism of changes, made at the 15th or the enlarged installation of the bunker at the crest of the hill at the first hole. “I have more of an advan tage than previously at the 15th. It's 2'Q= yards longer. They say it isn't‐ but you can bet me. Bob. Jones's original idea was to give you a gambling chance to reach the green in 2. Now it's not so, for most of the field. [Jones designed the course with Alister Mackenzie.] Furthermore, I don't like the look of the mounds. They look out of place. But I think I have more of an advantage than in other years.” Nicklaus said he anticipated the over‐all scoring average would be higher for other rea sons. “The fairways are thinner and will play faster and the greens are hard and fast, too,” he added. Gary Player, the South Af rican, who won at Greensboro last Sunday, was the center of considerable attention as a se curity guard of eight followed him. There was complete seren ity here and Player gave no indication he was under pres sure despite the sight of the guards.

The society received $130, 000 last year in Federal funds and $90,000 from the county for civil cases. John F. Middlemiss Jr., the director of the society's civil division, said a three‐man evaluating team from O. E. O. had studied the society last October and reported that its operation of civil cases was “in effective and inefficient.” He said that the society, however, had never been permitted to see a copy of the evaluation and, that there was “no bill of particulars.”

553-> U.S. PANEL SEEKS NEW AUTO ENGINE
WASHINGTON. July 16 (UPI) — The Nixon Administra tion announced today a pro gram to develop by 1975 at least two low‐pollution alter natives to the regular gasoline auto engine, which is estimated to cause at least half of the nation's air pollution. John J. Brogan, head of the new program told newsmen that the goal was to make the price of the new engines, when produced in quantity, “com petitive with the internal com bustion engine.” He said that private industry should be able to produce cars with the new engines before 1980, when stringent auto emission standards are sched uled to go into effect. He said that the Federal program of re search contracts and industry incentives would cost $45‐mil lion over five years. He will head the research effort from his laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. The Health. Education and Welfare Department under which Dr. Brogan will work, has estimated that cars cause up to 60 per cent of the air pollution in America. Russell E. Train, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said that the gas turbine appeared the most promising alternative. Another good possibility, he said, is a “hybrid” engine with “a small, low‐powered heat [combustion] engine and an ar ray of batteries.” “We do not currently see an all‐electric automobile meeting the demands of the consumer by 1975,” Mr. Brogan said. “The state of the art is too crude.” He said that an electric car might be feasible before 1980, however. Mr. Train said that the auto industry was “gambling on cleaning up the internal com bustion engine.” But he and Mr. Brogan said that auto makers were cooperating with the Fed eral program. “Certainly by 1975 the auto industry will be induced to start a vigorous parallel program,” Mr. Brogan said. Ernest S. Starkman, profes sor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, was named chairman of an eight‐member advisory commit tee to assist the program. One official from each of the auto motive “big three” — General Motors Corporation, Ford Mo tor Company and Chrysler Cor poration — also was chosen. “The data on current levels of pollution in our urban en vironment, the projected in creases in urban traffic in the years ahead and the perform ance of [emission] control sys tems under actual driving con ditions make it clear that even the application of more strin gent standards in 1975 will only prolong the downward curve in vehicle emissions until the mid dle nineteen‐eighty's,” Mr. Train said. “After that, carbon monoxide levels will again rise because of the sheer number of auto mobiles on roads and high ways.” Six Penn Central trains oper ating into and out of Grand Central Terminal were immo bilized for 20 minutes yester day when power was shut off following a bomb threat. The report, relayed from the Police Department, was that bomb had been planted on the Harlem River drawbridge where a fire last Monday caused massive early morning tie‐up. No bomb was found. The message from the po lice was received at 3:17 P.M., the railroad said, and power was shut off on all four tracks from 3:30 to 3:50 P.M. between Grand Central and Highbridge in the Bronx.

554-> Letters:
To THE FINANCIAL EDITOR: Oscar Lasdon's article in The Times of July 26 surmises that the reorganization of the Penn Central may require from 5 to 20 years. His observations as to the manifold and complex problems which the four trustees must face are most timely and important — not least that, if a railroad is to be successfully reorganized, it “must be put in shape to make money on a day‐to‐day basis.” Mr. Lasdon certainly strikes the jugular in saying that present Section 77 procedures—particularly the timeconsuming procedural “shuttling” now entailed between the Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission—“do not facilitate speedy reorganizations” and he helpfully mentions several suggestions for “a streamlining (of that Section) to save precious time.” Many of Mr. Lasdon's suggestions were included in bills sponsored by the American Bar Association's Committee on Railroad Reorganizations and Readjustments in 1960 and introduced in both houses of Congress in the first part of 1961. The bills so introduced included amendments to Section 77 to accomplish the following: 1. To require a railroad's Court‐appointed trustees to file a plan of reorganization —after observing a new statutory direction to confer with the various interested parties and the commission, with, a view to proposing expeditiously a plan which not only is compatible with the public interest and affords due recognition to private rights but is also “feasible.” This proposed amendment follows the pattern of Chapter X reorganization proceedings under which the independent trustee is the only one required to file plan — though the debtor would continue to have the right to do so. 2. To avoid the procedural shuttling back and forth between the Court and the commission, with the duplication of effort and the invitation to delay inherent in the present provisions of Section 77, it proposed that there shall be but one appealable order as to the plan — the order of apprbval entered by the Court after the vote of security holders has been taken. 3. To empOwer the I.C.C. to call in outside experts to assist in expediting technical and clerical steps necessary to a plan. The statistical and accounting problems that arise in Section 77 proceedings are so extraordinary that, in the interest of expedition. it seems desirable for the I.C.C. to he able to assign, at the debtor's expense, some of them to outside experts. The A.B.A. Committee, however, far from suggesting that the substantive role of the I.C.C. be reduced in Section 77 reorganizations, realized that it would be almost impossible for a single Federal judge adequately to grapple with the many problems and complexities involved, statistical, engineering and economic as well as legal. Neither, on the other hand, did the committee advocate a procedure analagous to that under the Public Utility Holding Company Act to give the commission [S.E.C.] almost plenary jurisdiction over the plan. Instead, the committee believed sound the underlying principles of Section 77 in recognizing the need for the efforts of both the commission and the reorganization Court — and sought to accelerate the reorganization process by the above‐suggested amendments, and by others of less When, in 1960, the American Bar Association Committee sponsored the above amendments, which were introduced in both houses of Congress in early 1961, no major railroad was then under Section 77; and other proposed legislation was of such importance that no Congressional committee hearings were held on those hills. The same was true of the similar bills introduced in 1963. With the signal recent increase of financial stringency on the part of several railroads, it seems appropriate to suggest that further and prompt consideration can well be given to amendments to Section 77 of the kind proposed by the American Bar Association's Committee almost a decade ago.

557-> Kling Kling Wins $57,400 Lawrence Realization at Belmont and Returns
Kling Kling, the established grass campaigner owned by John M. Schiff, withstood the closing rush of William Haggin Perry's Loud and won the $57, 400 Lawrence Realization at Belmont Park yesterday. Under the guidance of Jean Cruguet, who had won two races earlier on the card, Ming Kling took the 1½‐mile turf event for 3‐year‐olds by three quarters of a length and paid $8 for $2 straight. It was not until late in the going that Kling Kling took the lead from Naskra, who finished third, 1½ lengths back of Loud. Loud, who won the Travers at Saratoga last month, carried top weight of 123 pounds and was ridden by Jacinto Vasquez. Kling Kling, under 114 pounds, was timed in 2:27 3‐5 on the firm course. Co‐Choice Finishes Sixth The crowd of 21,612 sent Kling Kling off as a co‐favorite with the Watermill Farm's Burd Alane, but the latter failed to show an aptitude for the grass and finished sixth in the field of nine. The success was the fourth, all on grass, in 15 starts this season for Kling Kling, who earned $37,310. The perform ance proved extremely pleasant for Tommy Kelly, who train Kling Kling, for it occurred on his 51st birthday. Kelly also saddled the first winner on the program, Close Control. Kling Kling is a home‐bred Kentucky son of Blue Prince, and his season's earnings are now $68,135. Mrs. Schiff ac cepted the victory trophy from Joseph Roeblittg, who also made awards to Kelly and Cruguet. Hoist the Flag Impresses Mrs. Stephen C. Clark Jr.'s Hoist the Flag stepped to an impressive victory in the 6½ furlong sprint that preceded the main event. Even after an awkward start, the 2‐year‐old son of Tom Rolfe won the race “going away” under a ride by. Cruguet. Carrying 122 pounds, Hoist’ the Flag was timed in 1:B 2.5,1 two‐fifths of a second slower than the track record. The vic tory, second for Hoist the Flag in his two‐race career, was no surprise, as indicated by his price of $3.40 for $2. Hoist the Flag, trained by Sid Watters Jr., is considered strong possibility to perform well in the Cowdin a week from tomorrow. The Cowdin, at $50, 000 added, is for 2‐year‐olds at seven furlongs.

558-> F.C.C. MAN SCORES REVAMPING PLANS
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 — Nicholas Johnson, a member of the Federal Communications Commission, said today that a study group named by Presi dent Nixon had reached the wrong conclusion in proposing reorganization of Government agencies, like the F.C.C. that directly regulate business. Reorientation toward guard ing the public interest, not re organization, is what these agencies need, Mr. Johnson said in a speech to the Federal Bar Association. He said that the place to start was with better appointments to the agencies. “There is nothing wrong with the current regulatory process that sound Presidential appoint ments could not cure,” he said. The proposals Mr. Johnson criticized have reportedly been, made to Mr. Nixon by what is known as the Ash Commission,’ a study group headed by Roy L. Ash, president of Litton In dustries. The Ash report has not been made public. Among other things, the study group has reportedly proposed consolidating the three separate Government agencies that now regulate ground, water and air transportation; and has pro posed that most agencies be headed by a single individual, instead of by five to eleven commissioners. ‘A Thousand Naders’ “From what little has sur faced so far,” Mr. Johnson said, “the Ash proposals appear no ticeably devoid of any strong sentiments toward the current plight of the American con sumer.” He said that the Ash recommendations might actu ally be aimed at “quietly bury ing what little hope of vigilance there remains for the lowly con sumer in the regulatory process.” The ailments of the regula tory agencies reflect the ail ments of American society as a whole, and must be viewed in that light, Mr. Johnson said. He added that the need here, as elsewhere, to develop “true par ticipatory democracy.” To achieve this, he said it would be necessary to find fi nancing for many different laws firms that will take cases in the public interest — “a thousand Ralph Naders, not just one, with hundreds of thousands of dol lars, so our rusty legal machin ery can begin humming again.” Mr. Johnson suggested that the new organization Common Cause, which is being put to gether by John W. Gardner, former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, could turn its attention to financing such law firms. The regulatory agencies could also consider holding more fact finding tours around the coun try. Mr. Johnson said. “This approach can work,” he said. “Not long ago, for ex ample, the Illinois Commerce Commission toured all over the state and listened to telephone customers by the hundreds. As a result, one of the commission ers reports, the Illinois commis sion refused to grant a rate in crease until multiparty rural telephone service is upgraded.”

559-> Federalists Victors In Quebec —For Now
—After the pro‐fed eralist Liberal party won a land slide mandate in last week's Que bec provincial election, many Canadians wondered whether the threat of Quebec's secession from Canada had passed for good or merely been delayed. The Liberals, led by youthful Robert Bourassa, won 71 of the 108 seats in the provincial legis lature. Three other parties shared the remaining seats. They were the conservative National Union, which had formed the previous government; the arch‐conserva tive Creditistes; and the Parti Québecois, which seeks eventual separation from the rest of Canada. With Mr. Bourassa's solid ma jority, the troubled French‐speak ing province can probably hope for a degree of tranquillity in the next four years. But, René Lé vesque, leader of the Parti Qué becois, in a belligerent election night farewell to his separatist supporters, vowed that “our fight is just begun.” Mr. Lévesque suffered personal defeat by a Liberal in a predomi nantly Italian Montreal district but seven separatist deputies were elected elsewhere. More than 600,000 voters, one‐fourth of the total who cast ballots, were for separatist candidates. In the last election four years ago, less than 9 per cent of the voters supported two uncoordinated sep aratist groups and elected no separatist members. Mr. Lévesque, by force of en thusiasm, energy and extraordi nary powers of suasion had led thousands of voters who opposed separation of Quebec from Can ada to support his “reasonable” new approach to the old French Canadian problem of living in a predominantly English ‐ speaking continent, Mr. Lévesque spoke, not of “independence” and “se cession,” but of a Quebec “sov ereignty” attained through a peaceful negotiation with the Fed eral Government in Ottawa. He said the process might take years; meanwhile, Quebec would pros per through continued economic and fiscal ties with English Can ada. In the end, fully one‐half of Parti Québecois support is esti mated as having come from non separatist malcontents who had found their jobs lost or jeopard ized in the economic backsliding of the recent years of National Union rule. Mr. Bourassa profited because, unlike the National Union, he neatly packaged federalism with promises of economic growth, more jobs, and a prosperity that eventually would match neighbor ing Ontario's. In a victory state ment, Mr. Bourassa recognized, if not too heartily, the emergence in Quebec's official political life of the separatists who now have elected representatives in the provincial Parliament for the first time. Mr. Lévesque was elected as a Liberal and sat as a separa tist only after he bolted from the Liberal party two years ago. Mr. Lévesque was unhappy that under the present system of electoral division, more than a quarter of the voters could elect less than 1/15th of the deputies, but the fact remains that Quebec separatists no longer need resort to violence to be heard. This could relieve tensions all around. Or it may provide so frustrating and slow a process of political development as to dis may hard‐core separatists in Parti Québecois ranks. The veteran militants whom Mr. Lévesque won over to his moderate seces sion course, might then back track to old radical ways. This would bring on new violence and it would also break up the Parti Québecois. —JAY WALZ

560-> 2 Taxi Strikers Arrested In Brawl Over Gypsy Cabs
Two cabbies were arrested yesterday in a fracas involving about 150 striking cab drivers and the police at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The melee occurred ‘ when the strikers broke through po lice barricades on Lexington Avenue in an effort to get at a driver of private livery limou sine who had pulled up across the street. Swinging night sticks, the policemen drove the strikers back behind the barri cades. Private limousines and gypsy cabs—which may answer tele phone calls for service but are’ not permitted to cruise for pas stengers—have been picking up riders during the 11‐day walk out by 36,000 fleet drivers and independents who operate their own cabs. This has led the strikers to post picket lines at several major hotels where the unlicensed cabbies have been seeking customers. Yesterday morning, 800 strik ers also threw picket lines around the Port Authority Bus Terminal and made it difficult for passengers to hail gypsy cabs. The two men arrested were taken to the East 51st Street police station. They were An drew Taylor, 34 years old, of Congers, N. Y., who was charged with resisting arrest and harassment, and Victor Ferguson, 36, of 1405 Prospect Place, Brooklyn, charged with disorderly conduct. Harry Van Arsdale Jr., presi dent of the striking Local 3036 of the New York City Taxi Drivers Union, was present during the disorders outside the Waldorf‐Astoria, but he took no part in the activities. He said he had been passing by when he stopped to talk to some pickets. Although the strikers have now been out of work for 11 days, some of those interviewed yesterday said they were firm in their determination to win the union demands. “I'm beginning to hurt,” said 63‐year‐old George Finklestein, who was picketing outside the Terminal garage on 11th Ave nue near 56th Street. “But won't go back without a con tract.” And George Brancaccio, 57, who was also picketing there, commented, “We are 100 per cent behind the union.” The drivers of the 6,816 fleet owned cabs have been seeking wages to approximate the $175 to $200 a week earned by transit workers. At present the fleet cabbies average about $150, including tips. In an effort to avert the strike, Mayor Lindsay had asked the City Council to raise taxi fares enough to provide about $53‐million in extra rev enue for the owners and their drivers. However, the drivers and the companies were unable to agree on a percentage di vision of the higher fares. The strike has been hardest felt by those who are both too old and feeble and too poor to afford hiring the higher‐priced private limousines. These have mainly, been old persons living on Social Security Or small pensions. Because many of these elder ly cannot climb subway stairs or stand in crowded public buses, they have often been forced to postpone or cancel visits to doctors or hospitals for checkups. The lucky ones have been able to find friends or relatives to take them there by private car. Persons going to and from La Guardia Airport and Ken nedy International Airport have been helped by the action of the Cam Transportation Com pany in increasing the number of its buses serving these points. Passengers Can po di rectly to and from the airports and the East Side Bus Terminal, the Americana, New York Hil ton and the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel and Rockefeller Plaza. The Independent Taxi Own ers Council, which represents 4,963 owner‐drivers, called on Governor Rockefeller yesterday to intervene in the strike. In a telegram to the Governor, Al Kanner, president of the coun cil, asked for “your desperately needed assistance in ending the taxicab strike.” He charged that Mayor Lindsay “has fomented the strike and is keeping it dead locked so that he can impose his politically motivated taxi commission upon an unwilling industry and the public.” In addition to asking the City Council to set higher fares, the Mayor had also asked that a commission be ‘established to regulate the taxi industry.

561-> Kennedy: How Bad Is the Political Damage?
Last Wednes day was to have been the day when the cloud lifted over Ed ward Moore Kennedy, the cloud that had shadowed both his pub lic and personal life since the dark midnight last July when Mary Jo Kopechne drowned off Chappaquiddick Island in the car he had driven off Dike Bridge. Last wednesday was the day when the legal case was finally to be completed, with the re lease of the record of the inquest on the 28‐year‐old secretary and the report of the judge who had conducted it. But the records were made public, and the news went pouring out of Boston—and the cloud did not lift. There had been no Kennedy aide so foolhardy as to predict that publication of the inquest report would not injure the Sen ator politically. At an absolute minimum, it would refresh pub lic recollection of the Chappa quiddick episode, reminding the electorate that there were un answered questions, unresolved doubts about the whole messy business, but, on the whole, the Kennedy men believed that was the worst it would do. They were wrong. What the report could and did do was accuse Senator Kennedy, on the basis of the evidence, of giving the inquest court a version of the events that was not reasonable or probable. Judge James A. Boyle concluded that Senator Kennedy and Miss Kopechne had not planned to return to the mainland, as the Senator had claimed, and therefore he had not made a mistake in turning into Dike Road. “I therefore find,” the judge declared, “there is probable cause to believe that Edward M. Ken nedy operated his motor vehicle negligently... and that such operation appears to have con tributed to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne.” “At the inquest,” Senator Ken nedy replied. “I truthfully an swered all questions asked of me. In my personal view, the infer ence and ultimate findings of the judge's report are not justified, and I reject them.” In a sense that the Washing ton political community felt but was not so appreciable else where, the timing of this new setback to Senator Kennedy's career could not have been worse unless it had come at the climax of his re‐election cam paign in Massachusetts next fall. For Teddy Kennedy had fi nally managed to climb out of the pit, and it had taken time and effort. He had shaken off the stiffening trauma of the accident itself. He had survived a series of deadening embarrass ments on the Senate floor when his colleagues spurned Kennedy amendments they would have rushed to endorse only six months earlier. The Senator's success in re establishing a large measure of his lost leadership role, plus the failure of other potential Demo cratic candidates to establish themselves firmly in the early running, had begun to persuade party leaders that Mr. Kennedy was indeed their man for 1972, however he might feel person ally about the race. That conviction had just be gun to surface. Democratic Na tional Chairman Lawrence F. O'Brien had given Senator Ken nedy prominence in a candidate list only a week ago. His com petitors, men like Hubert H. Humphrey and Senator Edmund S. Muskie, had restored his name to the active roster within re cent weeks. How much did the Chappa quiddick report hurt the young est and last of the Kennedy brothers politically? In the hours after its release, no one knew, and the most practiced political experts could only speculate. The one certain fact was that it had made his showing in the 1970 re‐election campaign even more critically important than it had been before. Next November's Massachu setts vote, ever since the tragic events of last July, had shaped up as Teddy Kennedy's chance to demonstrate that people be lieve him as opposed to rumor and salacious gossip; then he could move from there to the position that the people of the United States were really no different from the people of Massachusetts. But that demonstration has been complicated. Mr. Kennedy must now vie with the pub lished official conclusions of a judge, not merely rumor and gossip, to win his case. And, unfairly in the eyes of some legal authorities, he appears to have no tribunal to which to appeal except the court of pub lic opinion. Last time out in 1964, Senator Kennedy piled up an astonishing 1.13‐million‐vote majority, a combined product of sympathy for his inability to campaign from a hospital bed in the wake of an airplane accident, a John son landslide and the magic of the Kennedy name among its most instinctive adherents. It does not appear now that 1970 can possibly be so favor able. His likely Republican op ponent is Josiah Spaulding, a certifiable Yankee with money, intelligence and liberal views. He has less party support than he would like in the state and, possibly, more from national leaders than may prove helpful. But he was reported after last week's events to have reached a new peak of optimism—which for a Republican challenging even a disabled Kennedy on home ground can still be a fairly unimpressive peak.

BALTIMORE, July 16 (AP)— Representative John Dowdy's move to dismiss bribery con spiracy charges was turned down today by Federal District Court Judge Roszel C. Thomsen.

The judge said in an 11‐page opinion: “It is clear Congress has the right to discipline its own members but it is clear that Congress responded to in creased national concern in 1962 over the ethical standards of political officials by reaf firming and broadening this delegation of authority to the courts.” Mr. Dowdy, 58 years old, is charged with two counts of conspiracy—tto commit an of fense against the United States by receiving pay from a private source in matters affecting the Government operations and to influence a Justice Department investigation.

565-> U.N. Unit Puts Off Decision on Funds For Expansion Here
GENEVA, June 23—A United Nations organ today postponed until January a decision on whether to advance $10‐million toward an $80‐million addition to United Nations Headquarters in New York. The surprise decision of the governing council of the United Nations Development Program, which may cause serious com plications for the project, was made by a vote of 17 to 12, with 6 abstentions. France and the Soviet Union led the fight for postponement. They argued that if the govern ing council helped provide the money for the new extension, which is to include office space and recreation areas, this would prejudge the final decision on whether the offices of the de velopment program should be moved to Geneva. The choice of Geneva as a site for a meeting of the govern ing council is itself a sign of a growing shift from New York. The Economic and Social Council has always held its summer sessions in Geneva. The development program's gov erning council recently began following this example. Dr. Glenn A. Olds, the United States representative, fought for immediate authorization of the advance, insisting that it had nothing to do with the decision whether the develop ment program should be moved out of New York. Of the $40‐million to be pro vided by the United Nations for the project, the General As sembly will appropriate $25‐ million. The development pro gram, which is now paying $600,000 a year for rented space near headquarters, would ad vance the $10‐million in lieu of rent on the offices it will oc cupy when the work is finished in 1973. The United Nations Children's Fund has voted to provide the $5‐million remain ing.

566-> More Jitters In an Uncertain Economy
— All of the confusion and uncertainty con nected with the Government's delicate effort to check inflation without pushing the economy in to a tailspin—plus a dash of Cambodia—combined last week to send an already jittery stock market reeling to some big de clines. There was no panic, but a good deal orgloom. With the Dow‐Jones industrial average at its lowest point since late 1963, a good many people were be genning to wonder what be came of the idea that stocks are a good “hedge” against infla tion. What, then, was the real eco nomic background in late April, 1970? Was the economy, in some vaguely defined way, in bad shape? Was the Government's underlying economic policy still on track? Senator Jacob K. Javits, the New York Republican, put the general psychological climate well: “The country is very wor ried about where the economy is going, and so are its major financial institutions. Remedial action is needed now or we may face dire economic and social consequences in a chain reac tion to present conditions... the collapse of prices on the stock exchanges, the record high interest rates and the continuing unacceptable 6 per cent rate of inflation in the cost of living are but a thermometer confir mation of the national economic fever.” As for some months now, the underlying concerns were of two entirely different kinds. The first was a fear that the so‐far grad ual and relatively mild slow down would cumulate into a se rious recession, with unemploy ment soaring well above 5 per cent of the labor force. The other was the fear that the icing struggle against infla tion would be lost. The economy would turn up, all right, but it would take off into a new boom — spurred by a new burst of government spending — long be fore inflation had been checked in any significant way. Both fears, of course, cannot materialize together, though ei ther might stimulate someone to sell stocks. And regardless of which fear one held, there was the steady flow of news last week, annual corporate meeting time, of sharply reduced corpo rate earnings for the first quar ter — not across the board but highlighted in such major indus tries as automobiles and steel. Up until early April, there was a growing though far from uni versal feeling in the financial community that the Government stood a fair chance of achiev ing its objectives. The change in the mood stemmed mainly from two things: ¶President Nixon's decision, which had a panicky look about it, to release $1.5‐billion in pre viously frozen construction funds. ¶The brief postal strike and its aftermath of a 12‐month ac celeration of a large Govern ment‐wide pay increase. To skeptical financial men, these events spelled a major “busting” of the President's tight budget policy. The emergence of budget deficits, perhaps on a large scale, appeared inevit able. From that followed the ob vious deduction: The inflationary boom would soon resume. Interest rates began to move upward again as traders fore saw large demands for credit and no abating on inflation. And this, together with the corpor ate earnings reports, was un doubtedly the immediate cause of last week's further decline in the stock market. But all of the gloom may be premature. The words from Washington last week were, as expected, soothing. But they were amost certainly genuine as well. As for the danger of cumula tive recession, Paul W. McCrack en, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, cited evidence to back up his view that “the pace of the econ omy to now beginning to quick en” and that “quarterly gains in economic activity should be increasing for the remainder of the year.” More important, he said this was not inconsistent with pro gress on the inflation front. He presented a new analysis, con necting price changes in the economy one year with the rela tive sluggishness or exuberance of the economy in the previous year — a measure known as the economy's “operating rate.” By this measure, the rate of price increase will be moderat ing as 1970 goes along, even though activity is again picking up. And finally, Mr. McCracken in sisted, “the budget continues to be on a path consistent with the basic game plan... there is no reason to expect from the bud get any major deflection in the orderly course of the economy.” He gave no details on this point. Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was equally confident. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy, he said, was continuing to aim at “a middle course between con tinued inflation and a protract ed slump in economic policy.” And, he continued, “I believe this policy will succeed.” The President let it be known that he, too, was confident, and that he would soon address the general public so that it could “share his confidence.” In words that frightened many persons who remembered similar state ments in 1929, the President was even quoted by a visitor as saying, “frankly, if I had any money, I'd be buying stocks right now.” The fact is that nothing has yet happened to show that what a high official called “the hat trick of the century” — a suc cessful curbing of inflation with out a deep slump — will fall. The budgetary picture cannot be termed irretrievably bleak un til it is known what Congress will do — on expenditures and on the few but important rev enue measures such as an in crease in postal rates. Will Cambodia “bust the hudg et?” Pierre Rinfret, an econo mist noted for unequivocal and unorthodox views, said last week —before the invasion was an nounced by the President—that any significant escalation of the war would mean “the end of the American economy as we have known it.” He meant perpetual inflation and even higher interest rates, not a slump. But the bond markets were calm on Friday, presumably on the ground there is no present evidence that the Cambodian move will reverse the downward trend of defense ex penditures and the cost of the war. The wholesale price index ac tually turned down for April, on a preliminary basis, though the cause was mainly in the food area. Mr. McCracken showed that some parts of the Consumer Price Index — non food commodities, as distinct from services — have risen much less rapidly so far this year than in 1969. And, while unemployment is likely to go a little higher, there were fewer and fewer voices fearing that the decline in the economy would turn into a major recession. The American Federa tion of Labor‐Congress of Indus trial Organization was an excep tion. It spoke last week of “dan ger signals flashing almost every where that the nation's current economic recession, slump, slow down or whatever term you like may grow worse.” Confusion last week was un derstandable. But as for gloom— only events can say whether it was warranted. The ball game is far from over.

569-> PACE IS LISTLESS IN AMEX TRADING
“At least the market didn't go down.” This comment by a broker summarized the activity on the American Stock Exchange yes terday. Prices on the exchange just managed to finish slightly higher in very quiet trading. At the final bell the ex change's price‐change index was up 0.03 at 21.06. Stocks moved in a very narrow range throughout the session and there were few price changes of more than a point. Turnover dropped to 1,826, 790 shares from 2,378,660‐ shares on Monday. Only three blocks of 10,000 shares or more changed hands yesterday against eight such blocks the day before. Brokers attributed the indif ferent tone of the market to the lack of bullish economic news developments. Only one of the 10 most ac tively traded issued managed to gain more than a point. The exception was Milgo Electronic, which rose 1 3/8 to 22 3/8. The volume leader, Asamera Oil, tacked on ½ to 12 5/8 on a turnover of 66,100 shares. The new warrants of National General Corporation, the sec ond most heavily traded issue, were up ¾ to 3 7/8 on 59.600 shares. The company said it expected to earn $2.50 a share in 1970 compared with a loss of $46.4‐million, including a $23,750,000 reduction of invest ment, in 1969. National General old warrants gained a point to 6 3/8. Another stronger issue was Kriby Industries, which gained a point to 20. The company said it had made an apparent oil discovery in a partly‐owned well in Eucador. United Refining moved ahead a point to 11 5/8. The company predicted a 15 per cent in crease in second‐quarter pro fits and a 17 per cent rise in earnings for 1970. Earnings for all of 1969 amounted to $1.45 a share. Pneumo Dynamics rose ¾ to 10 5/8. The company said its subsidiary, Cleveland Pneumatic Company, had received a $25‐ million contract to produce landing gears for the McDon nell‐Douglas DC‐10 aircraft. Another stronger issue was Crestmont Oil, which advanced 5/8 to 4 7/8. Crestmont announced the completion of an oil dis covery in Polk County, Texas. Also registering gains were Digital Equipment, which rose 4 to 73¼, and Saxon Indus tries which added 2 1/8 to 55¼. Teleprompter was up 3 5/8 to 64 7/8 and H. B. American gained 1 3/8 to 18. Among the losers, Amrep slipped 3/4 to 16. Amrep and Dart Industries announced the termination of their merger dis cussions. The over‐the‐counter market ended fractionally better in very slow trading. Most price changes were under a point. Among the stronger issues were Tampax, which climbed 2 points, and L. E. Meyers, up 1 7/8 points. Recognition Equip ment advanced 1½ while Mal linckrodt Chemical and Barnes Hinds each gained a point. On the downside, Fanny May lost 2 points and Dow‐Jones lost 1 point.

571-> SILVER FUTURES SHOW PRICE RISE
Silver futures prices rose yes terday on the New York Com modity Exchange in line with increased prices received at the Government's weekly silver auction in Washington. The September futures con tract, the busiest with 391 sales, rose to $1.740 an ounce from $1.6870 the day before. The De cember contract, with 386 sales, went to $1.7530 from $1.7360 an ounce on Monday and the January contract, with 255 sales, climbed to $1.77 an ounce from $1.7530 in the previous session. The June contract, with 23 sales closed at $1.6620 an ounce compared with $1.6450 on Monday. At the Washington auction, 1,506,000 ounces of silver were sold out of 1,601,000 ounces of fered. Prices received ranged from a high of $1.6550 an ounce to a low of $1.6311. In the pre vious week's sale, prices ranged from $1.5850 to $1.5405 an ounce. Sharps, Pixley & Co., Ltd., London, bid in 483,000 ounces at $1.6350 an ounce and 126,000 ounces at $1.6311 an ounce. N. M. Rothschild & Son, also London, took 588,000 ounces at $1.6350 an ounce. The Spiral Metal Co., Inc., South Amboy, N. J., bid in 189,000 ounces at prices rang ing from $1.6410 to $1.6510 an ounce. Soybean futures prices con tinued to rise yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade with all options setting new highs for the season for the second session in a row. Soybean meal futures prices advanced also, but soybean oil closed mostly lower. The buying of soybean fu tures was again triggered by the report that caused a 3 cent a bushel advance on Monday. This stated that the Commod ity Credit Corporation would raise the minimum selling price of soybeans for September de livery. The increases in prices were the greatest for the September, November and January months. The September contracts reg istered an advance of just over 10 cents a bushel since last Tuesday. The buying was mixed, al though commercial interests were out front early in the ses sion. Short‐covering was noted as prices rose and near the close much profit‐making was evident.

577-> Legacy of Indians and Mr. Bronck
Indians, saints and accidents of spelling are among the sources from which places get their names. The Indians have left America a rich heritage in poly syllabic place names. There is a Chaubunagungamaug Pond in Massachusetts and a Chemquassabamticook stream Maine. Such names are often descriptive in very practical terms. Aswaguscawadic, N. H., is Algonquian meaning roughly, “where we have to drag canoe through stream.” In the West many places are named for saints, but not every San has a saintly heritage. San Ardo, Calif., was first named for a ranch there called San Bernardo, but the Post Office rejected it as too similar to San Bernardino. “M. J. Brandenstein, the owner of the ranch, then created what has been called a new saint by lopping off the Bern,” Dr. Stewart writes. The Bronx has a phonetic origin. In the days when Jonas Bronck had a farm north of Manhattan, people would speak of going to “the Broncks.” The English kept the pro nunciation but worked it into a new spelling.

578-> Aviation Student Is Sued Over Crash in the Rockies
FORT COLLINS, Colo., Aug. 8. A New York aviation stu dent, who crashed Monday at the base of the Colorado Rockies after his plane was caught in a down draft, now faces a complicated legal battle. Jim Naum, a 35‐year‐old high school science teacher from Flushing, Queens, had been studying for his com mercial pilot's license at the Emory Aviation School in Greeley, Colo., 60 miles north of Denver, before the mishap. He was on a solo training flight—flying a bit too low, he concedes—when an air current caught the nose of his plane and he crashed in 50‐foot waters in a mountain reservoir, taking down tele phone lines with the plane. Mr. Naum escaped serious injury but was immediately expelled from the flight school. Two days later, the owners filed a lawsuit against him for more than $31,000 for the plane; for removing it from the water; for loss of its use to the school; for interrupting business and for damage allegedly done to the school's reputation. As the New Yorker was leaving the courtroom, he was greeted by law officers who arrested him and took him to a Fort Collins jail in Larimer County, the site Of the mishap. Mr. Naum was booked for “willful destruc tion of telephone facilities” and for not having his li cense in his possession at the time of the accident. The pilot has a private license and would have received his commercial permit the week of the crash. He spent the night in jail and was released the follow ing afternoon on a personal. recognizance bond. A spokesman for the tele phone company in Greeley later disclosed that the lines that were torn down in the crash were not in service and that the phone company had planned to take them down in the near future. “We filed no claim or complaint,” he said, “because in a way he did us a service by taking the lines out for us.” But the charges against Mr. Naum still stand. Car Sale Law Tightened BOSTON, Aug. 8 (AP)—Gov. Francis W. Sargent signed into law yesterday, a measure that requires that a motor vehicle be able to pass a Registry of Motor Ve hides inspection before be ing offered in a retail sale.

579-> Clouds Appear in Labor Picture
When labor specialists last fall ran their fingers down the list of contract negotiations that were scheduled for this year, they sighed and almost unanimously agreed that it would be a troublesome year. Their predictions have held up and the picture ahead is for continued labor problems. For example, 70,000 rubber workers have con tracts that expire this month, 75,000 meat packing workers and more than 600,000 auto workers have contracts that ex pire in September. In recent days and weeks, the public has witnessed dis putes involving postal workers, air traffic controllers, truck drivers, gravediggers, railroad workers, tugboat workers (who return to work today), news paper employes, television technicians and others. While each dispute has had its own peculiarities and prob lems, several common threads have intruded into many of the negotiations, according to labor specialists. One has been the strong in flationary trend over the last three years. A second has been the spirit of rebellion evident in the country that has encouraged some union members to disre gard the advice of their union leaders. A third has been the will ingness of many public em ployes on the local, state and down and run the risk of court action and loss of jobs. None of these factors is new this year, but labor specialists generally agree, for example, that union leaders do not miss the significance when other union leaders are repudiated by their members. Nor are many public employe union leaders willing to appear less militant than their members, even if their members propose to violate the law. Last winter both President Nixon and Labor Secretary George P. Schultz suggested that labor should moderate its wage requests or it might price itself and its employers out of the market place. George Meany, president of the American Federation of La bor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, replied that no labor leader was inclined to limit demands because of the prospect of a future downturn. And he added: “If he does, he isn't going to be the head of that union very long.” Both the rate of inflation and the size of many union con tract gains recently have been very sizable in comparison with figures of four and five years ago. The cost of living rose 6.9 per cent in the New York area last year and 6.1 per cent na tionally, and those trends have largely continued this year. The Labor Department reported that negotiated wage and benefit settlements last year produced a median gain of 7.4 per cent, compared with 6 per cent the year before. All signs are that the gains will be as high, if not higher, this year. The tugboat work ers here won a new contract that will give them an aver age increase in wages and benefits of about 53.5 per cent or about 18 per cent a year, according to their union. But they were out of work for two months to accomplish that. In the public employe field, the problems have been es pecially difficult, labor special ists note, because employes have acted on what was al ways known but seldom dis cussed — namely, that the government needs certain em ployes more than they need the government. Threats of job loss and court action have largely failed, be cause government has seldom been able or willing to try to recruit an entirely new force of post office workers, for ex ample, or air traffic control lers, for another. Attempts to do so, it is known, could also provoke other unions to strike in sympathy, enlarging an al ready difficult problem.

580-> JARRING TO START TALKS ON MIDEAST AT THE U.N. TODAY
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Aug. 24—Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring said today that he would open the long‐awaited Middle East peace talks here tomorrow with the chief United Nations delegates of Israel, Jordan and the United Arab Republic. Dr., Jarring, who is Secretary General Thant's special repre sentative for the Middle East, said he would begin by meeting in his 38th‐floor office with each of the three delegates sepa rately. Asked at a news conference about controversial questions of procedure, he voiced hope that as progress was made the talks might be elevated to the level of foreign ministers. But he added that he had no fixed ideas and “there are no text books.” U.S. Seeks Truce Extension In Washington, meanwhile, the United States—whose peace initiative brought about the talks—began directing its diplo macy toward an extension of the 90‐day cease‐fire, which started Aug. 7 as part of the accord leading to the negotia tions. [Page 6.] At tomorrow's meetings, Is rael and the United Arab Republic will be represented by their chief delegates to the United Nations, Yosef Tekoah and Mohammad H. el‐Zayyat. As Dr. Jarring noted today, Jordan will be represented by her Ambassador in Washington, because her delegate here, Dr. Muhammad H. el‐Farra, is at home in Jordan. The Jordanian Ambassador is Abdel Hamid Sharaf, who has served in Washington about a year. Dr. Jarring, who was making his first public statements after two and a half years of preliminary maneuvering and diplomatic pressures to get talks started, repeatedly de clined to answer any questions about his plans for the next steps. “Procedure is something that is coming,” he commented. “It is impossible to say anything today.” The Israelis have consistently favored direct talks with the Arabs at the foreign ministers level, but have agreed to start the meetings at a lower level as a compromise. The Arab coun tries insist on indirect talks, beginning at the United Nations delegates level, with Dr. Jar ring serving as mediator. Dr. Jarring promised inten sive work once the talks be gin. Asked whether there would be a pause after to morrow's opening meetings, he said: “Well, I think we are going to start tomorrow and I hope we will be continuing every day now without any delays. At least, we are not looking for delays, I can tell you that.” Only Basic Details Are Given The Swedish diplomat made his announcement before about 200 newspaper, radio and tele vision correspondents in a big conference room used by the main Political Committee of the General Assembly. His ini tial prepared statement said: “I have pleasure in an nouncing that the Governments of Israel, Jordan and the United Arab Republic have each ap pointed representatives for the discussions to be held under my auspices for the purpose of reaching agreement on the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, and that these discussions will begin on 25 August 1970 at New York. “The parties will be repre sented in the initial stage by their permanent representa tives. “It continues to be my hope that at a later stage the discus sions can be held at the foreign ministers level. I feel sure that the parties will enter the dis cussions with the firm inten tion of finding a solution. I hope that with goodwill and under standing they will in time reach agreement on a just and lasting peace.” Eban Named by Israelis Dr. Jarring noted that Israel had already named her Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, as chief delegate to the talks, but men tioned that Mr. Tekoah was acting as alternate. He said that if the other foreign minis ters came here for the General Assembly session, which opens Sept. 15, “of course, I would be seeing all of them.” Asked whether he thought it would be necessary to extend the cease‐fire beyond the pres ent 90‐day period, Dr. Jarring said extension would make him happy but “I would be even more happy if we had found the solution before the end of the cease‐fire.” He declined to say whether he would make any proposals of his own to the parties in volved. “We have to play it to see which way we can find in the future,” he declared. “I think you have to feel your way through,” he added later. To a suggestion that the meetings might eventually be moved elsewhere, Dr. Jarring said he expected to limit them “to my office upstairs on the 38th floor.” Top‐Floor Security Is Tight That floor, the highest in the headquarters building, has elab orate security measures and no intrusion is feared there. Dr. Jarring did not rule out contact with the Big Four—the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union—which have been holding their own meetings in New York in an effort to resolve the Middle Eastern crisis, but he indicated that they would not figure pre dominantly in his procedures. Today's announcement rep resented a further success for an initiative undertaken this summer by the United States to break a two‐year deadlock blocking progress on the Jar ring mission. On June 19, Secretary of State William P. Rogers pro posed a new effort to carry out negotiations under Resolu tion 242 of the Security Coun cil to persuade Israel to evacu ate occupied Arab territories and persuade the Arab coun tries to make a formal peace with Israel and guarantee her boundaries. The meetings tomorrow are the first step in beginning such negotiations under the guidance of Dr. Jarring. Reso lution 242 was adopted by the Security Council on Nov. 22, 1967, following the Arab‐Israeli war of June 5 to 10 in that year. The main obstacles to prog ress since then have been Is rael's insistence that not all of the occupied territory can be given up and the Arabs de mands that all of it be eva cuated before they discuss per manent frontiers.

582-> A Study in Pollution Control: How Seattle Cleaned Up Its Water
SEATTLE—A few weeks ago, a Seattle newspaper carried brief ‘article under the head line: “Flow of Raw Sewage In to Elliot Bay Ends.” The gist of the item was that the last two sources of raw sewage on the bay, an arm of Puget Sound that forms much of downtown Seattle's water front, had been connected with a centralized metropolitan sewerage system. The event, long anticipated here, attracted little attention among the nearly 400,000 users of the vast network of inter ceptor lines and treatment plants. But for people inter ested in pollution control, it was good news and it was im portant news. For the forging of the last link in the sewerage system marks the culmination of 10‐year, $145‐million program that is a case study in how community willing to pay the price can clear up its water. The ambitious program, car ried out by an organization formally named the Municipal ity of Metropolitan Seattle but known localy as “Metro” for short, is regarded by environ mentalists as exemplary in many ways. Metro went to work long be fore saving the environment became a popular issue. It has succeeded in harnessing to gether the divergent interests and efforts of 18 separate met ropolitan governmental units. And it has been paid for al most entirely by local bond issues. The White House Council on Environmental Quality, in its first annual report, cited Seat tle's Metro project as one bf the two outstanding anti‐pollu tion success stories in the na tion. The other was the clean ing tin of San Diego Bay. Greater Seattle is 80 per cent surrounded by water, and its pollution problem was com pounded by geography and political structure. On the west lies Puget Sound. To the east is the freshwater Lake Wash ington, 20 miles long and two to four miles wide, bordered by many incorporated towns. The outlet for Lake Washing ton is the Duwamish River, which empties into Elliott Bay. This was the situation in 1958 when Metro was formed to deal with the sewage prob lem. On the Seattle waterfront and the Duwamish, there were four primary treatment plants. (A primary plant settles out solids and removes about 35 per cent of the organic matter.) But there were also 46 “out falls” dumping 70 million gal lons of raw sewage a day into Puget Sound. The deep sound, with its tidal flow, might have been able to handle this if the out falls had been located off‐shore in deep water with defuser at tachments. But they were close to shore. The result, according to Charles V. Gibbs, executive di rector of Metro, “was not only a terrible esthetic prob lem but a terrible bacterio logical problem as well.” The raw, stinking discharge floated around the docks and shore line. Almost all beaches were closed as unsafe. Around Lake Washington, where suburbia had prolifer ated since World War H, there were 10 secondary sewage plants discharging 20 million, gallons of treated effluent into the lake each day from 23 cities and sewer districts. (A secondary plant removes 85 to 90 per cent of organic matter.) The problem in Lake Wash ington was not bacteria; it was nutrients — phosphorous and nitrogen compounds in the effluent that stimulated the growth of algae. When the algae died and de composed, oxygen in the water was depleted. The result was a cloudy lake, foul‐smelling and full of scum. The transparen cy of the lake—measured by the depth to which a white, eight‐inch disc is visible below the surface—decreased from 12 feet in 1950 to about two and one‐half feet in 1958. Many of the beaches on the lake were closed. Salmon suf fered as the dissolved oxygen became exhausted in the deep water. Dr. W. T. Edmonson, a zo ologist at the University of Washington who began to study the pollution of Lake Washington back in 1952, de scribed the irony of the situa tion in the late ‘fifties. Noting that 10 treatment plants had been constructed since 1941 to deal with the “intolerable” con tamination from raw sewage, he wrote that “the situation had been changed from one in which the lake was con taminated with organic wastes to one in which it was being fertilized with inorganic ‘plant food.’ “ It was the studies of Dr. Edmondson and others by Dr. Robert O. Sylvester, a pro fessor of civil engineering at the University of Washington, that provided the spur for the creation of Metro. The princi pal civic force involved was the Municipal League of Port land. And the principal leader was James R. Ellis, who in 1953 was 32 years old, just three years out of law school and deputy prosecuting at torney for King's County, which includes Seattle and its environs. In 1953, at the urging of Mr. Ellis, the Municipal League set up a Metropolitan Prob lems Committee, which spent two years digging into the problem of sewage pollution. It was obvious to the com mittee that the problem could be solved only if a system was developed to serve the entire drainage basin. But such a system not only presented complicated design problems; it also raised jurisdictional problems on financing. Exist ing plants, some of them be ing financed by bond issues, would have to be abandoned. The suburban cities would have to be recompensed. In 1956, the Municipal League recommended that the Mayor of Seattle appoint a citizens’ committee to prepare a report and draft legislation to create a metropolitan au thority to deal with areawide problems. The Mayor did so and named Mr. Ellis as chair man. The same year the state, county and city com bined to hire Brown & Caldwell, a sanitary engineering firm, to prepare an area sewage plan. The citizens’ committee was ambitious. It wrote legisla tion permitting the formation of a “Metro” that would deal not only with sewage dis posal but also with transporta tion and comprehensive land use planning. The state legislature passed the bill in April, 1957. But the actual establishment of Metro required a majority vote in both Seattle and the county. In March, 1958 the voters of Seattle approved it, but it was defeated in the outlying county and thereby killed. The citizens’ committee thereupon redrafted the legisla tion to limit Metro's authority to sewage disposal, and city and county voters approved it in September, 1958. Two Bond Issues Passed As one of its first acts, the 21 members of Metro's de cision‐making body adopted the plan prepared by Brown & Caldwell. It provided for re tention of one small existing primary treatment plant on Puget Sound, and the construc tion of four large new plants —three primary plants on the sound and one secondary plant on the Duwamish. A total of 110 miles of interceptor lines and 19 pumping plants would channel the sewage to the treatment plants. All 10 plants on Lake Washington would be abandoned, and no more ef fluent would go into the lake. All raw sewage discharges into the sound would be halted. The original plan called for a bond issue of $125‐million, but extension of the system to some suburbs not originally in cluded has required a supple mentary $20‐millionbond issue. The bonds were to have been paid by additional sewer charges of $2.50 a month for each residential connection, with a proportionately higher charge for commercial and in dustrial connections. How ever, by careful planning, the residential fee was reduced to $2 a month before construction began in 1961 and has been kept at that figure. Because it was begun long before passage of the Clean Waters Restoration Act of 1966, which provided Federal grants of up to 55 per cent of the cost of a sewage project, the Metro system has received less than 6 per cent of its financing from the Federal Government. The system is now in full operation. The beaches on the sound and on Lake Washington are now open. In Lake Wash ington, phosphorous, which was 70 parts per billion in 1963, has fallen to 29 parts per billion, and summertime transparency has increased to nine feet. There has been a 90 per cent reduction in the oxygen demand of the effluent released into the Duwamish River, and salmon can now migrate to their spawning grounds. “Without achieving a miracle or a utopia,” Mr. Ellis said, “Metro has nevertheless brought its civic activists some satisfying rewards. It has dem onstrated the great potential, of local Initiative in the Fed eral‐state‐local framework.”

585-> Unmanned Soviet Spacecraft Goes Into Orbit Around Moon
MOSCOW, Sept. 17 —The Soviet Union announced today that its unmanned Luna 16 spacecraft, launched on Satur day, had gone into orbit around the moon. In the first official report on Luna 16's progress since the launching, Tass, the official So viet press agency, said that the circular orbit was 66 miles from the moon's surface. It is not known if the craft will try to land on the moon. Tass, in its first announce ment on Saturday night, said that the goal of the flight was to conduct research of the moon and the space near the moon, the same general goal that was given for Luna 15, which orbited the moon and crashed into it in July, 1969. The Luna 15 craft received enormous publicity abroad be cause it was launched into space three days ahead of the American Apollo 11 craft which made the first manned landing on the moon. Some observers at the time had speculated that Luna 15 would try to land, scoop up rock, and return to earth ahead of the Americans. But the Soviet Union never gave Luna 15 more than routine publicity during its mission. It was not discussed in the press after it crashed, suggesting that it was a failure. Some observ ers here, believe that Luna 16, in a rather low orbit, may make a soft landing and perhaps send some television pictures back to earth. Soviet space officials have sought in recent months to take some of the “sensation” out of space flights, although the most recent manned Soyuz missions have received extensive pub licity here. The chief Soviet goals in space are the creation of a manned laboratory orbit ing the earth, and further ex ploration of space by unmanned craft. The publicity for Luna 16, while scant, was about the same as that given for Luna 15 and for Luna 14. The last named circled the moon in April, 1968, but did not land or return to earth. Tass said that Luna 16 was orbiting the moon at a 70 de gree angle to the moon's equa tor, and was circling every hour and 59 minutes.

588-> Suspect in Bombing Conspiracy Foiled in an Attempt to Escape
Samuel J. Melville, accused of being the explosives expert in a group that was alleged to have bombed six buildings in Manhattan last fall; over powered an, unarmed marshal and tried to escape from cus tody at the Federal Courthouse last Saturday. The United States Attorney': office and Mr. Melville's lawyer agreed to keep this secret, anc planned to arraign him on the escape charges privately, they disclosed during a hearing last night. Federal sources said yester day that the husky, 34‐year‐old defendant had been ap prehended at gunpoint as he was running down a flight of stairs in the building, which is locked and almost deserted on Saturdays. Mr. Melville, who has been held in $100,000 bail on Fed eral charges, has been in the Federal House of Detention, 427 West Street, since his arrest last November. On Tuesday, he was denied bail on separate state charges, because, according. to the judge, unless he was detained, it would be unlikely that he would ap pear at the trial. Agreement Is Reached Assistant United States At torney John J. Doyle 3d, in the hearing before Judge Milton Pollack yesterday, said he had agreed with Mr. Melville's law yer, William E. Crain, that he would seek a Federal grand jury indictment but would have Mr. Melville plead to it before the judge. As soon as articles about the escape and about a possible link between Mr. Melville's case and more recent bombings on West 11th Street appeared in yesterday's New York Post, Mr. Crain said, “a fair trial be came impossible,” and he moved for a delay of 90 days In the trial. Judge Pollack said that he would rule on the new motions this afternoon, and also would consider a hearing to determine the source of the Post articles. Sources in the office of United States Attorney Whit ney North Seymour Jr. were silent when they were asked about the attempted escape. The case is scheduled to go to trial in Federal Court next Wednesday. Mr. Melville's co defendants, John D. Hughey 3d of 228 East Third Street and Jane L. Alpert of 235 East Fourth Street, are free on bail. The abortive escape attempt took place during a private con ference between Mr. Melville and Mr. Crain. Mr. Melville has refused to help his lawyer prepare his de fense in the Federal jail, which he fears is “bugged,” so the court arranged to make a con ference room on the fifth floor of the Courthouse in Foley Square available to them last weekend. One Marshal Carries Gun Two marshals, Richard Hiller and James R. Barefoot, accom panied the two men to the con ference room. Mr. Barefoot, the only one carrying a gun, left the others for a moment and Mr. Crain then left to confer with Federal prosecutors. According to reliable reports, Mr. Hiller said he was “jumped” by the more power ful Mr. Melville, who knocked him down, tied him up with the marshal's own belt and ran from the room. Mr. Barefoot returned, saw Mr. Hiller on the floor, ran back out into the hallway and saw the stairway door closing. He gave chase and drew pistol on Mr. Melville, who had reached the third‐floor landing, “Halt or I'll fire,” Mr. Barefoot said, and he and his revived companion then returned the defendant to his cell.

589-> Danes, Under Fire, Willing to Curb Salmon Catch
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, March 17—Denmark has out lined far‐reaching fishing re strictions that she said she would accept to reduce inter national dissension over the plight of the Atlantic salmon. But the Danes made it clear at a monthly Scandinavian min isterial meeting yesterday that they would continue to reject the appeal of Britain, Canada, the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries for an outright ban on salmon fishing on the high seas. Heavy Danish catches off Greenland are said by many to be disrupting the salmon's life‐cycle and depleting the sal mon streams of Scotland, Maine, Canada and other areas. Denmark says the case is un proved, but prime ministers and princes have joined sports men and gourmets in express ing alarm. Ministers of fisheries and ag riculture from Denmark, Nor way and Sweden discussed the salmon issue at the Prince Hamlet Hotel in the Danish coastal city of Helsingor, which Shakespeare called Elsinore. The restrictions being dis cussed include cutting a few months off the fishing season, geographical limitations and a coarser mesh in the nets to permit smaller fish to escape. Denmark has also offered to take a larger role in stockings salmon streams. The Danish Fisheries Minis ter, A. C. Normann, relaxing after the meeting, lamented the fact that salmon stirred such strong emotion and added: “When someone said in the British Parliament recently, ‘Something's rotten in the state Denmark,’ I guess they were (referring to me. We seemed to be blamed for everything.” However, Swedish represent atives said at the meeting that Sweden would soon join Den mark and West Germany in rejecting the personal appeal from Prime Minister Wilson for a 10‐year ban on salmon fish ing. Mr. Wilson took the politi cal initiative to try to break the deadlock. Under the rules of the 14‐ nation North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, in which the Soviet Union, Poland and Western European countries promote high, sustainable veilds the objection of three members can block a recom mendation. One of the more emotional aspects of the controversy has been the allegation that since Denmark does little to cultivate her own salmon, she is taking the salmon of Britain, Canada and other countries that have spent millions of dollars stock ing their own streams. The streams are stocked in expectations that baby salmon, after feeding in the Atlantic for a year or so, will return as 10‐pound fish to spawn—and to be caught at home. The Danes intercept them in their feeding grounds. Mr. Normann, rejecting that argument, said that since the salmon fed on small fish off Greenland, which is constitu tionally integrated with Den mark, Greenland and Denmark should be conceded their rights in international waters. The Danes acknowledge that catches have declined in some home streams, but they attrib ute the drop to disease and to increased pollution. The British view is that the major environ mental change in the life of the Atlantic salmon is the sharply increased Danish fishing since 1967.

590-> Reed, Despite Damaged Knee, Holds Up as Pressure Grows
Since Jerry West's injured thumb “limited” him to 37 points and 18 assists in the overtime victory the Los An geles Lakers scored Friday night what can the New York Knickerbockers expect from Willis Reed's ailing knee? The four‐of‐seven series for the championship of the National Basketball Association is tied at 2‐2. When it resumes at Madison Square Garden tomorrow night, with a sixth game scheduled for Los Angeles Wednesday and a seventh, if needed, for the Garden Friday, the condition of Red's chronically painful limb may develop into the decisive factor. West's injury, a legitimate one suffered during Wednes day's game (which the Knicks won in overtime), responded to almost 48 continuous hours of medical treatment and al lowed him to play his best game of the series Friday. “But if the game had been scheduled for Thursday, there is no way I could have made it,” he declared afterward. But Reed's injury, the result of attrition rather than any single accident, may prove more serious. It is not, for tunately, a cartilage situation that will require surgery, but it is a bad enough muscular strain that has been bothering the Knick captain on and off since before midseason. Reed has taken repeated doses of cortisone, in the form of injections and in the form of pills, during the last month or so. The injury is painful at all times. At one point in the Baltimore series, which went through seven tough games, Reed was visibly slowed down for two games. After Friday night's game, despite his almost fanatic de termination to minimize his condition, Willis had to admit it was pretty bad again. “The two days off may help me,” he said. But as of tomorrow night, he will face two games in three nights and possibly three in five. There is no question Reed will play, and probably play well, until and unless he actu ally collapses. But the cumula tive wear and tear can't be ignored. The sixth game of this series will be the 100th played this season by the Knicks and Reed has missed only one. Since March 24, under the greatest competitive pressure. Reed has gone head ‐ to ‐ head with Wes Unseld for seven games, Lew Alcindor for five and Wilt Chamberlain for four. And yet, in these 14 games, Reed has averaged 29.6 points and 17.5 rebounds, while prov ing again his defensive skill and his right to the most valuable player award by the timing of his best efforts. In fact, one of the most strik ing features of these truly re markable playoffs is the way so many of these highly paid pro fessionals drive themselves de spite their aches. Elgin Baylor, who will be 33 this year, is wrapped in bandages from toes to armpits and has had knee injuries seri ous enough to end a career three times over. Yet he found a 30‐point performance within himself Friday in the victory that kept Los Angeles alive and he has played brilliantly the whole series. Chamberlain, of course, had knee surgery less than six months ago and yet he is play ing spectacularly. Dick Barnett, who will be 34 this fall, had a “career ‐ ending” Achilles heel injury three years ago—and he's the only Knick starter who has played every, game this year. West's career, interrupted many times by leg injuries, also includes 11 broken noses. Dave DeBusschere has an ankle that is far from 100 per cent, but he goes on pounding the floor game after game. Meanwhile, for the fans, the thrills are piling up almost be yond one's capacity to assimi late them — with the real de cisions still to come. In Friday night's game, the Knicks started off with a hot hand, hitting nine of their first 11 shots for an 18‐10 lead, with Barnett hitting five straight. But the shooting cooled, and the Lakers outplayed them for the rest of the half, which ended with Los Angeles leading, 54‐47. The Lakers led by 11 in the third quarter, but they hit their cold spell, and the Knicks pulled even at 79‐79 with 7:43 to play. Down by 6 with less than four minutes left, the Knicks rallied and took a 97‐96 lead on Bill Bradley's basket at 0:47. West tied it at 0:42, Walt Frazier made It 99‐97 with two free throws at 0:35, and Baylor matched them at 0:23. John Tresvant who hadn't played yet in this series, en tered the game for the Lakers in the final minute and helped spoil the play the Knicks set up for the final shot, which was ultimately taken and missed by Frazier. Then, after the first 90 sec onds of overtime left the teams even at 103‐103, West, Baylor and Tresvant set off a rally (with help from Chamberlain and Keith Erickson) to 114‐107 and the game ended at 121‐115. It was the third overtime game for each team in the playoffs. The Knicks defeated Baltimore, the Lakers defeated Atlanta, and they split with each other. FRIDAY NIGHT ??

591-> REPORT ON CAMBODIA BY NIXON IS PLANNED
WASHINGTON, June 23 (AP) —President Nixon plans to de liver a summation on the Cam bodian aspect of the Indochina war during a week or more to be spent largely at the western White House at San Clemente, Calif. Mr. Nixon has promised that all United States combat forces will be out of Cambodia by June 30. The report is expected around that date, with no spe cific time set yet. The White House said there had been no decision whether the report would be broadcast. The President will leave for California Thursday and stop in St. Louis to address the 50th anniversary convention of the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce. The stay on the coast is ex pected to last through July 4. The White House noted that the President had scheduled dinner in Washington July 10 to mark the 25th anniversary of the United Nations. On Saturday, Lawrene Mae Nixon, daughter of the Presi dent's brother F. Donald, is be ing married in Newport Beach, calif. The White House did not say definitely that President Nixon would he on hand, but Julie Nixon Eisenhower said yesterday that her parents and sister, Tricia, would attend. Mrs. Eisenhower and her hus band, David, are staying behind in Washington.

592-> MITCHELL AIDES TO VISIT COLLEGES
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2— Teams of Justice Department officials will fan out across the country next month in an effort to convince college students that the Justice Department's policies are not repressive to ward criminal suspects or luke warm on civil rights. Assistant Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, who is in charge of the program, said to day that at least 50 college and university campuses would be visited in October. The object, he said, is to dispel a belief among many students that the Justice Department is following unenlightened policies and to hear the students’ complaints. It is a coincidence, Mr. Ruck elshaus said, that the month long effort will take place just before the general election Nov. 3. He said that October had been selected because stu dents would be getting settled at the start of the fall semester, and that would be a good time to catch their ears. Seven teams are being or ganized. Each will be headed by a top Justice Department official, aided by two lawyers, one who has been working on the department's crime pro gram and another who has been dealing with civil rights. The format will stress ques tions and answers, Mr. Ruckels haus said. He added that the program would not be affected by the Hatch Act, which forbids po litical activity by certain Fed eral employes, because the vis its were intended to be infor mational and not political. “We will go to rationally convince the students that the Justice Department is not re pressive,” Mr. Ruckelshaus said in an interview today. He said that although students were mistaken in their impressions of the department, their con cern was sincere and appar ently widespread. Attorney General John N. Mitchell first mentioned the idea of visiting college cam puses during a television inter view early last month. About 200 invitations have come from campuses in reaction to that, according to Mr. Ruckelshaus. The 50 campuses to be visited will be chosen to span the en tire country and to include large, small, public and private institutions. Invitations will not be accepted from student polit ical groups of any orientation, and efforts will be made to have the meetings sponsored by the colleges themselves. For the last several months, Mr. Mitchell has frequently ex pressed concern that the Jus tice Department has acquired a mistakenly harsh image among students. He has begun to appear more frequently be fore the press and has relaxed into a more genial public de meanor than the unsmiling presence that earned him “prosecutor” image. He has also made strong statements in support of the Supreme Court and of the de sirability of encouraging dis sent.

594-> BROOKE SAYS NIXON SHUNS BLACK NEEDS
WASHINGTON, March 11 (UPI)—Senator Edward W. Brooke charged today that the Nixon Administration had made a “cold, calculated political de cision” to ignore the needs of blacks as part of a strategy to win re‐election in 1972. The Senate's only Negro said that he and other Republicans who worked for President Nixon's election in 1968 be cause he had promised to “bring us together” were now “deeply concerned about the lack of commitment to equal op portunities for all people.” “It appears to me that the strategy is to appeal to the same voters that the Adminis tration appealed to in the 1968 election and that is generally suburbia, white middle‐class America,” the Massachusetts’ Senator said. “I think it's a rather cold, calculated political decision made by the President and his advisers, “ he continued. “The climate that has been created now is very, very dangerous.” Senator Brooke made the charge in an interview with the Columbia Broadcasting System and later expanded on it in talking to reporters.

595-> Odissey House Chief Defends Release of 12‐Year‐Old Addict
Dr. judianne Densen‐Gerber, the clinical director of Odyssey 140iise, a group of private treat ment centers for narcotics ad dicts, said yesterday that she bad received numerous calls from persons Inquiring about a 12‐year‐old addict who left a center on East 87th Street Sun da5i at his own requeest. Some of the callers, Dr. Den sen‐Gerber said, were irate. The boy, Ralph de Jesus, at tracted national’ attention and concern on Feb. 26, when he testified, sitting on Dr. Densen Gerber's lap before the Joint Legislative Committee on Pro tection of Children and Youth and Drug Abuse. The testi mony of the snort, frail boy caused one legislator to break down and cry. Although Dr. Densen‐Gerber said that Ralph had been taken home to his parents by Odyssey Housse personnel be cause he was too young and because he did not want to re main at the treatment center. questions had been raised con cerning her responsibility to the 12‐year‐old. “Should I have tied him up?” Dr. Densen‐Gerber asked. “Should I have put bars on the windows?” Dr. Densen‐Gerber added that Ralph had to have special privileges not given to the 130 adolescents in the, centers. He vias read bedtime stories and was taken home each day to see his parents. “After the fifth visit,” Dr. Densen‐Gerber said, “the other children in the community re sented it. They also resented his not having to follow the rules they had to follow.” She said that Ralph was told that he would have to follow the same rules as the other adolescents—there are two 13 year‐olds—and he asked to go home. “So we took him home to his mother.” Because therapeutic commu nities—there are about a dozen organizations with such cen ters here—have no bars or locked doors, residents can leave at any time. The procedure taken by Odyssey House when one of its residents wants to leave, acording to Dr. Densen‐Gerber, is to first try to convince lira to stay. ‐ If he does not want to remain, he is given carfare if he is an adult. If he is an adolescent, his parents are re quested to pick him up. In Ralph's case, because he was the youngest addict that the Ilfacility has had, officials from Odyssey HouSe took him to his mother. Dr. Densen‐Gerber said she wrote a registered letter to Commissioner Lawrence Pierce, head of the State Narcotic Ccin trol Commission, 24 hours after Ralph was admitted on Feb. 18, requesting permission to house Ralph in an infant's ther apeutic community. She has not received an answer. “If Lawrence Pierce ‘with his millions of dollars to spend and if Larry Alan Bear [the Com missioner of the city's Addic tion Services Agency] with his millions can do nothing for the Ralphies, unfortunately I with minus $1,300 a day am too tired to crawl to court. A spokesman for the State Narcotic Addiction Control Commission said yesterday that a popular “misconception” about the commission was that it could “pull anybody off the streets who is an addict.” The spokesman said that the parents of Ralph, or any other relative, could take him to court. The judge would decide whether he was an addict and he could be committed to the custody of the commission‐for three years. Because the state has no fa cilities in its 11 narcotics hoipi tals for youngsters under 16, they are sent to a state training school for delinquents where there. are some facilities ‘for treating young addicts. Mr. Bear said that there was a youth outpatient center close to Ralph at 774‐776 Westchester Avenue in the Bronx. He added that youngsters and teen‐agers come to the center when they are referred by parents and teachers. Ralph's brother, Peter, 21, reached at home, said that his mother had no.plans to commit Ralph to a state institution or to a youth center. “He is going to school and doing fine and he isn't taking drugs,” Peter said. Peter, who was released from the Army to help take cate,of his family, which is on welfare —his father suffers from acute asthma—said that he was ex posed to the “jitterbugs” at school when he was growing up, but that his father kept him in line. “He is too sick to run after Ralphie; but I'm keep ing an eye on him now.”

596-> Girl to Manage American Symphony
A little more than a year and a half ago, Cathy French, 22 years old and newly grad uated from Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, spatted an employment ad that appealed to her. “Gal Friday, concert business,” it read. She answered it and was hired by the American Sym phony Orchestra. “I got my job through The New York Times,” Miss French said yesterday. And what a jab it turned out to be! She has just been ap pointed to the newly created post of executive director of the American Symphony Or chestra, which was founded in 1962 by Leopold Stokow ski, who is still its music director. The orchestra is giving 14 pairs of subscrip tion concerts at Carnegie Hall this season. Miss French's appointment was announced by Samuel Rubin, president of the orchestra, who said “Mr. Sto kowski showed us that there can be no discrimination be tween men and women in an orchestra.” “Talent is the governing factor,” he said. “The same applies to the behind‐the scenes picture of an orches tra and we are fortunate to have found in Miss French person with all the qualifi cations her post demands.” “I am always in favor of giving opportunity to youth so that they develop respon sibility and more understanding about life today,” Mr. Stokowski said. As executive director, Miss French will work closely ‘with both men in directing the affairs of the orchestra. She will conduct its business, which involves negotiation of contracts with soloists and guest conductors, office ad ministration and fund‐raising, among other things. The person responsible for these matters in most other symphony orchestra organi zations is the manager, but the American Symphony Or chestra prefers the title of executive director for this post at this time. The title may be new but the work is famiilar to Miss French, who has been doing much of it since the begin ning of this season. In any case, she does not seem to regard her progress from dal Friday to executive director’ as a particularly surprising development. “Since I came here,” she explained, “I've been in volved at one time or another in all aspects of the’ work and, having been business manager of my college glee club, which gave a concert every year in New York, knew about renting a hall, pricing a house for ticket sales and that sort of thing before I arrived.” A man in the music field who has worked with her said she learns fast. “She al ready knows all the artist managers,” he noted “and she knows how to negotiate effectively with them.” One of her particular inter ests is assisting in the musi cal education of youngsters, and she is making plans for “Show and Tell” concerts for children in the first, second and third grades. Miss French, who majored in music history and music education in college, lives in Bergenfield, N. J., with her family. She attends all of the orchestra's Monday ‐ evening concerts and most of those it gives on Sunday afternoons. Asked if she goes to other musical events,” she said: “I love opera. And I go when I can, about once a month or so.”

597-> JOE PYNE, 44, DIES; ABRASIVE TV HOST
HOLLYWOOD, March 24 (AP) —Joe Pyne, the aggressive tel evision and radio talk show host whose reputation rested on his ability to anger his guests, died last night of can cer at Cedars of Lebanon Hos pital. His age was 44. He leaves his wife, Britt; his mother, a son and two daughters. At the peak of his career, In 1966, Mr. Pyne had a syndicat ed television talk show on Met romedia stations and a syndi cated radio show on 254 sta tions, including WNBC in New York. He earned about $200,000 a year. Critics of Mr. Pyne's on‐the air technique called him “Killer Joe” and the “ranking nuisance of broadcasting.” He insulted his guests continually, calling them such things as “stupid,” “jerk” and “meatball.” “I'm not a nice guy,” he told an interviewer, “and I don't want to be.” Mr. Pyne devoted great por tions of his interview, programs to extreme polemicists, to huck sters, to those who contended that they were merely passing through earth en route to other planets. “If I bring kooks on,” said Mr. Pyne, “it's to expose them.” His critics were shocked at his asking an epileptic: “Just why do you think people should feel sorry for you?” Once when a guest questioned the provisions of the McCarran Act, Mr. Pyne asked: “What do you get out of this, going around and making life easier for the Communists?” Mr. Pyne said he did not want intellectual exercises on his programs. “The subject must be visceral,” he said once, “We want emotion, not mental involvement.” Mr. Pyne was born in Ches ter, Pa. In World War II, he was a Marine, winning three battle stars and losing his left leg. A heavy smoker, Mr. Pyne once said that although he real ized cigarettes might cause can cer, he would “rather take chance than be a fat neurotic.” When he learned he had cancer, he stopped smoking.

598-> DEFENSE IS ENDED IN ADDONIZIO CASE
TRENTON, July 16—The de fense rested today in the trial of Hugh J. Addonizio, former Mayor of Newark, and four other men charged with extor tion and conspiracy The sequestered jury is ex pected to begin deliberation on a verdict Tuesday, after legal motions, summations by the de fense and prosecution and the legal charge by Federal Judge George H. Barlow. The trial, which began in United States District Court on June 2, ran through the Newark mayoral election on June 16, in which Mr. Addonizio was defeated by Kenneth Gibson, an engineer. Mr. Addonizio had charged, when postponement was denied at the outset of the trial, that he was the victim of political persecution. He had been Mayor for eight years and had served in the House of Representatives as a New Jer sey Congressman for the pre ceding 12 years. The proceedings here were the outgrowth of an indictment handed up last December by a Federal grand jury in Newark against 15 persons. Two of those indicted died before the trial began, and the cases of eight others have been severed because of illness or for other reasons. Anthony (Tony Boy) Boiardo, alleged Mafia leader and the most important defendant, after Mr. Addonizio, suffered a heart attack in jail on July 5. As a consequence he was separated from the other defendants for possible trial later. Another defendant, James T. Callaghan, a former member of the Newark City Council, was severed after he pleaded guilty on June 26 to an income tax charge of failure to report sums that he received as alleged “kickbacks.” The remaining defendants, besides Mr. Addonizio, whose cases will go to the jury, are Anthony P. LaMorte, executive director of the Newark Utilities Authority; Philip Gordon, for mer Newark Corporation Coun sel, and Joseph Biancone and Ralph Vicaro, associates of Boiardo, who has been de scribed by witnesses as “col lector” of kickbacks for the al leged conspirators. Judge Barlow had told the lawyers that the jurors were becoming restive after more than five weeks of confinement and isolation from their fam ilies and from all sources of news. The judge announced to the jurors today that they might realistically expect to hear summations on Monday. The final defense move this morning was to recall Paul W. Rigo, engineering contractor who had been the prosecution's key witness, to try to authenti cate accounting records and other documents as the basis for analytical testimony by an accountant. However, Mr. Rigo testified in the absence of the jury that while he could identify his own signature on checks, he could not remember or did not know anything about the accounts of his five companies, known as Charles H. Capen Associates, Capen‐Rigo Associates, Con strad, Pach and Loripaul. Mr. Rigo had previously testified, chiefly on the basis of entries in his diary, that he had paid thousands of dollars in cash kickbacks by those companies to the defendants on Newark city contracts. The total of such kickbacks, which was a basis for 65 counts of extortion in the indictment, was $253,000. The first count charged the defendants with conspiracy. Each of the 66 counts carries a maximum pen alty of 20 years and all the counts are applicable to every defendant under the con spiracy charge.

599-> Spending Plans for Year Cut by Business
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2—As widely anticipated, business has again revised downward its plans for investment in plant and equipment this year, the Commerce Department and the Securities and Exchange Com mission reported today. The new estimate puts the dollar value of investment this year at $80.52‐billion, up 6.6 per cent from last year. This contrasts with estimated in creases of 9.7 per cent in February and 7.8 per cent in May. ‘What is more, spending in the current third quarter is projected at an annual rate more than $2‐billion less than in the May survey, and actual spending in the second quarter turned out $440‐million less than planned. However, this latest survey gave no indication of an actual downturn in plant and equip ment investment. Each quarter of the year, if plans materialize, will show higher outlays than the preceding quarter. These were the new quarterly figures, at annual rates: First quarter (actual)— $78.22‐billion. Second quarter (actual) —$80.22‐billion. Third quarter (planned) —$81.05‐billion. Fourth quarter (planned) —$82.24‐billion. The report said that planned investment in the second half of the year had been revised downward by about 2 per cent since the survey taken in May and published in June. The planned 1970 increase of 6.6 per cent in plant and equipment investment is far less than the booming 11.5 per cent rise in 1969 over 1968. With prices of constuction and machinery rising, the physical volume of investment this year may show almost no increase, though there are no precise figures on this. A decline in plant and equip ment outlays has typically been associated with recessions— partly as a result and partly as a cause. There is no sign of such a decline this year, though the capital investment sector is clearly much less of an upward thrusting force than it was. Today's report would be con sistent with the widespread forecast of a sluggish recovery in the economy in the second half of the year, with invest ment outlays rising by only about $1‐billion a quarter. The report said that “downward revisions of the 1970 pro grams are shown for all major industry divisions except com munications.” Utilities showed little change from the May sur vey. In manufacturing, investment for the year is projected at $32.05‐billion, up only 1.2 per cent from 1969, contrasted with a leap of 11.7 per cent in 1969 over 1968. Manufacturing spending is put at a rate of $31.21‐billion in the third quar actual decline from the second quarter and about $2‐ billion below the May estimates. The fourth quarter is expected to show a small rise to $32.15‐ billion, still under the rate of the first half of the year and less than the spending rate in the final quarter of 1969. Thus the bulk of the down ward revision of spending plans has been in manufacturing, though transportation also showed a sizable drop. Real economic growth will pick up again around the turn of the year, the First National City Bank of New York said yesterday. An increase in industrial pro duction, a sharp rise in new orders for durable goods, slowdown in the rate of in crease in consumer prices and stock market gains all indicated that the tone and the tempo of the economy had been changing for the better in recent weeks, the bank said. A significant factor in ap praising the early strength of the busines revival is “the un questioned mildness of the ad justment that has occurred so far in production and inven tories,” the bank added. While the weakness of the most recent downturn was no guarantee that the coming up swing would be equally slug gish, there was the possibility the economy would slither in an essentially sidewise movement for a longer period than was typical of most cyclical turning points, it stated.

601-> Washington: ‘The Heart of the Trouble’
WASHINGTON, May 2—In announcing his decision to ex pand the Indochina war, Presi dent Nixon said he was going “to the heart of the trouble,” and if you accept this as true, it is easy to approve his deci sion. But is it true? “Our third choice,” he said, “is to go to the heart of the trouble. And that means clear ing out major North Vietnamese and Vietcong‐occupied terri tories, these sanctuaries which serve as bases for attacks on both Cambodia and American and South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam as well.” But the heart of the trouble is not in Cambodia, but in North Vietnam and beyond that, in the Soviet Union and Com munist China. This is where the power comes from. This is what we have been up against from the beginning. The real sanctuaries, which Mr. Nixon wisely is not prepared to chal lenge, are Hanoi, Peking and Moscow, and that being so, it is a thunderingly silly argument to suggest that wiping out the enemy's bases in Cambodia will get to the “heart of the trouble.” There is a good case to be made for attacking the enemy's bases in Cambodia—always has been. Some of them are only 33 miles from Saigon. No gen eral with the brains of a cor poral would willingly give his opponent a safe haven from which Saigon could be attacked in the night or even destroyed by relatively short‐range mis siles which Moscow and Peking have the power to provide. But why can't this plain and sensible tactical battlefield case be made honestly? The Presi dent explained the move into Cambodia, not as a necessary tactical invasion—which it un doubtedly is—to reduce casual ties and save the staggering Cambodian Government through the coming monsoon season; but he presented it as some kind of magical stroke that would stun the enemy, wipe out the sanctuaries, bring the boys back home quicker, prove our determination to the Russians and the Chinese, and help ar range a just and lasting peace. He asked the American people if they wanted to cut casualties, bring the boys back home, be faithful to their promises, defend the integrity and commitments of their coun try, and support their fighting men; or whether they wanted to abandon their soldiers, their allies, their principles, and their promises. And all this, he in sisted, depended on whether they supported his decision to invade the enemy's bases in Cambodia. As a television show and a political exercise it may have been effective, but as a serious Presidential presentation of the brutal facts of a tragic and dangerous problem of world politics, it was ridiculous. No doubt the enemy's Cam bodian sanctuaries will be de stroyed or abandoned, and with out too many casualties on our side. But unless we keep our troops there, the enemy will come back or move to other sanctuaries. This has always been the “heart of the problem.” Geography, history and time are on the side of the enemy. It is a devilish problem. He can always retreat into other sanc tuaries in Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam or even China— and wait. The question is whether we are willing to fight and wait or whether we are merely determined to pretend. What President Nixon did in his speech on the Cambodian invasion was to pretend—pre tend this would get the boys back home and get the enemy to negotiate a just peace, pre tend he was getting “to the heart of the trouble.” This is what is really dividing Washington today—not that the President is expanding the war, but that he is pretending his invasion of Cambodia will end it by destroying the critical enemy sanctuaries which every body knows really exist else where.

602-> Secret Service May Get Task Of Guarding Visiting Notables
WASHINGTON, March 18— President Nixon may ask Con gress to provide Secret Service protection for foreign dignita ries making official visits to the United States, according to the Chief of Protocol for the State Department. Emil Mosbacher Jr. said in an interview that Mr. Nixon had taken “a personal interest” in the security issue because of protest demonstrations during the visit of President Pompidou of France earlier this month. Mr. Pompidou was so upset by protesters who hurled in sults from within a few feet of his official party outside a Chicago hotel that he called the demonstration “a stain on the forehead of America” and President Nixon flew to New York to apologize. The White House said last week that legislation to im prove security procedures was “under development.” Mr. Mos bacher's statement was the first confirmation that Secret Service protection was being given serious consideration. Mr. Mosbacher said two other steps were under discus sion. One would be to encour age cities to adopt a limit on how close demonstrators could come to foreign dignitaries, similar to the District of Co lumbia's “500‐foot rule” at em bassies. The other possibility cited by Mr. Mosbacher would be to ask Congress to authorize an in crease in the size of the staffs of the protocol office and the security office at the State De partment. Both staffs, Mr. Mos bacher said, were essentially the same size as they were 10 years ago, when there was less travel by foreign dignitaries in this country and fewer trips by American officials abroad. “President Eisenhower went abroad twice in eight years and President Nixon went abroad twice in his first eight months,” Mr. Mosbacher said, indicating one measure of the increased demand on his staff of 47. He said that no decision had been made yet on what pro posals the Administration would offer. The issue is being dis cussed among officials at the White House, State Department and Justice Department, Mr. Mosbacher added. Under present law, Federal agencies are “completely de pendent on local authorities when they take a foreign guest somewhere,” Mr. Mosbacher said. He praised local officials in general but said there had been an occasional “breakdown in communications.” President Pompidou accused Chicago policemen of having been “accomplices” of the crowd that “insulted me and my wife.” Mr. Mosbacher would not comment directly on the han dling of the demonstration by the Chicago authorities, but he said the incident might not have occurred “if the demon strators had only been kept back a few feet, as they were in New York and San Francisco and Washington.” Reliable State Department sources said its security office was unhappy that the incident in Chicago was being regarded in some Administration circles as a blemish on the office's record. These sources blamed Chicago police for having per mitted the crowd to get close to the Pompidous. There are 337 persons on the security staff, including 70 agents scat tered in foreign countries, and 94 clerks.

603-> For U.S. The Pilots Are a Dangerous Challenge
From the start, the Nixon Ad ministration has looked upon the Middle East as a crucial testing ground of a postulated Soviet willingness to choose restraint over engagement in local con flicts, with the aim of averting a direct confrontation of the superpowers. It was a week of bad news for those who scruti nize the Kremlin for signs of restraint in the Arab‐Israeli con flict. The Under Secretary of State, Elliot L. Richardson, flew to New York to address a con vocation of distinguished Ameri cans and Russians and spell out the theory of “spheres of re straint” — areas of the world, he said, “where neither of us is now so heavily committed, (where) progress can be made toward reducing the danger of expanded local conflict by de liberately limiting our involve ment.” Ironically, Mr. Richardson's carefully planned address came only one day after American in telligence analysts reached the long feared conclusion, based on reports from numerous sources, that the Soviet Union had deep ened its commitment to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser by sending trained Russian pilots to fly combat aircraft on operational missions over Egypt. This was a step toward escala tion which, scarcely a month ago, American analysts doubted the Russians would take. Since the immediate aftermath of the June, 1967, war, the Soviet Union has committed a massive investment In military materiel— aircraft, artillery, tanks—to re store the shattered Egyptian armed forces. In so doing, the Kremlin gained a political influ ence—and responsibility — in Cairo that far exceeded even the close ties that had existed before the war. American influence and stature, conversely, dropped to an all time low across the Arab world; revolutionary Arab regimes even started threatening to undermine the longtime bulwark of their economies, the vast American oil operations in the Middle East. The Administration's judgment was that Soviet policymakers would stop at this point, would avoid any deeper engagement— particularly of manpower vulner able to combat dangers. Partly to set an example, President Nixon chose to withhold the sale to Israel of 125 additional jet air craft last month, and followed up this decision with a renewed appeal for agreement on limiting the flow of arms into the area. The latest intelligence reports dashed many hopes. Sadly, Mr. Richardson inserted at the last minute some ominous phrases into what he had planned as a constructive speech to a joint Soviet‐American audience. “The Soviet Union should real ize that any immediate gains it might make by attempting to take advantage of the troubled Middle East situation are far outweighed by the danger of stirring up a wider conflict,” he said. “When in such an area one of us—in this case the U.S.S.R.—involves itself militarily, it is inevitable that the other will take notice and react.” To both his Russian and Amer ican listeners the message came through loud and Clear, that what is now at stake in the Middle East is a spiraling new arms race, and the possibility of direct So viet engagement in combat with Israel—combat from which the United States could not insulate itself with certainty. Diplomatic alternatives to such a prospect were not promising. The Administration's top negotia tor for the Middle East, Assistant Secretary of State Joseph J. Sisco, returned from a tour through the area only a week ago, and reported a disappointing inflexibility among all parties to the conflict that did not augur well for progress on the negoti ating front. Both his own talks with the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, and the Four Power negotiations at the United Na tions are to continue, Mr. Sisco indicated, but officials said there had not been a sign of Soviet interest in the arms limitation proposal. Mr. Richardson refused to be drawn out on how the United States might react to the latest Soviet move. Acknowledging that the options are limited by Presi dent Nixon's own commitment to maintain the strategic balance, American officials nevertheless cautioned that nothing has actu ally happened yet to destroy Is rael's air superiority. So far, according to both American and Israeli intelli gence, the Soviet pilots have re mained well behind the front lines where the Egyptian and Israeli air forces are clashing in dogfights. The Russians seem to be operating on purely defen sive missions, around Cairo, Alexandria and Aswan, where they are engaged in deploying the SAM‐3 missile air defense network. Furthermore, American mili tary analysts are not convinced that the Russian pilots — un trained in combat — will be much more of a match than the Egyptians for the seasoned Is raeli airmen, a form of compli ment which is not particularly comforting in Tel Aviv. The State Department prompt ly prepared instructions for Jacob D. Beam, the American Ambas sador in Moscow, to let the So viet Government know in the strongest terms of the serious ness with which Washington views the new Soviet involve ment. Words are to be the first step; there are few observers of the conflict who expect words alone to suffice. The same American diplomats who are striving for a defusing of the Arab‐Israeli conflict are also aware of the danger of letting the United States appear to the Arabs and the Russians as a “paper tiger.” President Nixon hoped he was setting an example of forbear ance by withholding the new air craft for Israel. But instead of continuing the restraint which some officials believed the Soviet Union was employing, the Krem lin chose to enter upon a new level of military support. Instead of a sphere of restraint, the Mid dle East is showing increasing signs of becoming a sphere of confrontation.

604-> TYRANT CAPTURES CARTER HANDICAP
The white and cherry colors of the Locust Hill Farm were brought into the winners' circle for the second straight year fol lowing a running of the Carter Handicap yesterday as Tyrant outlasted Calumet's Best Turn at Aqueduct. Despite, a late charge by Best Turn in the closing yards, a length separated him from the leader at the wire. Then came Dorothy C. Rigney's favored Fast Hilarous, a length astern of Best Turn. Rounding out the order and not in contention at the finish were Ogden M. Phipps's Beau Brummel and Greentree's Buck Run. The first starters rep resented one of the smallest Carter fields since the fixture was introduced in 1895. The outcome of the $55,400 fixture came as a surprise to most in the crowd of 44,346, who had allowed Tyrant to leave the post as a 6½‐to‐1 out sider. Their betting was con centrated on Best Turn, Fast Hilarious and Buck Run. Only three minutes before “off” time, there were three “deuces” next to the names of these three horses on the infield tote board—all listed at 2‐to‐1. Buck Run and Best Turn were made the close second and third choices, respectively, moments before the start. In taking the seven‐furlong contest, Tyrant, who returned $15, was superbly guided by Bobby Ussery, who had the leg up on Promise when that Locust Hill's hopeful won the 1969 edition of the fixture. In yesterday's outing, Ussery kept his mount in front all the way. “It was a fast pace,” said Ussery, “but we stayed with the leaders in the backstretch. He was running easily.” The fifth race marked the return of Ogden Phipps's Re viewer, one of the top 2‐year‐ olds in 1968. This Bold Ruler colt suffered a hairline fracture of the cannonbone in his left foreleg during the running of last year's Wood Memorial in which he finshed third, only a neck behind the victorious Dike. In his comeback yesterday— his first appearance in 13 months—Reviewer easily dis posed of his four rivals in the six‐furlong contest. He beat Philip Heisler's Berkley Prince by eight lengths, breezing home in an outstanding 1:08 4/5, only fifth of a second behind the track record. Whenever Carter Day ar rives at Aqueduct, some of the order fans are certain to discuss the 1944 edition of the event, when Belair Stud's Bossuet, William Ziegler's Wait A Bit and Joseph W. Brown's Brownie, hit the finish line to gether to produce the only three‐horse dead heat for first place in an American stakes race. “I saw that finish,” a short, bald‐headed follower of form told his two companions yester day while waiting on the daily double line before the first race. “But, I was sitting way up the track at old Aqueduct. From the angle up there, that finish looked like just another one of those close finishes. There seemed no doubt in the minds of many fans, how aver, as Tyrant sped around the track that he was streak ing. The fractions of 0:22 1/5, 0:44 and 1:08 1/5 were ex tremely impressive. The time for the seven furlongs was 1:21 2/5, tying the stakes record set in 1965 by Viking Spirit. A major factor in the race's speed were the challenges from Buck Run and Fast Hilarious during the entire run down the backstretch and around the turn. It wasn't until the stretch that Buck Run finally dropped off and fell behind. Fast Hilarious, however, kept in close pursuit of the 4‐year‐ son of Bold Ruler and appeared to have at least second place protected until the closing yards. It was then that Best Turn came through with the surge that gave him the run ner‐up spot. Ussery was particularly elat ed about the victory since it marked his first stakes success in New York this season. But the victory did not surprise him.

605-> Styles are thrifty, mechanics skillful, all the mots justes
The editor's introduction says that this collection from the new Transatlantic Review's first 10 years of publication shows “the range of stories we have published and, hopefully, the quality of writing we have tried to encourage.” Fortunate ly, the quality of the stories is higher than this sample of Mr. McCrindle's prose; the mis use of “hopefully” does not ap pear elsewhere in the book. In fact, the quality is very high indeed. With one or two ex ceptions, all of these 30‐some stories — most of them short and none very long — are in teresting in both the critical and popular meanings of the word. And all, without excep tion, are supremely competent. Edited by Joseph F. McCrindle. 304 pp. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, $8.95. It would appear, in fact, that American and British short story writing — as here re presented — has come to a point of something like perfec tion. The mechanics are skill ful. Themes are presented with precisely that degree of obli quity that whets the appetite and stimulates the mind. Char acterization is achieved with the quick, subtle strokes teach ers of Creative Writing recom mend. Settings are deftly sug gested. Exposition and descrip tion are scrupulously avoided. Styles are thrifty and all mots are justes. Symbols are care fully arranged. The range of writers is wide, varying from accomplished vet erans and names like Pritchett, Updike and Oates (is there any anthology of recent years in which she hasn't appeared?) to writers who were unknown when the Transatlantic Review published them, and some who are still unknown. The range of forms and subjects also is (or looks) wide. There are some fables, in cluding Updike's “During the Jurassic,” about a group of bron tosaurs and such attending a cocktail party. There are stor ies in great traditions: Hugh Allyn Hunt's “Acme Rooms and Sweet Marjorie Russell,” a re markably attractive account of Midwestern youth in a brothel (it might be termed “Seventeen” with lust); William Goldman's comedy of a contest between a man and a dog, “The Ice Cream Eat"; Leonard Michaels's “Making Changes,” an elu sive story Henry James might have written if he had ever dealt with an orgy. There are stories about most of the popular topics of the 1960's. There is a great deal of poverty, whether urban (Austin Clark's harrowing “The Collector,” about a Candian de relict who lives by selling old bottles)’ or rural (Shirley Schoonover's “The Star Blank et,” a story of a poetic girl sold as a wife to a misan thropic shepherd, a story so har rowing as to be improbable). There are sharply observed re gional reports (e.g., Walter Clem ons's “A Different Thing,” new and refreshing look at Texas). There is a huge supply of neuroses — such as George Garrett's “A Game of Catch, which has neurotic twin boys and an even more neurotic girl playing on a beach. There are primitivism and commercial ism, both treated in Thomas Bridges's “Music to Lay Eggs By” — the first and near to being the best story in the col lection. There is a great deal of ho mosexuality, handled with great skill — for example, Al fred Chester's “Ismael,” about a fag novelist and a scabrous Puerto Rican male prostitute. There is some comment (not much) on race relations. There is some religion, including stig mata (Jean Claude Van Itallie's “Francois Yattend”); there is Jewish humor, including Asa Bober Jr.'s “My Sister and Me,” a story that shows what a Chi cago courtesan's kid brother, raised in night clubs, can do to a New England boarding school. The range is certainly not unlimited. There are no drugs, no riots, no protest movements. These writers are of the Old Left; they have not gorie into the street. And their orthodoxy of topic is matched by their orthodoxy of form. The pre scriptions of technical comp& tence appear, after about the 30th story, to be a sort of straitjacket. Competence is sometimes re deemed by absolute literary power. A writer like Alan Sil litoe, whose “The Road” smells of greatness, manages to be powerful within the convention of the slOrt‐story‐as‐a‐work‐of art. Some of the others are also very good, as distinct from perfect. But perfection is what is notably represented‐here. It makes one wonder if The Short Story is not in danger of be coming a liturgy instead of lit erature. ■

606-> Abram Enters Race For Seat in Senate
Morris B. Abram entered the United States Senate race in New York yesterday with a pledge to “dare to dream and plan” for a better America. The former president of Brandeis University became the 10th Democrat to declare his candidacy for statewide office. But most of the party's atten tion was focused on a man who may become the 11th—Arthur J. Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg continued his discussions with party leaders, but said in an interview late last night that he had no statement to make about a pos sible candidacy for Governor or Senator. Mr. Abram pictured Amer icans as part of ?? in ?? and promised to ?? his skills in law, diplomacy, philanthropy, community serv ice and education to an effort to redeem the nation's potential for good. Nationally known as a civil libertarian, Mr. Abram resigned as president of Bran deis to make the Senate race. He will be 52 on June 19. He declared at a crowded news conference at the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel that, even though doubt had been cast upon the validity of his New York enrollment, he would be able under an obscure pro vision of the election law to qualify for the June 23 Demo cratic primary. Though this section permits late enrollment for someone domiciled elsewhere during the regular registration period, Mr. Abram said that he would still ask the State Committee, which will meet on April 1 and 2 to designate candidates, to waive the technical point so that he can be considered with the four other major declared candi dates. “Ours is not a boss‐controlled party,” he said, “and this can be demonstrated by a vote to waive this hypertechnicality.” Guests at the session, who included Thomas K. Finletter, former United States Ambas sador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Mrs. Mar shall Field; Cyrus R. Vance, former Deputy Secretary of De fense, and Chester Carter, for mer Assistant Secretary of State, applauded frequently the harsh criticism by the candi date of Nixon Administration policies. “When you hear President, Nixon talk of inflation,” he said, “it is always in connec tion with domestic priorites. The word is not in his vocabu lary when he talks of Vietnam.” He called the Nixon policy of Vietnamization of the war “fraudulent” and urged a “speedily negotiated with drawal — not tied to the fate of the corrupt Saigon regime.” He warned, however, against “a withdrawal into interna tional isolationism.” The Georgia‐born lawyer said also he had no plans “to attend the wake of the civil rights movement” and, by reversing the Administration's policy of “do‐nothingism” for youth, to demonstrate that domestic rev olution is “not only impossible but unnecessary.”

607-> PADRES' BIG THIRD ROUTS BRAVES, 8‐3
SAN DIEGO, April 17 (UPI) — Nate Colbert's three‐run homer capped a five‐run third inning and Pat Dobson, making his National League debut, throttled Atlanta tonight as the Padres cuffed the Braves, 8‐3. Dobson came to San Diego from Detroit in a winter trade. His only difficulty came on Orlando Cepeda's home run in the seventh and Henry Aaron's run‐producing single in the eighth. Ron Herbel pitched the final inning and gave up the third Atlanta run on a triple by Tony Gonzalez and Clete Boyer's sacrifice fly. The Padres drove out Phil Niekro, a 23‐game winner last year, after three innings. ?? SAN DIEGO (N.) ?? LOS ANGELES, April 7 (UPI) —Two‐hit pitching by Gary No lan gave the Cincinnati Reds a 4‐0 victory over the Los An geles‐Dodgers tonight. The 21‐year‐old Nolan, com ing back after two seasons with arm trouble, gave up a bad‐hop single in the fourth to Willie Crawford and a line‐drive single to Crawford in the ninth. The Reds scored three runs in the third after Wes Parker dropped a pop foul with Tommy Helms at bat. Helms then sin gled, Pete Rose walked and Tony Perez, Johnny Bench and Hal McRae singled. ??

MY job is one where I have responsibility for investigating all crimes re ported in Manhattan from the Battery up to 59th Street. That's an awful lot of crime.” Man in the News The speaker — stocky, 51, years old, fond of cigars — stood in the chill wind on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village, his hands plunged ‘in the slash pockets of his dark, greenish ‐ gray raincoat. k deep, gray fedora ringed with a blue ribbon was planted on his graying hair, and as he spoke, he rocked on the balls of his feet. His brown eyes focused on the ruins of 18 West 11th Street, he watched as fire men pumped water from the basement of the devastated townhouse that has already yielded two corpses and a cache of explosives. The watcher's name is Al bert A. Seedman (“I'Ve just got a middle initial, not a middle name”). His title, since last June 5, has been assist ant chief inspector. He com mands the Police Depart ment's Manhattan South detective borough — a re sponsibility that embraces 396 detectives and the lower portion of the borough. Winner of 5 Citations Since last Friday, when a series of explosions trans formed the townhouse from a landmark into a mystery, the stocky figure of Chief Seedman has become a fa miliar sight at the ruins. As the man in charge of the in vestigation, he said yester day, he intends to stay close to the scene, watching devel opments. Dedication to his work has won him five citations, has marked his climb in 10 years from sergeant to cap tain and in six years from deputy inspector to assistant chief inspector. His colleagues regard Chief Seedman as the epitome of the professional. At the scene, his cigar nearly omnipresent, he exudes authority. Laconic and generally soft‐spoken, he can be charming when invest igations are proceeding to his satisfaction — and quick to ignite into irritability when they are not, a quality that prompts some of the detec tives under his command to concede that working for him is not the easiest job in the world. “I'm thinking in terms of professionalism of police work, especially at the com mand levels,” Chief Seedman said yeseterday as he ex plained why he was studying toward a doctorate in public administration. He won his master's degree in the same field from City University in 1962. He was born during World War I, on Aug. 9, 1918—the son of the late Rose Herman and cab late David Seedman, a cab driver. Growing up in the Bronx, he graduated from Public School 93, &oft the Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan and in 1941 from City College, where his major was business” admin istation. Chief ‐ Seedman worked briefly as an accountant be fore his appointment, on March ‘16, 1942, to the police ‘force. “That,” said his wife yes terday, “was his ambition.” Mrs. Seedman, the former Sylvia Alabaster, met her future husband through mu tual friends at a Knights of Pythias dance in Manhattan about two years before they were married, on May 17, 1942. Before the end of that year, he was in the Army— an enlisted man assigned to criminal investigation. InVolved in Controversy After three years in the Army, he returned in 1945 to the police force here and was made a detective in 1946. He was involved briefly in public controversy in 1962, when he and another police officer were attacked by the New York Civil Liberties Union for alleged “excessive and improper use of force” after they had apparently been instrumental in posing suspects in the slaying of two detectives for news pho tographers. Chief Seedman appears to regard the inci dent with regret as an em barrassment to himself and to the Police. Department. He and Mrs. Seedman live in a gray, three‐bedroom, suburban ranch house. They have three children—Barry, 26; David, 21, and Marilyn, 17. In his spare time, Mr. Seedman tries to keep fit. “I get to the gym when I can to play handball,” he said. “During good‐weather, I ‘like to spend time on the golf course.” Asked about his golf score, he replied, “I'd say it's pretty fair. I'm more success ful as a police officer than as a golfer.” Mrs. Seedman said he shoots in the low 90's.

609-> POLICE IN BUFFALO TO LEAVE CAMPUS
BUFFALO, March 11—The acting president of the State University at Buffalo an nounced at a faculty sen ate meeting this afternoon the beginning of a phased with drawal” of city policemen from the 180‐acre campus. The senate, representing about 1,500 full‐time faculty members, later rejected a res olution calling for the resigna tion of the acting president, Dr. Peter F. Regan. Dr. Regan called the police to the campus Sunday morning after violence and vandalism had plagued the university since Feb. 25. Inspector Frederick Platek, the police commander on the campus, said he had withdrawn about 35 of his men from the central area of the tree‐shaded campus along Buffalo's Main Street, but added that they were standing by in other sec tions of the campus.

611-> Second Judgment
Shifting rapidly to a target of opportunity following his nomination and rejection for the Supreme Court, Judge G. Harrold Carswell has resigned from the United States Court of Appeals to run for the Senate. He has of course, every right to leave the bench, he wishes, and seek a seat alongside the majority Senators who snurned him for the hieh court. There is a vast difference between the Senate and the Supreme Court. The Senate is a representative political arena while the Court—interpreting the law of the land—is a forum designed to be above partisan judgments. But the Senate no less than the Court demands men of quality, character and ability— though often of a different kind of temperament. Judge Carswell was turned down for the Supreme Court not because he was a Southerner—despite Pres ident Nixon's claim to the contrary—but because a Majority of the Senate correctly thought that he lacked the requisite qualifications for the nation's highest tribunal. Whether he has them for the Senate is a matter for the voters of Florida to decide.

613-> A Legacy From Rome And Athens In Spain
AMPURIAS, Spain — Thanks to the sand that covered them and to the archeologists who uncovered them, it is possible, here on Spain's Costa Brava, to walk through the ruins of both a Greek town once called Neopolis and an adjacent Roman settlement known as Emporion. Ampurias, which is situated about 75 miles northeast of Barcelona, is really one archeological site in three parts. In ad dition to the ruins of Emporion and Neop olis, there is, a little farther on, the site of the original settlement of Emporion. It is now a small fishing village called San Martin de Ampurias. The stones and artifacts unearthed here show how the early residents lived, mar keted, worshiped, watched spectacles, un loaded cargo, left for war and were buried. At the site of the ruins is the Archeo logical Museum, which suffers only from the fact that the best finds dug out of these ruins are on permanent display in Barcelona's Archeological Museum. A stratigraphic exhibit shows 15 levels of excavation, and the shards and other frag ments indicate the succession of the in habitants who settled here at various times during Ampurias's long history. In 575 B.C., when Greeks from Phocaea, the Ionic city in Asia Minor (Turkey) started a colony here, there was a small island—it was about 1,000 feet in diam eter—just off the coast. Because of its natural defenses and the commanding heights of the island, the first settlers chose it as the site of their town, Emporion, now San Martin de Ampurias. When the Persians wiped out Phocaea in 540 B.C., the survivors of the battle packed up whatever they had left and came to the Costa Brava. They built massive jetty here and made this a major port. Emporion, the island stronghold and the last important Greek settlement in the western Mediterranean, became the center of Greece's commerce and cultural influ ence in Spain. The original island is no more. Over the centuries, sand has filled in the nar row strait between Emporion and the coast, so that today it is a hill instead of an island. The jetty is still visible, but sand has sifted in behind it. The fisherman of San Martin de Ampurias beach their boats on the sand. The original “island” where the Greeks first settled still affords a great view of the sea and the countryside inland. The town includes a handful of houses and gothic church that was actually built on the foundations of an early temple to Ar temis of Ephesia, Zeus's daughter and the goddess of wild nature, childbirth and fertility. This church is believed to be one of the first Christian churches in Spain. It was destroyed by the Vikings in 852, and was rebuilt in 926, 1248 and, finally, In 1507 after Ampurias was besieged and destroyed in the 1468 rebellion of Barcelona against King John II of Aragon. The original Greek settlers had found that their island stronghold was too small for them, and so they moved to the main. land. There, they built a new walled town, Neopolis. It was after that move that the sand began to fill in the strait. A row of trees is now planted along the coast to serve as a windbreak and to pre vent the sand from burying the Ampurias ruins again. The excavated ruins are surrounded by a wall built by the Greeks when they erected the town. At an opening In the wall, Just wide enough to admit a donkey cart, an attendant collects the 5‐peseta (7 cents) admission and permits the visitor to step Into ancient Neopolis. Streets lead past the foundations of buildings, walls and an occasional surviv ing column or statue from temples, foun tains, the colonnaded market and the public cistern. Because there were no wells or springs, the Greeks had to collect rain water. For that purpose, they built a complex network of conduits under the level of the streets and large underground cisterns to store the water. The public cistern was used by those who did not have their own private water supply. The water was puri fied by pouring it through four‐foot‐tall, charcoal‐and‐sand‐filled ceramic jar filters. Directly next to Neopolis is the Roman settlement of Emporlon. The historian Livy writes about Romans living there during the second Punic War (218‐201 B.C.), when Hannibal was threatening Rome. Cato the Censor, Scipio Africanus and Julius Caesar all passed by Emporlon at one time or another. Caesar brought part of his victorious army here, after defeating Pompey in 49 B.C., and his engineers built the great wall that enclosed the prosperous Roman city. The Roman site is 10 times larger than the ruins of Neopolis. The spaciousness and the more luxurious quality of life in the Roman town are evidenced in the larger outlines of the houses, the occa sional column standing among the cypress es and some superbly preserved mosaic floors. It must have been impressive with the large forum, the amphitheater and the houses and shops stuccoed and painted white and other bright colors to reflect the Mediterranean sun. Just beyond the Roman wall is the foun dation of an amphitheater where stone supports radiate out from the stage. The Romans placed wooden, bleacher‐style seats on these supports for the theater goers. After the Romans came the Visigoths, who are represented here by an uncovered burial site. They had a unique interment technique: They simply laid slabs of lime stone over the body in a way that resem bled a pup tent. The remains decomposed in a matter of weeks in these limestone sarcophagi. The Archeological Museum at the ruins contains displays of sophisticated pottery and its significance. The orange ‐ red, glossy terra‐cotta bowls and vases were skillfully decorated by Greek and Oriental craftsmen. The pottery was in such uni versal demand that cheaper and less‐artful imitations made in factories in Gaul and elsewhere soon flooded the market. There was a locally produced style of pottery called Ampurtian gray, which also became popular and also was soon imitated. Also on display at this first‐rate museum are statues and elaborately carved sar cophagi, marble and ceramic buttons, combs, bronze keys to intricate locks and a series of oil‐burning lamps that show the evolution from clay to bronze. A large anchor recalls Emporion's importance as a naval center, and iron hardware from a Roman catapult found here helped with the reconstruction of one of these early‐day artillery pieces. The excavation site is open the year round. The nearest accommodations are La Escala, a pleasant fishing and resort village through which the road to Am purias passes. Some of the hotels in the village, which is about five miles from the ruins, stay open through the winter house visitors to the Ampulias diggings.

614-> Two Key Backers of Abortion Reform in the Legislature Are Defeated Upstate
The two key figures in the politically explosive abortion reform struggle in the 1970 Legislature—one a Republican the other a Democrat—were defeated in party primary elec tions yesterday. Republican Senator D. Clin ton Dominick of Newburgh, the Senate sponsor of the re form bill, and Democratic As semblyman George M. Michaels of Auburn were both defeated in elections in which the abor tion reform votes were deci sive. Senator Dominick, serving his 12th year in the Senate after four years in the lower house and generally considered a leader of the Republican party in Albany, was defeated by a political novice, Rich ard Schermerhorn, who ran a generally conservative‐oriented campaign. Some politicians consider his defeat a general loss for Liber al Republicanism in Albany since Mr. Dominick led his par ty in liberal education legisla tion in his role as chairman of the Senate Education Commit tee. Mr. Michaels, who is confined to a hospital bed because of a recent auto accident, declined to speculate on the cause of his first defeat after 10 years in office. But John Rossi, the 33‐year‐ old Auburn lawyer who de feated Mr. Michaels to win the Democratic nomination, said “the way Michaels voted on the abortion bill” was his key to victory. The abortion bill apparently figured heavily in contests where it led to a primary chal lenge to supporters of the liberalization. In Buffalo, Arthur O. Eve, an incumbent Democratic Assem blyman, was attacked by lead ers of his own party for his abortion‐reform vote. Mr. Eve, facing a strong challenge from John A. Smith, said last night that the Assem bly minority whip, John B. Lis, also from Buffalo, had. “written a letter against me today obvi ously aimed at the Catholics in my community pointing out I voted for the abortion reform bill.” Mr. Eve said he would con front Democratic party offi cials in Albany today with the letter and “win, lose or draw they are going to have to ex plain this use of the party officials against another Demo crat.” Mr. Eve defeated Mr. Smith by 6,139 to 4,498. Senator William E. Adams was renominated in the Buf falo suburb of Kenmore. The Republican incumbent was ac quitted last April on charges of perjury and obstruction of jus tice in an investigation of the state's medicaid program. As returns trickled in late last night only a few incum bents were facing serious threats. Political observers sug gested that only emotional is sues such as the abortion vote would make a difference in the little‐publicized legislative pri maries. Mr. Michaels seemed to typi fy such an upset. A highly pop ular vote‐getter in his upstate district, the Assemblyman prob ably would not have had op position except for his abortion vote. Mr. Rossi had said earlier that he would not seek the seat as long as Mr. Michaels held it. However, 10 days after his dramatic vote in favor of abor tion reform on April 9, the Democratic leaders in Cayuga County held a convention and withdrew an earlier endorse ment of Mr. Michaels. In a dis trict with a heavy concentra tion of Roman Catholics, the vote was essentially political suicide. “I realize,” Mr. Michaels said the day of the deciding vote, “that I am terminating my political carer.” The prediction, despite last night's defeat, may he prema ture. According to his campaign manager, Mr. Michaels has the Liberal party's endorsement and is still considering taking on all corners in the November election. Among the upstate incum bents who won renomination were Senator William T. Smith of Elmira and Assemblyman Charles D. Henderson of Hornell. Both men are Repub licans. Albert J. Hausheck, a Demo cratic Assemblyman from Buf falo who was accused by his party leaders of seeking “politi cal plums” when he voted for a Republican‐sponsored sales tax last year, ran for renomi nation as both a Democrat and a Republican. Mr. Hausbeck was renominated on the Repub lican line but incomplete re turns indicated that he had lost on the Democratic line. In the 73d Assembly District In Manhattan Edward H. Leh ner defented John J. Walsh, a Democrat who has been in the Assembly since 1959.

617-> Roland Wank, Chief Architect Of T.V.A. in Early Years, Dies
Roland A. Wank, head archi tect of the Tennessee Valley Authority from 1933 to 1944, who designed towns, public housing projects and many im portant buildings, died Wednes day of cancer in New Rochelle Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived at 35 Highview Ave nue. New Rochelle. N. Y. Mr. Wank was a partner in Wank Adams Slavin & Associates, architects and en gineers of 155 East 42d Street. In 1941, during a compre hensive exhibition of pictures and models of the vast T.V.A. project at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Wank de clared: “Surrounded by cracks in our inherited framework, we are again at work to hammer out a new integration. To plan a housing development, a road side restaurant, a school or a powerhouse is not of itself very different from nor more useful than to mend boots, run a lathe or total up accounts. But to share in a forward struggle when the fight is hot and pas sion rims high is one of the vital experiences that make life worth living. And that makes contemporary architec ture fun.” Among his colleagues he was known for “his timeless, func tional, logical style.” A friend yesterday called him “an ar chitect's architect who avoided sensationalism and rejected fad dism as a scourge which in a short time will date build ings.” Mr. Wank was born in Buda pest Oct. 2, 1898, He studied at the Royal Polytechnicum there, the Technical University of Brunn, and the College of Beaux Arts and the School of Applied Arts in Budapest. He served as an officer in the Austrian Army in World War I. He was chief architect for European engineering and con struction firms from 1921 to 1924, when he came to the United States to escape “the dead hand of the past.” His talent soon won recog nition. The American Institute of Architects gave him ifs gold medals for his design of the Grand Street Apartments in Manhattan and the Union Ter minal Building in Cincinnati. When he went to T.V.A. in 1933, he recognized his prob lem as not merely one of re working the original plans of the engineers but as “a new phase in architecture.” His job was “to make sure that the dams look as efficient as the engineers have made them” and also to show “that a public architecture can be a great architecture,” he declared. To house the workers and future settlers around Norris Dam, the town of Norris, Tenn., was built. Mr. Wank said he worked on the premise that “changing mores call for changes in architecture. De pendence upon environment calls for its control and plan ning for balance and dignity.” Mr. Wank had been chief architect for the Greenhills (Ohio) Resettlement Project, chief consulting architect for the Rural Electrification Admin istration, and architectural con sultant for the United Nations Headquarters Commission. Structures he designed in cluded the Hoffmann‐LaRoche Laboratories in Nutley, N. J.;v Remsen Hall of Queens College; the Eastman Kodak laboratories in Rochester; the General Hos pital in Elmhurst, Queens, and the First National City Bank Building in Lima, Peru. He was consultant on buildings and design for the New Jersey Turn pike Authority. Mr. Wank taught postgradu ate seminars as a visiting pro fessor of architecture at Prince ton, Cornell and Columbia, and had lectured at Harvard. He contributed articles to technical periodicals. He held an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from. Fairleigh Dickinson University, and was a Fellow of the American Insti tute of Architecture. Surviving are his widow, the former Piroska Szabo; two sons, Peter and Aindrew, and five grandchildren.

619-> Thant Criticizes the Israelis for Holding Two Algerians Seized From an Airliner
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Sept. 10 — Secretary General Thant criticized Israel today for having ignored two ap peals he had made for the re lease of two Algerian officials arrested during a stopover at Lydda Airport Aug. 14. He said at a news conference that he sent one oral and one written appeal to the Israeli Government last month urging it to free the two men. He re ported that he had also offered to send a personal representa tive to Israel to discuss the case of the Algerians, Khaleb Jaloul and All Belaziz. But, the Secretary General declared, he has received “no reply and no reaction” from the Israeli Government to these initiatives. After the news conference, Mr. Thant received a letter, dated yesterday, from Yosef Tekoah, the Israeli representa tive. The letter acknowledged the Secretary General's appeals but defended the arrest of the Algerians for interrogation on security grounds. Many diplomats here believe that the release of the two Algerians by Israel could play a major role in breaking the stalemate in the negotiations of the International Red Cross with the Palestinians over the release of the 300 hostages held on the three airliners in the Jordanian desert. Informed sources said the Algerians have emerged as the key issue in the negotiations. Israel has insisted that there must be no exchange. Mr. Thant briefly reiterated an earlier statement that the recent hijackings had been “criminal and inhuman” acts. The Secretary General spoke at a news conference in con nection with the start next Tuesday of the 25th anniver sary session of the General Assembly. The session is ex pected to become a gathering of leading statesmen and an occasion to strengthen the United Nations’ role as a peace‐keeping institution. On the Middle East situation in general, he said that nego tiations under United Nations auspices remained the only hope for peace in the region and that he was determined to “put them back on the track.” Mr. Thant conceded that the peace talks through Dr. Gun nar V. Jarring of Sweden, his special representative, had suf fered “a severe setback” and added: “But I am not prepared to say that it is beyond sal vage.” The talks are now stalled. Israel has said that she will not participate in them until Egypt withdraws missiles re portedly moved into the Suez Canal zone in violation of a standstill cease‐fire which be gan on Aug. 7. Egypt says she has not moved any additional missiles into the zone. Mr. Thant said Dr. Jarring continued to remain at the United Nations, available to all the parties concerned. Mr. Thant delcared that the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France were more nearly in agreement on the nature of a final peace set tlement in the Middle East than they had ever been. He was optimistic about the chances of peace, he said, because never before had there been such a Big Power accord on the Mid dle East. Mr. Thant said that he had presented “some ideas” to the major powers on how the world leaders who are ex pected to come to the General Assembly could use their pres ence here for consultation. From sources outside the United Nations it was learned that Mr. Thant had proposed to be host at a working dinner of the American, Soviet, French and British heads of government but that the sug gestion had fallen on deaf ears. Three of the four powers are understood to feel that this is not the time for such a meet ing of Big Four leaders, mainly because there has not been time for adequate preparation. The idea is believed to have been welcomed only by France, which has traditionally been for close Big Four consultation. President Nixon is expected to come to the two‐week com memoration of the United Nations anniversary but no official announcement has been made. The same is true for Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin of the Soviet Union. Prime Min ister Heath has formally an nounced that he will come. France is expected to be repre sented by Premier Jacques Chaban Delmas rather than President Pompidou. Mr. Thant also made the fol lowing points: ¶He said, as “a personal guess,” that he did not expect Communist China to become a member of the United Nations before “November or Decem ber, 1972.” ¶Mr. Thant said he did not intend to volunteer for a third term as Secretary General when his present term expires in December, 1971. But he added that he was not making a “categorical announcement” at this time. ¶Asked about his reaction to the reported likelihood that both West and East Germany would soon apply for United Nations membership, Mr. Thant said it would be easier to admit two Germanys than two Koreas or two Vietnams.

620-> ISRAELIS UNEARTH A TALMUDIC NAME
JERUSALEM, Jan. 18—Arche ologists today discovered the name Bar Katros inscribed on a stone weight in the ruins of a house in Jerusalem destroyed by the Romans 1,900 years ago. The house, in the Jewish quarter of the Old City, is the first discovered “intact” from the siege and fire that ended a Jewish revolt in A.D. 70. Israelis are showing great interest in it because it represents the first visual evidence of the event. Prof Nahman Avigad of Hebrew University, who is un covering the ruins in the walled Old City, which came under Israeli control in the 1967 war, said the name Bar Katros ap peared in the Talmud as a family of high priests. Bar Katros is the family name. The first name is missing, being on a part of the weight that had been chipped off. There was no way of knowing if Bar Katros was the owner or tenant of the house, or both. The Talmud, the body of Jewish law, compiled in the sec ond century, also includes dis cussions and elaboration of the law, with many legends and stories. Professor Avigad said that it was in these legends and stories that the name Bar Katros appeared. Professor Avigad has been “excavating two rooms of a structure believed to be about 20 feet wide and deep. Two additional rooms have yet to be uncovered. The house was in a favorable position, or “good neighbor hood,” as one archeologist put it, atop a hill overlooking the Temple Mount, a rise contain ing the Second Temple. The temple was also destroyed in 70 A.D. This placement would be ap propriate to a man of the priestly class, but the weights and measures found in one room and the indications of furniture or carpentry work in the other might not. Bar Katros could have been the owner of the building, how ever, or he could have engaged artisans for some delicate work such as fashioning objects for the temple. Artifacts of the period have been found before but never in the Pompeii‐like circumstances that are providing experts with evidence for the fire that Jose phus, a historian of the period, said killed 1,100,000. Coins dating the find within two years also have been found, providing archeologists with a means of dating pottery more exactly than heretofore. This, in turn, will enable them to date other sites where sim ilar pottery, but no coins, has been found.

621-> NIXON DRAFTS BILL FOR BODY TO RUN PASSENGER TRAINS
The Nixon Administration has decided to propose legisla tion for the creation of a semi I public corporation empowered Ito take over and modernize the nation”s ailing intercity pas senger train system. The plan would take in dividual railroads out of the in tercity passenger business— something they have been pleading for—and create a single, nationwide passenger rail network that Government officials believe could become profitable within perhaps three years. The corporation, called Rail pax, would be patterned after the Communication Satellite Corporation—the quasi‐public corporation that operates tele communications satellites. It would have up to $300‐million in initial resources to revitalize passenger service on a network of routes around the country to be selected by the Secretary of Transportation. On routes where it was es tablished by the Secretary that there was clearly no demand for passenger trains, service could be suspended or states or local agencies could keep the trains running by subsidizing losses. Railpax could discontinue a passenger run if, after a trial period, it was determined that even with better equipment and service there was not enough public demand, or no local gov ernments willing to absorb the deficit. However, Congress could veto the discontinuation of service once it had been in cluded in the system. The corporation, under the legislative proposal to he made this week, would receive $100‐ million in Federal aid over a three‐year period to buy new trains and other equipment. The Federal money would in clude $40‐million in grants and $60‐million in long‐term Fed erally insured loans. The stock in Railpax—“pax” is an abbreviation for passen gers, used commonly in the transportation field—would ini tially be owned by the rail road industry. As a condition for turning over to Railpax passenger trains that the railroads no longer wanted to operate, the lines would he required to buy stock in the corporation, to donate train equipment to Rail pax or both. The Department of Trans port ation estimated that the corporation would he capital ized at $200‐million—in addi tion to the $100‐million in Federal aid—hy this revenue and equipment from the rail roads. Railpax eventwally would issue stock to the public, and framers of the plan predict that operations would become profitable enough to pay divi dends to the stockholders. The plan envisions spending most of the Federal money to upgrade service in mediumhaul “population corridors” rather than on long‐distance trains. The department be lieves that rail transportation has its best future over dis‐, tances of up to 500 miles densely populated regions of, the country, such as the north east corridor between Boston and Washington. Although most of the em phasis would be on these high speed runs in population cor ridors, Government sources said that Railpax would also he expected to keep certain long‐haul passenger trains run ning. The railroad heaviest losses occur in long cross‐country runs, where jet airlines offer the most advantages to travel ers in terms of speed. Never theless, officials said that the department believed that, with the operating efficiencies of a large, centrally managed sys tem, even some of these long distance trains could be made profitable once more. The Railpax blueprint is the Nixon Administration's reply to calls from Congress and else where for a plan to keep inter city (as distinguished from com muter) passenger trains in operation. Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe promised Con gress last fall that the depart ment would develop a plan by the first of the year to attack the problem of the disappearing passenger train, The Railpax plan is the result of the pledge The industry has been dig continuing passenger trains at highball clip over the last dec ade ??pre ?? rail travel. The railroads, which have been pressed in recent months, indicate clearly they prefer the much more profit able freight business. They contend that they are losing more than $200‐million annual ly on their passenger trains. Intercity passenger traffic by train in this country dropped from 32.5‐billion passenger miles in 1950 to 8.7 billion in 1968. Critics of the industry hold that the railroads are to blame for much of this decline be cause they have not marketed their services aggressively and let services deteriorate on many runs—all in efforts, the critics say, to deter people from buy ing tickets on the trains. These critics also challenge the railroads loss claims, say ing that accounting procedures do not reflect costs of the pas senger operations. The Interstate Commerce Commission after a study last summer gave some support to the railroads. It estimated that eight railroads lost $118‐million in unavoidable costs the pre vious year because of deficit passenger operations. The Administration's concept of a semipublic corporation dif fers strikingly from proposals in more than 30 hills now pend ing in Congress. These hills call for the railroads to con tinue operating their passenger trains but with heavy Federal aid and subsidies of day‐to‐day operating losses. The Senate Commerce Com mittee is expected to resume consideration this week of a draft bill calling for expendi ture of more than $400‐million ?? years to by new equipment for the rail roads and pay up to 80 per cent of operating losses. A high official of the De partment of Transportation said that the Administration opposed this approach. “One of our goals” he said, “is to make rail passenger trav el more attractive and profit able again. We think, especially in a few corridors around the country, that if you can offer the kind of service that you have on the Metroliner (the high‐speed train running be tween New York and Washing ton] you can get people to ride the trains again. We don't think you need subsidies.” This is how the plan would work: The Department of Transpor tation would make a study of the existing rail passenger net work and determine which route should be preserved in the national interest. Trains not included in this network could be dropped by the rail roads. The railroads that operated trains on these selected routes would be invited to turn over their passenger operations to Railpax. To do so, they would, in effect, have to buy their way out by exchanging equipment or capital for stock in Railpax. Railroads that (lid not want to include their service in the system under these terms could continue operating the trains or follow current procedures and appeal to the Interstate Com merce Commission for authority to suspend service. The corporation would he run by a hoard of directors includ ing members appointed by the President and representatives of the ?? industry.

623-> Congress's Right to Know
WASHINGTON. EXECUTIVE secrecy surrounding the conduct of our foreign policy and its associated mili tary operations Is, I am convinced, endangering not only the_welfare and prosperity of the United States but also, and most significantly, the national security. This is a conclusion I have reached slowly, reluctantly, and from the unique vantage point of having been a Pentagon official and now being the only member of either branch of Congress to sit on both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Com mittees. The practice of either editing or wholly withholding military informa tion from Congress and the public is not new; the present Administration is no better or worse than its prede cessors. In recent years, the need for immediate reaction to a possible nuclear attack has made it necessary to transfer more authority to the executive branch, but this additional authority has apparently been carried over into the conventional military and foreign policy field. As a result, key foreign policy activities have not been properly debated in Congress, for we simply have not known enough to play our traditional and constitutional role‐in the formulation of foreign policy and the direction of the country. A particularly heavy veil of secrecy has been drawn over one especially important and dangerous aspect of the foreign/military policy field: the production and deployment overseas of United States nuclear weapons. While some secrecy in the nuclear field is justified, much of it is a carry‐over from the past and deserves the most searching review within the Government‐as well as more public disclosure and debate. No one seriously concerned about the future can deny that our current worldwide military posture could be interpreted by a possible enemy—in cluding the other superpower—as un necessarily threatening, and in any case belying any real interest on our part for achieving, through the cur rent SALT talks, a permanent peace by means of an agreement about the control of nuclear arms. It seemed to me axiomatic that the American public should know and un derstand as fully as possible the im plications of our current worldwide military deployment and the foreign policy commitments which this de ployment presumably enforces. Yet the public in this country often knows less than much of the rest of the world. As a ranking Republican on the F6reign Relations Committee observed recently, “Our problem is that we don't take the Hong Kong newspapers.” My personal feeling of alarm began to stir in 1963, with the defense budget mounting toward $80‐billion, and keen awareness based on per sonal experience that high cost and duplication are characteristic of our enormous military presence abroad. (Today, we have over seas more than 1,000,000 men in some 384 facilities and 3,000 minor installations, along with 300,000 at sea.) At best, an examination of this vast military position could point up waste and ineffi ciency; at worst, it presents—because of its high dollar cost and its direct relations to issues of war and peace—a serious present danger to the continued vitality of our free and democratic institutions. IT was against this back ground that the Senate For eign Relations Committee de cided to undertake a study of just what this nation's foreign policy commitments are. Sena tor Fulbright asked me to serve as head of the new sub committee and we began work in February, 1969. Seventeen months of in vestigating confirmed our al ready deep concern about ex ecutive branch secrecy sur rounding much of our foreign policy and the military under takings incident to those poli cies; secrecy which has now developed to a point where military activities often first create and then dominate for eign policy responses. I do not refer to the conceal ment of military details which could aid the enemy, nor to the publication of the precise terms of negotiations or spe cific agreements which could frustrate their successful con summation. I do refer, how ever, to the continuing failure to reveal, explain or justify the true dimensions of our ac tivities abroad, dimensions which are far better known by our adversaries than by the American public—and in some cases, by the American Con gress. As recent evidence, last month, for the first time in the history of the Senate For eign Relations Committee, an ambassador refused to testify about United States activities in a country in which we are waging war, unless specific regulations laid down by the State Department were ad hered to, including retention by the executive branch only of any written record. Accordingly, rather than agreeing to State's stipulation that the written record of the testimony of G. McMurtrie Godley, the United States Am bassador to Laos — where he directs all military as well as political activities—not be re tained by the committee, the committee elected to receive a briefing from the Ambassador, with no record being kept on either side. Publicity, I know, may be occasionally inconvenient to those who supervise the func tioning of a bureaucracy. The “system” works more smooth ly if unexposed to question ing. But public disclosure is a truly vital safeguard against government adoption of posi tions and policies of unknown and potentially dangerous im plications. And when it comes to issues which involve actua al survival (even more than mere prosperity and the ques tion of whether so much of our money should be spent for military rather than domes tic social needs), there is ob vious need for more careful examination. Beyond any pragmatic con cept is the philosophical. If this Government is one truly based upon the consent of the governed; if it is to function as the people's servant rather than their master, a proper measure of accurate informa tion is essential for the people to determine whether their Government is wise and right in its response to their needs. Today's danger resulting from increased secrecy with respect to foreign/military policy and programs exists at two levels: information denied the public and information de nied the Congress itself. As illustration, let us look briefly at the deep and costly American involvement in the secret war of northern Laos. Hearings on that country, which were held by our sub committee last October, gave members a fairly comprehen sive view of just what has been going on, for years, in that part of Southeast Asia. As shown by the transcripts, finally released six months after the‐hearings, the United States has been, and is, par ticipating heavily in a secret war that has cost many Amer ican lives and billions of dol lars. It is a war conducted far away from any Vietnam inter diction effort along the Ho Chi Minh Trail of southern Laos. From a modest 1962 role as a supplier of equipment to the Government of Prince Sou vanna Phouma, the United States has now become in volved in fighting on a broad scale. Under the veil of what was officially termed “armed reconnais sance,” American fighter bombers, as far back as 1964, began to attack Communist ground targets and troops—and therefore inevitably civili ans— in northern Laos; and American air effort in that area has grown continuously since that time. This air support took quan tum leaps during the various bombing pauses over North Vietnam, reaching a peak after the 1968 Executive order to cease all raids over that latter country. For over five years this secret American war has been going on in northern Laos; but until recently, the only reports on United States activities in that distant land were from representatives of the press who went to the scene. Some of these press stories con tained much accurate detail; but almost without exception their accounts have under standably contained mistakes. It was the old case of blind folded men touching the ele phant, with each describing the part he touched; and with American diplomats, here and in Laos, never anxious to re move the blindfolds. During the years 1964‐69, as the clandestine American role in Laos grew steadily, ex ecutive branch discussions and presentations to Congress were extremely limited; in some cases they were actually misleading. An illustration of the latter is the testimony in January, 1968, of William H. Sullivan—the United States Ambassador to Laos at the time—before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Ambassador told the committee, “We do not have a military training and advisory organization in Laos... We don't have ad visers with them [the Lao tians]. However, some of these units probably have been trained in Thailand under American supervision, though we don't have people with them. We don't have a mili tary advisory group there.” When later asked whether Air America—the C.I.A. sup ported airline — was engaged in bombing, Ambassador Sul livan replied, “No, sir... They carry equipment for our AID program... But they are not engaged in combat opera tions. There are no Americans who fly Laotian planes.” When asked whether the Royal Lao tian Air Force was doing any fighting, he responded, “They are doing all the fighting.” This testimony was com pletely misleading. Nowhere did Ambassador Sullivan ac knowledge the significant role of the United States Air Force, which for years has been bombing and napalming Lao tians in northern Laos, actu ally closer to the border of Red China than to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Even though I personally traveled all over Laos in 1966 and 1967, until these hearings in the fall of 1969 I never knew that United States pilots, flying out of Thailand, were bombing tar gets and napalming natives in that part of the country. WHEN confronted at our hearings with these earlier statements, Ambassador Sulli van, by then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. stated the reason he had given this‐type of testimony was because he had not been asked any direct questions about American air operations in northern Laos. Senator Fulbright observed, “We do not know enough to ask you these questions un less you are willing to volun teer the information. There is no way for us to ask you questions about things we don't know you are doing.” The subcommittee finally heard testimony on all phases of Laos, including United States support of this war; but the American people are still being denied full informa tion because of the continuing refusal of the executive branch to declassify portions of the transcript which, we think, should be in the public do main. Also known throughout the Far East is the participation in said Laotian war by United States supported third country military forces; but the State Department to date has also refused to make public the extent of this participation. Having achieved for the Congress during hearings last October a measure of dis closure about the situation in Laos, we turned our efforts to obtaining a release to the public of all testimony which would not help a possible enemy. After more than six months of discussion with numerous officials of both the Defense and State Departments, dur ing which period the President himSelf issued a statement containing some of the facts of United States involvement in Laos, the subcommittee fi nally obtained approval and then released what we con sidered to be a meaningful transcript of its hearings on this subject. Following this publicity, none of the nega tive results which the. State Department had predicted as reasons for nondisclosure did in fact occur. The implications of secrecy raised in connection with the war in Laos are more far ranging than this particular episode. As example, the se crecy of the Laotian opera tion raises the fundamental constitutional question of the President's right to wage war without either a declaration from Congress or, as in the case of these United States military operations in north ern Laos, even an authoriza tion from Congress. As the result of an arrange ment between the United States Ambassador in Laos and the head of the Laotian Government, the bombing of northern Laos actually began in 1964. Funds for this opera tion, which involved the send ing of American combat planes from Thailand to hit tar gets and people in the north, were obtained from the De fense Appropriation Act with out any public discussion or specific authorization. Thus the executive branch, under a veil of strict secrecy, was not only permitted to wage an un authorized war, but alio to set a precedent for undertak ing similar activities in other countries with which the United States has no formal treaty. A corollary to this consti tutional questioU is a specific foreign policy question also raised by this Laotian ex ample: namely, does the exec Utite branch have the right to make an agreement with a foreign government which would involve the use of American military forces, ei ther air or ground, when part of that agreement includes a stipulation that the United States would not disclose such activities? Also of grave concern is the fact that this secrecy concern ing United States activities in northern Laos permitted the Administration to escalate heavily the fighting in that area while it was de‐escalat ing, with much public fanfare, the war in South Vietnam. As a result, the American people were misled as to the over‐all role of the‐United States in Southeast Asia; whereas the enemy — fully aware of the stepped‐up United States bombing — received quite a different impression with re spect‐to the actual intentions of our Government. This secrecy also prevented any objective review by the Congress of our policy with respect to Laos. Only after a closed session of the Senate, in which some details of the heavily stepped‐up bombing were first disclosed to the members, did the Congress fi nally take action by adopting an amendment which pro hibited the sending of ground combat troops into that coun try. The vote on the amend ment was 73 to 17. As for the future, if the precedent of Laos secrecy had gone unchallenged, the Presi dent, ‐in effect, would have been able to assume authority to undertake secret military operations in any country he desired, disregarding the. ne cessity of having, through treaty arrangement, either the authorization or even the prior consent of the Congress. Moreover, if in the same man ner the executive branch in the future chooses to deny Congress the opportunity to approve or disapprove such major foreign policy decisions, then at the same time it would be denying the right of the people in a democracy to have a voice in policies which involve the overriding issues of war and peace. ANOTHER aspect of the problem of secrecy incident to the formulation of foreign/ military policy is well illus trated by the developments which led to the United States’ supplying financial and mate riel support to the Philippine noncombatants who went to Vietnam. At the request of Philip pine Government leaders—who desire to hide the United States financial support from their own people—an official cloak of secrecy was dropped over‐:.United States participa tion and financial contribu tions. As a result, the Amer ican people, too, were kept ignorant of the fact their taxes had been used to pay for Philippine support in Viet nam; and, lacking the facts, were led to believe that the Philippine Goveinment had spontaneously joined in with the. United States in the com mon defense of South Viet nam. A complicating factor arose during the 1965 Philippine elections. The successful can didate for President, Senator Ferdinand Marcos, who was running against incumbent President Macapagal, took a public position against the sending of Philippine com batants to Vietnam. After Marcos's victory and his as sumption of the Presidency, however, he changed his po sition, but stated he would send only noncombatant troops. One proviso of this‐agree ment that the United States would grant extra allowances to individual Philippine sol diers and officers—allowances that would more than double their regular salaries — was that the terms of these allow ances, as well as the allow ances themselves, would be kept secret. Philippine offi cials feared that public knowl edge of the payments would make the force appear to be a mercenary one. At the. request of the sub committee, the manner in which this extraordinary ar rangement was implemented has now been investigated by the General Accounting Of fice; and the subsequent G.A.O. report can only be de scribed as incredible. True to past secrecy practice, how ever, the State Department has required the G.A.O., and therefore the subcommittee, to keep classified startling in formation about this question able use of taxpayers’ funds. It is our conviction that the American people should have been informed when a de cision was made initially by this Government to heavily fi nance Philippine noncombat forces to Vietnam. Such un warranted use of secrecy— and the Philippine case is not unique—can only have serious implications far beyond the limited matter of these troops. For example, when the rules of such secrecy are ap plied, they require that within the United States Government certain steps be‐taken to ob serve such rules. In this par ticular case, the secrecy ordered in turn required that United States military prepare highly questionable, if not ac tually illegal, documents in order to justify the payments and at the same time satisfy the requirements of the Philip pine Government. Secrecy enabled this Gov ernment to turn over to the Philippine Government mil lions of dollars, according to the G.A.O. report, without any U.S. control over the money's use, irrespective of the spe cific purpose for which the funds were made available in the first place. Earlier this year open hear ings on U.S. payments for Philippine forces in Vietnam were held in the Philippines. with the witnesses under oath. We had planned to have sim ilar hearings on this matter in June, but we have just been advised by the State Depart ment, they cannot furnish wit nesses for the hearings until later this month. They also again bring up the question of secrecy, by demanding that any hearings on this subject held in this country be con ducted in executive session: All such actions by our Government could be in terpreted by the governments of other countries as justifica tion for not believing our claim that ours is an open society. Thus our policy of se crecy, in itself, could do seri ous damage to our present and future relations with other countries. SIGNIFICANT as the dis closures to date of our for eign policy and conventional military activities in South east Asia may have been—all part of the subcommittee's ef fort to present the grave dangers‐of excessive secrecy —these developments pale compared with the need for more disclosure of our current worldwide deployment of nu clear weapons. For reasons we are now asking to have explained, the executive branch continues to maintain a strict silence on this vital matter, reftising to disclose not only to the Amer ican people, but also to proper committees of the Senate, full details about the vast prolif eration of nuclear weapons. Any possible enemy is cer tain to know as much about the approximate location‐and general number of these weapons as Congress is en titled to know. The executive branch has announced that in Europe alone the United States has positioned 7,000 nuclear warheads; and such informa tion, along with the various political and military agree ments covering their location and handling; must be a major factor in the formulation of foreign policy with each of the countries in question. In 1957, a large stockpile of these weapons in Europe was approved by our NATO allies; and while the doctrine of “massive retaliation” was later changed to include that of “flexible response,” this stockpile in Europe has never theless continued to grow. We of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, however, have never been given any details about the nature, or degree, or the rea sons for that growth. In 1966, Secretary of De fense Robert McNamara did make reference to said growth when he testified’ as follows before a joint meeting of the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees: “We believe that the need now is not for more tactical nuclear weapons, because by the end of June of this year we will have a 100 per cent increase in the number of tac tical warheads in the soil of Western Europe compared with what we had in 1961, but rather for weapons which have a better chance of sur viving in both nuclear and nonnuclear environments.” Previously a suggested freeze on further deployment, however, was met with stiff resistance by one country, and abandoned. IN 1962, the Soviet Union commenced the installation of medium‐range nuclear mis siles in Cuba. This touched off the well‐known crisis; and President Kennedy described the danger to our shores as follows: “This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base—by the pres ence of these large, long range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass de struction—constitutes an ex plicit threat to the peace and security of all the Americas. “I call upon Chairman Khru shchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations.” The theory of overkill has been generally accepted. The “two scorpions in a bottle” concept is sound in that to day neither of the two super powers, could prevent destruc tion by the other. Every American who desires peace, therefore, has the right to ask—if this one deployment by the Soviets some 90 miles from our shores was consid ered to be such a threat to our security, why should not the Soviets consider as equally dangerous to them the de ployment of nuclear weapons by the United States in coun tries even closer to their border? There was a touch of irony in the television address of Oct. 22, 1962, when President Kennedy assured the world that “our own strategic mis siles have never been trans ferred to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of secrecy and deception...” Perhaps these installations were not made without the knowledge of the other na tions involved, but clearly such actions have been kept secret from the Congress and the American people. In this connection, let us note how very little, if any, debate there has been in the Congress, or for that matter anywhere else in this coun try, about the deployment of nuclear weapons. Again, as has been true of many other weapons systems which in the past have cost the American taxnaver Unnecessary billions of dollars, the more a policy of secrecy can be maintained about any such program, the better the chance for receiv ing the‐money from Congress and later covering up costly mistakes. There are some who believe that if there had been more information about such mat ters as lethal fallout, required computerization, and possible electronic failures incident to multinuclear explosions, the Safeguard Antiballistic Missile System (ABM), which passed the Senate last year by one vote, would not have been approved. One example of the con tinued use of secrecy in the effort to gain support for this weapons system: last June 4 Dr. John Foster Jr., Director of Defense Research and En gineering, in open testimony before the Senate, cited the “O'Neill Report,” made last January to the Secretary of Defense by a panel of inde pendent scientists; the report, Dr. Foster alleged, supported the view that the Safeguard ABM would “do what the De partment of Defense wants it to do"; since the report is classified, Dr. Foster was not in a position to discuss the details ‐which justified his statement. Later, however, two mem bers of the O'Neill Report panel flatly denied, in an open session before the Senate, that the findings of the panel con tained the conclusions which Dr. Foster said it contained; so once more it became im possible to discuss the details of a proposed multibillion‐dol lar weapons system on its merits, a system which both of these experts opposed without reservation on the grounds that it was not cost Only Congress can cut through executive secrecy” effective and would not fur nish the protection claimed. IN any case, a continuation of this policy of unwarranted secrecy is clearly as unwise as it is undemocratic. The citi zens of this nation; conscious of the need for more and bet ter housing, more and better schools, control of crime and pollution, etc., are neverthe less bending under increasing taxes along with reduced pur chasing power due to infla tion; and they have the right to know a lot more about the reasons for these multibillion dollar expenditures. They are the ones who pay, and there fore the ones who should have more knowledge, and through that knowledge more say, in the establishment of priorities for our increasingly limited resources. In addition, the people have the right to know more about who profits from the pur chases‐and operations grow ing out of such defense pro grams. A further problem present ed by this policy of unprece dented‐secrecy has to do with the effect the deployment of these weapons abroad has on our agreements. with countries in which such weapons are located. Perhaps the most disturbing risk: What would happen if some nuclear weapons fell into. the hands of a once friendly government turned possible enemy? As illustra tion of this possibility, in one country, at a tme of interna tional crisis, a local. com mander informed the Ameri can officer in charge that he intended to take possession of some of the nuclear weapons stationed there. That confrontation was solved ‐without publicity. But in this fast‐moving world any change in the international game of relative force no doubt furnishes a temptation to the leaders of the host countries; and some of these nations are ruled by military dictatorships. Knowledge of the deploy ment of our nuclear weapons in Europe is to my mind basic to any meaningful assessment by the Armed Services Com mittee of the number of troops and installations re quired in a particular area. With respect to its efforts to define the United States’ foreign policy commitments, the Foreign Relations Com mittee must of necessity be informed about what coun tries contain our nuclear weapons, along with what commitments have been made to those foreign governments which have such weapons on their soil. The subcommittee investi gated the legal issues raised by the position taken by the executive branch; it concluded that there is no indication, either in legislative history or precedent, for believing that Congress intended, in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, to limit inquiry into matters which are clearly basic to our foreign/military policy. ON the subject of execu tive privilege, this investiga tion pointed up. another un fortunate dimension in the policy ‐of limited disclosure established in the past and carried on by this Administra tion: namely, any extension of this concept goes to the heart of the democratic process and raises more pointedly than ever the fundamental issue with respect to the proper dis tribution of authority between the executive branch and Con gress. It is axiomatic that the executive branch does not have sole discretion as to what information about the use of the taxpayers’ money should be given and what should not be given to the proper committees of Con gress. Otherwise, in effect, Congress would be forced to appropriate blindly billions of dollars for various projects the desirability of which would be questionable. In an extraordinary memo randum prepared in 1958, transmitted over the signature of the then Attorney General to a Senate Judiciary Subcom mittee, the Justice Depart ment asserted that it was within the power of the executive branch to determine what information it would provide the Congress. Coinci dentally, that Attorney Gen eral, William P. Rogers, is now the Secretary of State. Without adequate informa tion, however, how can the Congress perform properly its constitutional obligations to enact laws, appropriate funds and ratify treaties? As our self‐appointed post World War II mission to both defend and finance much if not most of the free world comes under increasingly skeptical surveillance, it would seem that proper dis closure to the Congress is es sential to intelligent function ing under our Constitution. The executive branch, as the party in original possession of pertinent information, will in evitably prevail unless the legislative branch, with the help of public opinion, can obtain disclosure. Such dis closure is essential, because a continuation of this policy of unnecessary secrecy could en danger the survival of the nation. Only the. Congress can cut through executive secrecy. Using appropriate committees in the foreign and military policy fields; Congress must increase overseeing responsi bilities with systematic fact finding inquiries, both in this country and abroad. In this way the people can be better informed and Senators can better meet their “advice and consent” role in the formula tion of foreign policy. Fifteen years ago Walter Lipprnann wrote thatforeign policyrnaking officials “... rarely feel they can afford the luxury of telling the whole truth to the people. And since not telling it, though prudent, is uncomfortable, they find it easier if they themselves do not have to hear too often too much of the sour truth. The men under them who report and collect the news come to realize in their turn that it is safer to be wrong before it has become fashionable to be right.” The current domestic and international situation does not permit us the luxury of delay; and now it has fallen to the Congress, with the sup port of the people, to break this chain of automatically continuing policies; and in that way, also to break through the government se crecy which has been and is being utilized both to defend the past and to limit the future.

626-> MINE REBEL LEADS IN PENNSYLVANIA
PITTSBURGH, Dec. 9—Louis Antal, the candidate of a rebel group in the United Mine Workers of America, held a 514‐vote lead here today in a bitter contest with Michael Budzanoski, the incumbent, for presidency of the union's Dis trict 5. Still untabulated, however, were 1,200 absentee ballots cast by retired miners drawing the union's $150‐a‐month pen sion. These votes were expect ed to overwhelmingly favor Mr. Budzanoski, who is supported by the U. M. W. president, W. A. Boyle. Mr. Antal, the anti‐Boyle candidate of the Miners for Democracy movement, plans to challenge the validity of the absentee voting, used in this election for the first time in the union's history. The out come of the election, therefore, may depend upon the legal challenge, which may not be settled in the courts for months. The union's tally of ballot ing among about 14,000 coal miners in 10 counties of West ern Pennsylvania was 4,436 votes for Mr. Antal and 3,922 for Mr. BudzanoSki. Mr. Antal is a leader of the reform movement that grew out of the union's national elec tion last year. The rebel can didate then, Joseph A. Yablon ski, was murdered with his wife and daughter at their Clarksville, Pa., home three weeks after losing to Mr. Boyle. Mr. Yablonski had accused the Boyle organization of run ning a “dictatorship” marked by violence, intimidation, fraud and embezzlement. Mr. Budza noski has been one of the strongest Boyle loyalists. Mr. Antal, meeting report ers in the reception room of the District 5 office today, said “I feel that we have won the election.” “Boyle and his henchmen was what this was all about.” Mr. Antal said. “Budzanoski is just the figurehead and this is a symbolic gesture of the working miners — how they feel about the U.M.W. leader ship.” Mr. Budzanoski, speaking to newsmen in his office after a nearly sleepless night, said: “I talked to President Boyle today. He said he was disap pointed that the membership let me down this way after all my hard work for them. He acknowledged the fact that the Yablonski tragedy had stirred up the men.” Mr. Boyle could not be reached for comment. Mr. Yablonski's son, Ken neth, a lawyer for the Miners For Democracy faction in Washington, Pa., said he ex pected to file a Pa., election fraud complaint with the Labor’ Department by tomorrow con cerning the absentee ballots and also what he described as “a number of irregularities at the polling places spotted by our observers.” The reform group had posted over 100 volunteer college students as observers at local union polling places. The stu dents included about 20 from Columbia University. The Labor Department last March said its own investiga tion of the Boyle‐Yablonski election had disclosed enough evidence of illegal activity to warrant its going into Federal court to invalidate Mr. Boyle's victory and to seek a federally supervised re‐run of the ballot ing. The department's election suit has not yet been tried. Mr. Budzanoski and the Dis trict 5 secretary‐treasurer, John Seddon, are under Federal indictment for alleged falsifica tion of union expense vouch ers. Mr. Budzanoski said today that the indictments had “helped the opposition a lot.”

628-> Music: Flair for the Camerata Singers
BRAHAM KAPLAN and his Camerata Singers and Symphony Orchestra gave a very spiffy concert last night in Philharmonic Hall. The program was interest ing, the solo work of a high order, and the execution lively. Mr. Kaplan has real flair, and he makes music with exuberance. There is a feeling of real commitment in his work. THE CAMERATA SINGERS AND CAMERATA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. Conducted by Abraham Kaplan. With Martina Arroyo, soprano; Carol Smith, mezzo‐soprano; En rico di Giuseppe, tenor; Ara Barbarian, bass. At Philharmonic Hall. Cantique de Jean Racine Faure Symphony No. 1 Beethoven Stabat Mater Rossini Occasionally this exuber ance led Mr. Kaplan, last night, into a few dynamic extremes, where he pushed chorus and orchestra into some shrill sounds. But throughout the entire eve ning there was a quality of excitement, of performers throwing themselves into the music. We do not get this very often, and when we do, it is seldom with the profes sionalism that was brought to bear on this occasion. • Mr. Kaplan is primarily known as a choral man, and the Camerata Singers have participated in many Philhar monic concerts. But Mr. Kap lan is as good in front of an orchestra as he is in front of a chorus. His Camerata Sym phony is a smallish but as sured ensemble, nuanced in tone, accurate in intonation. With its relatively small body of strings, it is an ideal ve hicle for preromantic music. The Beethoven First Sym phony came out in a graceful yet full‐blooded manner. Mr. Kaplan likes fast and even ardent tempos, but he has so trained the orchestra that the articulation in all scale pas sages was clear and precise. Balances were meticulously observed, and there was a spirited rhythmic bounce to the playing. Much greater or chestras have given far less convincing performances of the Beethoven First than Mr. Kaplan conducted last night. The choral part of the program consisted of Faure's “Cantique de Jean Racine,” a sweet, sentimental, Gouno dish student work, and the Rossini “Stabat Mater,” This wonderful Rossini work does not turn up very often, but it is a masterpiece. The last decade has seen the Verdi Requiem not only come to flower but also overplayed to the point where it is ac tually hackneyed. Conduc tors should take a look at the Russini “Stabat Mater,” which in so many ways pre figures the Verdi. • It received an impressive performance. Marina. Arroyo was in magnificent voice, rising easily to the big C's in the “Inflammatus,” color ing sensitvely, mixing beau tifully with the other singers in the ensemble numbers. Enrico de Giuseppe started out in a rather, nervous and breathy manner, as do most tenors faced with the “Cujus animam” and its fearsome D flat. Mr. di Giuseppe made it, but just. That over, he set tled into strong singing. It might be mentioned that Mr. Kaplan takes the modern view of “Cujus animam,” which means a very fast tempo. Singers of a previous generation took it much more slowly. Carol Smith and Ara Ber berian are always dependable artists, and so they were last night. And Mr. Kaplan con ducted forcefully. There was shape to his work, and style. He properly stressed the dra matic elements of the music, realizing that it would be a mistake to be solemn in this operatic specimen of a Stabat Mater. To show that his con ducting is not always of a propulsive nature, Mr. Kap lan opened the evening with a flowing, pellucid account of the Faure “Cantique de Jean Racine,” which the superbly trained Camerata Singers performed like angels.

629-> Easing of Tax Rules on Depreciation Is Under Study as Spur to Economy
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 — In line with its new emphasis on finding ways to stimulate the economy and reduce unemploy ment, the Administration is again examining the possibility of liberalizing the tax deduc tions that businesses may take for depreciation. The idea had been discarded Parlier this year on the ground that liberalized depreciation would cost the Government more than the budget could stand in lost tax collections. Now, however, the Admin ktration's emphasis has shifted from strict budgetary control to ways of reviving the economy, preferably rather rapidly, so that full employ ment, or something close to it, could he achieved before the November, 1972, election late. Conservative economic theory holds that one of the best ways to stimulate the whole economy is to stimulate business invest ment in new plants and equip nient. The theory that liberal ized depreciation allowances stimulate such investment is essentially undisputed. DevelopmentInformation that the Treasury had revived its studies of liberalized depreciation came on the heels of two other significant developments today in the tax‐policy area. ¶Rona Id L. Ziegler, the White House press secretary, disclosed that the Administra tion is not considering imposi tion of a value‐added tax, which is a type of a national sales tax. ¶The White House made pub lic the report of its Task Force on Business Taxation. The re port was completed in April and printed in September. One of the main recommendations of the task force was for lib eralized depreciation. In releasing copies of the re port, Mr. Ziegler said that while President Nixon was “aware of the recomendations,” the White House was issuing the report “without comment.” Mr. Ziegler said the proposals would be “taken into account in future discussions of tax policy.” The main proposal of the task force was that the period of time over which businesses are permitted to write off the cost of their facilities be re duced by 40 per cent. Faster write‐offs mean bigger deduc tions from taxable income and, hence, lower taxes and more cash in the till for businesses. The proposed 40 per cent re duction was publicly discussed yesterday in New York by a task force member, Roger Mil liken, president of Deering Mil liken, Inc. dr textile company. He and other members of the task force were said to have been annoyed with the Nixon Administration for failing to make their report public. The chairman of the task force is a former ‘law partner of Presi dent Nixon, John H. Alexander of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and; Alexander. The task force report said that the cost to the Government in lost revenues from a 40 per cent reduction in the tax write off period for equipment would be $1.4‐billion in 1971, assum ing enactment of the change ef fective with the first of the year. The task force estimated the calendar 1972 revenue cost at $3.7‐billion and the 1973 cost at $5.1‐billion. A Treasury Department study done later in the year at the request of Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, put revenue losses of essen tially the same proposal at $1.9 billion in 1971, $5‐billion in 1972 and $8‐billion in 1973. The Administration had long known what the task force was going to propose and, while the Treasury gave the task force extensive technical help, adoption of its recommenda tions for liberalized deprecia tion was originally seen as simply out of the question, for budgetary reasons. In submitting the Treasury's own study of the subject to Senator Javits in July, Secre tary David M. Kennedy had written that any eventual Treasury recommendations on the subject would “depend heavily on the levels of Fed eral expenditures which are to be financed.” He added: “The Administra tion's continued concern with remaining inflationary tenden cies in the economy suggests a cautious approach to tax pol icy; it would be fiscally im prudent to embark on long range tax policy changes [such as depreciation liberalization] before the weather charts can be drawn with confidence.” What the Treasury currently has under study in the area of liberalized depreciation includes the 40 per cent reduction in tax write‐off periods; some smaller reduction, such as 20 per cent, in these write‐off periods; and other changes in depreciation, including, possi bly, a flat first‐year deprecia tion deduction of some fixed percentage, regardless of the length of time the equipment is expected to be used. In studying these possibili ties, the Administration is caught between two conflict ing considerations. It wants to hold the reduction in tax col lections to a minimum but it also wants to have a significant stimulative effect on the econ omy. Smaller revenue losses would involve a smaller degree of stimulation. Liberalization of depreciation is regarded among businessmen and conservatives generally as a more effective means of stim ulating the economy than re ductions in either corporate or personal income taxes. The Democratic policy‐makers of 1961‐62 also took this view when they liberalized deprecia tion and pushed through Con gress the investment tax credit that was repealed in the 1969 tax act. If the Administration ulti mately decides that it wants to liberalize depreciation, the de cision will probably be made in time for its inclusion in the budget that will be sent to Congress in late January or early February. Depending on how the lib eralization is to be achieved, it might be done without the need for legislation. The law merely requires that “reason able” deductions for deprecia tion be permitted, and the Treasury has, in the past, ex ercised great administrative leeway in determining what is “reasonable.” Mr. Ziegler's ‘statement that a value‐added tax was “not a matter before the President” apparently brought to an end, at least temporarily, a long study of this possible means of ‘raising additional revenue and restructuring the taxes paid by corporations. Secretary Kennedy, in par ticular, has become an ardent advocate of the value‐added tax since coming into Govern ment. But Congressional oppo sition is very strong, because the value‐added tax is seen as a tax on consumers and one that would raise prices. Representative Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, the chair man of the House Ways and Means Committee, is listed as one of the opponents of this tax. The Task Force on Business Taxation, by a vote of 13’ to 2, recommended adoption of a value‐added tax “or some other form of indirect taxation” at any time in the future when there was a need to raise addi tional Government revenue. But it said such a tax should not be used as a substitute for any existing tax.

YONKERS, May 9—Armbro Harvey posted the first sub two‐minute mile of the Yonkers Raceway spring meeting to night when he won the $15,000 White Plains Junior Free‐For All Pace in 1:594‐5 before a gathering of 27,613. Driven by Carmine Abbati ello. Armbro Harvey won by a head from the 3–5 favorite, La verne Hanover, with Nifty Nelse a length further back in a field of seven. The winner, owned by Abra ham Schultz of Bal Harbour, Fla., paid $6.80. $3 and $2.40 for $2 across the board. La verne Hanover returned $2.80 and $2.60 and Nifty Nelse $3.40. Armbro Harvey, who held the meet's best time of 2:00 3–5, covered the quarters in 0:29 4–5, 1:00 1–5 and 1:30 1–5. Tropic Song, who finished fourth, three‐quarters of a length be hind Nifty Nelse, dueled Arm bro Harvey nose‐to‐nose from midway in the backstretch until the head of the stretch. After Armbro Harvey, a 6‐ year‐old gelded son of Cape town‐Tarport Rhythm, survived Tropic Song's drive, Laverne Hanover made a rush at the leader. But with Abbatiello whipping furiously, Armbro Harvey had enough left to win. The triumph was the third in five outings at Yonkers for Armbro Harvey and raised his victory total to four in nine races this season. He has earned $29,950. ??

633-> Scientist Gives New View on How L‐Dopa Curbs Parkinson's Disease
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 24 —A neurochemist at the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology offered evidence today that L‐Dopa, the drug used with dramatic success in treating Parkinson's disease, may work by entirely unsuspected means. The scientist, Dr. Richard Wurtman, said that, although his results were derived from experiments with mice, they might open the way to more eeffective means of treating the disabling disease, which af flicts as many as a million Americans by inducing uncon trolled tremors. L‐Dopa is given to victims of Parkinson's disease in very large doses. It has been shown to alleviate symptoms in the vast majority of cases. It has generally been as sumed, without much direct evidence, that L‐Dopa operates by promoting the manufacture of dopamine, a chemical im portant in the transmission of nerve signals, which is deficient in the brains of Parkinson's victims. But Dr. Wurtman and a col league, Dr. Ross Baldessarini of the Massachusetts General Hospital, recently found that, in mice, only a small fraction (.1 per cent) of L‐Dopa reached the brain. While this small amount could account for the effect of L‐Dopa, the scientists looked for some other mechan ism. In experiments reported to day in Science magazine, they show that, within 45 minutes of injecting L‐Llopa into mice, much of the drug reacts with another brain substance, an amino acid called S‐adenosyl methionine, causing the cancen tration of the amino acid to drop by 76 per cent. Dr. Melvin Yahr of the Col lege of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, who is one of the leading authorities on Par kinson's disease, called the findings “very important.” He warned, however, that the ac tion of a drug in the brains of healthy mice was not neces sarily the same as that in dis eased human brains. The implications of the find ings are not clear. One theory is based on the fact that he amino acid is used to turn off the action of dopamine and another neural transmitter, no rephinephrine. By cutting down the brain's supply of the amino acid, L‐Dopa may make dopa mine and norephinephrine more effective. Dr. Wurtman said in an in terview that his findings might provide a key to Unproved treatment. Doses could be lowered, he said, if a chemical means were found to block the breakdown and waste of L Dopa before it gets to the brain. Last month L‐Dopa was ap proved for market sale as prescription drug by thei Food and Drug Administration fol lowing experiments with more than 6,000 persons. A day's supply costs from $1 to $3.

634-> Air Force Cuts 10 More F‐111F's From Its Plane Purchase Order
Cost adjustments have chip ped away 10 more planes from the planned Air Force purchase of the most advanced of its F‐111 attack bombers, the F model. This is on top of a previously announced cut of four planes from the original 40 covered in the $283‐million budget re quest for 1971. The latest cutback had been reported by industry sources and was confirmed in general yesterday by the Air Force. The Air Force attributed the reduction to cost adjust ments resulting from a slash of 121 in planned “F”‐model purchases made in December. Unit costs of any product are cheaper when total production is greater. The net result of all the cuts is that the size of the planned F‐111F wing is down to about 83 planes. By contrast, the earlier model wings will have 141, 94 and 96 planes each. It is stand ard to have 72 active planes in a tactical wing, with the extras available for replacement. The F wing, therefore, will have an austere margin of only 11 or so planes. The irony of this, to officers devoted to the plane despite its history of technical problems and soaring costs, is that the model that is suffering most, the F, is the one that promises to be the best, by far, in the inventory. F‐111 boosters and critics generally agree that, with its much more powerful P‐100 Pratt and Whitney engine, the “F” should turn out to have about the performance the Air Force sought when it first ordered the swing‐wing plane. The cutback of four F‐111F's early this year was to meet the costs of on‐the‐ground torture tests that the whole F‐111 fleet is undergoing to pave the way for releasing the planes for flight. Except for seven planes re leased for limited test missions, the fleet has been grounded since a Dec. 22 crash that oc curred when a metallic flaw caused the left wing to buckle. The two pilots were killed. The torture tests, in which wings and other parts are stressed to the maximum for which they were designed, were devised to ensure that no simi lar flaws existed in other planes. The tests got under way a month ago at the Fort Worth plant of the manufacturer, the General Dynamics Corporation. There were 232 planes in the fleet when the grounding was ordered, and quite a few more have since come off the line. Nine planes have passed the torture tests. They now are going through meticulous in spections by ultrasonic and other devices. And it is ex pected that the first of these tested planes will be back fly ing later this month.

636-> Transit Authority Gets Subsidy Of $74‐Million in Tunnel Tolls
The motorist began subsidizing the straphanger in New York yesterday. A check for $74,063,985, rep resenting surplus revenues from tolls on the nine bridges an tunnels of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority was deposited in the treasury of the City Transit Authority. “We have taken an import ant and historic step forward having rubber [motor vehicles] help pay for rails,” Governa Rockefeller said in announcing the transfer of funds. Arthur J. Goldberg, Mr. Rockefeller's rival in the November election, immediately characterized the announcemen as an election year “nonevent.’ He said the fund transfer had long been assured. Political observers said Mr Rockefeller's decision to call news conference to announce the long‐anticipated transfer of funds, and Mr. Goldberg's prompt reaction, reflected the significance mass transportation is expected to play in the race for the governorship. Clash Is Sharpened The clash over transportation was sharpened by several other developments yesterday. Mr. Rockefeller was asked at the news conference, which was held in his New York offices, 22 West 55th Street, to comment on a report issued Tuesday by Mayor Lindsay's Subway Service Watchdog Commission. The report was highly critical of safety, conditions on the subways, and assailed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority investigation of the May 20 fatal crash of two IND trains as a “whitewash.” “It sounds political to me,” the Governor replied. Dr. William J. Ronan, chairman of the M.T.A., the state agency that runs the Transit Authority, was seated behind Mr. Rockefeller. He quickly stood up and contended that Myron Cohen the chairman of the Watchdog Commission, had been “openly campaigning” for Mr. Goldberg. Mr. Cohen, in a telephone interview yesterday, denied campaigning for Mr. Goldberg. However, he said he had stated publicly that “political action” was needed to bring about improvement in the transit system. He also hinted that he might campaign for Mr. Goldberg after learning his position on mass transit questions. The use of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority surpluses to make up Transit Authority deficits was authorized in the landmark 1967 legislation that established the M.T.A. The huge transportation conglomerate took over the Transit Authority, Triborough Authority, Long Island Railroad, and other enterprises under a single management. PATH Received Earlier Aid The transfer of the TriborHugh funds marked the first time that the financially strapped New York transit system had received a cash subsidy from motorists’ tolls. Bridge and tunnel tolls already indirectly subsidize losses on the Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) rail system. The fund transfer had been blocked for months by a requirement for the consent of two‐thirds of the Triborough Authority's bondholders, the investors who loaned money to build the agency's bridges and tunnels. Final approval came in May. Under the 1967 legislation New York City had to provide $100‐million annually for subway construction projects. To qualify for the anmai surpluses. The actual transfer of funds yesterday coincided with the beginning of the city's new fiscal year, the day the city investment was legally authorized. The Triborough Authority had a surplus last year of $26million after payment of bondholders. The $74‐million signed over yesterday represents last year's surplus, plus revenues left over from 1967 and 1968. Dr. Ronan said the money would be used to, pay back $46‐million to New York City that the Transit Authority borrowed last year to help maintain the 20 cent fare through 1969. He said the balance would be used to offset expected deficits this year. The transit fare was increased to 30 cents Jan. 1. Dr. Ronan said the $74‐million, plus $26‐million expected from the Authority this year, would make it possible to keep the fare at 30 cents at least through Dec. 31, 1971, when the present transit workers’ labor contract expires.

637-> A Signal for Rozelle
As the National Football League labor impasse continues the question arises: How will it be resolved, and how soon? Increasing hostility between the club owners and the players would appear to compel Commissioner Pete Rozelle to arrange a resumption of negotiations. When he attended several meetings last month, settlement developed on sonic vital issues. Perhaps his presence would inspire a complete settlement. Federal mediation failed to produce a solution. It merely preceded a strike situation that threatens next weekend's 10 opening exhibition games. In turn, the loss of that exhibition‐game income would harden the owners’ position on their offer for the players’ pension fund, the root of the impasse. The time has arrived for the Commissioner to solve another crisis, his forte for a decade. “I've made myself available to both groups on an informal, basis,” Rozelle said yesterday, “and I will continue to make myself available.” The owners presumably would accept Rozelle as a mediator, but some players distrust him. Despite that, John Mackey, the Baltimore Colts’ tight end who is the president of the Players Association, has had, secret discussions with the Commissioner recently. Alarmists have put the 14game regular‐season in jeopardy, but Rozelle is more realistic. “It's difficult to say now.” the Commissioner said. “Training camp is needed both for the physical conditioning of the players and for the economic stability of the teams. Something is going to have to happen shortly.” If the Commissioner were to mediate, he would abstain from the issues involving him. The players are demanding that a ?? umpire be appointed In noninjury grievance cases, such as the Joe Namath controversy that occurred last year, but Rozelle would be awarded veto power. The players have agreed that Rozelle's authority should he binding in matters involving the “integrity of the game,” which could result in contradictions. Arbiter in Injury Cases Both the owners and players have agreed that Rozelle appoint an arbiter in injury grievance cases. But the Commissioner succeeded in eliminating the most serious threat to his authority. He persuaded the players to drop their demand that he be considered an “employer” when he mediated sessions at the Hotel Plaza here last month. Mackey recently recalled Roaelle's solution to that problem. “He held up both his arms,” Mackey said, “and he told us that the owners were holding a hammer over us, and that we were holding a hammer over the owners. And then he told us that if one side would drop its hammer, the other side would drop theirs. And worked out." The players withdrew their demand that Rozelle be labeled an “employer” and the owners agreed to negotiate preseason pay. Prior to that, the owners had contended that the players had promised in 1968 not to seek an escalation in preseason payments “in perpetuity,” which the players denied. Although about a dozen issues remain unresolved, the pension fund represents the basic problem. The owners’ objection is to what they call the “double hit,” meaning a player's salary, which he bargains for individually, and his pension‐fund money, which the association bargains for collectively. Strikes in other occupations, the owners contend, normally involve salary as the prime issue. Pensions usually are negotiated in the same package as salaries. Many owners like to relate their investment in pro football to that of a hobby. They contend that if a responsible financial adviser were to inspect team's financial statement, he would suggest that the owner sell immediately. During the impasse over a difference of $7.6 ‐million for a projected four‐year contract, several owners have acknowledged that they “don't mind being silly, but not insane” in their concessions. The players contend that the money, much of it from the lucrative TV contracts negotiated by Rozelle, is there to be shared. But through 55 days of bargaining over a period of more than four months, no settlement has developed. The owners and players have met in Honolulu, New York, Bimini, Miami, Baltimore, Chicago, New York again, and Philadelphia. If a neutral site is necessary, maybe the Commissioner can arrange the next meeting at United Nations headquarters.

638-> Bonnefous of Paris Makes His Debut With City Ballet
Weekend performances at the New York City Ballet brought in not only Jean‐Pierre Bonnefous's debut with the company but also a new part ner, Earle Sieveling, for Vi olette Verdy in Jerome Rob bin's “In the Night.” Mr. Bonnefous who, with At tilio Labis and Cyril Atanasoff, represents the new generation of male stars at the Paris Opera Ballet, made his first appearance at the State Thea ter Saturday afternoon, part nering Patricia McBride in Balanchine's “Swan Lake.” It was a role that did not show to full advantage the strong technique he has dis played in Paris, but his clean classic style promises to be well used in the company. Like all newcomers to the City Bal let, he will need to adjust his partneriner to the unusual rapidity of its female dancers. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Sieveling stepped into Peter Martin's original role in the sec ond pas de deux of the Rob bins ballet. If Mr. Martins's swooping gallantry with Miss Verdy gave a Tolstoyan tinge to the duet, it was the flavor of Natasha's first ball. Mr. Sieveling's aristocratic hussar, full of meaningful pauses and military flourishes, combined with the abandon ment of his partner, brought to mind the Tolstoy whose women throw themselves under trains. Mr. Sieveling's interpretation was highly interesting. A new dimension, as well as still an other costume change by Joe Eula, has been added to the ballet.

640-> Davis Cup vs. Rhodesia
Informal, unofficial over tures have been made to Rhodesia urging a with drawal from further Davis Cup competition this year, top United States tennis offi cial has disclosed. Robert B. Colwell of Seat tle, first vice president of the United States Lawn Tennis Association, said the discus sions were made on a “purely unofficial basis” with Rhode sian tennis officials. Colwell said discussions of Rhodesia's current position in competition “had nothing to do with politics.” “The question we are con sidering,” Colwell said, “is the same question which was raised over South Africa: whether the participation of a country will endanger the play of the Davis Cup.” Colwell said a special seven‐nation Davis Cup com mittee, of which he is chair man probably would he oneried by mail or cable on whether to allow Rhodesia to continue in the European Zone competition this year. The Rhodesian team won its first match against Israel by default: two ton Israeli play ers were drafted into the Army; a third was injured. “It's almost certain that Rhodesia will play Czecho slovakia and the Soviet Union in the next two rounds,” Col well said. “If this should hap pen, both of these countries probably would default. It would make a shambles of the Davis Cup if everybody started defaulting matches.” Colwell sail the seven‐na tion committee is empowered to refuse entry or determine if continuity of play should he ended. “When we kicked out South Africa,” he said, “everybody said we did it because of Arthur Ashe. This wasn't tour, The policy was simply whet lit South Africa's par ticipation would have jeop andized the play in the rest of the competition. “If Phodesia is banned, it ?? be because we're kich ing them out of international play or because we have any thing against their players. It's to preserve the competi tion.” South Africa was banned from the Davis Cup during a special meeting March 23 in London after the govern ment failed to grant Ashe a visa. Rhodesia holds racially mixed tournaments and has extended a visa to Ashe, America's Negro star. “The United Nations al ready has extended sanctions against Rhodesia.” Colwell said. “And there are around 20 countries in Europe who lack visa exchanges with them. We'd have a great deal of difficulty completing the competition.” A three‐fourths majority among the seven nations is required for any formal ac tion. Other nations on the committee are Britain, France, Australia, Malaysia, the So viet Union and Uruguay. The Rhodesian problem is one of several delicate inter national issues. Another in volves a possible team match between the United States and South Africa in the Fed eration Cup, the women's equivalent of the Davis Cup, later this month in Freiburg, Germany. The Federation Cup is a new event by tennis stand ards, begun in 1963 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation to encourage team competition among top women players. The sensitive question facing American officials is whether to adopt a consist ent policy for all interna tional team competition and boycott or to follow Davis Cup rules. “If South Africa is in the Federation Cup and doesn't endanger play,” Colwell said, “I wouldn't see any reason fur nut competing. But this is sornething, that has to he discussed. The Federation Cup is a new area com pletelyu.”

641-> SOUTAR CAPTURES BOWLING TOURNEY
LAS VEGAS, Nev., Jan 24 (UPI)—Dave Soutar of Gilroy, Calif., won the biggest purse of his career today when he took the $11,111.11 first‐place prize in the $77,777.77 Showboat in vitation bowling tournament. The 28‐year‐old Soutar, whose first title was the na tional championship nine years ago, threw seven straight strikes in the nationally tele vised championship game as he defeated Don Glover, Bakersfield, Calif., left‐hander, by a 257‐214 score. Soutar finished in fifth place in the 40‐game qualifier that preceded the final matches. He had to defeat three opponents before facing Glover, whose average of 220 plus in the elimination phase earned him the right to he seeded in the finals. In the first game against Dick Ritger of Hartford, Wis., Soutar prevailed when he tri pled from the eighth through the 10th frames for a 215. Next was Johnny Guenther of Seattle, who rolled a 300 game on TV a year ago. Again Soutar tossed three strikes from the seventh frame on, and the final tally was 215‐193. Johnny Petraglia, 22, of Brooklyn, who finished second in last week's Greater Los An geles open, put up a valiant fight and led after six frames in the third match. But Soutar was in stride and won handily, 247‐221, when he registered five straight strikes from the seventh frame on.

642-> Market Place:
Ripples from the liquida tion of the First Devonshire Corporation continue to fan out from Wall Street to in volve customers of other brokerage houses and even retired people in Miami Beach, Fla. Some embittered individ uals affected by the New York Stock Exchange's deci sion to suspend First Devon shire feel that the firm is being denied membership in the club even though it paid its dues. The suspension means that First Devonshire's customers do not have the protection of the Big Board's $55‐million trust fund. With that protec tion, they might have been trading as usual—like the customers of 10 other firms in financial trouble that have the trust fund's backing. First Devonshire accounts have been immobile since the receiver froze them some weeks ago. It now appears that there was a major debate among the 33 members of the New York Stock Exchange's board of governors over the ques tion of trust fund backing for First Devonshire and Charles Plohn & Co. Both of these firms were suspended at the same meeting. Some friends of the ex change who were briefed on the debate believe the Big Board may have made a mis take in denying the fund's protection to the two firms. The feeling is that it was short‐sighted to deny protec tion to them because the ex tent of their liability is rela tively small. However, members of the board—many of whom feared they and other members of the exchange might be per sonally liable if the $55‐mil lion trust fund ran out—evi dently were unwilling to accept the risk. Another consideration was said to be the fact that the exchange had assured Con gress that only 10 firms needed to be covered by the trust fund. Meanwhile, what about the customers? Have they begun to get their securities from First Devonshire? The an swer is no, even though the receiver said on Sept. 9 that he expected to start transfer ring out accounts on Sept. 11 at a rate of 50 a day. There are 6,000 to 7,000 First Devonshire accounts. A spokesman said yester day that yesterday had been set as the next target but that to date not a single ac count had been transferred out. The new target date for shipping out accounts—many of which he said are already packaged and ready to go—is within two weeks. Some brokers formerly with First Devonshire have com plained to this newspaper that their customers have been signing general releases made up by the receiver, Thomas J. Cahill, that must be among the broadest ever devised. While the release states that it is signed for “good and valuable consideration,” the owner of shares is asked to sign and return the release before getting his shares and with nothing but a letter from the receiver to show for it. The signer discharges for ever First Devonshire and Mr. Cahill from “all manner of action and actions, cause and causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, ac counts, reckonings, bills, bonds, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, promises, dam ages, judgments, executions, claims and demands whatso ever in law, admiralty or in equity.. I ever had, now have.. or shall or may have from the beginning of the world to the day of the date of these presents.” Jerome Feldman, formerly in‐house counsel of First Dev onshire since hired by Mr. Ca hill to help in the liquidation, said that a number of these releases had been signed and delivered. Customers are now being told to sign the release effective only to the extent that securities and cash are both released. He said Mr. Cahill's intent was that the release should have been so qualified. Meanwhile, a broker who worked for First Devonshire in its large Miami Beach of fice said that many retired people there were unable to pay their rent and other liv ing expenses because they de pended on monthly dividend checks from First Devonshire. He bitterly criticized the stock exchange for not com ing to their rescue with trust fund guarantees. Another broker, specializ ing in puts and calls, said that any customer who had an option endorsed by First Dev onshire would find that he could not get delivery and would thus lose a profit he believed was locked up plus his original premium. Nobody knows who the endorser is when he buys an option, the broker said. So people who had no idea they were in volved find that they are. Washington's Birthday An item in this columh yesterday said that the New York Stock Exchange would observe Washington's Birth day on Feb. 22, 1971. In fact, the exchange will ob serve his birthday on the third Monday of February, the 15th, under recent legis lation—just like every one else.

643-> U.S. Is Seeking to Extend Mideast Truce
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29—The United States is directing its diplomacy in the Middle East toward extending the Arab‐Is raeli truce beyond its present 90‐day duration to improve the changes for reaching a peace settlement in the negotiations starting tomorrow at the United Nations. Senior American officials said today that, while the United States had proposed a three month truce last June 19, the agreement to begin the peace talks tomorrow opened the way for new attempts for a longer truce. The officials said that the delicate peace‐making mission of Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, the United Nations representative for the Middle East, would be made more difficult if he had to carry it out “under the gun” of an inflexible deadline. They noted, however, that the new diplomatic initiatives would not seek an “indefinite” cease‐fire, which Israel initially wanted but which the United Arab Republic and Jordan op posed. Rather, the United States would seek a commitment in principle by both sides that the suspension in hostilities would be continued after the 90‐day cease‐fire expired Nov. 5 if the United Nations talks appeared to offer encouragement. Negative View on Fulbright Meanwhile, the Nixon Admin istration appeared to take a negative view of Senator J. W. Fulbright's recommendation for an “imposed” peace while re maining cautiously noncommit tal over his proposal for a United States treaty guarantee ing Israel's borders after she withdrwas from territories oc cupied in the 1967 war. Although Senator Fulbright, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, only de livered his speech in the Senate today, it was made public on Saturday and has already been a topic of controversy for two days. Before Mr. Fulbright delivered his speech today, the acting Senate Republican leader, Rob ert P. Griffin of Michigan, read a statement to newsmen ac cusing him of threatening the success of the peace talks open ing tomorrow. “On the very eve of negotia tions,” Senator Griffin said, “It seems most inappropriate to call, for an imposed settlement before the parties even have had an opportunity to negoti ate.” “I think the United States can use only one Secretary of State at a time,” he added, “and the one we have now is doing an excellent job.” Secretary of State William P. Rogers is the author of the American peace initiative that brought about the present cease‐fire. While Senator Griffin was not formally speaking for the Administration, officials here made it clear that they agreed with his assessment. Robert J. McCloskey, the State Department's spokesman, refrained from direct comment on Mr. Fulbright's proposals, saying only that “the Senator gave it considerable thought and we will study it carefully.” But he immediately volun teered the remark that the cease‐fire had been the result of a United States proposal. He said the situation was now in the hands of Dr. Jarring and Secretary General Thant of the United Nations who, he added, “have our full support.” Although Mr. McCloskey refused to be drawn into dis cussing the Fulbright proposal for a United States “guaran tee treaty” for Israel, other American officials said later that his reticence reflected the Administration's view that the suggestions were at least pre mature and possibly harmful to the Jarring negotiations. Cairo Accuses Israelis Mr. McCloskey again refused to comment on Israeli and Egyptian charges that the stand still and cease‐fire had been violated. Cairo today issued its first accusation against Israel following a barrage of denunci ations by the Israelis that the Egyptians were moving forward missile batteries. Mr. McCloskey said merely that the United States was in “close and pri vate contacts” with all the par ties on the armistice observance. In the Senate, Mr. Fulbright read only a part of his 15,000 word speech on “old myths and new realities,” but he engaged in an hour‐long discussion with Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, who sought clarifications of the pro posals. Questions were also raised by Senators Jacob K. Javits, New York Republican, and Charles H. Percy, Illinois Republican. The main thrust of the ques tions was whether Mr. Ful bright believed the Soviet Union would abide by any settlement worked out by the United Na tions. Mr. Fulbright said he be lieved Moscow would do so and he cited the progress in the United States‐Soviet arms limitation talks and the signing of the Soviet‐West German agreement as examples of what he termed a changing Soviet attitude.

644-> Law
So some of the criticism, at least, had had an effect. Attorney General John Mitchell had seen two of his hand‐picked Supreme Court nominees thoroughly discredited and cast away; now, looking for all the world like a man who had met his match and lost, he is going to try a new approach. From now on, said the Attorney General, he would let the American Bar Association's judiciary committee look over all potential candidates for the Court before he sent them to the President. The question was, would it make any difference? Was Mr. Mitchell, in fact, acting as someone who had met his match? Or was he, as the cynics said, looking for a nice way to (1) quiet his critics, and (2) keep getting on the Supreme Court the kind of men he has already managed to place there — competent and learned, if conservative, types like Warren Burger and Harry Blackmun? On the evidence, it seems that the cynics have point. ‘Quick and Informal’ To take up the first question first: It should be noted that even under the old system, the nominees who caused the critics’ ire—Clement F. Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell—did not, in the end, get appointed. It should also be noted that the committee that Mr. Mitchell has chosen to screen his choices, at the committee's behest, is the same committee that under the previous procedure had approved Judges Haynsworth and Carswell. And, in fact, when the committee's chairman, Lawrence E. Walsh, was describing the new procedure to a reporter last week, he said that the first step would be a “quick and informal investigation to see if the fellow is likely to be good or bad”—and added hurriedly that he “assumed” the candidate would be good or he wouldn't be under consideration. Still, to be fair to Mr. Mitchell —and perhaps to bolster the view that the plan is a way to calm his critics—the new plan is, undeniably, an improvement over the old arrangement. As even Mr. Walsh said, “Our procedures weren't really very well geared to investigating.” It started in 1954—two years after the committee had begun reviewing nominees for the lower Federal courts — with a request from then‐President Eisenhower to screen William Brennan. The problem was, from then through the Johnson years, the committee was given only 24 hours between the time of the request and the time that the Supreme Court nominee was to be announced. Then came the Nixon era, and even the scant 24 hours for hasty prepublication review were dispensed with. Instead, the President just announced his appointment; it was left to the Senate's Judiciary Committee, afterward, to call upon the A.B.A. committee for an opinion. So the key to the new plan is that the Attorney General will go, privately, to the A.B.A. committee; the committee will make a preliminary survey; then, if it seems worthwhile, a broader study with extensive interviews of fellow judges, lawyers and law professors as well as, if the candidate is a judge, investigation of his opinions and record on appeal. The benefits, as Mr. Walsh, and presumably Mr. Mitchell, see them, are considerable. First of all, says Mr. Walsh, the committee will be more likely to get a “candid” opinion. And if a candidate turns out to be not so good, the committee can tell the Attorney General this without so much embarrassment to either the Attorney General, which the committee admittedly does not relish, or the candidate. In the end, though, is all this enough to insure a good nominee? The vice chairman of Americans for Democratic Action, Joseph L. Rauh Jr., accused the Attorney General of “weak‐kneed capitulation to one of the most reactionary forces in America"; unfair as the statement may be, it nevertheless hints at the viewpoints of a lot of American lawyers. For though the Bar Association has recently become more involved in current social problems—in large part due to its president, Bernard Segal—it has a long tradition of conservatism. As for the A.B.A. judiciary committee itself, numerous legal experts have called it unrepresentative of the nation's lawyers and even of the A.B.A. So there are many who, looking at the new plan, would agree with this assessment by Jack Greenberg, director of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund: “If the A.B.A.'s part of the check, that's fine; the question is, ‘What else are they going to do'?’ —LESLEY OELSNER

645-> INQUIRY ON MAFIA TOLD OF BAD LOAN
TRENTON, April 1 — The State Commission of Investi gation heard several witnesses testify today that alleged Mafia figures had gained control of a man's oceanfront mansion in Long Branch and then had proceeded, in an apparent conspiracy that involved arson and municipal corruption, to erect a luxury apartment house on the property. The commission, which al ready has portrayed Long Branch as a community heavily infiltrated by organized crime with the connivance of munici pal officials, devoted most of its public hearing today to the case of Samuel S. Wolf. Mr. Wolf, a former Manhat tan liquor dealer whose failing business and extravagant per sonal expenditures led him to seek money from a reputed Mafia shylock in 1960, owned a 20‐room beach home in Long Branch. He said that he took loan of $20,000 at an annual interest rate of 50 per cent in 1960 from Frank Sacco, a reputed Mafia loanshark from Scarsdale, N. Y. Mr. Wolf said that in 1963, Mr. Sacco gained the rights to his Long Branch home by tell ing him that he could use the title as security for another usurious loan. But he said that Mr. Sacco claimed the title on record and that he was evicted from the mansion on June 27, 1963. According to Mr. Wolf and Leonard R. Riccio, a fire insur ance investigator from Newark, Mr. Sacco moved in with sev eral alleged Mafia cronies the day after Mr. Wolf moved out. Witnesses and neighbors re ported that the mansion was then apparently turned into a high‐rolling gambling house, surrounded on weekends by long, black limousines, most of them with New York registra tion plates. Then witnesses testified a local real estate man expressed interest in developing the prop erty, and the commission said this apparently led to the events of Aug. 6, 1963, when the house was destroyed by fire. Mr. Riccio said there was clear evidence that two fires had been deliberately set. Later, on the burned‐out site, a company called Nisac Realty constructed a high‐rise luxury apartment house that has come to be known as a residence of top Mafia figures in Monmouth County. The commission called Samu el de Bartolis, the Long Branch building and plumbing inspec tor, who testified that he had approved the apartment house while receiving nearly $4,000 plumbing work from the com pany. Charles E. Polk, chairman of the Long Branch Planning Board, said he had approved the apartment house and had received $1,500 for landscape work at the building site. Neither Mr. Polk nor Mr. Bartolis saw any conflict of interest when that question was raised by the commission. Raul F. Anderson, a doorman at the apartment house, which is now called Harbour Towers, said he had observed such al leged Mafia figures going in, and out as Simone Rizzo (Sam the Plumber) DeCavalcante, who allegedly controls the rackets in Monmouth County. One resident at Harbour Towers was Anthony (Little Pussy) Russo, a reputed De Cavalcante lieutenant who was jailed by the commission for not testifying and is now serv ing a three‐to‐five‐year term in the State Prison on a perjury conviction. A commission investigator disclosed that Russo, while he lived in the apartment house had an unusual option to pay rent or not to pay rent. The investigator said Russo opted to live rent‐free.

648-> Hanoi Negotiators in Paris Willing to Hold Private Talks
PARIS, Dec. 24 (AP)—North Vietnam said tonight that it was willing to hold private talks with the United States to break the deadlock in the peace conference. But a statement by the Hanoi delegation to the talks, reply ing to yesterday's news con ference by Secretary of State William P. Rogers, did not in dicate that the North Viet namese would modify their stand in such talks. “The importance is not in the form of the conference, that it be public or private, en larged or restricted,” the state ment said. It said that for the con ference to progress, “the first necessity is that the United States abandon its aggressive designs, end the policy of Viet namization of the war, cease all acts and menace of war against North Vietnam, end reply seriously and posivitely” to the Communist peace plan. Mr. Rogers said yesterday, “I would think that private talks probably present a forum for progress that's more satis factory than the public forum —but we have not disavowed the public sessions at all.”

649-> POPE BIDS PRIESTS ALWAYS BE LOYAL
ROME, May 17—Pope Paul VI ordained 279 young priests in an open‐air ceremony today and urged them to remain united with their bishops and “never betray!” The pope told the new priests that they must spend the rest of their lives “in a spirit of sacrifice.” Before administering the sacrament of Holy Orders by laying hands on the young men from 33 countries, including the United States, the Pope prayed that God give them “a pure heart that knows evil only to define it, fight it and flee it.” The Pentecost Sunday cere mony in St. Peter's Square this evening marked the 50th anni versary of Pope Paul's ordina tion. From the hundreds of mes sages of good wishes that Pope Paul received from all over the world, the Vatican today singled out one sent by Leo Cardinal Suenens, the primate of Belgium. In his telegram, Cardinal Suenens said that the episcopa cy, clergy and faithful of that country were praying that God give “holy light and strength” to the Pope. The Belgian primate's mes sage and its publication by the Vatican bulletin for the press were regarded as indicating that both the Belgian Cardinal and Pope Paul were in a con ciliatory mood after recent strains. In an address Friday, Pope Paul voiced “grieved astonish ment” at what he termed the lack of fraternal spirit among members of the hierarchy in discussions of important theo logical problems. This was generally understood to be rebuke to Cardinal Suenens, who in a newspaper interview last Monday criticized Pope Paul's way of dealing with the issue of priestly celibacy. The Belgian primate advocated an open dialogue on the question all levels in the church. In today's homily, the Pope apparently alluded to dissent among the celrgy when he ex horted the newly ordained men never to doubt their priest hood, never to “isolate” it from their bishop and its func tion within the church, and never to betray. “We won't say more to you now,” the Pontiff concluded.

651-> U.S. Acts Against Whites In Alabama School Sit‐In
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Sept. 3 The Justice Department took action today in Federal court to block a group of white parents in a rural Alabama school district from interfering with court‐ordered desegrega tion there. It was the first major case entered by the Government since the massive round of desegrega tion now under way in Southern schools began, according to Justice Department spokesman. The role of the Justice De partment in the South has been clouded by the political rever berations that greeted Attorney General John N. Mitchell's an nouncement last summer— since rescinded—that 100 law yers would be sent into the South at the opening of school to monitor the progress of de segregation. Last week the Justice Department entered a motion in volving extra‐curricular activi ties in a small Georgia school district, but the legal steps tak en today represent the first move against significant oppo sition to a court order. The case grew out of an at tempt earlier this week by group of white parents in Tal ladega County to occupy class rooms in schools where they insisted on sending their chil dren in defiance of a court plan that assigned them to for merly all‐black schools in the district. District Judge H. Hobart Grooms ordered nine of the parents to appear in his court in Birmingham tomorrow to show cause why they should not be enjoined from further interference with the plan. In an affidavit filed by the Government, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that white parents in Talladega County took over several classrooms in three dis trict schools during the first few days of desegregation this week. In one instance, one of the parents assumed the office of principal and began to operate a separate school for approxi mately 170 white students who had been assigned to a majori ty black school, the affidavit stated. One of the schools the par ents and children were boycott ing was the newest in the dis trict and has been used by black students for only one year, it was reported. Govern ment sources said no physical force was used by the parents who had ignored the warnings of local school officials that the children would not be en rolled in schools outside the zones set up by the new plan. The sit‐ins in the three schools involved a total of nearly 500 white children, the Government attorney said. It was one of the few instances in the South this school term in which white parents have taken direct action in violation of court‐ordered desegregation plans. The school district, about 30 miles east of Birmingham, has been under a court order to desegregate since last January. In another court action in which the Justice Department was a party, District Judge Seybourn H. Lynne issued an order denying the right of group of white Birmingham tvicners to use the state's teacher tenure law to refuse new teaching assignments. The teachers, who had been assigned to new schools under the city's desegregation plan that went into effect this week, sought to challenge the trans fers on the grounds that re assignment was subject to the tenure code, which provided or hearings and other steps of due process.

652-> Stewart, Andretti Get Top Spots In Auto Racing Buff's Rankings
CALLING Jackie Stewart or Mario Andretti the world's “greatest” or “best” driver will get you an argument, but you'll be on safer ground characterizing them as the “leading” drivers of 1969. Just be sure to cite Ralph J. Money's annual driver stand ings as your authority. Money is a race buff, but he overrides personal emotions and opinions (his and anyone else's) in grading race drivers. Money is a mathema tician—professor of mathe matics at Fairfield (Conn.) University and mathematics coordinator in the grade schools of Trumbull, Conn.— and his approach is purely mathematical. Money does this grading as a hobby. He spends more than 400 hours a year culling race publications and thousands of news releases in compil ing a “weighted comparison of drivers' [finish positions] in all phases of auto racing” each year. For 1969 he tallied the points earned by drivers in an incredible total of 1,863 for eign and domestic races. • Stewart, the 1969 winner of the world drivers cham pionship on the international Grand Prix circuit for For mula One cars, leads Money's new list. Andretti, the winner of the United States Auto Club championship and of the Indianapolis 500, places sec ond. Only two American drivers are included in the top 10 and seven in the top 20. 1—Jackie Stewart 2—Mario Andretti 3—Bruce McLaren 4—Denis Hulme 5—Jochen Rindt 6—Jacky Ida 7—Jo Siffert 8—Jean‐Pierre Beltoise 9—Piers Courage 10—David Pearson 11—Al Unser 12—Bobby Unser 13—Gary Bettenhausen 14—A. J. Fort 15—Graham Hill 16—Dan Gurney 17—Chris Amon 18—Brian Redman 19—Jack Brabham 20—Le Roy Yarbrough Of the 10 leaders of 1968, four improved their positions: Stewart from 7 to 1, Andret ti from 3 to 2, McLaren from 8 to 3 and Ickx from 9 to 6.

653-> Injuries Haunt Phillies, Third Catcher Is Hurt
PHILADELPHIA, May 24 AP)—Injuries further crip pled the Philadelphia Phillies as they lost a third catcher today. Mike Compton, a catcher, brought up from the Pacific Coast League when Tim Mc Carver and Mike Ryan suf fered broken hands, injured his lower left rib cage while taking batting practice before the game against the St. Louis Cardinals today. Don Seger, the Phillies trainer, described Compton's injury as a possible spasm or muscle involvement. The Phils are down to 20 able bodies.

654-> POSTAL WALKOUT IS HITTING SPORTS
For the most part, the strike by the nation's postal employes has managed to hit the sports world in the off‐season, but there are a number of problems and minor hardships that could get worse if the strike con. tinues for any length of time. The biggest problem is lack of communication — the life blood of sports promotion. The mimeograph machines that grind out thousands of releases for Aqueduct and Yonkers, the Knicks, Nets, Giants, Jets, Yan kees, Mets, Rangers, Fordham, Columbia, N.Y.U. and St. John's have been momentarily hushed. A summary of other prob lems follows: ¶BASEBALL — The Yankees open April 7 at home against Boston, and the Mets on the 14th against Pittsburgh. Open ing‐day tickets and orders for tickets could still be in the post office. In addition, the copy for the Yankees Yearbook and pro gram is in the mail on its way to the printers, and Roy White, an outfielder, has been called up for reserve duty to help de liver the mail. ¶BASKETBALL—The Knicks have sold out their first playoff date tickets, but don't know the status of Mike Riordan and Caz zie Russell, who have been called up for duty with reserve units. American Basketball As sociation playoffs don't start until April 17, and the Nets probably won't play at home until April 22 should they fin ish third or fourth. ¶HOCKEY—The Rangers, un certain of a Stanley Cup play off berth, haven't printed tick ets yet, but should they make it, there could be a problem of communications. ¶TRACK AND FIELD—The Penn Relays, April 24 and 25, will be accepting entries at the Rutgers University state track clinic on Friday from 10 A.M. to noon, according to Jim Tup peny, director of the meet. ¶DOG SHOWS—Entries for the specialty of the Collie Club of America, which would have closed tomorrow with the Foley Dog Show Organization, will close instead on Monday, March 30. The event is scheduled for April 11 and 12. There will be no extension for three all‐breed shows, however. The Shawnee K.C. event on April 16, the Bal timore County K.C. on April 19, and the Harford County K.C. on April 20 will close April as scheduled. ¶FOOTBALL: Strictly off‐sea son for Jets and Giants, but the Jets report that “contract negotiations” with rookies, usu ally carried on by mail, may be held up. The Jets have no home exhibitions to sell tickets for and the exhibition with the Giants in the Yale Bowl has been sold out.

655-> F.C.C., lN REVERSAL, VOTES TO EXPAND CABLE TELEVISION
WASHINGTON, May 17—In a policy shift that could radi cally expand the program choices on American television, the Federal Communications Commission has tentatively voted to permit virtually un limited importation of out‐of town programing on cable tele vision, or CATV, systems. The new plan, lifting the most burdensome restrictions on cable television's develop ment, was sponsored by the commission's chairman, Dean Burch, and endorsed 4 to 3 in a preliminary vote Friday. Although the plan would give the CATV industry a powerful impetus, it would also divert 5 per cent of cable com panies' income into a huge new subsidy for educational tele vision. In addition, the plan provides for generous compen sation to independent local broadcasters who would stand to suffer heavily from the ex pansion of cable television's offerings. Mr. Burch's proposal is still in outline form and may face the concerted opposition of the established television networks and some local stations. But it is already being cautiously described as a historic break through in the liberation of cable technology. Cable television systems use large master antennas to pick up signals of distant television stations, which are then ampli fied and transmitted by coaxial cable or microwave to a central community point and then dis tributed by wire to the homes of subscribers. CATV, formerly known as Community Antenna Televi sion, currently serves about 4 million households in the United States, principally in remote communities where normal re ception is poor. In New York City, where it offers a sharp picture but only a few addi tional programs, CATV has been sold to approximately 50.000 homes and apartments. Unlike broadcast television, whose wireless signals are sub ject to interference and must be limited in number, cable televi sion transmits sound and pic tures through a wire, and can deliver up to 40 different clear channels to a standard televi sion receiver. Against this promise of di versity, cable television poses a number of threats to the estab lished order of the television industry. Through the intercon nection of widely scattered broadcast signals, it could dis rupt the local character of pro graming and advertising. And it has never been established how much cable systems should pay to the owners of copy righted programs (including movies) that CATV picks on the air and retails to sub scribers for a monthly fee. Accordingly, the F.C.C. had previously barred cable systems from importing distant signals into the 100 largest markets. With little original programing of its own to offer, CATV has not grown significantly in the big cities. Mr. Burch's solution, con ceived with the help of Henry Geller, the F.C.C.'s general counsel, is to let CATV systems import out‐of‐town program ing but require the substitution of locally sold advertising for the commercial breaks on the imported signal. Revenue from the substituted commercials would go directly to local ultra high‐frequency stations, whose audience would be expected to shrink as the CATV alternative grew in popularity. Thus, a Philadelphia cable company could transmit movies broadcast in New York. The substitution of ads would com pensate Philadelphia broadcast ers for the fragmentation of their audience and would pre vent the originating station in New York from marketing its advertising, like a network, on a multicity basis. For each distant signal they carried, cable companies would have to pay .7 per cent of their gross income into a gen eral pool for copyright owners. If a system carried five out‐of town channels, it would pay the copyright owners 3½ per cent of its income. Beyond changing the rules on importation of distant signals, Mr. Burch's proposal would significantly extend the Federal Communication Commission's regulation of local cable com panies and would supersede most of the rules that city and state governments have im posed on the medium. The proposal also holds open the possibility of the first F.C.C. limit on the charges that CATV companies impose on subscrib ers. In some cities these fees are locally regulated, but in many areas they are not limit ed at all. CATV charges aver age about $20 for installation and $5 a month for the pro gram service.

656-> A Bill in Georgia Seeks to Curb Power of Liberal Welfare Chief
ATLANTA, Feb. 14—William H. Burson, Georgia's contro versial welfare director who says he has won his war on hunger and wants to start on overpopulation, is in serious trouble with the Legislature and could be stripped of most of his powers if a bill being debated becomes law. The measure has been la beled the “abolish Burson bill” and would relieve the 41‐year‐ old former newspaperman of virtually all of his policy‐mak ing powers, transferring them to an advisory board he con siders antagonistic to his own approach to welfare programs. “This is a manifestation of the antiwelfare sentiment that permeates our society,” Mr. Burson said this week. On Tuesday, he told the Georgia House's Committee on Public Welfare that the bill, already approved by the State Senate, would put the Welfare Depart ment in the hands of those who have no concern either for those in need of assistance or for Federal welfare regulations. While some observers have speculated that racism pro duced the bill, Mr. Burson, once a press aide to United States Senator Herman E. Tak madge, said: “It goes beyond whatever racial implications it might carry.” The bill, he said, is merely an expression of those “who reject the idea that the state should be actively involved in caring for its people.” Further, Mr. Burson agreed with the bill's sponsors in the Georgia Senate who have in sisted that their legislation is not directed toward him. He was appointed to the job in 1967 by Governor Maddox and in the last two and a half years has been instrumental in establishing free food programs in all of Georgia's 159 counties. Now he wants to begin campaign for statewide family planning. “Birth control,” he said in an interview, “is the only realistic solution to wel fare problems. Without it, the problem feeds on itself.” The House committee will vote on the bill soon and Mr. Burson's future in state gov ernment could depend on its recommendation to the other Representatives.

659-> Renaissance Ensemble Fuses Classical and Rock at Fillmore
Renaissance is the latest Eng lish band to attempt a fusion of classical music and rock. The group played Friday and last night at the Fillmore East on a bill with Savoy Brown, a British blues‐rock band, and the Voices of East Harlem, a soul gospel ensemble. The Kinks, originally scheduled, were forced to cancel when a mem ber became ill. Renaissance shifts patterns often in the course of a song, playing a hard‐rock theme, then adding a jazz influence, a folly influence, and most fre quently a baroque‐keyboard theme. This is classical‐influ enced rock (“Bach‐rock” is a term that has seen some use), but it is classical rock for lov ers of rock. Where the New York Rock & Roll Ensemble, probably the leading group to pick up a clas sical influence, separates its rock songs from its classical ones, Renaissance throws to gether all the ideas it has col lected. Thus, it frequently sounds like a harpsichord fac tory that has been struck by a bomb. The group's strongest point is the often excellent piano work of John Hawken. Its main faults, however, are a certain lack of unity among the several ideas it may explore in the course of a song, and weak vocals. Its singing tends to be inconsequential. With Mr. Hawken, the mem bers of Renaissance are Keith Relf, vocals and guitar; his sis ter, Jane Relf, vocals; Jim Mc Carty, drums, and Louis Cen namo, bass.

660-> 2 SUSPECTS SEIZED ON BOMB‐PLOT COUNT
Two men were arrested on St. Marks Place last night after a policeman dressed as an East Village denizen allegedly over heard one of them tell the other how to make bombs. As part of the explanation, the police said, the man de scribing the process outlined it in writing on a blank page in a copy of the New Testament. Early this morning, the po lice said, the two men, identi ied aa, James Capper, 33 years old, and William Santana, 21, were booked on a charge of conspiracy to make explosives —which is a felony. According to the police, Pa trolman Joseph Sweeney of the Tactical Patrol Force overheard the alleged explanation and heard Mr. Capper tell Mr. San tana that the explosives were “to use in places but not on people.” The patrolman sports a beard and was wearing a beret, desert boots and a denim jack et as a member of the decoy task force of the T.P.F. Both suspects have previous arrest records, the police said. Mr. Capper, who said he lives at 3004 Albany Crescent in the Bronx, told police he was mechanic. Mr. Santana, who said he was a student, listed his address as 210 Forsyth Street on the Lower East Side. The arrests occurred down Circus, the discotheque, where a bomb exploded Sunday night, injuring 17 persons.

661-> I D. S . Funds Delay a Vote On Naming Budge as Chief
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15— Hamer H. Budge, the departing chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is again on the brink of taking a posi tion with the mutual funds managed by Investors Diversi fied Services, Inc. His position would be as president of the funds, not with the management com pany. The boards of the six funds were to have met today for mally to elect him, it has been learned, but called off their meeting when some I.D.S. of ficials expressed concern that the hiring of Mr. Budge, while he was still chairman of the commission, would raise storm of criticism. Mr. Budge's resignation will be effective with the adjournment of the present session of Congress, which can be not later than Jan. 3. Mr. Budge considered taking the same position with the fund group a year and a half ‘ago. When the word leaked out that he had been talking about a job with the fund group at the , same time he was nego tiating with the fund industry generally over regulatory leg islation, there was criticism. The next regular meeting of the boards of the I.D.S.‐man aged funds is set for Jan. 14, and Mr. Budge is expected for mally to be named president then. He would replace Harold K. Bradford, who is retiring. Mr. Budge was reported to have discussed the job as president of the funds with Mr. Bradford earlier this month when both men were in Florida for the annual meeting of the Investment Bankers As sociation. Mr. Budge is report ed to have met privately with Mr. Bradford at the latter's home, near the Boca Raton site of the I.B.A. meeting. The S.E.C. has taken several actions that are not necessari ly to the liking of I.D.S. or its funds under Mr. Budge's chair manship. The latest action ac cused the managers of two of the funds of improper use of inside information concerning a decline in profits of Lum's, Inc., a fast‐food chain. The managements have denied the charges.

662-> W. Germany Rated No.1 Riding Squad In World Standing
WEST Germany was the leading team in inter national horse show com petition last year and Alwin Schockemohle, a member of the squad, was the world's top rider. These conclusions were reached by Max E. Ammann, a 31‐year‐old Swiss foreign correspondent who is stationed in New York. Am mann covers the cultural scene and writes political commentaries for newspapers in Switzerland, West Ger many and Austria. Horse Show News His main outside interest is horse shows and he reports on them for numerous Euro pean magazines. He also is writing a history of the eques trian events of the Olympic Games, which is scheduled for publication next year. • Ammann recently finished a thorough review of world show jumping in 1969. The results are scheduled for publication in most European and North American horse magazines in the next month or so. “The review,” he said “will contain the rating of the 10 most successful Nations Cup teams and a rating of the most successful 20 riders. I don't think anything like this ever has been done before.” He studied the results of about 80 international shows around the world for his rat ings. “I also took into considera tion the resulits of the vari ous national championships, the North American Grand Prix in Toronto, the Eastern Canadian championship and the Oak Brook (Ill.) and Cleve land Grand Prixes,” he said. After West Germany, his team ratings are: 2, Britain; 3, United States; 4, Italy; 5, Canada; 6, Switzerland; 7, France; 8, Poland; 9, Soviet Union; 10, Belgium. • Following Schockemohle, Ammann's individual list in cludes: 2, David Broome, Britain; 3, Raimondo d'Inzeo, Italy; 4, Anneli Drummond Hay, Britain; 5, Janou Le febvre, France; 6, Hans Gun ter Winkler, West Germany; 7, Lutz Merkel, West Ger many; 8, Nelson Pessoa, Bra zil; 9, Hartwig Steenken, West Germany; 10, Graziano Man cinelli, Italy. The remainder of the top 20 were not rated in order. “This was a difficult year to rate the teams and indi viduals,” said Ammann, “be cause it was the first year of the traditional Olympic cycle. That meant, since it was the year after the games, no one wanted to travel much. The United States Equestrian Team stayed home and no Europeans came for the fall circuit here.”

663-> Market Place
How's that again? Morris Schapiro against the world? That's the way it seems at this point as the scrappy bank‐stock dealer battles an impressive array at talent from the New York Stock Exchange over the investor protection House and Senate confer ees have postponed a meet ing that was scheduled for today to resolve differences between the House and Sen ate versions. While the House bill would protect the inves tor with insurance to the tune of $50,000 and the Sen ate bill, $20,000, the upper chamber's bill has teeth the House version does not. Emissaries from member firms—including Abe Fortas, the former Supreme Court Justice, representing Loeb, Rhoades & Co.—are trying to extract the teeth put into the bill through an amendment by Senator Edward Brooke, Republican of Massachusetts. • Mr. Schapiro had taken ads urging the Senate to put these teeth in. An ad run yesterday by Mr. Schapiro urged” that, they be left in. , ‐ _ . Meanwhile, representatives of member firms are report edly in Washington “in droves,” according to one observer, to have the Brooke Schapiro teeth removed. Un der the Brooke, amendment, which was unanimously ap proved by the Senate; bro kers would have to segregate customers’ cash and securi ties, high financial standards would be required of those seeking membership in the insurance program (to be known as the Securities In vestor Protection Corpora tion) and a majority‐ of the directors would represent the investing public—not the se curities industry. The stakes are large. At the beginning of this year, Big Board members firms held $3‐billion in free credit balances for their customers. The Big Board is opposed to paying interest on these funds. If the brokerage houses earned 7 per cent’ on that money in 1970, this would amount to more than $200 million. That's four times the $55‐million Special Trust Fund that the exchange used to shield customers against loss from brokerage‐house failure. The Big Board is reported ly enlisting the aid of the Securities and Exchange Com mission in its fight, even though the Special Study commissioned by the S.E.C. in the early nineteen‐sixties recommended that reserves be maintained against free balances—similar to bankers’ reserves on deposits. Remember the old New mont Mining solution to cyclical earnings character istic of the copper industry? This well‐managed holding company used creative ac counting to overcome the pitfall: Irrespective of the underlying earnings of its largely owned subsidiary, Magma Copper, Newmont would adjust Magma's divi dends to insure a favorable earnings trend for the parent company. Shortly after the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants changed its rule seeking to end this prac tice for largely owned subsid iaries. Newmont changed accountants and continued the practice for a time. New mont now owns all the shares of Magma, so the is sue has become academic. Adjusting dividends to meet the vicissitudes, of eco nomic setbacks will be even more difficult in the future under new proposals ‐now in draft form which the ac countants’ institute will be circulating for comment. The proposed “equity rule“—requiring a company to include in its own income statement the proportionate share of income or loss of a subsidiary—would apply to investments representing 20 per cent or more of voting stock. This would apply to corporate joint ventures as well as investments in un consolidated subsidiaries. A second proposal would require a statement of sources and uses of funds in reports to shareholders— something that some corpo rations already give, though it is not required. The institute, which has been actively seeking more meaningful financial state ments under its aggressive executive vice president, Leonard M. Savoie, is also considering a policy change that would limit another source of confusion. This has to do with dis tortions resulting when long term receivables or payables bear no interest or an un realistic rate, of interest. The proposal would call for im puting a prevailing ‐rate of interest on such items. One effect would be that apparent profits on some property sales would be re duced at the time of sale and would be reported as in terest income during the payment term.

665-> Mayor Vows ‘Relentless’ Drive To Track Down Police Bomber
Mayor Lindsay conferred with top police and fire offi cials in the bomb‐shattered Po lice Headquarters yesterday and then pledged to the people of the city “that a maximum effort is being made to assure their safety.” “Those who have committed this vicious act and others who may be tempted to violence must know that the police in vestigation now going forward will be relentless,” the Mayor said. At a news conference after the meeting, the head of the department's bomb section, Lieut. Kenneth W. O'Neil, said the bomb that tore through the second floor of the headquar ters building Tuesday night and injured seven persons slightly could have been carried in package no bigger than an eight‐inch cube. He said it had the force of 10 to 15 sticks of dynamite and could have been TNT or any one of several military ex plosives. Chief of Detectives Frederick M. Lussen said that at this time neither radicals nor ter rorists nor disgruntled individ uals could be ruled out as pos sible suspects. “The door is wide open to all possibilities.” he said, and he asked the public to give the police any shred of information that might be helpful. Interest was focused on the Weather man faction of Students for a Democratic Society after identi cal notes taking credit for the bombing and signed “Weather man” were received early yes terday by The Associated Press and The New York Times. Postmarks on the letters, which were sent by special de livery, indicated that the notes could have been mailed either before or after the bomb went off. Chief Lussen said these leads were being investigated. On the weekend of May 23 and 24, a letter from the Wea thermen threatening an attack on “a symbol or institution of American injustice” within the following two weeks was re ceived in the Chicago bureau of The Times. The bomb in Police Headquarters went off just two days after that two‐ week period. While the Mayor was meeting with John F Walsh, the first deputy police commissioner, and Samuel Sheres, the first deputy fire commissioner, and their princi pal aides, a man called Police Headquarters and said other bombs had been planted in the building. Members of the police special events squad immedi ately fanned out through the building and searched it but found nothing. The call was one of several threatening ones received through the Police Depart ments special 911 telephone ex change yesterday, including one alleging that a bomb was to go off in City Hall. All proved to be unfounded. At 4 o'clock yesterday morn ing, three detectives, acccom panied by Hempstead Village policemen, arrested James Schroeder, 24 years old, at his home at 67 Terrace Avenue, Hempstead, L. I. Mr. Schroeder, identified as student, was brought to Man hattan and questioned for al most three hours in the District Attorney's office in connection with a telephoned bomb threat to Police Headquarters. He was then released in the custody of his lawyer. In Night Court, Assistant Dis trict Attorney Stephen North moved that a charge of aggra vated harassment against Mr. Schroeder be dropped “for in sufficient evidence.” The case was dismissed by Justice Neal P. Battiglieri. No one answered the door bell at Mr. Schroeder's home last night. Neighbors said he and his wife were a “quiet young couple” who had lived in the modern, three‐story apartment house for only a few months. They have no children. Members of the police bomb section continued their labor ious task of collecting debris for analysis. Lieutenant O'Neil said that his laboratories had “many fragments” to be ex amined but that he could not be sure that any of them were fragments of the bomb. He said there were both simil arities — none conclusive and dissimilarities between this explosion and others that have rocked the city this year, in cluding the three March 12 in the offices of International Busi ness Machines, Socony Mobil and General Telephone and Electronic. At the news conference, Com missioner Walsh said security arrangements for the head quarters building, precinct sta tions throughout the city and other public buildings were be ing reviewed. “For some time,” he said, “we have seen a need for se curity arrangments here and in other police facilities. But there is a margin for error in all these undertakings. The fact that an incident like this can happen is an indication that some changes should be made.” Commissioner Walsh would tot discuss what would be done in detail, but evidence of the ??tened procedures was al ??eady in evidence yesterday at headquarters. Extra Guards Posted At the Centre Street door, all persons in civilian dress were required‐to show identifi cation, to state their business and then to be escorted to the office they wanted to visit. There were a dozen men at the door to do this work, com pared with only two who were stationed there before the bombing. Outside the building there were men in pairs at all four corners, and inside, men were posted on the stairs and out side key officers' doors. In ad dition one man directed traffic into the ladies room on the second floor, which was being used temporarily by both men and women. Asked if he thought the suc cessful act of attacking the headquarters of the department had hurt the morals of the force, Chief Walsh said, “No, quite the contrary.” He added: “We had the borough com ??anders, both uniform and de tective, hert this morning. From their reports and their own re action to this incident, I would say it had strengthened the re solve of the police force to pre vent anything of this kind from happening again.” He said, in response to another question, that he would not call recent attacks on the police a “guerilla war.” “These are the acts of a small minority of people,” he said. “The overwhelming ma jority of the people in the city support the police.’ Commissioner Walsh is acting as head of the department in the absence of Commissioner Howard R. Leary, who is in West Germany attending a po lice conference. Mr. Leary is expected to leave Berlin this morning to fly home. The bomb went off at 6:57 P.M. Tuesday in a second‐floor men's room of the Beaux Arts‐style building, which fills the irregularly shaped block bounded by Grand, Centre and Broome Streets and Centre Mar ket Place. The blast ripped through a five‐course brick wall into an elevator shaft and corridor, blew down partitions in the ad joining offices of the deputy commissioner for administra tion, Kenneth Marion, and shat tered windows. Glass was broken in outer windows facing Centre Market Place, in interior windows lin ing the north‐south corridor tha bisects the floor, and in the door leading to the office of Commissioner Leary. Also damaged were lava tories above and below the second‐floor men's room where the blast went off. The offices of the department's public infor mation bureau were also torn. The department had no esti mate of what it would cost to rebuild the shattered offices, but Jack Katz, consultant on construction to the Commis sioner, said they would have to be repaired completely, because the new headquarters building, now under construction, will not be ready for occupancy for two and a half years or longer. Mr. Katz said preliminary checks showed that the basic structure of the building had not been hurt by the blast. However, engineers from the Department of Public Works have been called in to confirm that finding. Workmen yesterday were shoring up interior walls along the second‐floor corridor with 2‐by‐6 timbers. Doors that had been splintered were being re moved. Air‐conditioners were being reinstalled into the slots from which they had been loosened. And linemen were re pairing telephones. At the same time young civil ian aides who work in the head quarters building were wiping desks and chairs clear of plas ter dust and plucking bits of glass from moldings and lino eum floors. As men who work in the building met in the corridors yesterday, they congratulated one another on having left on Tuesday before the bomb ex ploded. Louis L. Stutman, chief clerk of the department, said: “We're accustomed to catas trophes, but when it hits home, it is dismaying. It makes you wonder what is safe these days.” Detective James Dempsey, one of four persons injured inside the building by the blast, said yesterday: “I was just walking out the door when everything came in on me. There was so much dust and smoke, you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. It's hard to say what did after that. I just kept think ing there might be another one. All I can say is thank God, when you think what might have been.” Controller Abraham D. Beame yesterday called the bombing “a crime against humanity” and warned that if it went unpunished, it could create a crisis of confidence in the ability of the police to protect citizens, homes and businesses here. The Controller said he would ask the Board of Estimate to morrow to authorize a reward of $25,000 for information lead ing to the arrest and convic ion of anyone connected with the bombing. Earlier, at the Police Head quarters news conference, the Mayor said he had told Com missioner Walsh that “every re source of the city would be made available” in the investigation, including reward money if the police decided that It should be offered. Edward Kiernan, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent As sociation, called for “a cam paign to root out the causes of violence and to bring it to an, end.” The time has come, Mr. Kiernan said, “when the com munity must mobilize in its own defense or it, will be destroyed.” The Traffic Squad Patrol men's Benevolent Association announced through its coun sel, Harold Foner, that it was offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the ar rest of the headquarters bomber.

667-> POSTS ARE DRAWN IN PACING SERIES
YONKERS, April 7—Twenty five colts and two fillies—that was the story today as post positions for Friday night's three‐race second round of the $65,000 Ed Sullivan Series were drawn at Yonkers Raceway to day. The fillies that will take part in the forthcoming sequence are Keystone Sophie, a 3‐year‐ old by Tar Heel, and Hickory Dolores, a bay daughter by Queens Adios. Dolores was installed as a 0‐to‐ outsider in the Good Time Boy Pace after post posi tion No. had been picked for her. Sophie, however, was named the 3‐to‐ favorite in the Adora's Dream, after drawing the No. 4 berth. Coices selected for the other mile contests in the round were Keystone Aaron and Coun sel Hill. Aaron, who drew the No. 6 spot in the Betting Time, was picked at 6‐to‐5. Counsel Hill, although saddled with No. berth in the Good Time Boy, was made a 3‐to‐ choice. I think Keystone Aaron is the baby we'll eventually have to watch the closest,” said McKinney Lawhon, trainer of Keystone Sophie, after the post positions had been selected. “That colt sure has speed. He went 2:00 2–5 in Florida early this season and in his first two races this year won by a corn bined margin of a dozen lengths.” Did Lawhon think that Sophie, who earned only $25 last year and who failed to place in all three 1969 outings, could eventually beat Aaron? After all, that colt is unbeaten this year in three starts and eh won eased up by one and three‐quarter engths last week at Yonkers. “You're darned right I do,” was the answer. “Sophie is sharp right now. She's already won $9,275 this year and seems certain to win much more. Why in her last race, she started from the No. 7 spot, got parked outside all the way and still beat D. and F., a colt who had left from the pole.” As in the past, Sophie, whose mile record is 2:052‐5, will be driven by the Canadian‐born Norman Dauplaise. Aaron and Counsel Hill are both from Bill Haughton's stable.

669-> Bridge:
IDENTIFYING the strongest married partnership in New York bridge circles would be a hazardous ven ture—there are several candi dates for the title. But if the measuring stick is play in recent major tournaments, the award must go to Michael and Gail Moss, who in the last two months have had successes as far afield as Dallas and Mexico City. During the last weekend they were second in the Open Pair Championship at the Canadian Nationals in Toronto. To complete the rec ord of their energetic travel ing, they competed in the Spring Nationals in Portland, Ore., where the diagramed deal was played in the Inter national Fund Game. Michael Moss sat South and opened quietly with one dia mond. His wife raised to two diamonds, and East, who had passed originally, made a take‐out double. South's re double showed general strength, as it always does when the opponents have made a take‐out double. The S.O.S. redouble, begging part ner to think of some other denomination, applies after a penalty double. West bid three clubs and Mrs. Moss took the oppor tunity to show that her dia mond support was substan tial. This was all her husband needed to know, and he made a slightly aggressive leap to slam in diamonds. Clubs were led and con tinued, and the declarer ruffed with the diamond ace with the idea of preserving entries to the dummy. A small trump was led to the king in dummy, and East dis carded a spade. Dummy's last club was ruffed with the diamond queen. Three more rounds of trumps were played, leaving dummy on lead in this position: The last trump was led from dummy and East had to discard a heart to keep his spade king guarded. South discarded the spade ten, and finessed the heart jack. The heart four became his 12th trick. If East had discarded a spade instead of a heart, South would have discarded a heart, finessed the heart jack, and made his contract by dropping the spade king with his ace. South was confident that the squeeze would succeed: East had to have the spade king, the heart queen and length in hearts to justify his double of two diamonds. Moss had foreseen that the heart finesse would succeed when he bid the slam, show ing that the opponents' bid ding can sometimes guide a perceptive player to the win ning contract.

671-> Pilar Suffers Fracture From Spill in Derby
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 2 —Hector Pilar, the rider of Holy Land in today's Ken tucky Derby, was in Sts. Mary and Elizabeth Hospital tonight with a compress frac ture of the first lumbar ver tebra and a possible fracture of the fifth vertebra. Pilar was thrown to the ground when his mount stumbled about a quarter of a mile from the finish of the 1¼‐mile event. Holy Land, 13th in the field of 17 at the time, did not fall, and Pilar was not struck by any of the four horses behind him. Dr. George Dwyer, the track physician, said the jockey was expected to be hospitalized three of four weeks and would be in a brace for possibly six months. There was no internal bleed ing or nerve injury, the doc tor said.

672-> 2 Whites and 1,391 Blacks In a Mississippi School
WOODVILLE, Miss., Jan. 5 —Annette Brown stood in the rain with her little brother, Tommy, biting her lips and waiting for a bus to take them home from their first day as the only white stu dents in a sprawling, one‐ story public school that has 1,391 black students. When the second semester began this morning here in this rural town in southwest ern Mississippi, all the other white children in Wilkinson County stayed home, waiting to begin their studies next week in a private school chartered after the Federal courts had ordered this district and 29 other districts to integrate their educational system immediately and com pletely. Only three of the 30 districts that are under or ders to desegregate immedi ately reopened classes today. Some white students attend ed the integrated schools and some stayed away. No vio lence was reported, but a few whites picketed in protest. “I can't figure it out,” mused Dewitt Ginn, a Negro who serves as principal of the schools where Annette and Tommy enrolled. “Their daddy is like most white folks around here. Why should he send his kids to school with black kids!” Annette had the answer. “Daddy wanted us to go to a private school,” she said, “but we didn't have the money.” So she took her seat this morning in Mrs. Virginia Wil kinson's 36‐member sixth grade class, and her brother stored his books in a desk just down the hall with the 34 other fourth graders taught by Mrs. Elizabeth Parker. “I was afraid, yes, that's right,” Annette said after the classes ended today. She is 11 years old. Tommy is 9. They are the children of Mr. and Mrs. Burnell Brown. Asked what she had feared, she said that she didn't remem ber. Unlike his sister, Tommy said that he had not been afraid and “liked it pretty much.” In the Wilkinson County Courthouse, about a mile from the school, the Superintendent of Education, Bernard Waites, studied reports from the prin cipals at the four schools in the county system and paused momentarily to discuss the fu ture of public education here. “I don't know what will hap pen but I do know that an all Negro system will be a tre mendous burden on us,” he said. “The loss of all these stu dents will make our educational system more expensive because we will be operating with the same number of schools and essentially the same investment but we will have a substantial loss of revenue.” Mississippi's public schools receive state funds on the basis of their average daily attend ance. Last month, before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordered the desegregation of schools in Wilkinson County, the average daily attendance was about 3,500. Today, 2,750 Negro stu dents showed up for classes. The Wilkinson County Train ing School has been the Negro high school. On the other side of this small town of 2,000 residents, all of the white chil dren had attended one school. The same plan was in effect in nearby Centreville in the county's other two schools. The Federal court's order re quired that the white schools serve as integrated high schools and that the Negro schools serve as integrated schools for the lower grades. Mr. Waites refused to specu late on whether Annette and Tommy might be joined tomor row by other white children. If that does occur, his daughter will not be among them. She has been enrolled, he said, in the third grade of the Wilkinson County Christian Academy “because she could not obtain a quality education” in the schools that Mr. Waites administers. “Her whole environment would be changed,” Mr. Waites said, adding that he preferred the freedom‐of‐choice desegre gation plan, under which his schools operated before. Then he said that he really preferred segregated education. “She would be under an in tolerable amount of emotional strain and stress,” he said. Mr. Waites, a native of Louisi ana, said he probably would serve the remaining two years in his elective office, which pays $12,000 a year. The rain had begun before dawn today and when the bells clanged in the corridors of the Wilkinson County Training School, the Negro stu dents and Annette and Tommy emerged boisterously into a schoolyard of mud and puddles. A bit confused by the new surroundings, Annette and Tommy failed to board the bus that would take them to their rural home several miles from Woodville, where their father, like many other men in this area, earns his living as a logger. The Browns do not have a telephone and, for a moment, Annette was shaken at the thought of being left behind. She stood alone, clutching her coat and hood tightly around her, and waited until she was told by two young Negro girls that the bus would return. She walked slowly back toward the school and stood with her brother and a large group of Negro students. The rain, driven by a cold, brisk wind, blew through the shelter on them all. “I don't know if we'll come back in the morning or not,” she said. “Daddy will have to decide that tonight, I guess.”

674-> Napanoch Inmates Protest Medical Treatment
NAPANOCH, N. Y., Aug. 24 —Several hundred inmates at the Eastern New York Correc tional Facility here refused for nine hours today to return to their cells in a protest ‐against what they called inadequate medical treatment. The action came the day after Louis Hankins, a 21‐year‐old prisoner, died of an apparent heart attack after playing bas ketball. All of the 900 inmates here are New York City prisoners shifted to this Catskill Mountain institution to ease overcrowding on Bikers Island. Maurice Blow, the warden, sent word today from his office that he was too busy to discuss the situation. However, the Rev William O'Brien, the Ro man Catholic chaplain who has been feuding with the prison administration here, gave ant account of the protest. He said that at 2 P.M yester day he was called to give the last sacraments of the church to Mr. Hankins, a Negro. A short while later, as the priest was preparing to leave for Brooklyn to notify the dead man's mother, he wag called and told that 500 men had gathered in his chapel. “I went over there thinking they wanted a memorial serv ice,” Father O'Brien said. “Two of the men there said they had, carried Hankins to the hospital and that he was breathing and, had a pulse. They said the doc for refused to give: artificial respiration until he could get the prisoner's record, and by that time he had expired. “I met with a delegation of the men, who said they wanted to see the warden and that their only demand was for a new doctor and for improved medical treatment. I conveyed this to the warden, and he told me he would meet with the men.” Reached at his home in Del mar, State Commissioner of Correction Paul D McGinnis said the trouble started when “one of our boys died while playing basketball in the rec reation yard.” He disputed the prisoners allegations of improper treat ment. “The man was dead when, they picked him up,” he said. The commissioner said that all of the men were out in the yard this morning, staying away from regular workshop or classroOm assignments. He added that about 300 left for their cells during the after noon and, at 6 P.M., 170 offi cers told the remaining 600 prisoners to “go in or we'll put you in.” Within a half hour, the men had returned to their cells. There was no violence or injuries, Mr. McGinnis said. The Commissioner added that prison officials would begin meeting tomorrow with delega tions of prisoners to discuss their grievances. Father O'Brien, who is 34 years old and has worked at the prison for two years, left the yard early in the day be cause, he explained, he had been ordered by the warden to limit his activity to Catholic prisoners. Earlier this month, after the priest characterized the state prison system as inhumane and racist, he received a note from the warden ordering him to tend solely to his religious du ties. In a telegram to Governor Rockefeller, Father O'Brien called the action “a reprisal to effectively curtail my activity.” He later received a letter from Commissioner McGinnis, who said he had approved the restraints and added, “In my opinion you have clearly dem onstrated by your actions that you are a threat to the safety and security of the institution.”

675-> CLASH WITH ISRAELIS REPORTED BY BEIRUT
BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 10 (UPI)—A Beirut spokesman said today that Lebanese troops had attacked one of the regular patrols Israel has been sending into Lebanon's frontier zone since an Arab guerrilla bazooka attack May 22 on an Israeli school bus that killed and wounded 32 children and adults.

676-> Advertising: Agencies Enlarging Services
Last week ended up with Benton & Bowles setting up a new division geared to providing a whole bagful of merchandising and sales promotion services to clients and non‐clients. It is called Promotion Management Services and will be staffed by existing agency experts. The announcement ended a week in which it was dis closed that two other agen cies had made similar moves designed to get more finan cial returns from existing talent. Young & Rubicam, which a couple of weeks ago had set up a design unit, an nounced internally that it was setting up a medical advertising division. And Ogilvy & Mather, it turns out, will be offering its media department's services separate from the rest of the agency. Asked to comment on the goings‐on, the president of an uninvolved agency ob served: “Agencies are des perately seeking a higher rate of return for the man power expended. With the advertisers pulling back, the squeeze is on and this is going to be a tough year.” Another agency mogul with historical insights noted that this was really a bit of a return to those yesterdays when agencies did all sorts of things like package de sign, finished art and sales promotion work for just the 15 per cent advertising com mission. • Then independent special ists began setting up shop, doing a good job, and the agencies relinquished those roles. Now, said the mogul, agencies are seeing and coveting the nice fat fees that the outside companies are commanding. The staff of Benton & Bowles new unit comes from right inside the shop. Austin Johnson is director of mer chandising and sales promo tion; William Noble, manager of merchandising; Michael Ellman, director of develop ment, and Phillip Baecker will be in charge of the creation of materials and sales promotion programs. The creation of the new secion will not affect the deals with current clients. Besides being involved in what you might expect them to be—premiums, direct mail offerings, incentives, dis play and brochure creation— Promotion Management Serv ices is also experimenting with a couple of new sam pling programs. One that the B. & B boys are willing to talk about is tentively being identified as the “family health chest.” Bill Noble pointed out that there could well be legisla tion to prevent the mailing of unasked‐for samples, and the B. & B plan, which would be for proprietary drugs, would mail offers of the free chests to consumers and they in turn would request them by return post card. Victor G. Bloede, agency president, looked over the personnel of what he calls “a new source of revenue,” in his office the other morn ing and said pridefully, “There's no better qualified group in this country.” It was a touching moment. * Alberto‐Culver has come out with an aerosol hair con trol which it claims looks, feels, and smells like no con trol at all. It's called Com mand Dry & Natural Hair control for men. The new spray joins its brothers, Command Hair Groomer and Command Hair Spray and will be directed to male audiences via net work and spot TV with heavy emphasis on sports pro grams. (Look out men, they know where to find you). The agency leading the assault is J. Walter Thomp son, Chicago. * Ever think of an Alka Seltzer as a springboard to fame and fortune? It might become one for Alice Piayten. Alice Playten? Yes, she's the little round‐faced kooky type that plays the new bride in the recent Alka‐Seltz er commercial from Doyle Dane Bernbach—the one who is planning on giving her hus band marshmallowed meat balls and poached oysters. The producers of the off Broadway show “The Last Sweet Days of Isaac,” look ing like mad for a replace ment for the leading lady, Fredricka Weber, spotted Alice on TV. She is taking over the role tomorrow. A star is born—maybe. * A group of Canadian daily newspapers have joined to gether for the common good —more advertising. All the papers are members of the Bureau of Advertising of the American Newspaper Pub lishers Association and the still unnamed marketing sales organization they have created will work with ma terials supplied by the bu reau. Beland H. Honderick, presi dent and publisher of The Toronto Star, has been named chairman, and Robin L. Hall, who was vice presi dent‐marketing of Bristol Myers Canada, Ltd., is presi dent. The Canadian papers will have their Bureau dues in creased and the bureau will then produce national and retail sales presentations for the Canadian scene. There are 51 Canadian newspapers on the Bureau's list of over 1,000 members. * To the unbelievably long list of companies available to serve the wants of ad agencies, please add Past masters, which will provide history almost while you wait. If you should want to know how beer was made in Elizabethan. England, what George Washington's favorite foods were, or if there was a pollution problem in Caesar's Rome, contact the new company at 663 Fifth Avenne. It is a clearing‐house for freelance historians, and Alan Schaffer of history fac ulty of Lehman College is its president. And they'll work for any business as well as for political candi dates, not just agencies. * The media are always making nice with Madison Avenue. Why not? That's where the money comes from. But deifying an agency man or even crediting him with superhuman powers, isn't that going a bit too far? And guess who's doing it? None other than staid Business Week, the flagship of McGraw‐Hill Publications, with the help of Warren, Muller; Dolobowsky. In a trade‐oriented cam paign that begins June 1 in Advertising Age, some well known figures in the busi ness will assume Biblical proportions. For example, there's this one ad that shows George Lois of Lois, Holland, Calla way, wearing a sports jack and nimbus while walking on water. The headline reads, “What makes George Lois so humble?” Another ad with the head line “Just who does Jack Roberts think he is?” shows the creative director of Car son Roberts, crook in hand, parting the waters. As it turns out in the copy, what raises these boys to the heights is their deci sion to put clients in Busi ness Week. It should be so easy.

679-> 17 Films Bow as Festival Opens Here
The Eighth New York Film Festival opened yesterday at Lincoln Center in a 13‐hour whirl of sometimes overlap ping events in which 17 films were shown. Last night, a capacity audi ence of 2,700 spectators was present for the official open ing program in Philharmonic Hall, a showing of Francois Truffaut's “The Wild Child” (L'Enfant Sauvage). It was preceded by a $100‐ a‐plate dinner of chicken cordon bleu servd to 355 guests in Philharmonic Cafe at 7 P.M. In the afternoon, one visit ing director, Claude Chabrol, was thrown alive to the critics immediately after a showing of a film of his, but they proved to be as fangless as kittens in their response. The festival, which cost $250,000 to produce, played to 88 per cent of capacity last year. It has an advance sale of close to $75,000, with about half of the available seats gone. Also sold out is the clos ing program, Luis Bunuel's “Tristana,” to be shown on Sept. 20. A triple series of special events will run 10 days beyond that. Mayor Lindsay greeted the first righters at both dinner and film premiere, proclaim ing New York the “film capi tal and center of the world.” Mr. Truffaut went onstage just before his film was shown and spoke a few words in French. A fairly acute attack of what she called “opening dayitis” afflicted Sallie Wilen sky, administrative director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, producers of the fes tival. The enormous size of the whole festival had almost overwhelmed her comprehen sion of its parts, Miss Wilen sky remarked. In total, there are 65 pro grams at three sites, includ ing Tully Hall, with about 100 films to be screened. In modes of dress, the opening night audience drew its inspirations from many winds of fashion. Some spec tators were dressed as if to defy the rainbow. Others came in a sort of casual semi‐formal attire. It was an extremely difficult event for a security guard to patrol with any feeling of surety. The man in the sweatshirt and the sandals was as likely to be an honored guest as an intruder. Nine directors whose films are to be shown were among the throngs. They were, in addition to Mr. Truffaut, Claude Chabrol (“Le Bou cher”); Marin Karmitz (“Com rades”); Marcel Hanoun (“Une Simple Histoire”); Lasse Forsberg (“Mistreatment”); Bob Rafelson (“Five Easy Pieces”); Dick Fontaine (“Double Pisces”); Martin Scorsese (Street Scenes 1970); and Hollis Frampton (“Zorns Lemma”). Again this year the Al gonquin has been chosen as the official residence for fes tival guests, partly because it is not persnickety about what film makers wear in its dining room. “Of the nine directors who are already in town, three of them do not even own a suit,” a festival aide remarked. Each director is assigned a hospitality aide while here. “If they want to be taken to F. A. 0. Schwarz, they get taken to F. A. 0. Schwarz, or to Harlem or anywhere else they want,” said Richard Roud, director of the festival. An advance screening of Mr. Chabrol's “Le Boucher” was held for critics in mid afternoon. When it was over, Mr. Roud accompanied Mr. Chabrol onto the stage of Philharmonic Hall, where the French director listened to questions in English, and answered them in French, with Mr. Roud interpreting his replies. He was asked about his use of color, about charac terization, about what sign lie was born under, about why he always cast his wife in all his films. “I find that she is a very god actress, and charming,” Mr. Chabrol said. Could the influence of Hitchcock be seen in his work? “When you are dealing with blood and murder, you may indeed be influenced by a man who has spent 40 years in these things,” he said, but he found himself “much less in fluenced by Hitchcock than I used to be” and far more in tune now with Fritz Lang. The selection of the open ing night film is as much a function of social diplomacy as of art. “Generally it chooses itself,” Mr. Roud said. “It has to be something that can stand a party after it; you must not send every body out in gloom and de pression,” he said, in an oblique reference to the mid night party held at the French consulate following the Truffaut screening. “The Wild Child” was chosen as suitable to the ex tremely unhomogenous audi ence of the premiere, in which tastes as various as those of Budd Schulberg, Andy War hol and Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Anspach (all present last night) must be considered. The first night attracts peo ple “who are interested in film, but more casually inter ested” than the more serious students, seekers and true be lievers who make up regu lar festival audiences, Miss Wilensky said.

680-> 2 Young Doctors: Pay Is Better, but . . .
The patients at Mount Sinai Hospital have learned to distinguish between the two doctors named Waldman. They call the bubbly hazel‐eyed red‐haired woman in the minidress, who's been making rounds during the last year as a senior medical student, Mrs. Dr. Waldman. The dark‐haired, mustached, quiet one is Dr. Waldman. As of July 1, Dr. Richard Waldman, 28, will be chief resident at the hospital. His wife, Nancy, 25, will be a pediatric interne. Their combined salaries will be $21,300, a far cry from the “Men in White” tradition of starvation wages. “This is the first year since we've been married that we'll be making more money than we spend,” the wifely Dr. Waldman said with an air of disbelief the other day. She was darting about their two‐ bedroom, $254‐a‐month apartment in a Park Avenue building owned by the hospital for its internes and residents. To an exquisite cacophony of childish voices and dog barks, she was doing mother and housewife chores and en joying the pause between medical school and hospital internship. Last May 27, she was one of four women in a class of 23 who received their degrees at the first commence ment of the Mount Sinai School of Medi cine. Dr. Nancy Waldman took the Upjohn Achievement Award for outstand ing student leadership and service to the school. Her medical tuition at $2,200 a year, as well as her husband's, has been financed by scholarships and loans. “We went $15,000 in debt to get through,” she said. Much of the finan cial aid came from her mother, a widowed public school teacher who “moonlighted” with evening and sum mer school teaching assignments to help with her daughter's education and to give the Waldmans a two‐week vacation this month in Spain and Portugal. “We never had a honeymoon,” said the new Dr. Waldman, who met her husband six years ago when she was a senior at Barnard and he a first‐year medical student. They were married half a year later and proceeded to pursue their studies and to raise a family, which now consists of Joelle, 4, Tod, 18 months, and Shakespeare, a vociferous female collie shepherd. Dr. Nancy Waldman took a year off between college and medical school to have Joelle. During her third year in medical school, she took a two‐week leave of absence for Tod's birth. She estimates that all of her interne's salary, except for taxes, will now be spent on child care. Joelle's kinder garten tuition next fall will be $1,600 a year. The Waldrnans also have a housekeeper, Mrs. Anna Diaz, who works from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. when they are at the hospital. Every third night and every third weekend, the Wald mans are on duty at the hospital, but usually not at the same time. “If you call an agency, they won't send you anyone for less than $90 a week and some want $125,” Dr. Wald man said. “When I told one agency that my husband wasn't making that much, the woman said, ‘But you wouldn't want to leave your children with some inferior person,’ and I hung up and cried.” It is not by accident, then, that the special role Dr. Waldman believes she and other women doctors can play is in pressing for the establishment of child care centers. “Women's liberation is not about bras or kicking men out,” she said. “It's about women feeling they can do what they want. But for a woman to be able to do things, she must have freedom from worrying about having someone capable taking care of her children.” Dr. Waldman believes that a hospital like Mount Sinai would be a logical place for a child‐care center for staff members. So would universities, large corporations, housing complexes and community centers. “To be able to stop in at lunch and see my children or to have a place for them if I'm working at night would be ideal,” she said. The child‐care center would have an isolation unit for sick children. “I've never had a pediatrician come to our house. We always have to take the children to his office,” she said. And as for infecting other children, “Most of the time the child has given the cold to the others before he comes down with it.” Child‐care centers could offer chil dren of all ages and all socio‐economic levels a good diet, she went on. “It's a wrong assumption that just because you're middle class or smart, you're always doing the right thing. I've seen so many cases of iron deficiency in middle‐class children whose mothers say, ‘My child won't eat and I won't force him,’ and so he subsists on po tato chips. A child‐care center could answer this,” she said. Dr. Waldman is familiar with the arguments against communal care for children, as in the Soviet Union or in the Israeli kibbutzim. “There's the argument that they take away true genius. But they do produce fewer neurotics,” she said. “Since the majority of children are not geniuses, I'd rather go for a child who's less neurotic and less genius. There will al ways be some mother who wants to stay home with her kids, though, and that's fine, too.” “Medicine,” Dr. Waldman said, “is a fantastically ideal career for women,” but added that medical education is not geared in the least to women's needs. The day‐care centers, don't exist yet. There is no part‐time course of medical study, and the long road consists of four years of school and four years of internship and residency. “But after that,” she said, “you can work part time until your kids are bigger. You can always find a field to suit you and your personality. You take care of other people, and you're getting gratification all the time.” Dr. Waldman plans to make radiol ogy her specialty, and somewhere along the way have two more children. Her husband will combine pediatrics and teaching after he finishes his residency and two years of military service. “I hope he gets sent to some city where I can continue my specialty. I'd hate not to be useful for two years,” she said. “I'm choosing radiology because I can easily get a job from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. and make $100 a day. I'll be able to walk the kids to and from school. I know the feeling of, ‘Oh, mommy, I wish you were there when I get home from school’ and I want to be there.”

683-> Observer: The Fool Problem
WASHINGTON, April 1—It is not easy for a young man to become a fool these days. In fact, it has become so difficult that it's a wonder there are so many of them still in business. Everything conspires against it. To begin with, there Is televi sion. From the time a child learns to toddle he is exposed to the horrible example of peo ple making foals of themselves on television, so that by the time the average person is three years old he swears that when he grows up you'll never catch him making a fool of himself trying to sell his new book or plug his latest film between acts by performing beasts on television shows. At school all manner of anti fool warnings are drilled into the modern child. This may be a partial explanation of why children seem to be such a malcontented class these days. It is hard and unpleasant work resisting the natural tempta tion to be a fool, and why children should have to should er it is not very clear. Mathe matics and English grammar would seem to be enough misery for any human until he reaches draft age, without loading him down with the toil of not being a fool, but there is the fact nevertheless. Children are constantly ad vised that only fools drop out of school or refuse to fight for admission to Yale or make truculent declarations that base five can go jump in the lake. This advice, lamentably, is sound, but the contemporary practice of loading it onto chil dren when their interests have not gone beyond dodge ball— well, that leaves something to be desired in the American way of life. A child ought to have the right to play the fool as much as he wants until he outgrows dodge ball, and pos sibly longer. We deny him that right out of excessive concern for the future state of his income. Be fore he leaves high school he is so impervious to foolisliness that you wonder what he has left to live for, and when he leaves college he is so well prepared against the least pos sibility of playing the fool—or “blowing his cool,” in last year's juvenile jargon—that he is fit for little else than burying. Fortunately, enough of us recover from the education of our early years to move ahead to long periods of extreme foolishness, and this makes a contribution to the world that no one should dismiss casually. The spectacle of a man mak ing a fool of himself over a woman can be a dreadful thing for humanity at large, of course. For the woman in the case, however, it can be an ex quisitely satisfying experience. She is most likely to give thanks that there are men in the world still able to outgrow their youthful “cool” and plunge with gusto into playing the fool. Then there are the noble fools, who persist in the folly that this is not the best of all possible worlds but that life can be better. Once in a while one proves himself correct and We call him a saint. Even those who fail nevertheless improve the tone of the world by dis turbing the, gray men who op erate the machinery that gov erns our lives. And the foolish fools. Shouldn't we also be thankful for them? For all those tongue tied authors and inarticulate actors who outgrow their child ish resolutions not to make fools of themselves by appear ing between TV dog acts to push their books and films? Without them there on the late night talk shows and the dinner time talk shows and the dawn talk shows, who would we have to feel superior to? It is harder to make a case for maintaining the present per centage of fools in Government and military affairs, and in any event it would only lead to a quibble about whether our col lective destiny is safer in the care of fools or knaves. About the sublime fools, however, there can be do doubt. They are the ones who elevate the natural human tendency to foolishness until it rises be yond reason's ability to touch it. The typical sublime fool is the counterfeiter of ancient coins who stamps his products with the date 500 B.C. to au thenticate their age. Another sublime fool buys them for $23 per coin, and the counterfeiter accepts payment in $23 bills. Why? He knows a perfect fool who will change $23 bills for him. With $11 and $12 bills. And why? Because this last fellow has heard there is a shortage of $23 bills and in tends to drive up their market value by hoarding them. Absurd? Maybe, but if enough sublime fools get caught up in the enthusiasm man's genius will have estab lished a monetary system.

684-> The Screen: Hutton's ‘Kelly's Heroes’ Begins Run
KELLY'S HEROES, directed by Brian G. Hutton; written by Troy Kennedy Martin; director of photography, Gabriel Figueroa; music by Leto Schifrin; pro duced by Gabriel Katzka and Sidney Beckerman; released by Metro‐Goldwyn Mayer. At Loew's Orpheum, 86th Street at Third Avenue, and Loew's State II, Broadway and 45th Street. Running time: 145 minutes. (The Motion Pic ture Association of America's Produc tion Code and Rating Administration classifies this film: “GP—all ages admitted, parental guidance suggested.”) Kelly Clint Eastwood Big Joe Telly Savalas Crapgame Don Rickles Oddball Donald Sutherland General Colt Carroll O'Connor Brian Hutton's “Kelly's Heroes” is a caper movie of fairly straight‐forward aspira tions, disguised as a World War II service comedy—of very complicated aspirations indeed. I suspect that the time for service comedies may have passed a while ago (the currency of “M*A*S*H” merely proves the point; a comic iconoclasm so general ly popular must be long since out of date), and the time for caper movies, as anybody who has seen 20 or 50 can testify, never came. • “Kelly's Heroes,” therefore, is not without its problems. But it is very largely with out viable solutions to them. Not without resources—it is full of resources, natural and mostly untapped—but with out that resourcefulness nec essary to persuade us that comedy, any comedy, is worth the time of day. Set during the Allied ad vance across France, “Kelly's Heroes” concerns a group of noncoms and private soldiers who learning that the Ger mans have stored gold bullion worth many millions in a town bank not far behind their own front lines (the logic of this escapes me), open up their own little pan zer attack in order to steal it. The film divides its atten tion more or less equally be tween the logistics of the heist (the sine qua non of caper movies) and the heroics of the mission. In leading the heroics, Kelly's heroes turn in per formances that range from mod relevance (Donald Sutherland) to self‐parody (Clint Eastwood), with samples of stand‐up comedy (Don Rickles) and exasper ated expediency (Telly Sa valas) in between. Of the principals I liked only Telly Savalas, who builds the first sergeant, a predictable role, into a characterization that would grace a much funnier or more serious movie. Donald Sutherland, on the other hand, has put together not so much a characteriza tion as a first aid package. A hippie tank driver who has established a commune at the front and who digs beau tiful people, etc., he is not only an anachronism by at least 25 years, but also an anachronism whose only purpose is to help this movie make the scene. Deprived of any real context, the ticks and attitudinizing of his per formance seem not so much a means of expression as of self defense. Clint Eastwood, who is not generally a funny man, plays with a quiet thin‐lipped determination of such with drawn ferocity—as if he was a kind of Gary Cooper whose essence had not just pre ceded but utterly superseded his existence — that you would expect his goal to be murder rather than money. The aim is money, but much murder is committed in its pursuit, and something goes not merely dull but ter ribly wrong with “Kelly's Heroes” along the way. De tailed and impressive in its bomb bursts, demolitions, and other special effects, it is greatly concerned with the pleasures of war. While the tanks advance and buildings crumble and bridges collapse and the dialogue remains at the level of a shouted “All right! Move out!” (as it most ly does), the movie partakes of good clean scary fun. • But when men are killed, and a lot of men are killed, many Germans, a few Amer icans, the balance alters to the horrors of war. To ac knowledge its deaths the film has no resources above the conventional antagonistic ironies and, comradely pieties of most war movies. And since its subject is not war, but burglary masquerading as war, the easy acceptance of the masquerade—which is ap parently quite beyond the film's control—becomes a de nial of moral perception that depresses the mind and bewilders the imagination. “Kelly's Heroes” seem big, expensive, loud and innocu ous. I don't think it is so innocuous.

686-> New Airport Power For Waterfront Unit Pushed in Congress
WASHINGTON, July 16 — Congressional approval to ex pand the anti‐crime jurisdic tion of the Waterfront Com mission of New York Harbor to the major airports in the metropolitan area was sought today by most members of Con gress from New York and New Jersey. In an effort to combat in creasing cargo thefts at the New York area airports, the state delegations introduced identical resolutions in the Senate and House to ratify a bi state compact that would give the Waterfront Commission reg ulatory powers at the airports and expand its name to the Waterfront and. Airport Com mission. Legislatures in both states approved the proposal earlier this year, but Congress must ratify all compacts between states. It was not immediately clear whether Congress will be able to adopt the resolution before it adjourns later this year, al though Senators and House members from the two states said they would seek early ac tion. The proposal is expected to encounter opposition in Con gress from the airline industry. “We have a lot of questions and problems about it,” said an official of the Air Transport Association, which represents the scheduled commercial air lines. “We hope that in due course we will have an oppor tunity to be heard.” One objection, the official said, is a proposed assessment of up to 2 per cent of the pay roll of air freight companies, which would be licensed by the commission. The commission would have power to license air freight employes, trucking firms that haul air freight to and from the airport and the owners or operators of air freight termi nals. The commission also would be able to install its own security force at the air ports, replacing private secu rity systems there.

690-> U.S. AIDE IS SLAIN IN AMMAN BATTLE
WASHINGTON, June 10—A United States military attaché was killed by Palestinian guer rillas at his home in Amman today and the United States Embassy came under sniper fire several times in the second day of heavy fighting between the Jordanian Army and the com mandos, the State Department announced today. The department identified the attaché as Maj. Robert P. Perry of Chicago, a 34‐year‐old specialist in Arabic affairs who was a graduate of Yale Univer sity and held a master's degree from the American University in Beirut. He was assistant Army attaché at the embassy in Amman. No other casualties were re ported among 535 other United States citizens listed as residing in Jordan. But a State Department press officer, John F. King, said the United States Government was “greatly concerned for the safety” of a group of Ameri cans, including newsmen, held as hostages since early this morning by guerrillas at Am man's Intercontinental Hotel, as well as that of the personnel of the embassy. Among the causes of concern for the State Department in the rising Jordanian crisis was the possibility of some form of violent Israeli reaction, partic ularly if King Hussein should be overthrown and replaced by a radical Palestinian regime. There also was speculation among officials that in the light of the Jordanian confrontation, the Nixon Administration might resolve to postpone the an nouncement, expected for next week, of its decision on selling new jet aircraft to Israel. Some officials raised the question whether a move next week on the Israeli jets might not ag gravate the Jordanian situation and further weaken the King's position. State Department officials indicated this evening that the United States chargé d'affairs in Amman, Harry I. Odell, had apparently decided against or dering the evacuation of the Americans in Jordan because the airport remained closed and the continuing fighting in the city, including tank and ar tilllery fire, made it too risky to assemble people for evacua tion. Major Perry was killed by automatic‐weapons fire at close range through the locked doors of his house when guerrillas attempted to enter his home, Mr. King reported. He said Major Perry's wife and chil dren had been present at the time. Subsequent cablegrams from embassy said that Major Perry's house was situated in the center of the heaviest fight ing in Amman this morning. As a foreign area specialist in the Army, Major Perry had seen considerable service in the Middle East. A 1958 graduate of Yale, he entered the Army in June of that year and later obtained master's degree in Arabic studies from the American Uni versity in Beirut. He was be lieved to be fluent in Arabic. He had been at his current post in Amman since March, 1967. Before that, he served as assistant Army attaché with the United States Embassy in Beirut from September, 1963, to July, 1966. He was born in Chicago on Feb. 1, 1936. A Defense De partment spokesman said late this afternoon that attempts were under way to contact his mother, who is believed to live in this country. Major Perry was the father of two sons and a daughter. The death of the attaché was the third incident involving members of the United States Embassy this week. On Sunday evening, Morris Draper, head of the embassy's political section, was seized by Palestinian guer rillas, and he was held over night before being released. Yesterday, the State Depart ment announced that Capt. Robert Potts, another assistant Army attaché, and his wife were slightly wounded by gun fire Sunday night at a guerrilla roadblock. Officials here said that bomb had exploded several months ago in front of Major Perry's house but had caused no damage. The United States' concern over the safety of the embassy staff was heightened as a re sult of the bitter anti‐American sentiment expressed by the commandos of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The Popular Front, a Marxist group, considers the United States an enemy because of its support for Israel in her con flict with the Arab states and the Palestinian nationalists, and it regards the Jordanian Gov ernment as a “reactionary” ally of the Americans. Al Fatah, another guerrilla organization that is also dedi cated to the reconquest of Is rael by the Palestinians, had been opposing acts of terror ism. Its leader, Yassir Arafat, has sought to maintain a tenu ous truce with King Hussein, emphasizing that al Fatah does not seek his overthrow but in sists on the right to continue using Jordanian territory as base for guerrilla incursions into Israel. Reports from Amman did not identify the guerrillas who killed Major Perry or the sni pers who, according to the State Department, fired several times during the day on the embassy's chancery building.

695-> The Theater: Risky Atlantic Crossings
LONDON, Sept. 10—This is the time of the year when Broadway and West End pro ducers are flying backward and forward like swallows— or even larger birds. The one thought in their nobly avian minds is whether this Broad way hit might prove too American for London audi ences, or that West End hit too English for the Ameri cans. The problem is more com plicated than might be thought. A simple watch on the reactions of average American tourists, a few shrewdly worded questions to New York visitors, and the answer would appear cut and dried. The reactions of tourists are notoriously unre liable; their whole trip is largely in search of local color. A Londoner could be enchanted by the exotic quaintness of a play set in the Bronx when he himself was in Manhattan, but once back in London the charm might not be noticeable. It Is observable that some shows — “Canterbury Tales” was one exainple—were ac tual favorites with American visitors, but still flapped stateside. And there is a dif ference in English and Amer ican taste. Agatha Christie's “The Mousetrap” is now in its stultifying 18th year in London. I fancy it didn't run 18 days in New York. Of course, at this time critics, stout‐hearted fellows to the last and not subject to the full rigors of cultural shock offered by trans‐Atlan tic sea‐change, might be thought of value to the pro ducer. But when John Barber, critic of The London Daily Telegraph, comes on his an nual investigation of Broad way, he is not writing for London producers, but for people genuinely interested in theater developments, and future British tourists, be they Mancunian businessmen or London housewives. In short, Mr. Barber is writing for his readers, and the New York critics write for their readers. But they would all be less than real istic not to apprehend that the particular readers hafiging most eagerly on their golden words were the Broad way producers. The critics, not only stout‐hearted to the last but, the kindest people you will meet in a day's march; do not wish to hin der unnecessarily a play's chances of New York ex posure. This problem of English ness is a difficult one, even for a ?critic or producer ex perienced in both theaters. It comes up in two new comedies, Alan Ayckbourn's “How the Other Half Loves” and Michael Frayn's “The Two of Us.” Both would be Broadway possibilities, but neither, I suspect, a certain ty, although I noticed Ameri cans in both audiences obvi ously enjoying themselves. “How the Other Half Loves” depends on two things, a very clever and new farcical device from the author, and a magisterially funny performance from Rob ert Morley. Mr. Ayckbourn's story is conventional enough, a young aspiring business man hav ing an affair with the wife of his boss. But Mr. Ayck bourn's trick must be the neatest of its type since Peter Shaffer pulled off “Black Comedy.” Mr. Ayckbourn sets his play in both households at once, and the pairs of spouses wander through the same setting unaware of one another's existence. Mr. Ayckbourn's most im pressive feat—the lovers have given the same excuse, sug gesting that a colleague's marriage is in difficulties— is for both families to have the colleague and his wife to dinner on subsequent nights in real time but con currently on the stage. The visitors are shuttled back and forth like tennis balls. As a farce mechanism this is very fine, but is this an American kind of play? The English have always been ob sessed with the actual tech nique of farce, the Americans have not. Compare “Room Service” with one of the typi cal so‐called “Aldwych” farces of that period and the point, I think, will be evi: dent. Yet New‐ York liked “Black Comedy,” and New York likes Robert Morley. So that is a play for produc ers to ponder upon. Mr. Frayn's “The Two of Us” is an example of the new English style of one‐act comedies, which London has apparently taken from New York. It is pure entertain ment, most of its very thin. One play — concerning the wife of a rising executive be ing vetted on the question of her husband's promotion—is over‐extended. Yet Mark Cul lingham's staging was brisk, Lynn Redgrave and Richard Briers are among the most gifted of modern farceurs, and best of all Mr. Frayn's writing often has a beauti fully acute perception. Would it go in New York? Possibly. I enjoyed the eve ning, but it needs to be re membered that New York generally prefers wisecrack comedy to situation comedy. Neil Simon's “Plaza Suite” ran for six months in Lon don, but is still happily run ning in New York. With all the heartbreaks who would be a producer except for the money.

696-> PALESTINIAN WARNS OF JORDAN CIVIL WAR
PARIS, June 10 (Reuters)— George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Libera tion of Palestine, said in an interview published here today that the guerrillas would start a civil war in Jordan if there was an attempt to suppress them. In an interview in Amman with the Paris newspaper France‐Soir, he described King Hussein's Government as “a re actionary regime that has tried to destroy us many times.” “We must defend ourselves to survive,” he added. Asked if there was a danger of civil war in Jordan, he said “There will be a civil war i?? they try to suppress us. We will provoke it.” BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 10 (UPI)—Yasir Arafat, head of A?? Fatah, said today Arab guer rillas would never consider an “armed movement” to topple the monarchy in Jordan. Interviewed by the Beirut daily Al Kifah, Mr. Arafat said “The commando movement not only never thinks of an armed movement to bring down King Hussein, but regards such an attempt as a trap which the [Palestinian] revolution wil avoid by every means.”

697-> Halaby Predicts Role For Airlines in Space
COCOA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 7 (AP)—Najeeb E. Halaby, president of Pan American World Airways, predicts that Pan AM and other carriers will be in the space trans portation business in the nineteen‐eighties. He said that the airlines, using a version of the Na tional Aeronautics and Space Administration's space shut tle, could carry passengers from the earth to an orbiting space station for a round trip price of $5,000 to $6,000, based on recent estimates. By 1978, the space agency plans to have an operational shuttle to ferry astronauts and scientists to orbiting lab oratories. On return it would land on an earth runway, ready to fly again. Mr. Halaby told a space transportation meeting this week that airline philosophy should be interjected early into the development of the shuttle “to insure that opti mum operational systems and maintainability are built into the design.”

698-> The New Plays
comedy by Art Buchwald, amused the 12 critics who reviewed it, although four qualified their approval. Clive Barnes: “An always endearing, often very funny play — a gentle but sub cutaneously corrosive sa tire on gunboat politics and the American way. The tone of the play resembles Woody Allen more than anyone else—it is a ‘Don't Drink the Water’ style of writing—and the individual lines are a lot funnier than the play itself. You may feel at the end of ‘Sheep on the Runway’ that it is not as funny as you thought during the play. It is an eve ning that disappointingly leaves no aftertaste to lin ger in the mind. But al though the drift of the writing is obvious, it does always have a genuine un dertow of a ridiculously oriented wit. The staging by Gene Saks was a delight and the cast was splendid. I wholeheartedly recommend ‘Sheep on the Runway,’ warts and all. It may not be perfect, but who is per fect?” For Walter Kerr, see Page 5. a musical by Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford, won praise from five critics. Three gave it mixed approval and one turned it down. Clive Barnes: “With a well‐groomed impudence and a cheerful antic wit, ‘The Last Sweet Days of Isaac’ arrived for what should be a long stay. It is one of the most pre posterous shows in New York and yet also one of the happiest. The book and lyrics by Gretchen Cryer and the music by Nancy Ford are easily among the best of the present Off Broadway crop, and the staging by Word Baker has great stylish ness. I enjoyed the show” For Kerr, see Page 1.

699-> Urban‐Renewal Project in Moscow Stirs Controversy
MOSCOW, Aug. 9—Kalinin Prospekt, Moscow's major effort at modern inner city redevel opment and beautification, is a grand concourse of contro versy. It lacks the esthetic approve of many Muscovites, who call it the city's “false tooth.” But it attracts hundreds of thou sands daily with the promise of something new and bright in this generally drab capital. Kalinin, which mingles slab bish skyscrapers with the quaint and the ugly architectures of the past, was cut through an old city quarter in the nine teen‐sixties to prove that Mos cow was equal to New York or Paris in modern concrete commerce and popular culture. The new thoroughfare, begin ning about a 20‐minute walk from the ancient Kremlin walls and stretching outward from the center of town for three quarters of a mile, was alsc planned as a national show place and, presumably, a pro totype of future urban rede velopment in older Soviet cities. It was also supposed to be a good place for people. Today the glassy‐gray 24 story and 26‐story apartment and office buildings that flank the broad thoroughfare and its sidewalks clash with surround ing buildings that survived the renewal. But the new sky scrapers, at the very least, are a distinct improvement over the dull‐yellow Stalin‐era struc tures, whose Gothic steeples punctuate the skyline. Bright, Imaginative Displays On the street level, the broad storefront windows with their usually bright, imaginative dis plays are unequaled elsewhere in Moscow. Still, the new Kalinin, named for the late Soviet President, has legions of detractors, who complain not only of its esthetics but also of the quality of its shops, cafes, movies and restaurants. Judged individually, it is said, they do not have that much more to offer than can be found in older quarters. Considered as a complex, on the other hand, Kalinin Pros pekt is physically brighter than anywhere else in Moscow and a more exciting place to spend a few hours — cer tainly more so than the im pressive solemnity of Red Square. For if Kalinin Prospekt is of dubious esthetic value and its wares are sometimes commonplace, it is alive. Nowhere else in town can so many miniskirted girls, Rus sian and foreign, be casually ogled from a sidewalk cafe. And the delights and frustra tions of dealing in a Soviet supermarket are probably best undergone in the largest self service market in the city. For the immediately hungry, the top of the street piovides what is probably the city's best large self‐service bakery, where warm baguettes or rich ry? bread can be bought for a few cents and eaten during a stroll The best and biggest men's barbershop is on Kalinin, em ploying women barbers who know when to cut and when to talk. The window of the largest bookstore in the city is full of Lenin's works and portraits inside excellent books of art reproductions are on sale for a few dollars. In the uncrowded supermar ket the other day, shoppers ignored row after row of pack aged noodles, dried fish and sugar. They looked with ap parent thirst at Rumanian red wine, but only a few bought it, for about a dollar a bottle. They looked with awe, if at all, at French cognac priced at $25 a bottle. In the barbershop, called the Enchantress, a small dispute developed in the line of men waiting for one of its 30 chairs. “Is there no control here?” asked a man who thought his place in line had been unjustly taken. “Usually there is self control,” said another “but not today.” After a 45‐minute wait and an hour in the chair, a cus tomer paid about $4 for a good razor haircut, shampoo, hot facial towel and shave. The woman barber initiated no un wanted conversation but was too quick to apply unwanted eau de cologne and hair spray. Farther up the street, women and girls gazed in windows dis playing pants suits — which are becoming increasingly fashionable here — and dresses, ranging in price from $10 to $90. There seemed to be few sales. But in a cosmetics shop scores of women rushed to pay, $1.60 for bright pink iridescent lipsticks, which are in short supply. There is other entertainment along Kalinin, none of it serious. Teen‐agers crowd around a few turntables in the Melodiya record shop to hear the latest Soviet release of the efforts of Nancy Sinatra or Engel bert Humperdink, which can be bought for 70 cents on thin plastic disks. Older people fin gered thicker, slightly more ex pensive records of Bach's Brandenburg concertos or Andrei Voznesensky's poems. Night life on Kalinin Prospekt is varied enough for most popular tastes. The Pechora Cafe is full of young people who listen nightly to adequate but hardly remarkable jazz, mostly Dixieland. Their elders reserve tables at the Arbat, one of the city's best and most expensive restaurant‐cabarets. The caba ret is sophisticated by Soviet standards in that it has few balalaika players and acrobats. The chorus line is a mixed pleasure for those accustomed to the nudity of Western night clubs and the plumpness com mon among Russian women. Even Russians who have never seen a striptease agreed that with the Bolshoi ballet out of town for the summer, the Arhat chorus girls provided the only opportunity to watch 10 slender Russian girls together. Downstairs at the Arhat is one of Moscow's few beer bars, usually crowded with people whose dress and manner would lead to their being classified as bourgeois in most Western countries. Upstairs, there is a bar that serves mild punch spiced with wine to young men and women who bring their own tape recorders to listen to Tom Jones, the Rolling Stones and other foreign entertainers.

700-> Grounded Tanker, Leaking Oil Cargo, Is Breaking Apart
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, Feb. 7 (Canadian Press) — The 11,379‐ ton Liberian tanker Arrow, agorund and leaking oil on shoal off Nova Scotia, is break ing up, a spokesman for Imper ial Oil, Ltd., said today. He said all men aboard tne stricken vessel had been re moved and efforts were being made to obtain the 3,800,000 gallons of bunker oil the tanker was carrying. He said the tanker was still in one piece, but “her back is broken” around midship. Yesterday, the Transport Min istry ordered that the tanker and her cargo be destroyed be cause of the danger of pollution of the coast. But early today Imperial Oil officials said they were continuing to pump oil from the tanker. In the meantime, they were gathering information on how to destroy the ship and its cargo by fire. The spokesman said way had to be found to ignite the oil, keep it burning and maintain safety. The Arrow ran aground Wednesday three‐quar ters of a mile off Arichat, 190 miles northeast of here. Divers who inspected the ves sel yesterday said only eight of her 27 tanks were still intact and oil was seeping through holes in the hull. The oil formed a slick about three miles long and 100 yards wide and was re ported to be drifting out to sea. But, some patches had drifted on to the coast and a two‐mile section of shore near Arichat was covered with a thick black mire.

701-> Airliner Crew Training to Balk Hijackers Urged
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) — Airliner cabin crews should receive training on how to work together to arrest hijackers, Secor D. Browne, chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, suggested today. He also urged setting up special force of lawyers to prosecute hijackers. Mr. Browne made the pro posals here at a conference of the Airline Passengers Associa tion, which is seeking ways to stop international hijacking. Delegates agreed that the only effective way to prevent hijacking was to stop the hi jacker from boarding the plane. Once he is on board, the dif ficulty is in stopping him from succeeding in his objective, they agreed. “While violence on the flight deck is certainly to be avoided, perhaps some concentrated training of the crews in security and containment of the in dividual should be undertaken,” Mr. Browne said. “'The flight deck of a modern transport aircraft is a confusing jungle to the stranger and a well‐briefed crew, acting in a coordinated fashion and making maximum Ilse of modern deter rents, should be in a position to divert disaster.” he added. Mr. Browne said that, be cause of the intricacies of aviation law and international relations local lawyers could not he experts on hijacking. He suggested that “a task force of specialists traveling from case to case” should be immediately set up to prose cute hijackers. Charles E. Ruby, president of the Air Line Pilots Associa tion criticized press coverage of hijackings. “If hijackings were given no publicity, fewer people might try it,” he said.

702-> Gonzales Does It Again; Beats Newcombe Easily
DETROIT, Jan. 31 (UPI)— Poncho Gonzales, so nearly perfect that he never had to display his famous temper, beat back time for the sec ond week in a row tonight by trouncing John New combe, 6‐4, 6‐4, 6‐2, for the $10,000 winner‐take‐all prize in the $200,000 Champions Classic series. The 41‐year‐old master served strongly and his com mand of the net was just as good in his rout of the Aus tralian, 15 years his junior. Last week it took him five sets to beat the world's top ranked player, Rod Laver, in the first match of the series. He has now won $20,000 with a possible $114,000 to follow should he win the next eight tennis matches.

704-> CRUGUET SCORES IN 2 RACES AGAIN
Jean Cruguet, the French jockey who has been finding it difficult to get into the win ner's circle this season, scored his second double in two days at Belmont Park yesterday on mounts with interesting back grounds. Victory No. 1 came aboard Mrs. Luoien Laurin's Beau Marker, the 1969 winner of the Massachusetts Handicap, in a claimer, no less. The jockey's second success was scored with Mrs. Robert Guerini's Import ed Jungle Fire II in the $15,000 Rockville Center Auxiliary, the Feature. The triumph by the Irish bred Jungle Fire II marked her first success in four American starts. She was purchased for only 3,300 guineas (about $8, 250) and the victory was worth $9,750. Since the 4‐year‐ old had earned $1,950 in her preceding Belmont outing, Mrs. Guerini already boasts a profit. The crowd of 21,931 sent the imported filly off as the $9.80‐ for‐$2 third choice, and for most of the mile ‐ and ‐ three‐ eighths race on grass, it ap peared that the daughter of Tiger was outclassed. Shuffled back immediately upon leaving the gate, she was in seventh place for much of the trip down the back stretch. It was as the nine‐ horse field was rounding the turn that Cruguet put his charge under urging. The filly responded immedi ately and began passing horses near the end of the bend. Cru guet kept Jungle Fire II on the outside for the final charge at C. V. Whitney's leading 20‐ to‐1 Dragon Queen. The jockey changed his whip from the right hand to his left and the Guerini color‐bearer did the rest. Her winning margin was 1½ lengths and her time was 2:15 3–5.

706-> ‘33d Floor’ Feud: Elliman's Version Given in a Letter
A number of persons have queried us for an explaria ton of a dispute between tenants in a building at 444 East 82d Street formerly managed by Douglas L. Elli man & Co., Inc. for Winston Holzer Corporation. The dis pute, which took place over a period of time in the late summer and fall of 1967 and the winter of 1968 involved two tenants who lived across the hall from each other in the high‐rise luxury apart ment building: Sanford Soco low, producer of the Walter Cronkite Show for CBS‐TV, who lived in Apartment 33A, and his neighbor, Herbert Kaye, who lived in Apart ment 33B. On June 7, The New York Times published in its Real Estate. Section an, article under the ‐headline “Feud on 33d Floor Drives a Family Into Suburban Life,” de tailing the tribulations of a tenant in a luxury building at 444 East 82d Street. The tenant, Sanford Socolow, said that he was forced to vacate his family from the apartmerit house because of difficulties with a neighbor. The article evoked wide response. There were many complaints from tenants who recounted similar experiences with troublesome neighboring tenants. There were many complaints from landlords who told of the problems they had encountered in evict ing tenants who disturbed their neighbors. But there was no response from Douglas L. Elliman & Co, who were the managing agents of the building in ques tion and who had declined to comment for the record on the Socolow case. However, readers who saw the article and who subsequently wrote to Elliman asking for an ex planation were sent a report dated July 1 giving the Eli man account of the dispute. That report, which was signed by Robert C. Erickson, executive vice president of Douglas Elliman, is printed below together with a corn ment by Mr. Socolow who saw the Elliman letter and replied to it in a letter to The Times: The dispute first came to Douglas Elliman's attention in September of 1967. It began with a noise complaint by Mr. Socolow against Mr. Kaye, the news producer al leging that his neighbor was depriving him of peace and quiet by giving a series of loud and noisy parties. In re sponse to these allegations, Mr. Kaye countered with a charge of his own that Mr. Socolow was, in fact, harass ing him. He explained that while his business required him to entertain frequently, there was no justification to his neighbor's complaint. Such‐noise complaints be tween tenants are among the most common problems faced by all managing agents and owners. It is our policy in such cases to initiate an im partial investigation to deter mine the truth of the charges and to ascertain if any action is warranted. In the course of his inves tigation, James McSherry, dis trict manager for Douglas Elliman, made frequent trips to the building during Sep tember and October and, while on several occasions he heard music and conversa tion coming from Kaye's apartment, on no occasion was the activity sufficiently noisy to justify any action against Mr. Kaye. A normal credit investigation was made at the time Mr. Kaye had applied for his lease in March of 1967 which indicated nothing unfavorable concern ing Mr. Kaye and revealed that he had an income of $30,000 per annum and some $70,000 in assets. The complaints against Mr. Kaye continued, however, with several other tenants in the building phoning in com plaints about their neighbor. Despite the fact that he spent several weekends in the ‘ building, one time staying in Socolow's apartment while the producer was away, Mr. McSherry could still not come up with any evidence that would warrant action against Kaye. Several times Socolow called McSherry late at night to complain about the noise across the hall, but when Mr. McSherry volunteered to get out of bed and come down and investigate, he was told that it was too late and that the people had already gone. During this period Mr. Kaye continued to complain that Mr. Socolow was harassing him for no good reason. Although Mr. McSherry was unable to obtain any sig nificant evidence of wrong doing by Mr. Kaye, he kept John Hamlin, president of Douglas Elliman, advised of the complaints he was re ceiving and Mr. Hamlin, in turn, kept in touch with the owners. Mr. McSherry also kept the owners of the build ing posted on the complaints at weekly management meet ings. The owners instructed Mr. McSherry that since he could not confirm the seri ousness of the complaints, he should proceed with extreme caution in handling the mat ter. The owners, in turn, were disinclined to take any action. In December Mr. McSherry contacted the nearby 19th Police Precinct to inform them of the continuing com plaints about Kaye's parties and during December and January, Mr. McSherry re ports that the police kept Kaye's apartment under ob servation. In subsequent con versations with Deputy In spector Fiske of the 19th Precinct, Mr. McSherry was informed that their surveil lance had turned up no evi dente upon which any actior could be predicated concern. nag Mr. Kaye. Mr. McSherry advised Mr. Socolow of his conversations with the police and of the owners’ position in the mat ter. On Jan. 22, 1968, Mr. Socolow informed Mr. Mc Sherry that he was moving his family out of the building because of his problems with Kaye and Management's in ability to find cause to re move Kaye. The feud between Kaye and the other tenants at 444 East 82d Street intensified after Mr. Socolow moved out of the building. On Jan. 26, 1968, five other tenants, not includ ing Socolow, sent a letter to Winston‐Holzer complaining about the intolerable condi tions that existed on the 32d and 33d floors because of Kaye's parties, and'enumerat ing a long list of specific al legations against Mr. Kaye. The owners responded to the letter by requesting that we discuss the matter with their [the owners'] attorney, Mr. Carr. Mr. McSherry arranged a meeting between Mr. Carr and the complaining tenants at which the [owners'] at torney advised them he would get in touch with them indi vidually concerning the prob lem. Unfortunately, Mr, Carr was called to Washington on legal business immediately after this meeting and did not follow through in this matter, a fact which undoubtedly dis pleased the tenants. In mid‐February, Douglas Elliman arranged to have a private investigator stationed in the Socolow apartment from 7 p.m. until 4 or 5 am. to observe the activities across the hall and obtain the proof that would be needed in an eviction proceeding. While Kaye had frequent weekend parties, on only one or two occasions did the in vestigator report that they were unusually large or noisy. There were, however, two incidents of violence which occurred during this period, after Mr. and Mrs. Socolow had moved out of their apart ment. During one, an un known person severely dam aged Mr. Socolow's apart ment door with an axe. The other occurred on Feb. 19 when two men set fire to the door of Socolow's apartment with a flammable liquid, caus ing a considerable fire in the hall. The investigator, who was in the apartment at the time, severely burned his hand when he opened the door. Mr. Kaye, who attacked a police officer investigating the fire, was arrested. After these incidents an armed guard was placed on the 33d floor to protect the other tenants on the floor, and the owner and Douglas Elliman attempted to initiate a complaint against Mr. Kaye in Magistrate's Court for his eviction. The other tenants of the building, however, appar ently cowed by Mr. Kaye, re fused to sign the complaint. Despite their refusal, the at torney for the owner and Mr. McSherry appeared in Magis trate's Court on Feb. 26 in an attempt to evict Kaye, but were advised by the clerk of the court that a complaint could not be sworn out be cause the plaintiffs had no first‐hand evidence of the in cidents alleged. On Saturday, March 23, Kaye was involved in another incident, this, time roaming the corridor with a rifle and grappling with the guard on the floor who attempted to disarm him. Mr. Kaye was ar rested again. This time the police investigation deter mined his true identity as Herbert Kebeck, a former convict with a police record. On March 26, 1968, the owners finally succeeded in evicting Kaye from the build ing. The publicity in the recent New York Times concerning the feud on the 33d floor ap parently has caused Mr. Ke beck to change his guilty plea to one of not guilty of the charge of fighting with a po liceman. Thus, Mr. Kebeck must now stand trial on the two serious charges for which he was originally indicted; namely first‐degree arson and second‐degree assault; as well as the criminal misdemeanor charge of fighting with a po liceman. While Douglas Elliman deeply regrets the anguish that the feud on the 33d floor caused the Socolow family as well, as the other tenants in the building, we hope it is realized that the legal safe guards provided in. New York City's housing laws protect all tenants equally. They, are principally designed to pro tect the’ tenants from harass ment or unwarranted evic tions by landlords; and while Douglas Elliman strongly sup ports such legal safeguards, the procedures which Must be folloWed make it difficult and time‐consuming for the owner of a building to evict a tenant like Herbert Kaye who was indeed disturbing the peace and quiet of his neighbors. Robert C.‐Erickson Executive Vice President The Socolow Reply I don't know Mr. Erickson. I am mystified that none of the several people at Douglas L. Elliman & Co. conversant with our problem were asked to write such a letter. It is obvious that Mr. Erickson is unaware of the true situa tion, or chose to ignore it for reasons of his own or cor porate policy. Judge Martin Stecher, who heard evidence from both parties, Wrote: “The facts are not in serious contention... The front door of the Soco low apartment was opposite that of a neighbor, K, and they shared at least one aim mon wall. K had parties which were frequent and noisy. His guests were nu merous, raucous and persis tently on hand. What went on at these parties is not clear, but the guests—who. paid a fee to attend K's par ties—lined up in the corridor several, times a week, waiting noisily and impatiently to en ter K'S apartment. Having done so, they spilled back into the corridor using it as part of the K residence where they drank, fought and ca roused.” “K in time acquired two companions in residence, a huge dog and an even larger man. Both seemed to serve the same function: to pre serve by their size and threat ening demeanor K's ‘peace’ and discipline in the 33d floor corridor and apartment On at least one occasion, K and his man assaulted the defendant in the corridor, and only timely slamming of defendant's [my] door saved him from serious inury: On other occasions the safety of the Socolow children was threatened by visitors to and occupants of K's apartment.” I would like to set the record straight on some spe cific points in Mr..Erickson's letter: I. If Mr. McSherry ever spent a weekend in our apartment, he did so without our specific approval or knowledge. Mr. Erickson's letter is the first report we have had on this matter. 2. A member of the police commissioner's office as sured me that there had been no complaint by the landlord or his agents nor any investigation of the oc currences in the building until after my family's re moval, and my complaint was registered. 3. After we hurriedly moved, I spoke to John F. Hamlin, president of Douglas Elliman, for the first time. He assured me he had never heard of the circumstances before; that if he had, he most certainly would have taken immediate action. He repeat ed this statement in a sepa rate conversation with my lawyer. Yet Mr. Erickson's letter makes the point that Mr. Hamlin had been kept abreast of the situation right a long. 4. Mr. Hamlin assured me in a telephone conversation that I could consider my lease breached, and that Douglas Elliman & Co. would do all they could to procure ‐a com parable apartment for me and my family. He never did. Subsequently, to my amaze ment, I was sued for rent for three months after we lett the apartment, and re placement of the door which had been axed and burned also after our removal. 5. Despite the fact that Mr. Erickson's letter says that the owners were disinclined to take any action, Mr. McSherry, to the last, as sured me the situation was on the edge of a solution. He said consistently that it was only a matter of four or five days and Kaye would be put out. Weekly, other tenants and myself were given such assurances. Mr. Carr, the owner's lawyer, also assured us he was moving on the case within four or five days. That was the last any of us ever heard from Mr. Carr. 6. On Feb. 26, six other tenants did appear, in.Crim inal Court, and at that point they did swear out individual complaints to support the landlord's case. This was, of course, too late to help nor situation, as we had alreatry moved’ from the premises. 7. The so‐called “normal credit investigation” which Mr. Erickson says “indicated nothing unfavorable,” indi cates to me‐:slipshod meth ods, to say the least. The New York Times, with only slight effort, uncovered Kaye's criminal record and the fact a previous land lord had paid Kaye a sum of money to get Kaye to move from an apartment just a few blocks from 444 East 82d Street. As for the charge that harassed Mr. Kaye: Mr. Mc Sherry mentioned it in an offhand way, much as a joke which wasn't funny. Judge Stecher said “Although the plaintiffs (landlord) had fre quent and timely notice of the use made by K of the apartment and adjoining cor ridor, no effort was made by the landlord to stop K or evict him from the premises.”

708-> Suit Over Draft in Utah Attacks Mormon Missionary Deferments
SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 7 — A system that allows the Mor mon church to nominate about 2,600 young men annually for two‐year draft deferments as missionaries is under attack in the Federal District Court here. The system is being attacked on the ground that members of a church get preferential treat ment from a Federal agency in violation of the Constitution. Chief Judge Willis W. Ritter has delayed action in half a, dozen draft violation cases, saying that he cannot hanale them until the matter of the Mormon church's official role, in making draft board classifi cations is resolved. Lawyers here said two con stitutional issues were in volved: Does the arrangement between the Mormons and the Selective Service System con stitute favored treatment to church, in violation of the First Amendment? Does it discrim inate against non‐Mormons by giving them an inferior posi tion in the draft, which would violate the Fifth Amendment? Moreover, it is asserted that the Mormon missionaries are treated differently from mem bers of other denominations be cause they get two‐year exemp tions as temporary religious leaders. Young men of other faiths will have made a life time commitment before they are similarly deferred. Evidence developed in pre trial depositions has disclosed an arrangement between the Utah Selective Service and the Mormon Church to administer the missionary deferment pa o gram jointly. This is offensive to persons who oppose church state combined actions. These persons also contend that the withdrawal of a large number of Mormons from the state's draft pool imposes an unfair burden on non‐Mormons in filling the state's draft quota. Judge Ritter has refused to accept guilty pleas from draft refusers on the ground that he would not want to pass sen tences while the legality of the draft as it operates in Utah is challenged in legal matters before him. A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints said the church would have no comment on the con troversy at this time. The church operates a mis sionary program that has about 12,600 Mormons in it. These young people enter the pro gram at the age of 19 and spend 24 to 30 months supporting themselves as missionaries, chiefly overseas, while they try to gain converts to the church, which has its headquarters here. The missionaries are drawn from Mormon families all around the world, but most are from Utah, where there are now 737,000 Mormons out of state population of 1,053,000. The Selective Service system in this state had 5,359 young Mormon missionaries in de ferred status last year. The total draft call from Utah was 1,558 in 1969. Similar arrangements are fol lowed in other states, sources here said, but the impact on the draft in other states is less because there are fewer Mor mons in proportion to the non‐Mormon population. The church and the Selective Service System here work hand in‐hand in deferring the mis sionaries. After the Vietnam War draft calls climbed in 1965, applications for missionary as ?? Mor mons rose sharply, and the top leadership of the church circulated a letter to all local Mor mon leaders. This letter announced that the church had imposed a quota of one draft‐eligible missionary each six months from each Mor mon ward. A ward is a con gregation of about 600 people. There are about 1,300 Mormon wards in Utah. If a certain ward did not have an eligible man to fill its quota, the vacancy could be transferred to another ward, the church letter said. Missionaries not eligible for the draft would not be counted against quotas. The next day, Col. Evan P. Clay, then the state director of Selective Service sent to all draft boards in Utah a circular letter to which was attached a copy of the church letter. Colonel Clay told the draft boards how to follow the church plan in deferring mis sionaries. Col. Richard V. Peay is now the director of Selective Service For Utah. A spokesman for him said that the system is still in effect and that he knew of no case where a deferment bad been refused a missionary backed by the church. This system was attacked in a suit filed in January, 1968, by James Austin Imus, then a Uni versity of Utah student. It still is pending only because Mr. ??s, a non‐Mormon, filed it as a class action, meaning that it represents other persons in similar circumstances but not named as plaintiffs. Mr. Imus withdrew 18 months ago as plaintiff when he received 4‐F classification. Federal attorneys represent ing the Selective Service Sys tem moved to dismiss the suit after Mr. Imus was reclassified. But Judge Ritter refused on the ground that the suit was an action in behalf of all Utah non‐Mormon men of draft age who might be drafted sooner in order to fill quotas because Mormon men were given defer ments. Soon a Salt Lake City non Mormon, William V. Olson, filed a legal plea that he be allowed to take Mr. Imus's place in the suit. Mr. Olson's draft board then gave him conscientious ob jector status and the Govern ment against asked that the suit be dismissed, but Judge Ritter has refused thus far. Richard J. Leedy, the attorney who represented Mr. Imus, said this week that he expected an other client to seek permission to become the plaintiff. The deferments given to the missionaries are the same 4‐D classifications given to minis ters and ministerial students of other religions. While officials would not com ment, other Mormon sources said that the returned mission aries became eligible for the draft, were classified 1‐A, and generally saw service, either as volunteers, National Guard members or draftees. A lawyer familiar with the case said that he expected an attempt would be made to equate the Mormon mission aries with Cassius Clay, the Negro boxer. Mr. Clay was re fused a 4‐D classification on the ground that he had no church and no congregation as a Black Muslim minister, which he claimed he was and under which claim he sought exemp tion. The 19‐year‐old Mormon mis sionaries also lack these trap pings of religious leadership, the observer here said.

711-> Architecture
T is hard to believe that the first major retrospec tive of the work of Bruce Goff is only now being shown in this country, packed into the tight quarters of the Architectural League. (Monday through Friday. 10 to 5, until Feb. 11, ad mission free, at 41 East 65th Street.) On the other hand, it isn't hard to believe, because the Eastern Architectural Estab lishment doesn't really be lieve in Bruce Goff. He is apt to be dismissed as a figment of Midwestern imagination, inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, a designer of outre fantasies which elicit a polite frisson along the elite East Coast axis that has produced a generation of cool corpo rate splendor spawned by the “correct” International Style. Although no one has been paying much attention in these circles, Bruce Goff is alive and well and 65 and practicing in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Since he was fast starter, at 12, this is his sixth decade of active pro duction. The impact of his work in this concentrated form‐160 exhibition boards containing photographs, drawings and prints, plus transparencies, of about 50 built or projected works—is mildly mind‐blowing. This is one of the most provocative manifestations of the Ameri can architectural genius. Go to the League, gentle men and ladies (architects are still in that order pro fessionally), even if those gold and silver presentation boards and houses like star fish, viking ships and tepees give you fits. If you can shed that eugenically frightening New England ‐ Calvinist Harvard ‐ Bauhaus ‐ intellec tual frigidity, if you can sup press a reaction to some obviously home‐grown corn, there is an artist here. There is a consistent statement of art and purpose, a sensitivity to the land, a last‐stand half triumph of the romantic in dividualist in a world that is forcing the architect to con form increasingly to stand ardized formulas and busi ness practices. This is fantasy, and it is often seriously flawed. Tight budgets, cheap materials and an ingenuous and sometimes buckeye taste make it easy work to disregard. But there is also, on occasion, poetry, and glimpses of horizons be yond brashly broken rules, rather than conventionally trained competence, as well as the inner belief of a man who follows his personal vi sion. For 58 years Goff has done his own thing. This ar chitecture — so out of the mainstream — proclaims a faith in the individual in every philosophical sense. The clients, touchingly and sometimes incongruously photographed in their bubbles and share the vision. Visions are not part of the status quo or the silent ma jority or the suburban sub division. Goff in suburbia, seen glimpsingly in slides, is Martian esthetics. But seen in the drawings the vision is splendid. It is worth a visit for the drawings alone (note particularly the plans), both Goff's renderings and those of his former student Herb Greene. Greene, in particular, draws like a demon on a permanent high. His delicate colored pencil Arabian‐nights‐of‐the future imagery is architec tural graphics on an extra ordinary level. His own fan tastic shingled shambles of a prairie house in Norman, Oklahoma, has been referred to by the English Architec tural Review as a “wounded buffalo.” Bruce Goff is a phenome non, part of an indigenous American tradition of the un spoiled, romantic, land‐loving loner that the Review has labeled the American grass roots mythology. This fasci nates Europeans and em barrasses Americans. The ar chitects who complete their concrete and steel bank buildings with hard‐edge ab straction are made a little uneasy by a man whose tastes run to rusticity, orien talia, peácock feathers and pink plastic. When he is pub lished by American architec tural periodicals the tone is uncomfortable and ambigu ous. Not surprisingly, his work is flashily offbeat enough to have been discov ered by the full color, popu lar press. Professionally, it is treated more sympatheti cally abroad than at home. “L'insolite Bruce Goff,” L'Architecture d'Aujourd' hui called him in 1962—the unusual Bruce Goff. What happens to his un usual designs? About half have been built. They are to be found chiefly in Okla homa, Texas, Florida, and places where tastes are open and grass‐roots mythology strongest. His houses have often been do‐it‐yourself, with the clients constructing them lovingly over a period of years under the architect's tutelage — or they are cost no‐object jobs. The Bavinger family built its own house in Norman, Oklahoma, charging the pilgrims and the curious a dollar a head toward the construction fund. This 1950 design is an unwinding stone snail, part cave, part green house, the color of late, color drained autumn leaves. At the other end of the scale, the house for Joe Price was a Playboy dream, if Playboy were an archi tect. (Price is the son of the wealthy clients who commis sioned Frank Lloyd Wright's Price tower in Bartlesville, the building in which Goff has lived and worked.) This playhouse was enlarged in 1967, after Price married, and now, as the Joe and Etsuko Price house, has such touches as a $10,000 Japanese bath that is a kaleidoscope of mosaics topped by a glass fish pool. One wonders if either a communications or a genera tion gap really exists be tween, say, Yale and Okla homa; there is so much of supergraphics in Goff's uses of color, mirror and pattern. There is also his theory of continuous composition that prefigures the popular aca demic anti‐formalism or “endless architecture” of the 1960's. Anyone who doubts Goff's serious competence need only look at the working drawings for the Price house in the show. They are an exhaus tive, painstaking documenta tion of the resolution of the special details of dream houses. It is also clear that short of an unlimited budget, any architect could lose his shirt doing this kind of thing. The Price house, a chef d'oeuvre of untrammeled, sy baritic fancy in gold anodyzed aluminum nylon carpeted floor and walls, goose feather ceilings and hanging plastic “rain,” is superGoff. LesserGoff or pure disaster, can be seen in the realization of the sketch for the 1960 Gryder house in Ocean Springs, Miss. Here ex ecution turns impossible fly ing curves into chewing gum and a precisely poised invert ed cone into Dairy Queen. However, the shingled, red wood‐sided cubes of the Wil son house in Pensacola, Fla., are something else again: ar chitecture, not Mother Goose. Except for a few bits of common vocabulary that in clude recurrent glass or plas tic conical domes, the pen chant for organic theory and things on the bias, and those colored pencil renderings, re semblance to Frank Lloyd Wright decreases after the early work. Goff is Goff, even in Las Vegas. His unexecuted 60‐story Viva Hotel and ca sino, in a style that might be called Space‐Camp, would have raised Vegas to a crea tive level that its humdrum hotel caricatures have always lacked. Another unbuilt proj ect, for the Giacomo Motor Lodge in McAlester, Okla* homa, looks like a petrified forest with balconies. Both are pure Pop Environment. In today's world of explod ing conventions, that is a hard act to follow.

712-> About MOMA, The AWC And Political Causes
LSEWHERE on this page today readers will find a letter from representatives of the Art Workers Coalition com menting on my article of Jan. 18. “Do You Believe in the Principle of Museums?” This letter is important, I be lieve, in two respects—for what it says about museum policy, and for what it fails to say. Because of its im portance, I want to deal with some of the issues raised in this letter today. Before turning to these is sues, however, it seems nec essary to make one point un mistakably clear. In my opin ion, the Art Workers Coali tion is, at the present mo ment, the only professional art group in this country that is addressing itself to the fundamental social and po litical problems that current ly afflict the visual arts both as a profession and as a cul tural enterprise. Other pro fessional groups — the art dealers, the art historians, the art critics, the art edu cationists, the museum direc tors, the museum member ships, and the older, mostly somnolent organizations of artists—have chosen, for the most part, to remain silent, indifferent, or simply superi or in the face of these prob lems. * For better or worse, it has been left to the AWC to bring these problems into the open by the now familiar means of direct confrontation. One may dislike the method. One may recoil from some of the values that are implicit in the AWC program. One may even despair that the prob lems in question can ever be solved in a manner altogeth er satisfactory to all parties concerned. But it would be folly to suppose that the AWC has somehow “created” these problems. I underscore the point because certain pri vate communications that came in after my Jan. 18 ar ticle have left me with the impression that some quite intelligent people, people who are otherwise not conspicu orisly stupid about the world they live in, have satisfied themselves that this is the case. Nothing could be fur ther from the truth. Like it or not, the AWC has earned our gratitude for bringing these problems to public notice with the proper sense of urgency. At the very least, it has brought us a vivid reminder of the fact that museums are social in stitutions with social respon sibilities. But whatever our debt may be in this respect —and I think it is a large one—it cannot disguise the woeful deficiencies of the AWC's own ideas and pro posals. Today's lettar, for example, does not contain a single con crete idea about the way museums should deal wi:n their permanent collections— the problem, after all, with which my own article was concerned. A useful distinc tion is made between “Kunst museum (repository of per manent collection) and Kunsthalle (temporary exhi bition hall).” and the AWC proposes that the Museum of Modern Art should simply abandon its role as Kunst museum in order to function solely as a Kunsthalle. But this proposal is anything but a solution to the problem. It merely transfers the problem to other physical premises where “the care and housing of an endlessly augmented collection,” as the AWC let ter puts it, would remain the same vexing responsibility. can only conclude that, on this particular question, the AWC has no ideas to offer us. * The political questions raised by the AWC are an other matter. The AWC argues that the Museum of Modern Art is already serv ing political interests—its let ter refers to “the present conservative politicization of the museum.” There is a clear (though unstated) sug gestion here that political tests have been applied in the selection of the “men now controlling the Museum of Modern Art.” Well, I agree that the museum's Board of Trustees is no band of reb els, but I have always as sumed that the primary test applied in the selection of these trustees is an economic one. The AWC letter does not persuade me otherwise. The trustees are men of great wealth. Why? Because they are the principal source (di rect or indirect) of the mu seum's funds. That such men are likely to be conservative in their social values; that they are not always disinter ested in their decisions par ticularly in matters affecting the market value of they own private collections; and that they are known to intervene in areas of museum business where they have no compe tence—all this, it scems to me, is undeniable as well as distasteful. But does it con stitute the politicalization of the museum? I don't believe so. * For whatever their sins may be, the trustees have not—so far as I know— obliged the museum to serve a political cause, conserva tive or otherwise. If, because of “the profits of the Viet nam war,” etc., their money is politically “tainted,” as the AWC claims, from what un tainted sources should the necessary funds be drawn? The Federal Government, which is conducting the War in Vietnam? It may in the end come to that. But given the present conserva tive temper in Washington, would the substitution of Government money for pri vate patronage strengthen or weaken the museum's con servative tendencies? It's a moot question—and still an other on which the AWC of fers us no ideas. Now the AWC does, spe cifically, call upon the mu seum to serve political causes. What this suggests to me is a society in which every organization, every group, and, ultimately, every individual —no matter how politically disinterested their work may be—will be obliged to serve political causes in order to pursue their own professional interests. It sug gests a society totally gov erned by political tests—in other words, a totalitarian society. Does the AWC really believe that such tests ad vance the cause of political liberty? I doubt it. But the AWC is marvelously cake lier in ignoring the implica tions of its own demands. In saying all this, I don't want to suggest that the mu seum situation, whether at the Museum of Modern Art or elsewhere, is all sweetness and light. Far from it. Sorite means must be found to in sure the authority and auton omy of curatorial staffs against the importunities of trustees. But to exchange such importunities for out side political pressures is not my idea of a change in the right direction. The AWC letter today con cludes by inviting me to pre sent my own “program for the ills of the Museum of Modern Art.” This is both flattering and embarrassing, for—dare I confess it? — I have no such program to of fer. Were I to frame one, however, its first tenet would be to guarantee the integrity of the museum's permanent collection as well as public access to as much of that collection as the Physical premises permit. It anything, I would like to see the mu seum keep itself at a greater distance from the current art scene than it now does. Its permanent collection is the greatest of its kind in the world. It seems to me to border on the perverse to suggest its liquidation for transfer simply to provide another temporary exhibition hall. The AWC writes, in any case, as if our New York museums were not already engaged in a frantic compe tition to mount temporary ex hibitions of new work. On another Issue raised by the AWC's proposals—the extension of the museum's museological services to com munities that now do not en joy easy access to them—I hope to write in detail on—a later occasion. The most in teresting program of this sort which I have personally ob served is the one which the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston Is now engaged in. When I have had the op portunity to study it futher, I shall report on it at leugth.

713-> Court Orders Rise In Relief Payments For Upstate Areas
New York State has been ordered by a Federal judge to grant an estimated total of $11‐ million annually in additional benefits for upstate welfare families. The ruling, which will mean more than $3 additional a month each for about 230,000 recipients, was issued late Wednesday by Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the East ern District in Brooklyn. It was based on a finding that the welfare revisions enacted in 1969 by the Legislature, while promulgated as an improve ment, reduced the level of bene fits upstate. The ruling, which state wel fare officials said would be ap pealed, was ordered effective Oct, 1. Attorneys for the Col umbia University Center for Social Welfare Policy and Law said that they would seek to have it declared retroactive to July, 1969, when the original revisions were implemented. The order does not affect the payment levels in New York City, which the Columbia center, in a continuing legal action, also contended were re duced appreciably in 1969. The issue of city relief pay ments is still before Judge Weinstein. State welfare officials said that they had not had the op portunity to study the ruling in detail but that their initial rough estimate was that it would increase the state's current annual total of 1.4‐ billion in relief benefits by $11‐million. The Federal Gov ernment would pay about 40 per cent of this, with the state and local governments payments paying 30 per cent each. At present, there are 1.1 mil lion state residents receiving welfare assistance, most of them residents of New York City. For a family of four in the Albany‐Syracuse area, the or der will increase the monthly grant from $207 to $221, plus rent. In the Buffalo area, the monthly payment would in crease from $203 to $218. In New York City, a family of four now receive $231 a month plus rent.

714-> BALTIMORE LEAD CUT TO 2 GAMES
CHICAGO, June 16 — Roy White picked the Yankees up on his 170‐pound frame tonight and lifted them half a game closer to the top of the Ameri can League's Eastern Division. The little left‐fielder got three hits, including his 10th home run, that drove in four runs as Mel Stottlemyre struggled to his seventh victory, defeat ing the White Sox, 6‐2, at Comiskey Park. The victory was New York's sixth in a TOW, their highest winning skein of the season, and left them only two games behind the Baltimore Orioles, who were rained out tonight. The Yankees were victorious for the 11th time in 12 games and for the 31st in their last 44 in a drive that has lifted them from last place. White was the difference with a single, double and home run in four times at bat. In the last three games, he has 11 hits. in 14 times at bat (a .786 pace and lifted his batting average tc .357, second best in the league. With the White Sox leading 2‐1, after five innings in 1.vhicl they battered Stottlemyre foi nine hits, White sparked three‐run Yankee sixth. Horace Clarke opened with a double and moved to third or Bobby Murcer's bloop single White then doubled deep into the right‐field corner, scoring both runners and moving to third on the throw to the plate. When he scored a moment later on Tommy John's ninth wild pitch of the season, the Yankees led, 4‐2. Once in the lead, Stottlemyre settled down and yielded only two hits in the final foul frames. He picked up‐ his sev enth victory against four de feats, winning for the seventi time in his last eight decisions. Importantly, in view of early season problems on the New York staff, the triumph was his third straight complete‐game effort. White gave the Yankee pitch er a further breathing margin in the eighth when he hit an opposite‐field homer batting left‐handed off Danny Murphy, the right‐handed Chicago re liever. White's belt followed single by Murcer. The first Yankee run had scored in the fourth on a dou ble by Thurman Munson and Ron Wood's single to center. The Yankees had been foiled in the second, third and fourth innings when, after leadoff singles, Luis Aparicio started three straight double plays by scooping up grounders, touch ing second and throwing first. The first Chicago run was scored in the second on fielder's choice after a single by Ed Herrmann and a double by Syd O'Brien. Gail Hopkins, Herrmann and O'Brien singled in succession in the fourth for the other Chicago run. The White Sox left 11 men on base as against two for the yankees, who these days are not only talented, but devilishly efficient. ?? ??

715-> DOMINICK PLANNING TO ACQUIRE DITTMAR
Dominick & Dominick, Inc.?? the investment banking and brokerage concern, announced plans yesterday for the acquisi tion of Dittmar & Co., Inc., a regional securities house based in San Antonio, Tex. Myron A. Wick Jr., chair man of Dominick, and Richard O. Arneson, president of Ditt mar, said Dittmar's offices in Dallas, San Antonio, Browns ville, Kerrville and San Angelo, all in Texas, would operate under the Dominick name, while its Houston office would be merged into the Dominick branch there. The acquisition, expected to become effective Feb. 1, will give Dominick strong repre sentation in the Southwestern area. The concern's business has been concentrated mainly in the East?? In an unrelated development, Walston & Co. said it would consolidate its Minneapolis of fice into its St. Paul location. As a result, the St. Paul office will employ 45, including 35 account executives. Nationally, Walston has one of the largest branch networks, with 104 of fices in 27 states and the Dis trict of Columbia.

716-> Jewish Groups Denounce Soviet Death Sentences
Jewish organizations yester day strongly protested the death sentences of two Jewish prisoners in the Leningrad hi jacking trial and other groups staged demonstrations in front of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, at 136 East 67th Street. As the organizations ap pealed to the Soviet authorities not to carry out the death sen tences, Jewish militants occu pied the exterior balcony of the East Side Synagogue, directly across the street from the So viet Mission and shouted de nunciations of the sentences. One group attempted to pre sent petitions, which were taken from two caskets, but the police said that the Soviet authorities would not accept them. New York City's five district attorneys, expressing “grave concern” over justice in the Soviet Union, asked the chief prosecutor in Leningrad for per mission to atend the trials of 20 Jews still facing charges in connection with the hijacking. The district attorneys—Frank Hogan of Manhattan, Burton B. Roberts of the Bronx, Thom as Mackell of Queens, Eugene Gold of Brooklyn and John M. Braisted of Richmond—ad dressed their request in a letter to S. Y. Soloviov, the Leningrad prosecutor. Meanwhile, Rabbi Arthur J. Lelyveld, president of the American Jewish Congress, in statement called on Pope Paul, President Nixon and the World Council of Churches to inter cede with the Kremlin in the case of the convicted Soviet Jews. “Let their sentences be reMilted, let them emigrate to Israel,”'. Rabbi Lelyveld Said. “The real crime these brave Jews is that they want to lead a Jewish life in the Jewish state.” Rabbi Bernard C. Berzon, president of the Rabbinical Council of America, denounced the trials which 11 persons —9 of them Jews—were con victed as reminiscent “of the Stalin purge confessions.” Rabbi Herschel Schacter, chairman or the, American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry, said had Leningrad trial has: had “its predictable result, as Soviet trials always do.” Philip E. Hoffman, president of the American Jewish Com mittee, also denouncing the ver dict, said that Soviet law “which makes it treason for a citizen to want to leave the country is in contradistinction to all other international norms.” At the demonstration out side the Soviet mission, sev eral hundred youngsters, affil iated with the Students for So viet Jewry, carried signs and sang “Am Yisroel Chai,” the people of Israel live. As they marched toward the Soviet Mission, members of the Jewish Defense League, led by their leader, Rabbi Meir Ka hane, eluded police barriers and entered the synagogue by go ing through rear windows from 68th Street and vaulting a fence. Policemen using bull horns, could not dislodge them from the balcony. Authorities of the synagogue protested but perwitted a group of about 30 to remain on the balcony. The they were unable to present their petitions to officials of the Soviet Mission. TEL AVIV, Dec. 24—Premier Golda Meir said in a broadcast tonight that the Leningrad sen tences showed that the present Soviet rulers were continuing the Czarist traditions of blood libel and murder of innocent Jews. It was later announced that the Knesset would hold a spe cial session at noon tomorrow to hear a Government state ment on the death sentences and long prison terms imposed on Jews charged with attempt ing to hijack a plane. Mrs. Meir, a former Israeli Ambassador in Moscow, spoke in a strained voice. She called upon the civilized world and all who cherish human honor and freedom to raise their voices in a call to remove the shadow of death from innocent people and the immediate re lease of the condemned. LONDON, Dec. 24—Jack Winocour, director of information of the World Jewish Con gress, tonight sent the follow ing appeal to President Nikolai V. Podgorny in Moscow: “I helped save thousands o?? Russian lives by disclosing Himmler ‐ Bernadotte negotia tions 1945 for surrender of Germany to allies. Please spare lives of two Jews who are loyal to you and to the Jewish people and commute sentence on other prisoners at Leningrad trial.”

717-> Royal Tom Triumphs by 2 Lengths in 6‐Furlong Sprint at Aqueduct
A Pennsylvania‐bred, Emil Dolce's Royal Tom, rewarded the form players at Aqueduct yesterday by taking the feature race with little trouble. Com peting against four rivals in the six‐furlong sprint for older horses, Royal Tom scored by two lengths over Crying For More, who had four lengths over the third horse, Hypoc risy. Eddie Belmonte gave the 4‐ year‐old son of Tompion exactly the right kind of ride on the good track. He dropped him back to last place as the field got away and kept him there almost to the stretcii turn. At that point Royal Tom stepped up his pace and zoomed into the lead, well before the wire. Under 124 pounds, his time was 1:11 2/5. The triumph was roundly ex pected by the crowd of 25,647 as evidenced by the straight payoff of $3.40 for $2. Robyn Smith, who gave up Hollywood starlet ambitions in favor of a career as a “jockette,” rode in the third race on the card and showed improvement. The 24‐year‐old Hawaiian‐born rider finished fourth on Running Bear in a contest won by the favored Mighty Miles, with Ron. Tur cotte riding. There were nine in the race and the winner paid $5.80. Miss Smith refused to give up with her mount when it was passed by a rival and she persevered enough to reclaim fourth position in the stretch drive of the five‐furlong sprint for 2‐year‐olds. The perfor mance was the second at Aque duct for Miss Smith. On Dec. last year she finished in fifth place in her sole Big A ap pearance. Dave Liverman, a 23‐year‐ old apprentice, made his way to the winner's circle with Tim's Boy, running in the silks of Clara Oliveri, in the second race. The score was a signifi cant one for Liverman, for it was the fifth victory of his career. As a result, he lost part of his apprentice allowance, and will now have an edge of sev en, instead of ten, pounds un til he scores his 35th victory. The triple crown for fillies, an annual presentation of the New York Racing Association, has drawn a record number of 135 nominations. The stakes that make up this triad are the $50,000 added Acorn at a mile on May 16 at Aqueduct, the $75,000 added Mother Goose at a mile and an eighth at Bel mont Park on May 29 and the $100,000 added Coaching Club American Oaks at a mile and a quarter at Belmont on June 20. Most of the leading fillies in the 3‐year‐old division are among the entrants, including the Elcee‐H Stable's Fast At tack, the top weighted of her. sex in the Experimental Handi cap. ??

718-> DRABOWSKY BACK IN ORIOLE FOLD
The Baltimore Orioles, who have been under pressure lately from the New York Yankees, contributed to a flurry of ac tivity as the baseball trading deadline an‐ived Monday at midnight. The Orioles sent Bobby Floyd, a 26‐year‐old shortstop and second baseman, to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Moe Drabowsky, the 35‐ year‐old relief pitcher. It will be the second time in Drabow sky's 15‐year career that he has worked for Baltimore. He was one of the heroes of the Orioles' World Series sweep, over the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1966, and then was traded to Kansas City. The Orioles also sent Dave May, a reserve outfielder, to the Milwaukee Brewers for the contracts of two minor league pitchers, Buzz Stephen and Dick Baney. In order to make room on the roster for May, the Brew ers farmed out Hank Allen, the older brother of Richie Allen, whom they recently had ac quired from Washington. Milwaukee also signed Bob Humphreys, a pitcher who had been cut by the Senators, and sold two pitchers—Bob Locker going to the Oakland Athletics and John O'Donoghue to the Montreal Expos. In other trades, the Cleve land Indians sent two pitchers, Barry Moore and Bob Miller, to the Chicago White Sox for Buddy Bradford, an outfielder, and Tommie Sisk, a pitcher, who then was assigned to Wichita of the American Asso ciation. To make room for Rick Morales, an infielder coming off the disabled list, the White Sox also farmed out Gerry Ar rigo, a left‐handed pitcher. The San Diego Padres re called Larry. Stahl from Salt Lake City and traded Bobby Etheridge, an infielder, to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ron Willis, a relief pitcher who has been with Arkansas in the Tex as League this season. The Car dinals also recalled Jerry Reuss, a left‐handed pitcher, from Tulsa to replace Nelson Briles, who went on the disabled list with a pulled hamstring muscle. The Cincinnati Reds beat the deadline by acquiring Ty Cline, a 31‐year‐old outfielder, from Montreal for Clyde Mashore, 25‐year‐old outfielder who was farmed out to Winnipeg.

719-> Cambodians Report Repulsing Enemy Attack Near Pnompenh
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, Tues day, Aug. 25 (AP)—A, military spokesman said an enemy force estimated at five batta ?? launched an attack nine miles northeast of Pnompenh fast night, but the spokesman said it had been driven back. Maj. Am Rong, the Cambod ian spokesman, said the Viet cong and North Vietnamese at tacked the village of Prek Tameak just before midnight and that fighting continued until this morning. Major Am Rong said the Cambodian troops had been given intensive support by fighter‐bombers and by Cam bodian gunboats on the Mekog River alongside the village. The village was overrun last week by three Vietcong bat talions that advanced to within six miles of Phompenh, which is on the other side of the river from Prek Tameak. The river is now approaching flood level and is more than a mile wide. Saang Reported Attacked Another enemy assault was reported to have been launched against the town of Saang, 18 miles south of Pnompenh, but Major Am Rong said the at tackers had been held off, largely by one AC‐47 gunship that circled most of the night firing at the defense perimeter with its rapid‐firing guns. Saang has also been a frequent target of the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.

720-> Football Tie‐Up Enters 4th Day; College All Stars Resume Drills
The stalemate In the pro football labor negotiations will go into its fourth day today with no further meet ings scheduled. The commit tees of the National Football League Players Association and the owners remained here, however, each awaiting a compromising move on money issues by the other. Their differences on a pro jected four‐year contract amounts to $7.8‐million, ac cording to the players, and $11‐million, according to the owners. Meanwhile, the College All Star squad of 53, all hope ful future professionals, re sumed drills under Coach Otto Graham at Evanston, Ill., following a one‐day boycott. The All‐Stars are scheduled to play the Kansas City Chiefs in Chicago on July 31 in the first of the preseason games. There were other rookies working out as 14 of the 26 teams had training camps open with more to come. But these camps remained closed to seasoned players by direc tion of both the owners and the Players Association. The Players Association documented its demands in full yesterday. The leading issue is more money for the pension fund. The players are asking for a contribution that would average $6.45‐ million over the next four years. The owners have of fered an average of $4.5‐million. The last two years $2.8‐ million has gone into the pension fund, most of it com ing from the Super Bowl gate and television receipts. The players also want in creases in the shares that go to participating teams in the Super Bowl, the conference playoffs and the new inter conference All‐Star Game. The Super Bowl shares would jump from $15,000 for win ners to $17,500 and from $7,500 to $10,000 for losers. The owners position is that when all the players de mands are added up the amount comes to $29‐million for the four years. “That's too much,” said a spokes man. “We can't afford it. It could mean that half the teams operate in the red.” The players have presented a formula built around sug gested further increases in ticket prices and anticipated added television income to generate the money. They say that if the projections fall short their formula will allow smaller returns for the pension fund. The owners contend that the formula and the projec tions are unrealistic. “We dif fer not only in figures but in philosophy,” said the owners spokesman. With disagreement com plete, there is talk of turn ing to a third party other than Commissioner Pete Roz elle for arbitration as train ing camp timetables become more demanding.

721-> FEW POLICE TOLD ABOUT SPRAY USE
While most American police departments have equipped their men with chemical spray weapons, very few have de veloped instructions on when and where to use them. These are two key findings of a survey on the use of non lethal spray weapons published recently by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Though use of chemical weapons by the police has stirred considerable controversy in various cities of the United States, little precise informa tion about their deployment has been available. Among the principal findings of the asso ciation are the following: ¶Four out of five of the 1,220 responding local, county and state police agencies have pur chased varying quantities of one of the approximately 20 different brands of chemical spray weapons now on the market. ¶Only one out of every three departments have provided written instructions to govern use of the weapons. Most of these instructions described how to activate the devices and rarely dealt with the questions “when, where and why the aerosol irritant projector should be employed.” ¶Virtually all the reporting agencies said the weapons were carried by all patrolmen. Three out of every four said the pro jectors also were issued to detectives. ¶The agencies said the chem ical ‐ weapons had been used under tactical conditions more than 30,000 times or about one for every 2.6 per cent of the projectors in service. They also reported injuries in less than one–tenth of 1 per cent of the instances in which they were fired. The association survey did not provide a breakdown of which cities were using the devices and which were not, but New York Police officials indicated that the small number of chemical weapons they had purchased were now in storage and not in the hands of police men. For about a year, such weapons were carried on trucks of the Department's Safety and Emergency Division. Another survey finding was that of the 953 police agencies answering the question on lit igation, 26 had been sued as a result of use of the chemical weapons. The survey did not indicate on what the suits were based. The study indicated that policemen in the East South Central, Mountain and Pacific sections of the country used chemical weapons most fre quently and those in New Eng land, the East, North Central and mid‐Atlantic areas least frequently. A second finding was that the larger the city, the more fre quent the usage. Cities with more than 250,000 persons re ported using the weapons more than three times more often than cities with under 25,000 persons. Eighty‐nine of the 1,220 re porting agencies said the non lethal weapons a been in the commission of 115 used crimes.

722-> His Bid Day Counts
“I THOUGHT I had one of these jobs people talk about — a Federal bureauc racy where you don't do any thing,” said John C. Culli nane yesterday. His tone said that he was joking, and so did the circumstances: Mr. Cullinane is New York's re gional director of the Bureau of the Census. But even when it isn't national census day — and the great head count takes place only once every 10 years— Mr. Cullinane's office is busy counting. The bureau does the regional surveys for other Government agencies — on TV ownership, on smoking, on agriculture, on almost anything that can be counted — and in slack periods puts its expertise at the disposal of communities for fee. In the New York region all those programs are under the administrative control of the 48‐year‐old Mr. Culli nane, who said in an inter view yesterday that what he liked best about his job was not the statistics, but “deal ing with people.” The anal ysis of the collected material is done in Washington; “the collection of raw data itself” is Mr. Cullinane's province here, and he has done his share of household interview ing. John Christopher Cullinane, born in Tipperary, Ireland, Sept. 3, 1921, joined the census agency in 1954. Be fore that, and after three years in the Army Air Force during World War II, he worked for the Veterans Ad ministration as a contact representative interviewing returning veterans. A reduc tion in the work force at the V.A. brought him to the bureau. “I like Government work,” he said. At that time I was dealing with the public in the form of vets, and I liked it, and I felt in the agency I had been performing a public service and was interested in staying with it.” He enlisted in the Air Force in 1942 and was sent to England with the Eighth Air Force. Serving as a gun ner on a B‐17 in August, 1944, he bailed out over France when his plane was shot down. He was wounded in the leg, and was captured by German troops on the ground. From then until May, 1945, when the prison camp was liberated by United States troops, Technical Ser geant Cullinane was a pris oner of war in Stalag Luft 12. The oldest of three chil dren, he came to the United States with his parents when he was six. He was educated in New York City public schools, and was graduated in 1938 from Benjamin Frank lin High School. Mr. Cullinane has been re gional director of the bureau in New York since 1964. Before that, he was district manager for the special 1957 census of New York City, after a stint in programming supervision and in adminis tration. He has been married since 1950 to his brunette wife, Margaret, whom he met at an “Irish social” in 1948. They live in a two‐family house that he owns in Belle Harbor, Queens, two blocks from the ocean. They have a daughter, Barbara Ann, 18, and a son, Michael, 17. Mr. Cullinane, who is 5 feet 9½ inches tall, weighs 180 pounds and, in his own words is “getting gray,” dresses conservatively and is active in church affairs. When there is time, he likes “a little bowling” and de scribes himself as a golfer whose scores are “like the President's—unmentionable.” He is a fan of the New York Jets, and pointed out that five football players (including three Jets) were working for the bureau as assistant dis trict managers for the census. The telephone calls were coming in so thick and fast yesterday that Mr. Cullinane handled about 20 of them himself. Most of them, he said, were of the how‐do‐I‐answer a‐question‐accurately variety. Told of a group of women in Kentucky who had protest ed that the “head of house hold” question on the ques tionnaire presupposed that the person in this category would be a male—by supply ing an answer box for “wife of head” but not for “hus band of head,” Mr. Cullinane was unruffled. The “libertarian move ment,” he said, would also find the census useful to their cause, because it would en able them to tally “the num ber of females engaged in various types of occupation, income and education.”

723-> Mann Follows Wife Into Opera
ONE of the New York City Opera's lead ing sopranos, Patricia Brooks, has been mar ried for 16 years to Theodore Mann, a well‐known theatri cal producer and director. It wasn't until last summer, how ever, that Mann was lured into staging an opera, when he tackled Puccini's “Gianni Schicchi” for the Lake George company in upstate New York. He liked the experience well enough to take on another work, this time for the City Opera. Tomorrow he begins rehearsing that company's re vival of Benjamin Britten's “The Turn of the Screw,” which will be given for the first time this season on March 1. Mann's interpretation of the famous Henry James tale is perfectly “straight.” To him it is a “Victorian ghost story” and, as such, quite natural. He accompanied his wife to London recently, when she made her Covent Garden de but as the Queen in Rimsky Korsakoff's “Coq d'Or,” and he found today's Englishman “ghost‐ridden.” “Everyone I met there,” he says, “believed somewhat in the supernatural. ‘The Turn of the Screw’ can not he treated as a fairy tale or as a product of the Gover ness's imagination, as it a sometimes interpreted. The ghosts are real; the Governess and the two children do see them. Britten's music for them is wonderful, suggesting the extension of life past the time that we've lived.” As a nonmusician, Mann has immersed himself in the music by listening to the recording, and he “finds it interesting that the composer knows so exactly what he wants.” Bravely enough, he is a bit at odds with some of the vocal interpretations in the record ing, which was conducted by the composer. In the record ing, he says, “all the women sing neurotically and sound alike. Actually, only the Gov erness, whom I have placed at 28 years of age, a young woman in need of male com panionship, is somewhat neu rotic, but even this should not show up at the very start of the opera. Miss Jessel, the previous governess who has become one of the ghosts, is almost passive, being mani pulated by Quint, and Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper, Is a completely passive, common sensical person.” With Jac Venza, who de signed the production, some seasons hack, Mann is redoing the sets, since there is a need for “theatrical magic.” Fie his dictable results 50 years from now. * But who is there to play the bigger Godowsky pieces? Godowsky, by making them so difficult, painted himself into a corner. To play this music, each of the 10 fingers has to have an eye in it, and the pianist must have an abil ity to bring out insuperably complicated inner lines, to weight each note and to maintain a singing line, as well as flexibility of rhythm and an unusual ability at coloration. It is hard to think of more than four or five living pianists who could throw off this ma terial with ease; and if a pia nist cannot throw it off, he should not be playing it. Deep in his mind, Godowsky prob ably thought he was compos ing his music for a race of future Godowskys. But he was the last of his line and after him piano technique was not to ascend to a higher plane. If anything, it was to recede from the transcenden tal heights to which he had carried it.

724-> FIREMEN AT AIRPORT END LONDON STRIKE
LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) — Striking firemen at London's Heathrow international airport decided today to end an un official three‐day strike short ly after their union made it an official walkout. The British Airport Authority said the airport would be com pletely operational by midnight. The authority had refused to negotiate with the 90 men over their claims for increases in their complicated shift pay scale while the work stoppage was unofficial. Once the strike was sanctioned by the union they agreed to open negotia tions and the men voted to re turn to work. The strike brought the air port to a standstill for an hour on Monday and caused it to operate on a limited schedule yesterday and today when 20 supervisors manned the fi: trucks for 12 hours each day.

725-> The Violent Black Minority
URING the nineteen‐thirties in New York City, the black white boundary ran along Morningside Avenue. My family lived on 123d Street, just on the west—the white—side of that frontier. East of Morningside, one was in Harlem. Yet, only whites crossed this line. Apart from some domestic servants and an occasional delivery boy, entire days might go by without a black face appearing in adjacent white neighbor hoods. On the other hand, those of us who were white never regarded Momingside Avenue as a barrier. We felt entirely free to wander into Har lem at any hour of the day or night, feeling secure that we would be neither accosted nor attacked. These were Depression years, and Harlem was by all odds the poorest section of the city. It could well have been dangerous territory for any white trespasser. Nevertheless, it was en tirely safe. The reason, of course, was that the blacks knew their place. Not only did they avoid white territory; they also realized that they must not ap proach whites who happened to stroll through their slum. Fear of the police obviously helped maintain this sub mission, for in those days Harlem's station houses were even less at tentive to due processes of law than they are now. A far more effective control, however, lay in the tacit under standing that members of Amer ica's subordinate races simply did not touch or threaten their bet ters. This is by no means to suggest that black Americans were happy with their condition. Their mood was rather one of resignation; any im pulse to protest fell victim to the presence of white domination within the black consciousness. EFORE World War II, America's black population constituted neither a threat nor a problem for the white nation. The black minority subsisted under effective control in the rural South and also in the Northern slums, where intimidation and oppression were usually implicit but nonetheless real. Moreover, little attention was paid to the condition of black Ameri cans. It was assumed, for example, that a docile pool of black labor would always be available for the arduous and unskilled services re quired by white society. No thoughts were raised concerning where house maids or porters went or what they did after their working hours. Black America remained unobtrusive, ap parently uncomplaining, and virtually invisible to white eyes. These were placid years for white Americans. No serious civil‐rights movement or organized protests arose to upset white sensibilities. No talk of black power was heard, and only the barest whispers of equal itarian aspirations could be detected. Aware of the totality of their thrall dom, black Americans simply saw no prospect for improving their bleak experience of life. They knew that they were marginal members of the nation, and realized that white Amer ica looked upon them as an awkward appendage, not quite human in major respects, and to be consigned to the end of the queue when scarce com modities were apportioned. HE most significant change for the black man has been not in his condition relative to white America, but rather in his perception of him self. Black Americans now feel en titled to more from the society that surrounds them. This transformation began during World War II, when, for the first time, black Americans were actually courted by the white society. A labor shortage in private industry forced employers to offer jobs to workers who would previous ly have been excluded from consider ation. Even the most exploited of domestic servants discovered that they, too, could exact better wages and working conditions. A human being's discovery that he is needed and wanted can be a catalyzing ex perience, forging a new conception of his own identity and accelerating the desire for even greater recogni tion. Once a society has told men and women that it cannot function without their participation, they will not willingly revert to less favorable conceptions of themselves when the crisis has passed. Thus, the notions of civil rights and racial integration, the ideas of social equality and black power, had their origins in the wartime years. A new black mind was forged by events that had been neither planned nor anticipated. For even so brief a sojourn in the sun as the wartime years afforded was sufficient to in troduce black Americans to incomes, occupations and expectations that had hitherto been the exclusive pre serve of whites. The protests of the postwar gener ation signified an end to an accep tance of the half‐slave, half‐free status that had persisted for almost a century following the Civil War. Now blacks mounted new responses to displays of injustice. Now the white nation encountered arrogance and anger for which it was not pre pared. The unintended effect of World War II was thus to destroy the con trols that had given race relations a placid appearance. Just as the war transformed the white population, instilling in average people new aspirations, so black Americans found reason to believe that their history could take a new turn. Blacks showed themselves willing to jeopar dize their lives and livelihoods as never before. The risks of arrest and imprisonment and bodily harm are now accepted, as is even the eventu ality of death. But if the psychology of black America has been altered, the mate rial reality of black life has changed only at the margin. By all compara tive measures, the nation's black citizens still find themselves con fined to the status they knew a gen eration ago in terms of the jobs they manage to obtain, the quality of education their children receive, the habitations in which they must live and their over‐all level of health and well‐being. Such amelioration as has occurred has been part of the general escalation in the living stand ard of the entire society. Today's blacks may be better off than were those of a generation ago, but the test is whether the gap between the races shows signs of diminishing. So far, this has not occurred. N other words, for all the social and material gains that some blacks have experienced, no white man has been supplanted in the process. Given the existence of many talented and imaginative blacks and many whites having only marginal abilities, any meaningful moves toward racial equality would necessarily entail the demotion of several million whites so that more capable blacks could take their places. The fact that such transpositions have not occurred has not gone un observed by blacks.* Thus, by all significant in dices, America's blacks re main clustered at the bottom of the nation's social struc ture. Moreover, for all the protests and the inflation of black expectations, time win bring little noteworthy prog ress toward a racial parity. Indeed, all signs now point to a hardening of racial lines, and there is reason to be lieve that the relative con dition of blacks will actually worsen over the coming decades. A candid analysis of the social character of America's black population compels such a forecast. It is certainly true that some hundreds of thou sands of blacks have come to share incomes and occupations once open only to whites, but this fact diminishes in signifi cance when set against the accelerating growth of a vast black underpopulation. Listing statistics on the numbers of blacks admitted to universities or given corporate white‐col lar jobs only deflects attention from those beyond the reach of education or employment. The critical figures are far more elementary: black birth rates and black patterns of migration' give the real picture of the racial future. For a child conceived to night will be the adolescent of tomorrow and the adult of the day after. The tenant farmer currently subsisting in rural Mississippi will soon move to New Orleans and thence to Chicago. The growing bulk of black America consists not of a few hundred thousand who have attained middle‐class status but rather of the mil lions of marginal men, women and children for whom white society has neither need nor sympathy. These black Ameri cans will make their presence felt, no matter what the opin ion or reaction of white Amer ica turns out to be. The Southern economy has declared that it no longer needs its black minority. Blacks have been deemed superfluous people for whom fewer and fewer productive jobs will be available each year. Not only have the me chanization of agriculture and the consolidation of farming rendered black labor redun dant, but the large cities of the South‐ hold out little promise of honorable em ployment for those forced off the land. The unwritten econ omic code of the region is clear: whatever new jobs may be created must first be of fered to the white citizenry. The South has more than enough underemployed whites to take over the workbenches of new factories, the desks of new offices and the counters of new shopping centers. Blacks are invited into the labor force only when the pool of available whites is depleted. Better than anyone, the Southern black under stands the rules of this game. He realizes he will have to bide his time at the tail end of the “Help Wanted” lines, and he has seen all too many of those signs taken down be fore his name was called. So he travels Norths. USES and‐trains have been pulling into Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia every day and night for a generation, disgorging exiles from Ala bama, Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina. Some times a father comes alone, to search for a job and a place to live, intending to send for his family later on. Not infrequently the arrival will be a weary mother with a brood of young children, coming to find the husband who had departed some months earlier and whose subsequent silence casts doubts on his future family role. But the North, like the South, has no real need for this flood of strangers. Few meaningful jobs can be created for these migrants, and they must squeeze them selves into the already over crowded tenements that white map‐makers designate as their territory. But at least no one need suffer malnutrition in the North. Welfare departments provide subsistence for un employable women and chil dren, and in the interstices of urban life men can find the small pickings of odd jobs and petty crime. The real scarcity lies in steady and moderately remunerative employment for black men, and even those who manage to get and hold jobs for sustained periods find few prospects for advance ment. The conventional precept that intelligence and industry will be rewarded with pro motion and affluence applies only to those born with white skins. Blacks realize that, no matter how hard they may work, they will still remain society's porters and janitors and dishwashers. If one req uisite for promotion is the ability to make a favorable impression on others, the mere possession of a black exterior precludes being taken wholly seriously. Excluded from traditional rewards and incentives, millions of black men move out of the system. Given similar prospects for success, the same proportion of whites would end up on urban steet corners. The facts of ghetto life compound this condition. These enclaves are created and sustained not by their ac tual residents but by whites who live elsewhere. Simply by denying blacks freedom of housing, white America stakes out the residual areas where blacks may live. To be sure, a few blacks do manage to break out of these confines (and others claim that they could move, but remain in the ghetto by choice). However, the majority, and especially the new arrivals, must make homes in the slums. The ghetto's boundaries are always expanding as a few more blacks move into proximate streets, thereby accelerating the exodus of remaining whites. But every better‐off black knows the difficulty of leapfrogging into white neigh borhoods: the humiliations he will encounter in his search for a home in such off‐limits territory, and the risks he and his family will endure if he tries to settle among inhospi table householders. For this reason alone much of the black middle class continues to live in the ghetto. Department stores and restaurants, hospitals and uni versities, municipal offices and police stations, even air planes and interstate highways are all white estates. In deed, the entire country— apart from its ghettos — is white property where non whites know they have no li cense to tarry after they have completed the approved er rands that brought them there. The black ghetto may well be a community; indeed, it may warrant that designation far more than most white neighborhoods. Yet, for all the shared experience and cama raderie of its residents, the ghetto also exhibits a greater measure of anarchy than any other region of American so ciety. Crime, violence and the sheer risk to life and limb are of epidemic proportions. (The odds that a resident will suffer physical assault are 130 times greater in a black slum than in a white middle‐class suburb.) The police provide protection at only minimal levels; danger lurks on the streets and in the tenements, for blacks have no compunc tions about preying on their fellow blacks.* Quite clearly, the ghetto is no fit place to raise children. Any hope that parents may have of exerting influence over their children suffers defeat once their youngsters reach the streets. Schoolyards and sidewalks become recruiting grounds for gangs, and youthful friends as often as not lead one an other into temptations that take a mortal toll before adolescence has ended. The street forms the focus of life, and exacts its price: heroin addiction, arrest and imprison ment, prostitution, or simply the lackluster life of semi literacy and sporadic employ ment. Boys have police re cords before their 15th birth day; girls become pregnant before turning 16. (This is not, of course, a “racial pathol ogy”; white Americans of all classes engage in self‐destruc tive behavior. But far fewer whites are raised in ghettos, and thus their chances of prison or pregnancy are lower.) ND in these pregnancies lies the future of black America. Half the black births in Northern cities occur out of wedlock, a figure unlikely to undergo substantial reduc tion during the next several decades. Moral censure, or even the threat of lessened welfare payments, will not alter the ghetto's sexual hab its. For these progenitive adolescents live in a world where puritanical or even precautionary morality has little relevance. To expect such boys and girls to exhibit self restraint or to adhere to a code created by an alien and uncaring society is self deception. Those who pre occupy themselves with the immorality and irresponsibil ity found in slum society would do well to turn their attention to the new genera tions of youngsters being spawned in our ghettos this very moment. These infants will be adolescents 15 years hence, and potential criminals, terrorists and unemployed adults a decade thereafter'Having come into the world unwanted by their parents and unneeded by society, they stand only the slightest chance of knowing love or encourage ment or even recognition of their humanity. In the process of creation right now are rioters and rapists, murderers and marauders, who will despoil society's landscape before this century has run its course.  This underpopulation domi nates the black birth rate and by sheer power of numbers decelerates all efforts at ra cial amelioration. Prior to 1970 it was customary to re fer to blacks as comprising one‐tenth of the American na tion. However, white America would be well advised to pay closer heed to the official sta tistics. Of the infants now being born, blacks account not for one in ten but closer to one in six. Black Americans will always be a minority; but as the white birth rate de clines, that minority will start to approach 20 or perhaps 25 per cent of the population. HE time has come for some unwelcome candor: to admit that white America does not want to deploy its re sources toward redeeming the black citizenry. Any meaning ful amelioration of black America's condition would re quire money and effort, per sonnel and priorities—indeed, moral and emotional commit ments—that the white society simply will not muster. If the merest hope of survival were to be granted to millions of black children, they would have to have care and atten tion costing many times what even the most prosperous of suburbs give to their own sons and daughters. Such a mission of rehabilitation would call for a virtual army of nursery‐school teachers, public health nurses, building inspectors, rat exterminators, probation officers, welfare workers and—not least im portant — policemen willing and able to render effective service in the black ghettos. However, white America, which pays most of the coun try's taxes and elects all save a handful of its lawmakers, cannot be‐ stirred beyond a conversational concern. Al though the nation may seem preoccupied with racial vicis situdes, its principal output has been little more than a series of paper programs and endless conferences, commis sions and committees. (Indeed, simply talking about “race” and “poverty” earns comfort able incomes for no small number of publishers, publi cists and social scientists.) And while white America de bates the wisdom of spending another billion dollars on yet another public project, the condition of the black under population continues to wor sen. The much publicized pre school centers, job‐training agencies and birth‐control clinics reach only a fraction of those in need of such as sistance. And when we take into account the annual ar rival of new infants and in migrants, the services which are available actually end up aiding an even smaller seg ment of our urban ghettos than they did the year before. Those who write reports al most invariably conclude their remarks with the word “massive.” They tell us that programs and appropriations must be “massive” if slums are to be rehabilitated, schools reformed and the employment system restructured. This is true, but America's racial sit uation has reached the point where deploying a major por tion of the nation's resources would only just begin to alter prevailing imbalances. How ever, the only “massive” en deavor will be the continued use of that word. White tax payers have no disposition to sacrifice their personal pros perity, especially to assist blacks—and no evidence can be produced to show that this attitude can or will be trans formed by new information, exhortations, or appeals. Black Americans realize this. Few have any illusions about white America's readi ness to underwrite anything more than research and con ferences. No one should be surprised at the more open displays of black resentment and rage. At the same time, it would be a mistake to at tribute these stirrings to dis illusionment over unfilled promises. It is certainly true that for almost two decades official pronouncements have appeared to hold out pros pects for substantial ameliora tion. Supreme Court decisions, Presidential directives and acts of Congress have de clared that school segregation, housing discrimination and poverty itself would be brought to an end. These pledges, impressive on paper, may well have raised some black expectations; their mea ger implementation certainly fueled black cynicism. But three centuries of experience have inured black Americans to the failure of white prom ises, even those issued by the most authoritative of agencies. Black discontent, therefore, does not arise from inade quate delivery on official as surances. Rather, its source lies in the contrasting condi tions of life known by the two races. That contrast, so evident to blacks, is the chief wellspring of anger. And that mood would still be present even had Government been less grandiose in its commit ments to racial reform. IOLENCE will mark rela tions between the races. Whites will live in increasing fear of depredations against their persons and property. And the grim overtones of race will exacerbate white fears, for being accosted by a black carries an added quo tient of terror compared with robbery by a member of one's own race. The condition of the black population is such that the number entering its criminal class — particularly adolescents and young adults —rises each year. Consider the black infants born this morning: there is no reason to believe that the lives most of them will know in the next 16 years will deter them from committing acts of violence. No special prescience is need ed to forecast the treatment they will receive from their birth through adolescence, so their subsequent behavior should hardly surprise us. Moreover, black animosities now express themselves more openly, and each criminal act against a white yields not only its material dividend but also the pleasure of extract ing some small revenge for centuries or racial wrongs. Even though black criminal violence is not part of any organized strategy, the fears aroused by such activity are as real as those stirred by purposive demonstrations. The number of attempts to sabotage the mechanisms of government and society will grow. In addition to peace ful demonstrations such as marches and picketing, the country will be confronted by not ‐ so ‐ peaceful efforts at blocking traffic, impeding business and disrupting white America's normal routines. Millions of black Americans have no incentive to identify with these institutions, and hence no compunctions about undermining their functioning. On occasion these disruptions will simply be mischievous; sending in false fire alarms, tying up telephone lines, clos ing off entrances to buildings, jamming roads at rush hours. However, the time will come when the malice will out weigh the mischief, often in volving serious destruction: dynamiting of bridges and water mains, firing of build ings, assassination of public officials and private lumi naries. And of course there will be occasional rampages, for which the raw ingredients are always available. Start with a spring or summer day when cramped apartments force ghetto residents onto the streets, combine with a rumor of police brutality, add the thunderclap of a nearby store window shattering to the pavement. It requires no more than this to release energies pent up by a lifetime of frus tration. However, these exer cises in violence occur only within the confines of the slums, and most participants content themselves with a lit tle looting. No sorties into white territory follow, if only because anyone who might attempt such an expedition knows he would be cut off, surrounded and decimated once he entered enemy ground. (White householders who arm themselves against a black invasion of their suburban homes underestimate black intelligence.) Ghetto rampages cannot be called “race riots,” at least not in the traditional understanding of that term, for they do not involve phys ical confrontations between one race and another. They are, rather, excursions in com munity vandalism having at least ‐ some insurrectionary overtones, for the chief tar gets are alien‐owned property inside the ghetto. Not all violence involves as saults on persons or prop erty. While human relation ships can range from amiable to abrasive, most people be come habituated to at least the appearance of civility. Therefore, when friction starts, those unprepared begin to find everyday life a more jar ring experience. Until very recently white Americans could take it for granted that their relations with blacks would move according to form. Blacks wore the appropriate mask in the white man's pres ence, smiling or deferential as the occasion warranted. This demeanor was itself evidence that whites were in control. The capacity to exact an ex pected countenance is an im pressive display of power. But black eyes no longer smile so readily. More and more blacks glare straight back, their expressions reflect ing insolence and contempt. This black gaze unsettles white sensibilities, undermin ing all traditional feelings of command. (To white liberals it is disturbing in a special way—individuals who profess sympathy for the black cause feel they should be exempted from such scornful glances.) The ways people look at, pass by, or brush against one an other always imply their re spective standings. The readi ness of blacks to say — with their eyes, their dress, their intonations—that they will no longer wear their old masks is a gauntlet thrown at white faces. Given the accustomed conventions, it is an act of violence. For all the erosion of black deference, expressions of black power are sporadic. The con sciousness of more than 20 million people does not change overnight. Nevertheless, the emergence of black pride has been surprisingly sudden, and for this reason real mobiliza tion may occur much sooner than current disorganization would suggest. But black Americans have yet to mount the kind of rebellion typical of a people victimized by alien oppressors. It is noteworthy —at least with the close of the nineteen‐sixties—how few acts of organized terror have been staged by blacks. Only a dozen or so young, committed men and women in any slum of several hundred thousand are required for a series of symbolic acts. Why, for example, have no white policemen been found in ghetto alleys or tenement hall ways, their throats slit ear to ear? (Of course, neighbors must be willing to shield the perpetrators, risking arrest, interrogation and imprison ment.) This sort of violence prevailed in Europe through out the German occupation, in Palestine during the British mandate and in Algeria prior to the French withdrawal. But it has yet to happen in New York's Harlem and Bedford Stuyvesant or Chicago's South and West Sides. Moreover, blacks in the South have had endless opportunities to fire shots at white sheriffs patrol ling rural roads. The failure of black America to produce even a score of men willing to display such resistance shows how strong are the controls which have held that race submissive for so long. Yet, given the contemporary ferment, the occurrence of symbolic terrorism becomes more and more likely. The very laws of chance — the emergence of 25 guerrilla war riors from among 25 million— hurtle in this direction. HITE America's re sponses can easily be predict ed. Unwilling to undergo either the emotional adjust ments or material sacrifices necessary to correct racial in equalities, whites will adhere to less costly alternatives: re treat, resistance, repression. Indeed, the white majority has already committed itself to a course whose effect, if not intention, will be to frustrate the most pressing of black aspirations. White wealth, white votes, plus the sheer preponderance of white numbers, will be used to pre serve the style of life white Americans have won for them selves in recent decades. The white population has nothing to gain and everything to lose by any significant alteration of the lines now separating the races. For if a single word characterizes white attitudes, it is fear. But how can a black mi nority, a small and impov erished segment of a huge so ciety, arouse such anxiety in 180 million hearts and minds? The threat, of course, lies not so much in the power blacks can deploy as in the vulner ability of whites when faced with the prospect of black proximity. Material prosperity, heightened status, enhanced schooling, increased articu lateness — none of these ad vantages have succeeded in dispelling white fears of the black presence. Indeed, the spread of affluence and edu cation actually serves to ex acerbate this disquiet. Indi viduals who have experienced recent elevations in status are the most easily frightened. Nightmares of racial inun dation alternate with prayer ful daydreams of blacks vol untarily reverting to earlier roles. Why don't they remain in their own parts of town instead of trying to push into places where they are not wanted? Why can't they send their children to the schools in their own neighborhoods rather than unsettle the en tire system with demands for altering traditional bounda ries? Why don't they work their own way up the eco nomic ladder instead of insist ing upon preferential con sideration? Why don't they teach their sons and daugh ters respect for law, order and authority? Underlying such meditations is the hope that they will cease their de mands and return to a status and psychology less threaten ing to white sensibilities. While these hopes linger in most white hearts, styles of expression differ. Conserva tives air their views with lit tle diffidence. Those profess ing a greatgr liberality must ponder such thoughts in si lence, for commitments to equality are now accompanied by fears of violence. Hence, the liberal wants blacks to stay in their ghettos, with the hope that they will be happy there. The conserva tive also favors such seques tration, but does not really care whether the blacks are happy in the ghetto or any where else. Hence, the end of all illu sions that black Americans may have harbored about an alliance with white liberalism. While liberals may extend verbal sympathy on appro priate occasions, they con tinue their exodus to the suburbs or the more secure portions of the city, they place their children in private schools and they ask fewer questions about the way the police guard them from pre sumptive criminals. Apart from rhetoric (“massive ex penditures” for rehabilitation of the ghettos, “crash pro grams” of job training), lit tle distinguishes the behavior of white liberals from that of their conservative neighbors. The latter express their ob duracy and animosity with a candor that may be frighten ing, but at least has the virtue of frankness. The scenario is all too fa miliar. A black couple enters a white neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon to inquire about purchasing a house or renting an apartment. This in itself is enough to arouse tremors, for such visitors are seen as heralds of an invasion. Every map of metropolitan America shows territory lost to the blacks: once one is let in, the rest will follow. Admit a black teacher or even a physician or engineer, and on his heels will arrive unwed mothers, drug addicts and adolescent gangs. To be sure, some white householders pro fess their desire to have a black family on their block and one or two well‐scrubbed and well ‐ mannered black youngsters in their own chil dren's classrooms. Tokens of this sort can be redeemed at the bank of conscience with compounded interest. (“Well, we have one four doors down from us.” “My daughter has one in her class.') Yet second thoughts often follow, for what begins as a magnani mous gesture can become an aperture through which a flood will rush. This is why the United States has no “in tegrated” neighborhoods to speak of, only “changing” ones. Thus, the tide moves on, sometimes slowly but always inexorably. Areas once im maculately white turn speck led and then black. The rear guard eventually flees, aban doning homes and schools in rapid disarray. But fewer and fewer hiding places remain. Having retreated to the city's outer reaches or into the adjacent suburbs, resettled homeowners may discover specks beginning to blemish the terrain they thought would be secure. Why this fear of black contagion? Part of the reason lies in attempts by white citizens to safeguard their modest material fortunes. A majority of Americans now own their own homes, or at least bear responsibility for discharging an unpaid mort gage. The graduation of so many to the rank of home owner has been widely ap plauded, for it was thought that attainment of this status would enhance identity and personal independence. Yet the burdens of ownership can be emotional as well as fi nancial: not only does a change in a neighborhood's racial composition threaten a lifetime's investment, but anxieties begin to take their toll well before the day of crisis actually arrives. Current preoccupations over status, economic loss and physical safety create and exacerbate racial antagonisms to a far greater degree than prevailed when people lacked so pro prietary an interest in their homes. HE majority of black Americans are poor. The poor est Americans are black, and even the most prosperous blacks are still poorer than great numbers of whites. If all 25 million black Americans were to be ranked by their incomes, every single individ ual on that list would have less money than his white counter part of parallel ranking. Thus, the black who stands 17,376, ‐289th among the 25 million blacks has a lower income than the white man standing 128,584,539th among the 184 million whites. The implications in these figures should be apparent. Racial integration of Ameri can neighborhoods would have to be class integration as well. If 50 blacks moved into any neighborhood now containing 370 whites, every one of these blacks would be poorer than at least some of the whites, and a majority of them would be poorer than any of their white neighbors. Very few Americans want to live among individuals of a class lower than their own. The disappearance of tradi tional tokens of status has caused a person's residence to become a critical measure of his social standing. The cas ual question, “Where do you live?” seeks not only infor mation about a person's tastes but also some approx imation of his class ranking. Where you live signals not only what you can afford but also whether you are headed up, down or marking time. To reside in a successful neighborhood is a symbol of personal success; to remain in one that is failing conveys a less joyous message. Few of us wish to risk an unfa vorable judgment. Those who live amid inferior classes jeopardize the image they pre sent to employers and asso ciates whose favor they may require. The very presence of poor people—especially poor blacks —unsettles middle‐class sensi bilities. Were neighborhoods to contain a mixture of races and classes, middle‐class in dividuals would find them selves living amid conditions they now manage to avoid. The poor reside in more crowded circumstances, often with several families inhabit ing a single‐family dwelling. (For this reason and because money is unavailable for other activities, they also spend more time on the sidewalks and street corners.) The poor have more fatherless families, more free‐wheeling children, and seem less committed to civil proprieties. And the poorer an area, the greater the incidence of drunkenness, drug addiction and violence both on and off the streets. Personal property and bodily safety are more vulnerable to depredations in less prosper ous settings, and police seem to feel that the poor deserve less protection or attention than do better‐off citizens. As blacks arrive in a dis trict and whites depart, such territory becomes more sus ceptible to burglary and as sault. Once even a few blacks begin to reside in an area, their faces become part of the local landscape and members of their race who are not resi dents find it easier to make criminal forays into that zone. Given this, middle‐class Ameri cans prefer to escape to neigh borhoods that are clean and secure. Moreover, the middle class has become quite fas tidious when confronted by violence: men who wear white collars and work at sedentary jobs have had little experi ence fighting, and for them the prospect of being mugged may be far more terrifying than for those who live and work in less prepossessing surroundings. This condition of mind pre cludes any possibility of estab lishing interclass — and cer tainly interracial — neighbor hoods. In the past, mixed neighborhoods were not to tally unknown. In small towns and parts of large cities, pri vate houses and tenements often stood side by side. But in those generations social controls were effective; the poor understood their place, and their presence held no threat to citizens of higher station. Such residential pat terns were possible because each neighbor appreciated where he ranked in the com munity, and he was aware that certain behavior would be deemed presumptuous for one of his income. But with the erosion of these controls, interclass living has become too great a gamble for the classes that have most to lose suchby integration. ND there are, of course, the children. A democracy's parents must fight to guaran tee the success of their chil dren just as the animals of the jungle struggle to protect their young. Most offspring of a democ racy arrive in the world with neither inherited wealth nor the promise of subsequent prosperity. If they are to pass the tests and secure the cre eentials that society requires of those who inhabit its upper reaches, then parental assist ance is necessary in the for mative years. Hence, the attempts to be stow on the children the ad vantages they will need in the competitions to come. Anxious and often obsessive attention becomes focused on the right school, the right college, the right course of study, the right career. In the upper middle classes only an irresponsible handful fails to attend par ents' meetings. They come not so much to check up on the school and its teachers—al though that motive is often present — as to pledge their allegiance to an institution that promises‐to ensure their children's ascent to a more elevated status. A democracy's children must be taught to avoid improper associations if they are to emerge as successful adults in a competitive society. But such an education can only be achieved in a good school in a good neighborhood — white middle‐class school in white middle‐class neighbor hood. Unless properly shielded from injurious influences, ev ery boy and girl is a candidate for the nether world of fail ures. (For one's offspring to have failed, moreover, be comes a commentary on the parents' ability to carry out the enterprise of child‐rear ing.) Adults who have made modest progress toward new plateaus know from their own upbringing the consequences of misguided associations. They realize how slum environ ments and inferior schools can nullify a youngster's pros pects. Hence, the frantic effort of white Americans to insulate their sons and daughters from the presence of subordinate classes. The fear is of con tagion; the disease is failure. Because of the separation of races and classes, a gen eration of white children has been raised overhearing end less discussions concerning the gap that divides black from white and poor from prosperous. Most of these children have been reared in white neighborhoods and at tended white schools, facts that further instill in them the idea that races belong apart. Even if their parents refrain from lecturing them on the results of admitting blacks to their schools and neighbor hoods, white boys and girls overhear enough to become convinced that such incursions would have baneful conse quences. The racial attitudes of today's children — tomor row's adults — become in grained at an early age; out looks implanted during these years may not be extirpated after the beginning of adult hood. There is little reason, then, to believe that oncoming gen erations of white Americans will display more tolerance than did their parents. For all the espousals of human equality and racial brother hood heard from adolescents and young adults, they will in time assume responsibili ties that will preclude the fulfillment of these vows. They, like their elders before them, will become burdened with families, mortgages and careers. The comforts and pleasures of possessions will make them less than eager to undergo sacrifices for the sake of others, and anxieties over the advancement of their own offspring will send them to the safety of all‐white sub urbs. Given the opportunities they will grasp and the lives they will lead, it is impossible to see how tomorrow's adult generation will differ from to day's. The proximity of con taminating races and classes would certainly threaten their status and security no less than it has their parents'. And the conversations their children will overhear may well be marked by bitterness and fear. F course, conditions can change. But change can take the direction of increasing tension, rising animosity and exacerbated conflict. Anyone who argues that tomorrow's Americans will act more salu briously in matters of race and class must show that the future will somehow exempt these individuals from the strains and anxieties that at tend child ‐ raising, career building and competition for social success. If people are to be more relaxed about their surroundings and less pre occupied with their personal status and safety, then the structure and psychology of the nation will have to under go deep‐seated changes. Oth erwise, the growth of racial amity will remain a wishful forecast rather than a reality. The white retreat will be accompanied by efforts at re sistance and repression. As criminal violence, riots and guerrilla activity become more frequent, white Americans will seek to maintain order by force. Police will be grant ed an even wider latitude in their enforcement procedures and will not have to answer for their methods. New cen ters of incarceration will be built, new weaponry invented and distributed to accommo date the assumption that ev ery black man between the ages of 15 and 35 may be considered a presumptive crim inal. No explanation will need to be given for detaining citi zens of such race and age, for in the eyes of white so ciety the statistical probabili ties demonstrate that enough individuals in these categories will sooner or later run afoul of the law or jeopardize pub lic order. These assumptions will in flict unjust punishments on many innocent blacks simply because they are members of a group having an above average record of criminal convictions. But the burden will be placed on each black man to prove his innocence of any wrongdoing — past, present, or future. And his consignment to jail, with or without much attention to the evidence, will be regarded as the removal of one more mis creant from society's streets. And having concluded that official agencies can no longer guarantee protection, more and more citizens of both races will purchase guns. Wom en's purses, executives' at taché cases and automobiles' glove compartments will hold such weapons, as will the drawers of bedside tables in countless homes across the country. As more people own guns, the use of firearms will inevitably increase, accom panied by the plea of “self defense.” Judges and juries will find themselves under growing pressure to render verdicts of “justifiable homi cide,” particularly in cases where white householders take the lives of black intruders. HETHER construed as a state of siege or a condition of civil war, strains between the races will suffuse all as pects of the nation's life. The resentments harbored by black Americans have yet to erupt in full expression; the genera tion of young blacks now emerging will mount demands that white America cannot possibly accommodate; and society's conventional instru ments of amelioration will prove both inadequate and irrelevant as both races react in an atmosphere of tension and fright. What scares and frustrates white Americans most, how ever, is their knowledge that racial arrangements are no longer under control. After 10 generations of submission, blacks now display anger and arrogance that white society can neither command nor un derstand. Thus, black behavior must be seen as an exercise of power—psychological and physical as well as political— which American society never anticipated. The riots, rob beries and assaults, even the modes of dress and contemp tuous stares with which blacks meet white glances, are all symbols of racial uprising. As much a mood as a movement, as much guerrilla war as par tisan maneuvering, black pow er has already achieved its greatest victory: the demorali zation of white society. The awareness that blacks can no infiger be ruled by hitherto effective controls has under mined white self ‐ confidence. Repression will surely follow. But the use‐of force will only be a frantic quest for protec tion and survival by a people whose morale has been shat tered by the surfacing of an inequality that was always in herent in our society. ■

726-> Morton Scores Democrats' TV Time
WASHINGTON, July 16 — Representative Rogers C. B. Morton, the Republican Nation al Chairman, accused the Dem ocrats today of “trying to de stroy” the country and Presi dent Nixon by demanding equal television time to answer Mr. Nixon's reports to the na tion. “When you begin to try to destroy the country by making the Presidency a partisan thing, you're in deep trouble,” Mr. Morton told a news conference. The Republican chairman has petitioned the Federal Com munications Commission for equal time to respond to the half‐hour program that the Democratic National Chair man, Lawrence F. O'Brien, pre sented on the Columbia Broad casting System network last week. It was the first of four scheduled Democratic broad casts called “The Loyal Oppo sition.” Mr. Morton said he would not have objected to the broad cast if it had featured Demo cratic Congressional leaders, rather than the party chair man. However, his ground rules appeared to exclude all such leaders except Speaker John W. McCormack. Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Senate majority leader; Ed ward M. Kennedy of Massachu setts, the Senate majority whip, and all leaders of the House except Mr. McCormack are up for re‐election. Thus, if they were given free television time, the industry would also have to provide it for their oppo nents. Speaker McCormack, who is 78 years old, has announced he will not seek re‐election from Massachusetts in the fall. In response to a question, Mr. Morton said that the Speaker would be “a perfectly logical person to have do it.” In an effort to demonstrate that President Nixon had re ceived from the networks com parable or less television time than did his two Democratic predecessors, Representative Morton listed these total figures for the first 18 months of the three Administrations: President Kennedy, 50 appearances for 25 hours 16 min utes; President Johnson, 35 ap pearances for 11 hours 39 min utes; President Nixon, 40 ap pearances for 13 hours 19 min utes. Figures showing only expo sure in prime time told a differ ent story, however. They were: President Kennedy, 4 appear ances for 1 hour 55 minutes; President Johnson, 7 appear ances for 3 hours 11 minutes;, President Nixon, 15 appearances for 6 hours 10 minutes. Mr. Morton flatly accused the Columbia Broadcasting System of joining forces with the Dem ocratic party. “They've decided to go the Democratic route,” he said of the network. “I want them to do it honestly, to say, ‘We're going to champion the Demo cratic party.’ I don't want them to evade that, to sweep that under the rug.” In a letter sent Mr. Morton yesterday, Robert V. Evans, vice president and general coun sel of C.B.S., said that the net work respectfully rejected the Republican request for equal time and planned to continue, providing “fairness and balance, in the treatment of public is sues” by giving free time to the Democratic National Committee for whatever party spokesmen it designated. Mr. Morton said that if the Federal Communications Com mission rejected the Republican petition, the National Commit tee might sue in Federal Court to overturn the decision. WASHINGTON, July 16 (AP) —Legislation to cut the high cost of political campaigning by putting a ceiling on major candidates' radio and television bugdets was approved today by the House Commerce Com mittee. The House bill would cover state primaries and campaigns for Governor and Lieutenant Governor as well as the general campaigns for President, Vice President and Congress, which are covered in a bill already passed by the Senate. The two major Presidential candidates in 1972 would be limited to about $5.1‐million each for radio and television advertising under the formula in both bills. Other major candi dates' spending would be limited to $20,000 or 7 cents for each vote cast for the office involved in the last elec tion, whichever was highest. Budgets for primary cam paigns would be limited to half the figure computed for gen eral election campsigns.

727-> Graham Deplores Distortion of Patriotism
The Rev. Billy Graham, who opens a five‐day crusade to night at Shea Stadium, deplores widespread identification of patriotism with the political right. “I think we nave allowea pa triotism to slip,” he said in an interview on the eve of the cru sade. “We have allowed the word ‘patriotism’ to get into the hands of some right‐wing ers.” The 51‐year‐old evangelist called for more confidence in American political institutions and asserted that patriotic sym bols such as the flag are the property of all Americans. “I don't guess anybody loves the flag more than some of the people that are against the war,” he said. Mr. Graham is returning to New York a year after a 10‐day crusade in Madison Square Garden that drew 230,000 peo ple, of whom nearly 11,000 made “decisions for Christ.” The sponsoring committee of local churchmen hopes that this week's event, which ends Sun day afternoon, will attract as many as 300,000. In other remarks, Mr. Gra ham described his relationship with President Nixon as strictly a “friendship” with no political overtones. He praised Sunday morning church services in the White House, because they per mit the President to hear “a cross‐section of preachers.” Reflecting on his own 21 years of national prominence, the Baptist preacher attributed his popularity primarily to the fact that he is a symbol of “authoritative faith that works” irt an era of religious uncer tainty. “We don't have too many people that really believe in anything,” he said. “We've be come a nation of skeptics and doubters. And to me the whole thing is a package all neatly wrapped up.” Mr. Graham said that al though doubt is “very normal” for most persons, including de vout Christians, he had not had a single doubt about his faith since 1949. At that time, he said, “I went through a great period of doubt and settled it on my knees.” The evangelist said the forth coming “Honor America Day” celebration in Washington on July 4 was consistent with his nonpolitical role. He is a co sponsor of the event, along with Bob Hope, the comedian. Among those endorsing the event, which will be high lighted by a mass rally and fireworks display at the Wash ington Monument, are former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman; Law rence F. O.'Brien and Rogers C. B. Morton, respectively, the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican National Com mittees. Mr. Graham said that the idea had emerged from a con versation he had some weeks ago with Hobart D. Lewis, president and editor in chief of Reader's Digest, in which they agreed that it would be a good idea to “try to get every body together and say, We believe in the institutions of America.” The evangelist said that Mr. Lewis called him a week later and asked if he would be will ing to join Mr. Hope in organiz ing such a program. “I said yes, and I called Bob Hope, and the more we talked, the more enthusiastic could see that Bob was about it,” the evangelist said. “And I said, ‘Bob, let's keep it up away from the war. This is not pro‐war or antiwar. Let's make it for all America.’” Mr. Graham declined to dis cuss President Nixon's recent appointments of Henry Cabot Lodge as his personal envoy to the. Vatican, on the ground that he was not familiar with the reasons for the move. He said that the President “has never discussed it with me.” Reflecting on his position as a national religious leader, Mr. Graham observed that as he grows older he is becoming more and more aware of the responsibilities he bears. “I feel that God has given me the ear of the masses of people and a place of leadership and that I must be very careful that I lead in the right direc tion,” he said. The preacher said that if he had his career to begin over again, he would do “less speak ing and more studying.” “I've done too many dedica tions, too many favors for friends that have taken my time, rather than keeping to my main targets,” he said. “Every body's asking you for something all the time.” Mr. Graham said that he would now have “far more to give” if he had spent more time in study, especially read ing the Bible. “I wish that knew the Bible a great deal more,” he said. The evangelist said that he expected to spend an increas ing, amount of time talking to seminarians, but he added that his own lack of seminary training was not necessarily re grettable. “God says we have to be come as little children, and try to keep my faith simple like a child,” he said. “Maybe this is one of the great blessings of having never gone to a semi nary. I didn't have much to doubt.”

730-> Lindsay Says Nixon Administration Is Moving U.S. Backward
Mayor Lindsay yesterday challenged the rhetoric and the priorities of the Nixon Adminis tration. “We are retreating into the seventies,” he said. “Televised glimpses of young men dying in combat raise fewer protests as the months go by. The gen tle poetry of “Black and white together, we shall overcome no longer moves us to march. While we desperately need commitment, our mood is pas sive.” In a soberly delivered ad dress before an audience of women who seemed totally un aware of the political implica tions of Mr. Lindsay's remarks. the Mayor said the following things: ¶Rebuked as “a strategy of surrender to our most regres sive impulses” the Nixon nomi nation of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court. ¶Challenged what he said was a belief that “we can coin fort our conscience by citing the economic progress of some of the poor—and forget the al ;most total lack of progress in the inner city and in depressed rural areas as well.” ¶Denounced Federal spending patterns in housing and trans portation as disastrous for the ciities. The Mayor spoke in his role as author of “The City,” a just published book that ties togerher many of the themes and the words from his re‐election cam paign. His address was delivered at a book and author luncheon in the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel, sponsored by Book World. Mr. Lindsay tried out on the audience a few self‐deprecating jokes left over from his off‐the record act last Saturday at the lampoon dinner of the Inner Circle, the organization of pre sent and past political reporters. But the jokes floated laugh lessly past the audience of 1,000, most of them women dressed as for a bridge or a suburban women's club tea. So the mayor swung back to his text and stuck to it almost word for word. Mr. Lindsay's aides explained later on a rain‐splashed ride back downtown to City Hall that the mayor had been aiming not so much at the Nixon Administration as at the cur rent “dominant political philo sophy” of disengagement from society's problems. He singled out for a scornful aside the “benign neglect” phrase used by Daniel Patrick Mcynihan, a Nixon assistant, in a memorandum. And the Mayor alluded to the phraseology of the inaugural address of the man who beat Mr. Nixon in 1960—John F. Kennedy — in criticizing Mr. Nixcn's priorities by saying: “We have opened the decade by telling only the poorest among us to ask what they can do for their country. “How else can we describe the portions divided between city and country, between do mestic needs and military de mands?” Mr. Lindsay picked up a theme from his book—that the Fed eral or mortgage loans of re cent decades had built the suburbs while starving the cities—and added: “This year the Federal Gov ernment plans to spend only 4 per cent of its transportation funds on mass transit for the cities—and 96 per cent on high ways that run through and be tween them under a cloud of poisonous gases. “For schools and health and environmental protection, state and Federal funds are rising— but at a feeble rate that does not even keep pace with infla tion. “We are not standing pat. We are falling back.”

Weberg of Juneau, Alaska, to be the Deputy United States Com missioner on the North Pa cific Fur Seal Commission. Mr. Weberg will succeed John I. Hodges of the Department of the Interior. The President met in the morning with his Cabinet and received an in terim report from the Council of Environmental Quality. He signed buls amending the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 and the Retirement Tax Act to make permanent the existing temporary program of supplemental annuities to encourage retirement of eli gible railroad workers at age 65. He also approved a bill requiring the Civil Service Commission to prepare a plan for a coordinated sys tem of job evaluation and position classification for the executive branch.

736-> Frazier Upset by Training Setup at the Felt Forum
A distressed Joe Frazier began the final two weeks of training in the Felt Forum yesterday for his heavyweight bout with Jimmy Ellis. Frazier was unhappy with the facilities at the Forum, which is five floors below the main arena of Madison Square Garden, where the bout will be staged on Feb. 16. The speed bag Frazier was punching was erected too high on a canopied platform. Not only did Frazier have to stand on some boards to reach the bag properly, but he was worried that the roof that supported the bag would crash down on him. “You gonna have a funeral around here, not a fight,” Frazier yelled to Madison Square Garden officials. “We'll fix it, baby, we'll fix it,” said his manager‐+ trainer‐adviser, Yank Durham, who sees his job for the next two weeks as soothing his tiger. “Oh, let's get this over with. Why don't we go to a gym and train?” Frazier asked Durham. Assured everything would be custom‐built to his satis faction, Frazier, grunting and snorting, pounded the bag and then shadow‐boxed be fore 30 fans. The Garden is allowing all purchasers of tickets for the bout to watch the workouts free of charge. “This will fix up boxing,” said Joe Louis. “The public wants one champion. The only thing is, what will hap pen after this match? Who is the winner going to fight?” Frazier, the cocky Phila delphian, is recognized as the titleholder in New York and five other states. Ellis is the World Boxing Association champion. The bout has been taking on more and more va lidity with the fans, especial ly since Cassius Clay con tends he is through with boxing. Ellis and Frazier will stage separate workouts tomorrow in the House Office Building in Washington, before mem bers of Congress. The move is seen as an attempt by the Garden to elevate the heavy‐+ weight championship once again to its status as an American institution, ranking up there with apple pie. For the next two weeks, Frazier will work out at 1:30 P.M. at the Forum, and Ellis will go on view at 3 P.M. After yesterday's workout, in which there was little sparring, Durham fielded questions from the audience. “What round you going to take him in?” asked one spec tator. “Simple,” said Durham. “From one to 15.” “When are you gonna take on Clay?” asked another. “We're only talking about Ellis now,” said Durham with a smile. In preparing for the bout Durham said he and Frazier will talk a lot the next two weeks. Durham theoretically takes the role of Frazier when discussing ring strategy. “I'm going to say to him, ‘I move to my right when he does this, I throw the left hook when he does that.’ Then Joe tries to catch me in a mistake. This way, I take the pressure off him thinking of fighting Ellis. It's me who's fighting Ellis, and he can think about the fight objec tively.”

738-> New York Electoral Reform
Mayor Lindsay may well be right—and we believe he is—in insisting that systematic discrimination against potential voters of the sort sometimes encoun tered in sections of the South simply does not exist in New York City. Even so, the failure of the city and the state to enact more enlightened election laws causes voter turnouts to be distressingly low and this failure may now result in three of the city's five boroughs being considered in the same category with the most oppressive Southern jurisdictions. This is hardly a happy prospect. State election laws need immediate reform to encourage voter registra tion and voter participation. City officials must dem onstrate a vigorous commitment to electoral reforms, such as those suggested the other day by Mayor Lindsay's law task force. Several of these proposed reforms deserve special attention. The anachronistic Board of Elections, too frequently a resting place for elderly party faithful, should be abolished as the task force recommends and replaced by a nonpartisan election commission. Efection personnel should be selected not on the basis of party fealty but sheer merit. This reform requires a state constitutional amendment. The present session of the State Legislature should start one on the way to ratification. Voter registration could be made simpler and easier by legislative enactment. Convenient places for reg istration ought to be provided—some reformers have suggested using post offices—and the process voter registration ought to be conducted not season ally but year‐round. There is urgency in another, area of election law. An oversight in providing for primaries has opened the prospect of distinctly minority candidates emerg ing as victors when the field is crowded. State law should provide for run‐off primaries when no candi date in a crowded field receives as much as 40 per cent of the vote. Similarly, there should be some provision for run‐off elections. New York is not the Deep South. There have been no cases of physical intimidation reported here recently. Neither, however, is it a place of particu laily high voter participation. It is not; but it should be. And if the state's election laws are reformed, it would be.

739-> Menotti's First Play Presented in Florida
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 23—For 20 years Gian Carlo Menotti has been harboring the idea of “The Leper.” At first he planned this work on the theme of minorities as an opera, but two years ago he decided to write it as a play because it was be coming “too intellectual and philosophical.” Although Mr. Menotti has written many theater pieces —operas, ballets and even a libretto for an opera, “Va nessa,” by his friend, Samuel Barber — “The Leper” is his first play. To underscore the significance of the occasion, Florida State University pre sented the premier here last night as the centerpiece of its 1970 Fine Arts Festival and the opening of its Fine Arts Building. While Earth Day was being observed on other parts of the campus, the arts were also getting a large measure of attention. At a noon con vocation, Aubrey Wood, a literary agent and friend of such playwrights as Tennes see Williams, Robert Ander son, William Inge and Tru man Capote, received an hon orary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, and Mr. Williams was here for the ceremony. In the afternoon there was a faculty concert that included a composition by Efrem Zimbalist Jr., the actor. For him this was a reunion with Mr. Menotti, since he served 20 years ago as co‐producer of the latter's biggest oper atic success, “The Consul.” To round out the senti mental reunion, Chandler Cowles undertook to produce “The Leper,” and Patricia Neway appeared in a leading role. Mr. Cowles co‐produced not only “The Consul” but also a number of other Me notti works, and Miss Neway, who is an opera singer as well as an actress, was the un forgettable Magda, the princi pal role in “The Consul.” When he began composing operas to his own librettos in the 1930's, Mr. Menotti wrote in Italian and then translated his text into English, but “The Leper,” like his more recent librettos, was written in Eng lish. “The Leper,” which Mr. Menotti himself directed here with a large student cast, except for three professionals —Frank Phelan and Jack Sy dow in addition to Miss Neway—is an effort on Mr. Menotti's part Eto remind the minority that they all must finally become a constructive element of society and not only the challengers and de stroyers—hardly a fashion able point of view today.” Explaining why “The Leper” became a play rather than an opera, Mr. Menotti said, “The more I thought about the theme, the more subtle and intellectualized it became. Opera is an emotion al form. I wanted this work to be more philosophical. It just didn't lend itself to music.” There are, however, scattered bits of music, com posed, naturally, by Mr. Me notti. A single flute plays forlornly in the distance, or a majestic choral passage is heard offstage. At the play's tragic end, a choral fragment in liturgical style envelops the play and the theater like a shattering threnody. Which leads one to wonder whether this play, set in a 12th‐century city state east of Byzantium might not have been enlarged by music. Mr. Menotti obviously foresaw this question. In a program note he wrote: “When I write operas, un sympathetic critics are apt to say that they are not operas but plays with music. Now that I have written a play, won't be surprised if some of them say that it is not a play but an opera without music. Evidently many people don't know what an opera is (or perhaps I do not know what a play is). “I must recognize, how ever, that there is a grain of truth in both criticisms, for in operas of other con temporary composers I often miss the valid dramatic ten sion of a play, and in most modern plays, I miss the emotional grandeur and sweep of music. “It is not an easy task to combine these elements, by injecting lifelike dramatic tension in an opera, one runs the risk of becoming pro saic—and in looking for emo tional grandeur in a play, one can easily become pom pous and lethargic.” “The Leper” is not pom pous or lethargic, though its style and diction are delib erately old‐fashioned and of ten melodramatic. It held its audience here, and it was re markably well performed by the professionals and students against an impressive set de signed by Holmes Easley. Mr. Menotti's masque, “The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore,” and his operas, “Amelia Goes to the Ball” and “Help! Help! The Globo links,” are also being per formed during the festival. Among other events are lec tures, exhibitions of Karl Zerbe's paintings and light sculptures by Allen Erdman, Edward Jankowski and Charles Waldeck and a pro duction of two short plays, “Big Sur” and “Marionettes,” by Frank Gagliano, university playwright‐in‐residence,

740-> Federal Legislation On Airport Thievery Is Being Considered
The United States Treasury Department has under consid eration proposed legislation de signed to prevent theft from airports and'seaports, Assistant Secretary of Treasury Eugene T. Rossides said last night. In a speech at the 10th an nual consular dinner of the Commerce and Industry Asso ciation of New York and the World Trade Club of New York, at the Plaza Hotel, Mr. Rosside: said that “theft of international cargo has shown alarming growth,” affecting, he said, “all major trading nations.” He gave no details of the proposed legislation, but said “it would be available for re view in the near future.” Several hours before Mr Rossides spoke, the Federal Bureau of Investigation an nounced the arrest of two more men in connection with the theft of cameras—insured for more than $6,000 — last year from Kennedy International Airport. The two men were identified as Joseph John Baudanza, 25 years old, of 2483 West 16th Street, and Harold Charles Rothenberg, 32, of 2312 West 13th Street, both, Brooklyn. Mr. Baudanza was described as tree surgeon and a supervisor for the City Department of Parks. The two were allegedly in volved in stealing the camera shipment from the Pan America World Airways cargo terminal in March, 1969. On Tuesday, four other men were arrested in connection with the same case.

741-> RECOVERY IS SEEN FOR U.S. ECONOMY
WASHINGTON, April 15— One of the top Nixon Admin istration economic officials said today that “the worst part of the slowing of economic activity appears to be behind us” and that economy is ap parently “at the threshhold of moving upward once again.” This assessment, the most definite of its kind to date, came from Maurice Mann, as sistant director of the Bureau of the Budget, who has a lead ing role in economic policy making. Mr. Mann gave his views in a speech to the Na tional Association of Chain Drug Stores in Bal Harbour, Fla., the text of which was made available here. He said that “as the economy begins to move forward in the months ahead, the advance must be kept in moderation.” Thus he emphasized that “the Administration is particularly concerned about achieving a surplus in the Federal budget for the 1971 fiscal year.” If Congress enacts the chief proposals of President Nixon following the big postal and other Government pay increases —a 10‐cent first class postage stamp and a speedup in col lections of estate and gift taxes —Mr. Mann said, “you should know that the numbers we are looking at today still show a small budget surplus in fiscal year 1971, as well as in 1970.” Mr. Mann said the conse quences of achieving a budget surplus “extend far beyond the initial economic impact.” A slipping back into deficit, he continued, “would raise all the familiar and basic questions about fiscal responsibility, fis cal integrity and fiscal credi bility” and would “have a ma jor influence on the psychology of the public at large as well as in financial markets.” On the general situation of the economy, Mr. Mann said, “while there are likely to be some unfavorable statistics in the weeks ahead—reports on events already passed—it now appears that the time may not be far away for the economy to resume an upward course.” But he disclosed that the gross national product, after correct ing for higher prices, “apparently declined somewhat more (in the first quarter) than in the fourth quarter of 1969.” Mr. Mann stressed that “the economy needs to go through a period of adjustment of suf ficient dimension to permit the forces of inflation to be elim inated from the structure of the economy.” But he added: “it now seems that the setting in of a cumulative downward movement in economic activity —the type of downward move ment that feeds on itself—is highly unlikely.” Much the same points were made in a separate speech to day, by Harold C. Passer, As sistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, though Mr. Passer concentrated on the inflation problem. He said, “al though inflation has not yet been curbed, the first goal in our economic policy—stopping the acceleration in prices—has been attained.” To curb inflation, he said, “does not require that the econ omy go into a recession.” It requires only, he added, that total output be kept for a while somewhat below the economy's capacity to produce.

743-> Senate Approves Ban on Mailing of Unsolicited Credit Cards
WASHINGTON, March 15 — The Senate passed today a bill to outlaw the issuance of un solicited credit cards. In doing so, it brushed aside objections of the Nixon Administration and Federal banking authorities. The vote was 79 to 1, with Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, dissenting for un specified reasons. The measure, which would take effect six months after enactment, now goes to the House with appar ently favorable prospects of passage. If enacted, the ban would supersede a pending Federal Trade Commission regulation that does not cover banks or common carriers. The regula tion is effective May 18. The bill, sponsored by Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, also goes beyond the F.T.C. order by limiting to $50 the liability of consumers for unauthorized charges against stolen or lost cards. The New York State Legisla ture has passed legislation to bar the distribution of credit cards unless specifically reques ted in writing. The measure is awaiting action by Governor Rockefeller. As a possible alternative, the State Senate has passed a bill to prohibit the issuance of un ordered cards unless 30 days' notice is given to the prospec tive recipient. If the House also passes it, the Governor will have a choice between the two measures. A ban on unsolicited credit cards is opposed by the Nixon Administration, the Federal Reserve Board and the Fed eral Deposit Insurance Corpora tion on the ground that it would give an unfair competi tive advantage to banks and other financial organizations that have already won millions of customers over the last few years by massive mailings or unordered cards. Reversing itself after favor ing a ban, the President's Com mittee on Consumer Interests urged Congress last December to postpone action pending further study. The committee is headed by Mrs. Virginia Knauer, special Presidential as sistant for consumer affairs. The Senate bill seeks to meet the unfair competition ar guments by prohibiting the re newal of previously issued un solicited cards without the holder's authorization. Action by the Senate and the Federal Trade Commission was spurred by numerous com plaints from consumers who re sented the inconvenience of re turning or destroying unwant ed cards and who feared that misdirected, lost or stolen cards would be used by un authorized persons. While it is doubtful that a court would hold a consumer liable for purchases made on a card he never received, the misdirection, theft or loss of cards in the mail can be troublesome to the intended re cipient. He must establish that he did not use the card, and this sometimes is difficult and exasperating when the issuer maintains a computerized bill ing system that is not always sensitive to human rights. The amount of “plastic” credit extended annually — so called because the cards are made of plastic — has risen to $13‐billion, mainly as the re sult of unsolicited cards mailed out by banks since 1967. Bank cards accounted for $1.7‐billion of the outstanding credit last June. This was more than twice the amount out standing at the end of 1967.

744-> Sound of Deflating Footballs Accentuates Gloom in Vikings' Dressing Room
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 11— Joe Kapp's tan suit was hang ing on a hook in the corner of the dressing room, but the Minnesota quarterback was out in a trainer's room having his injured left shoulder inspected. He is expected to take X‐rays tomorrow morning before fly. ing home. The only sound in Kapp's corner of the clubhouse was the hissing sound of escaping air. Bobby Lee, the bright, young punter‐quarterback was letting the air out of his footballs, to make it easier to ship them, home to Minnesota. The defla tion of the footballs seemed the final act for the Vikings, who had been similarly punctured by the Kansas City Chiefs all afternoon. “All that work.” Lee mut tered, “and this is the way its ends.” It was sure over. The score was 23‐7 and the defeat included one injured quarter back, “Hennepin Joe” Kapp, this year's magnetic personality of Super Week, the man who was to Minneapolis's Hennepin Avenue what Joe Namath was to Broadway. But when Aaron Brown of Kansas City clobbered Kapp with four minutes to go, the season was over, and painfully. As the Vikings trudged off the field, 39 of them hunched their shoulders against the scattered boos of the fans, but Kapp did not seem to hear. He was close to crying from the pain and he needed support as he stumbled toward the club house. Then he disappeared in to the trainer's room. “It's the left shoulder,” said Coach Bud Grant. “It's not dislocated and they don't think it's broken, but they'll need X‐rays anyway. Joe's in too much pain to talk.” The rest of the Vikings had their psychic pains, but they tried to talk about the loss. The front line of the defense, so magnificent all season, was asked about Kansas City's di versified offense. “I don't think they hurt us mentally,” said Alan Page. “We knew about their forma tions. They were one of the most physical teams we've faced. They came out tough right from the start. “We weren't surprised about any thing. We were told it would take our best effort to beat them.” There was some question whether the Vikings had shown their best effort. Coach Grant said, “Maybe we could play better tomorrow, but today we played as well as we could.” The coach praised Len Daw son, the Kansas City quarter back, calling him “underrated among so many stars.” Grant said he hadn't gone for a field goal from the Chiefs' 41‐yard line early in the game because of a strong wind against the Vikings. While Grant was talking, an assistant flitted into the club house and gathered all of Kapp's clothes. They dressed the quarterback in the private room in the back and sent him to their hotel to rest. Although he couldn't meet the press, Kapp later relayed a few of his remarks through his publicity man. “The Kansas City defensive line looked like a redwood for est,” he said. “I don't remem ber that one individual stood out—they were all very active. They took the running game away from us. We went into the game wanting to run the ball, and they were able to take it all away with a great defen sive play. “The big thing was the fact that we couldn't come up with the big play when we had to. That's what got us here, but we couldn't do it today.”

745-> Muskie Hints Slogan in '72 May Be the ‘Whole Society’
WASHINGTON, June 3 (UPI) —Senator Edmund S. Muskie, in a speech today outlining the political path to victory for Democrats this November, struck what may be his own Presidential campaign slogan in 1972—the “whole society.” In an address before the United Transportation Union, Senator Muskie, the Democratic Vice‐Presidential candidate in 1968, told the union leaders, “A whole society can be built only if all of us practice the tol erance, understanding and com passion that are the founda tions of the Democratic party.” One of the lessons learned in the 1968 Presidential cam paign, he said, was that “ac commodation—on both sides— is essential to victory.” The Maine Democrat added that the basic issue before the voters this November “is whether America is willing to recommit its energies to seek ing a whole society, and a livable environment.

746-> EARLY A.B.A. VOICE ON COURT IS ASKED
WASHINGTON, May 17 — Attorney General John N. Mitchell was urged today by the American Bar Association's Committee on the Federal Judi ciary to consult with leaders of the legal profession in the fu ture before recommending per sons to the President for nomination to the Supreme Court. The committee said in a spe cial report on its role in Su preme Court selections that the Attorney General could drop a prospective nominee “with less embarrassment” if questions about his legal qualifications were discovered before the President named him to the Court. Mr. Mitchell has been criti cized for not finding out more about Judge Clement F. Hayns worth Jr. and Judge G. Harrold Carswell before the President nominated them to the Supreme Court. Both were rejected by the Senate after questions were raised about their legal qualifi cations or judicial actions. In its report, the A.B.A. group said that it did not in tend to criticize Mr. Mitchell personally, but only to state its disagreement with President Nixon's policy of not consulting with the committee before nam ing persons to the Supreme Court. Under the present pro cedure, the Senate Judiciary Committee requests the A.B.A. group's opinion of a nom inee's professional qualifica tions, which is given at the Senate hearings. The committee's role in pass ing upon Supreme Court nom inees has embroiled the group in growing controvery; some recent nominations have been strongly opposed. Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson gave the committee about 24 hours advance notice before nominating persons, and today's report stressed that even that was not enough. It argued that Mr. Mitchell should tell the committee who he was likely to recommend to the President in time to let the group check out the candidate's reputation in legal circles for ability, integrity and judicial temperament. Under the present system, when the committee inquires about men who have already been named to the high court the report said that “some of the best informed and most re sponsible persons are reluctant to be critical in even their pri vate comments about the nom inees.” With prior notice, the com mittee said, it could unearth ob jections in advance and permit any unqualified candidate to be quietly dropped. But if a candi date were given the A.B.A. group's approval and was later opposed on political or ideo logical grounds, any attacks on his professional competence or integrity would be undercut, the committee argued. It asserted that the secrecy of the President's choice could be preserved, perhaps by check ing several possible nominees simultantously. The committee's report was sent by its chairman, Lawrence E. Walsh of New York, to the association's board of govern ors, which will meet here next Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for the Justice Department said today that Mr. Walsh, accompanied by Bern ard G. Segal, president of the bar association, would meet with Mr. Mitchell next week to discuss the proposed new pro cedure. But the spokesman add ed that it was President Nixon and not Mr. Mitchell who an nounced that the bar associa tion would not be consulted on Supreme Court nominees. In today's report, the com mittee said that its future in vestigations of Supreme Court nominees would follow the pat tern of Its check on Judge Harry A. Blackmun. Many judges, lawyers, law professors and law students will he con sulted, and nominees will be classified as either meeting “high standards of integrity, judicial temperament and pro fessional competence,” “not op posed,” or “not qualified.”

748-> 2 Women Who Decided on Abortions, but for Different Reasons
At 44, Mary Smith is an attractive, honey‐haired housewife who has been married close to 20 years and is the mother of two sons, John, 18, and Eric, 17, to whom she is obviously devoted. Hers is a close marriage, made more so, perhaps, by Eric's defective heart, a condition that has plagued the boy since birth. Her husband, John, is a dentist. The family (the names have been changed) live in an old but attractive house in the Douglaston section of Queens. Last week, Mrs. Smith went to see her obstetrician for the first time in some years. “I'm either pregnant or in menopause, and in either case, I need you,” she said. Once the diagnosis was made, Mrs. Smith was sure. “I'm too old to start again with a baby,” she told her doctor. “I don't have the patience. I want an abortion.” Friday afternoon, Mrs. Smith packed an overnight bag, and her husband drove her to Flower & Fifth Avenue Hospitals, Fifth Avenue at 106th Street, where she was admitted for a therapeutic abortion. After she registered, she was taken to a private room on the fifth floor at 4:30 P.M. She had a light hospital dinner at which she picked, chatted with her husband until visiting hours were over, and then settled down with “a dirty novel,” Jacqueline Susann's latest book. “I've got hospitalitis,” she had confided to her husband earlier. “I'm nervous because it's an operation, and I'm ashamed because three of my closest friends are going through menopause. It seems so stupid to be pregnant at my age.” “I don't think I'm selfish not to want a baby at my age,” she said thoughtfully. “I just don't think I could cope, especially after going through all of the worrying about Eric. I don't think I could take worrying that the baby might not be all right.” Interruptions in Sleep Throughout the night, Mrs. Smith slept fitfully, both because of her surroundings and the numerous interruptions for tests, temperature‐taking, blood pressure and other hospital procedures. Missing breakfast, she said, was no great sacrifice since she isn't too keen on hospital food, but she was anxious to have the operation over as soon as possible. Although she had been fitted for a diaphragm after Eric's birth, she hadn't bothered with it in recent years, she said, in answer to her doctor's question, and didn't want to think about contraceptive devices at this time. “Let's get this over with first,” she said, as a nurse efficiently removed the colorless nail polish from her fingers and toes and swiftly covered her wedding ring with adhesive tape. Asked to remove her watch and any other jewelry and be sure that her purse was put away safely, she was checked for false teeth (“only caps; if they come out, I'll sue the dentist”), given mild sedation, put on a wheeled stretcher and sent up to the operating room shortly before 10 A.M. for a suction curetage, a method used for abortion in early pregnancy (up to 12 weeks) in which the cervix is dilated and the uterus evacuated by means of a suction device. Put to sleep before the operation by an anesthesiologist, Mrs. Smith had no way of knowing that the procedure itself took less than 10 minutes. Most of two hours she spent out of her room was spent waiting for the operating room to be made available and, later, coming to in the recovery room. Glad It Was Over By 12:30 P.M., Mrs. Smith was back in her room, with her husband by her side, still feeling a little woozy (“I don't think I'll‐make the dance tonight”) but glad to have the operation over with. Feeling stronger, after a light lunch, Mrs. Smith got up, dressed, said she felt better than she thought she would and marched down the hall to check out. The time was 3 P.M. That night, Mrs. Smith cooked dinner for her family as usual despite her husband's objections. The tab: $750, a fee which was replaced, as of yesterday, at Flower Fifth by a flat rate of $350 for a suction abortion or $500 for “salting out,” a more complex procedure used in more advanced pregnancies, according to Dr. Martin Stone, head of the hospital's department of obstetrics and gynecology. The $750 breaks down into $350 for the hospital, which includes room, laboratory tests, operating room fees; $250 for the attending physician (fees range from $250 to $300 on the average); and $120 for the anesthesiologist. Nine other women—five of them married — received therapeutic abortions at Flower & Fifth Avenue Hospitals, the same day Mrs. Smith did. Among them were a concert pianist, who did not wish to be distracted from her career; a laboratory technician, who had become involved with a married man; three housewives, two with children, one with none; an unmarried bookkeeper who did not wish to marry the father; a Polish woman visiting the city on vacation and two adolescent girls. Most of the women had not used contraceptive devices; an exception was a housewife with two children whose intra‐uterine device had failed to stay in place.

754-> Market Place:
Remember the good old pre‐1969 days when every weekend seemed to bring news of another massive take‐over attempt? It's been a long time since big corporate take overs were in vogue — the attacks on Chemical Bank and Goodrich probably rep resented the high water mark — and new assaults on major companies now seem remote. That is either good or bad depending on whether you subscribe to the “keep ‘em on their toes” view, or prefer the “let sleeping dogs lie” attitude. A surprising number of hurdles have been erected to keep establishment manage ments firmly in the saddle —so many in fact that many persons believe it will be vir tually impossible to unseat the ins in the future. Take the tax legislation that slipped through without much fanfare. Proposed dur ing the Northwest Industries seige of Goodrich, the tax legislation was designed to choke off investment funds to finance giant take‐overs. A student of the legislation, H. M. Jaffer Dharamsey in an extended study of the act has picked out a number of fea tures which will deter major take‐overs. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 limits to $5‐million the amount of interest that can be deducted from taxes on debt financed acquisitions undertaken after Oct. 9, 1969. The limitation applies to any debt financing for “Corporate Acquisition Indebtedness.” The latter is defined as debt issued to acquire either in excess of 5 per cent of the voting stock, or when used to acquire at least two‐thirds of the total value of all assets of a corporation. Further, the $5‐million limit has to be reduced, Mr. Dha ramsey adds, by the amount of interest deducted, which arises from any debt‐financed acquisition made after Dec. 01, 1967, whether or not the financing can be classified as Corporate Acquisition In debtedness. Mr. Dharmsey details the ins and outs of debt as de fined in the legislation—the definition will undoubtedly be found quite confining to aggressive corporations—and concludes that the legisla tion is designed to “min imize” tenders and force a return to “corporate democ racy” by encouraging proxy contests as the key means of gaining corporate control. However, the Government has acted on other fronts to keep merger activity down. Some time ago, the Justice Department indicated that it would frown on mergers in volving any of the 200 largest United States corporations. A number of attacks on major mergers by the Justice Department has given em phasis to this position. On still another front, the rule‐making body of the na tion's accountants has acted to prevent a number of abuses, which have resulted out of mergers in the record ing of earnings. The approach to this prob lem was such that a number of individuals and observers said they sensed still another attempt to discourage large mergers. The original plans included a size test which, to some, suggested that large mergers would be so handicapped in reporting future earnings that they would find large merg ers unattractive. Meanwhile, more practical considerations have dealt merger plans a body blow. Many a company has undertaken merger discus sions in recent months only to discover that the take‐over would be too costly in terms of the acquiring company's deeply depressed stock. Where cash is part of the consideration, the problems in this era of the liquidity squeeze are even more diffi cult to surmount. Whether a major merger trend will get under way again in the foreseeable fu ture would seem to depend, then, not only on a stronger market but also upon a shift ing attitude by the Justice Department and an ability to avoid the pitfalls of some prickly legislation and ac counting rules.

756-> U.S. NEWSMAN SEEN IN VIETCONG HANDS
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, Aug. 9—Refugees from Skoun report ed today that Robert S. Anson, an American correspondent for Time magazine, had been kept bound but unharmed by his Vietcong captors in that Cam bodian town on the night fol lowing his capture on Aug. 3. and was later led away to an enemy‐controlled hamlet to the north. Oak San, the brother of a Cambodian teacher who was captured with Mr. Anson and later released, said that the American reporter had appeared to be unwounded the day after he drove into Communist‐con trolled territory. Murray J. Gart, chief of cor respondents of the Time‐Life News Service, said yesterday that he had received a cable gram from Prince Norodom Si hanouk regarding Mr. Anson and other missing newsmen in Cambodia. Sources said it ap peared to be the most positive response yet by Prince Siha nouk, who heads a Cambodian government in exile in Peking on the 21 missing newsmen. The Prince's note said that his government had asked “our popular forces of Cambodia to locate Mr. Robert Anson as well as the other missing reporters and to free them when they have been located.”

759-> Spotlight:
The “sell” recommendation — an area of some sensitiv ity in the securities business — is making itself more evi dent these days. These same recommendations often trig ger price declines in big name stocks, particularly those glamour issues trading at high price‐earnings ratios. In the past, the research staffs of brokerage houses often were reluctant to ad vise the sale of a stock. For one thing, such a recommen dation has been known to close the door on manage ent contact with the com pany whose shares are in volved. But the pressures of a pro longed decline in stock prices, evidence appears to indicate, have made the sell recommendation somewhat fashionable. “People are quite nervous and anxious to protect their profits,” explains one Wall Streeter. “After all, we've seen a long bear market.” Abraham Karp, an analyst at Dominick & Dominick Inc., scored something of a coup with a sell recommen dation on Avon Products, a darling of money managers and a dominant name in cos metics and toiletries. • On Jan. 13, Avon's stock traded at a record price of 184½, climbing 8 points to finished at 183. This com pared with its low of 125¼ over the last year. On Jan. 15, Mr. Karp issued a report on the cosmetics in dustry that had some high praise about Avon. “The company's product line is excellent, its merchan dising network is unequalled and its past operating record is outstanding,” Mr. Karp de clared. Nevertheless, he offered the opinion that “aggressive investors should consider gradual reductions in their holdings of Avon common stock.” His rationale was that the earnings growth rate for Avon in coming years would run closer to 15 per cent an nually than the 20 per cent level prevailing over the last decade. Avon's stock subsequently ran into a selling squall, fall ing as low as. 152¾ before the end of Jantiaiy and clos ing last month at 158. • What sort of reaction did Mr. Karp, a chemical engineer before entering the securities business, get to his selling recommendation? “Clients seemed uniformly pleased to receive the re port,” he recalled last week. “There was no shaking of fists. Holders of a stock want to know when they should sell.” Recommendations from dif ferent houses, of course, of ten vary as to the outlook for the same stock. On the day the Dominick & Dominick report on Avon reached one bank, two buy recommenda tions arrived in the same mail. Similarly, some of the re cent selling pressure in Na tional Cash Register, another premium growth issue, is at tributed to the sell advice is sued by Howard J. Abner, a partner at Jas. H. Oliphant & Co., another member firm of the New York Stock Ex change. • “We recommended the sale during the final week of Jan uary when the stock was sell ing around 152,” Mr. Abner stated. One week later, National Cash Register was down some 12 points. Mr. Abner's decision tag ging the stock as a sell cen tered on his rationale that the annual growth rate of earnings would run lower than he had expected earlier. This, in turn, stood to be reflected in a lower price earnings multiple that people might he willing to assign to the stock. The situation for National Cash Register was different in Mr. Abner's eyes one year earlier. “In January of 1969, we recommended the stock as a buy at a price around 112,” he said. Subsequently, the stock rose as high as 171¾. • How does the Oliphant partner account for the re cent rise in the number of pelf recommendations? “It's governed by the fact that earnings information these days tends to be dis appointing,” he replied. “In a climate such as that it can bcome difficult to justify buy recommendations.” Other brokerage concerns, as well as investment advis ory services, meanwhile, are including some sell rec ommendations in their liter ature. In a special report on nine issues last month, Bache & Co., Inc., placed Lockheed Air craft and Honeywell under the heading, “Stocks to Liqui date.”

760-> JOB SAFETY BILL STALLS IN SENATE
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17—The occupational health and safety bill, which organized labor and most Democrats are committed to passing in this session of Congress, appears to be in trou ble in the Senate. The bill is currently before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee. Approval had been expected by the end of this week, but opponents in voked a little‐known Senate rule today to keep the commit. tee from meeting and thus block its Democratic majority from approving the bill. This rule states that no com mittee may meet while the Sen ate is in session unless it re ceives the unanimous consent of all the Senate. Thus, because the Senate is meeting in morning and after noon sessions in an attempt to adjourn by mid‐October, a single objection—and one was made today—can keep the Sen ate Labor Committee from meeting and approving the job safety bill. A Senator does not even have to object in person to a com mittee meeting. He can convey his objection through his party leadership, as was done today through the Republican leader ship. The author of the Senate bill, Harrison A. Williams, Demo crat of New Jersey, warned on the Senate floor today that “obstructionist's tactics” were being used by certain Repub licans to prevent committee consideration of the bill. Williams Critical He said that he was convey ing “to the President, himself, an account of why this legisla tion has not been enacted” and noted that the job‐safety bill had been called “urgent legis lation” by President Nixon in his Sept. 11, 1970, message to Congress. “I agree with the President's statement, and I wish him well in persuading all members of his own party to agreement and so demonstrate by actions taken here in the Senate,” he added. Representatives of the United States Chamber of Commerce, and Republican opponents of the Williams bill, have said that they would attempt to prevent the bill from reaching the floor for a vote. The opposition to the bill has focused on the rule‐making and enforcement powers that it would give to the Secretary of Labor. In contrast, the bill favored by industry and most Republi cans would place these powers in an independent, five‐man board appointed by the Presi dent. Democrats and representa tives of organized labor have expressed fears that such board would be too lenient to ward industry. A similar job safety bill in the House, written by Repre sentative Dominick V. Daniels, Democrat of New Jersey, is also experiencing difficulties in the Rules Committee. Although that bill was ap proved several months ago by the House Education and Labor Committee, the Rules Commit tee still has not found time to schedule it for floor action. House supporters attribute the delay to a coalition between some Southern Democratic Congressmen and Republican Representatives who are said to hope they can block a floor vote on the bill until re‐election pressures force the House to adjourn. Senator Williams said that the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee would schedule the job safety bill for consideration again on Friday. “I would hope that some spe cial message from the White House, to members of the Pres ident's party here in the Sen ate, will make it possible for the Labor Committee to meet so that the work on this im portant measure can go for ward,” he told the Senate.

762-> Soybean Futures Rise, Then Dip
After advancing sharply, soy bean futures prices dropped on profit taking and closed lower yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a rather active session. The early buying apparently; was a carryover from the pre vious session. Thereafter, how ever, trading was largely on a local level with 2 to 3 cent swings common. There appeared to be no outside influence on the movement of prices. Soybean oil and meal main tained good interest early in the trading and oil held buying interest right up to the close. However, meal came under liq uidating pressure and prices dipped. A fairly heavy export business and a lack of enough precipitation in some areas in fluenced buying of corn futures. Late selling, however, caused prices to close mixed. Wheat futures also weak ened near the close, despite sizeable export business in the offing. Trading in oats futures was light and rye activity also was slow with only two con tracts changing hands. At the close or trading, soy beans futures prices were off 1½ to 2¾ cents a bushel; wheat, unchanged to off 1 cent corn, off ⅜ to up 1½ cent; and oats, unchanged to off ½ cent. Most platinum futures con tinued to decline on the New York Merchantile Exchange. The only exception was the January contract, with 21 sales, which closed at $147.00 an ounce, the same as the day before. The October contract, the busiest with 556 sales, closed at $143.30 compared with $144.30 an ounce the pre vious session and the April con tract, with 554 sales, dipped to $148.50 from $149.50 an ounce on Wednesday.

764-> BANK BORROWINGS UP FOR 4TH WEEK
Federal Reserve member, banks appear to be responding strongly to reminders by the central bank that it stands ready to lend them money through the discount window should they come under pres sure from their customers banking statistics published yesterday showed. Member bank borrowings spurted by a daily average of $384‐million in the week ended Wednesday, bringing such bor rowings to $1.68‐billion. This was the fourth consecutive week of increased borrowings —it was the biggest jump as well — exceeding an advance of $303‐million in the preced ing week. The Federal Reserve, con cerned that problems in the commercial paper market in the wake of the Penn Central Transportation Company de fault might put unbearable pressures on the banks, passed the word a few weeks ago that it would fulfill as usual its role as lender of last resort. It was feared that many cornpanies that would normally sell commercial paper, which are corporate i.o.u.'s, would be forced to turn to banks for short‐term financing because of much greater selectivity on the part of purchasers of paper. The banks, in fact, seem to be taking up the invitation of the Reserve. The latest week's member borrowings are nearly twice what they were three weeks ago. Although confidence in the paper market apparently is regaining strength, the weekly banking statistics showed yes terday a sharp increase in loans to finance companies at 12 ma jor New York City banks. ?? These loans, which declined by $88‐million in the preceding week, advanced by $220‐million in the period ending Wednes day. At $2.5‐billion, such loans are at a record level. A central bank spokesman noted that this indeed seemed to reflect con tinuing difficulties in the paper market. Meanwhile, the New York banks were able to sell another $348‐million of certificates of deposit in the latest week, bringing such sales in the last three weeks to $1.09‐billion. The Reserve suspended inter est ceilings on some short ma turity C.D.'s in late June in related attempt to give banks the ability to deal with demand linked to the commercial paper situation. Elsewhere, the banking fig ures displayed some wild gyra tions that were attributed to seasonal factors, errors in projecting money flows and items that could not be ex plained. ?? ?? The broad monetary aggregates showed substantial in creases and short‐term interest rates were mixed. One widely followed cator, which is largely mean ingless taken by itself, showed a considerably tighter picture. This was net borrowed reserves —the excess reserves held by some Reserve members minus the borrowings of others— which climbed to $1.59‐billion on a daily average basis, the highest on record. The money supply, another closely studied indicator, ap peared to continue to slacken from the recent sharp expan sion. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that money had grown at a seasonally ad justed annual rate of 2.2 per cent over the last three months, compared with 3.5 per cent over six months and 2.5 per cent over the last year. This indicates that money‐sup ply growth has come down in recent weeks, even apart from large bulges in late December and late March. In another developments, the Reserve revised upward, by whopping $394‐million, the amount of bank‐related com mercial paper outstanding on July I. The new total is $7.29‐ billion.

765-> Son Of ‘Help!’
THE Beatles are back, or soon will be. Although the lyrical lads from Liverpool were seen briefly in “Yellow Subma rine,” they have not appeared together in a non‐animated feature since “Help!” in 1965. Now comes the news that we will soon be treated to two new Beatles flicks, “Let It Be” and “The Long and Winding Road.” “Both films are hard to de scribe,” says Allen Klein, the boys' local representative, who nevertheless had a go at it. “Like ‘A Hard Day's Night,’ they are free‐form af fairs, fact films but not docu mentaries. ‘Let It Be’ tells how the Beatles, over a three‐month period, went about producing their rec ords. It's their own original idea, and the script is theirs, too.” The film, directed by Michael Lindsay, also peeps a bit into the Beatles' private lives. “The Long and Winding Road,” another original Bea tles brainchild, is a record of their travels and adventures over a period of two years, according to Klein. “Like ‘Let It Be,’ it will feature several new songs by the Beatles.” So Beatlemaniacs can count on a groovy spring, since that is the time both films are scheduled for release. Franklin Schaffner is a man with a fondness for other times and other places. In “Planet of the Apes,” the director showed us a post nuclear‐war simian civiliza tion, and in his current, controversial “Patton” he showed us one way of being a rebel in World War II. Now he is marching forward with a film about a couple of sci entists who teach dolphins to speak. The movie, “The Day of the Dolphin,” will be based on the novel by Robert Merle. Movie buffs will recall that Roman Polanski had once an nounced that he would put the dolphins through their paces, but that's definitely off now. Schaffner hopes to start filming for the Mirisch Com pany in Florida in the fall. United Roger O. Hirson has been signed to do the script, which will involve some sinister types who want to use the scientific findings about the dolphins for warlike pur poses. If those dolphins are smart, they'll just give their name, rank and serial num ber. Al Freeman Jr., who will soon open on Broadway with Shirley. Booth in the musical “Look to the Lilies,” is still looking to the movies. He has just acquired the film rights to “The Slave,” LeRoi Jones's play depicting open warfare between black and white Americans. Not only will Freeman re‐create the role of a revolutionary black poet which he played in the 1964 Off Broadway production of the play, but he will produce and direct the film as well. James Patterson and Rochelle Oliver have been set to co star as a professor and his wife with whom Freeman clashes. Freeman, who starred in the 1967 film of Jones's “Dutchman,” will start shoot ing here next month. Youth will be served in “The Martlet's Tale,” even though one of the major char acters is an 80‐year‐old woman. This “Tale,” based on a novel by Nicholas Delbanco, a 27‐year‐old Bennington Col lege English teacher, is being adapted for the screen by Del banco and 29‐year‐old John Crowther. Crowther, the son of Bosley Crowther, will also make his feature directorial debut. The story, about a wealthy matriarch and her 20‐year‐old grandson who is forced to choose between duty to fam ily and personal freedom, is set in Greece.

766-> U.S. Selects a Site F or Ground Tests Of Rapid Vehicles
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24—A site in Colorado near the Army's Pueblo Ordnance Depot has been chosen for con struction of a new high‐speed ground test facility for the De partment of Transportation. Secretary John A. Volpe said this week that it offered “a variety of weather and terrain conditions” at minimal cost, when he announced its selection over other sites in Arizona, New Jersey, New Mexico and Washington. The 30,000‐acre site, offered at no cost by the state, will provide space for two 20‐mile test tracks, one oval and the other a straightaway. The Ord nance Depot, about two miles from the oval, will be avail able to service the facility at minimal added cost. The land, about 20 miles northeast of Pueblo, is already owned by the state and leased to ranchers for cattle grazing. Secretary Volpe said that the facility would have no adverse impact on the environment. It will enable the Transportation Department to test “all types of equipment and engines,” he said, including a ground ve hicle driven by a linear induc tion motor designed for an ul timate speed of 250 miles an hour, which is now getting pre liminary testing at low speeds in California.

772-> The Impotence of Power
The supreme irony of this age of power is its impotence to deal with determined or fanatical minorities. Mr. Jeffer son, who had very little mili tary power, could deal effec tively with the Barbary pirates early in the nineteenth century, but Mr. Nixon, who has apoca lyptic power, cannot handle the Arab pirates without risking the lives of the Americans he wants to rescue. You can almost put it down as a rule that the more compli cated a society is, the more vul nerable it is to sabotage. It Is not only the great jet airliners that can be disrupted at the whim of a few desperate men, but even vast modern cities like New York are at the mercy of any fanatics who know how to get at the critical centers of electrical power. The violent events of the last few years illustrate the point. We have not yet had to face organized guerrilla war in the urban centers of America, but the skyjackers, the wreckers in the universities, and even the unorganized hoodlums have given us some idea of what can be done by tyrannical minorities. Each of these problems, of course, is different, but in all of them only a very few men were able to bring the opera tions of vast enterprises to a halt. Probably the most spec tacular example Of the power of the weak over the strong has been the operation of the Com munist guerrillas in Southeast Asia, first against the organ ized power of France, and then even against an American ex peditionary force of over half a million men. The danger in the present wave of skyjackings is that it can easily spread into an in fectious disorder, and not only in the Middle East. It is quick and comparatively easy way to dramatize any cause, and it seems to have a compel ling appeal to deranged minds. Even the risks involved in hijacking a jet or going down the right manholes to sabotage the power of a city are scarce ly as great today as robbing a bank. Mr. Nixon, for all his power, cannot even perform the first duty of government, which is to protect its own citizens, not because he is weak, but because his strength is so great that he dare not use it. He has 1,800 Marines with the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Medi terranean and a 1,500‐man air borne brigade in Germany. It is within his power to para chute them in the night into the Jordanian desert and over whelm the Arab pirates, but he might easily lose the lives of the trapped Americans in the process. So we are left with the prob lem of dealing with anarchy. Putting a military guard on planes in International traffic is not a solution, though the armed guards on the El Al planes have complicated the problem and raised the risks for the skyjackers. Probably the most effective sanction would be to isolate any country whose citizens en gage in international piracy. This would mean an agreement by all the major airlines not to fly into any country harboring the pirates, and not allowing that country's planes to use the airfields of the major na tions of the world. The objection to this, of course, is that the sanction is not precise, and in the case of Jordan would actually punish the government that is fighting the guerrillas. Nevertheless, such an arrangement might en courage the Arab governments to take more vigorous action against the pirates than they have been willing to take in the past. There is, however, no fool proof way to deal with the problem. Closer inspection of baggage would help. So would very strict limitations on hand baggage that could be carried into the cabin, but short of turning international flights into nudist parties, which might be a little awkward or even embar rassing, there would still be the danger of weapons concealed even from a vigilant frisker. Accordingly, President Nixon has undoubtedly been right to hold his temper and hope that the Arabs have hurt their cause so severely by these adventures that they will stop the nonsense on their own. This, however, is far from a sure thing. All you have to do is take a long walk through almost any American city these days to realize how many angry and de mented people there are wan dering around loose — many of them willing to risk their lives to remove some real or imagined grievance. Once the normal restraints of interdependent cities or systems are broken, the anarchy tends to feed on itself, and this is now the danger in a world with so many frustrated and even, de mented people.

773-> Scented Geraniums
ONE of the fondest mem ories of my childhood summers is the faint odor of peppermint from scented geraniums growing in the corner of a screened‐in porch. Scented geraniums come in a variety of forms and shapes as well as color of leaves and fragrances. Most of them have small blooms; some are quite colorful, which add charm to the beauty of the foliage. Blooms may be sparse in doors unless the night tem perature falls to 55 degrees or slightly lower. Scented leaved geraniums need full sunlight for best growth but will tolerate partial shade, especially the peppermint scented. Water plants when the soil approaches dryness. Rapid growers, geraniums need trimming and pruning frequently. Use fertilizer once a month. Ordinary garden soil or regular potting mix ture is best. Geraniums are prone to aphids and white flies but these pests can be controlled with an aerosol spray or malathion. Among the scented gera niums, there are several with lemon fragrance. Pelargoni um crispum has the strong est odor and is most desir able. Prince Rupert Lemon and its variegated form with larger leaves are stronger growing. The variegated form is highly favored for its dec orative green and white foli age. * Most popular is old fash ioned rose (P. graveolens), which is used in jellies, cakes and teas. Rober's Lemon Rose may be more fragrant and even better to use in cook ery than the old fashioned rose but it does not have the beautiful foliage. Rose gera niums also come in variegat ed forms — Lady Plymouth, Grey Lady Plymouth and P. graveolens variegatum. Peppermint scented gera nium has large velvety leaves and strong scent. A rank grower, prune severe ly to keep a shapely plant. * Basket variety with small leaves is apple geranium (P. odoratissimum) which has the scent of apples. Small round leaves send out runners that bear fluffy white blooms. P. grossularoides, also a hang ing basket variety, has the strong scent of coconut. It has dark, small green round leaves and tiny pink blooms. Strawberry (P. scarborviae) is similar to the crispum with very small dentate leaves, which smell like a basket of strawberries. Other scented geraniums smell like lime or ginger. The oak leaf va rieties are labeled as pun gent scented. Then there are the pine scented varieties of the Denticulatum group with sticky foliage like the pitch of pine.

776-> Hundreds of Mayors Hold Protest March in Paris
PARIS, April 8—Several hundred mayors sporting the tricolor sash of their office marched through part of the Left Bank of Paris today to protest the poor state of mu nicipal finances. The mayors marched from the National Assembly to the Premier's office at the Hotel Matignon despite an official ban on street demonstrations and the Government appeared highly annoyed at the example he mayors were setting for their fellow citizens. The municipal leaders, ineluding such prominent ones as Gaston Defferre, Mayor of Mar seilles, France's second city, and Francois Mitterrand, Mayor of the small town of Chateau Chinon, all belonged to leftist parties—Communists, Socialists and Radicals—opposed to the Government on general princi ples. They complained that the cities t‐7d towns were not get ting their fair share of public revenues, always a sore point in this highly centralized coun try. Everything was decorous, but what made officials angry was the fact that various groups in recent months had shown tendency to express themselves in the streets, thus hindering Government efforts to get prob lems settled in discussions. Last night, Premier Jacques Chaban‐Delmas, in a television interview, reaffirmed his Gov ernment's desire to carry on “a dialogue” with all groups that have grievances. But he remarked that as a society be came more complex it became easier for a handful of people to paralyze everything. “The Government is perfectly aware.” he said, “of the im possibility of allowing this kind of action to develop. And, as it is aware of this, you can be certain that it is prepared without delay to do what is necessary so that our whole society is not rendered in capable of functioning.” on WASHINGTON, April 8 (UPI) About five hours after the Senate rejected the nomination of Judge G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court today, President Nixon left aboard the Presidential yacht Sequoia for a dinner cruise down the Potomac River. He was accom panied by H. R.

779-> Do's and Don'ts for Trees
SOME tree owners with a “do‐it‐your self” attitude, perform various proj ects which they believe will aid their trees. Some of the things they do are indeed beneficial. Other projects are either of no value or are actually harmful. Here are some “no‐no's” for tree owners: When it appears that two portions of a small tree may split apart or that a portion may break from over‐weight, never use wire as a brace and wind it around the tree's heavier wood. What happens? The wood continues to grow, but the wire noose remains rigid. The flow of sap impeded so that a wooden bulge occurs alongside the wire. The portion of tree above the wire may eventually die from strangulation. In large trees, a chain binding two por tions together and wrapped around the wood can be just as lethal. If a brace needed, secure the wire, chain or cable with screw hooks or eyebolts that go di rectly through the trunk. Such penetration will not harm the tree at all. Old myths die hard. One that continues to hang on is the belief that trees will benefit if all holes and indentations are filled with cement. The reasons for filling cavity are to seal over the opening and to provide support which has been lost by the rotting away of heartwood. Specially prepared cavity filler is occasionally used by tree companies, but filling cavities a specialized, expensive job, and is seldom done, even professionally today. Cement can crack under pressure and because it does not keep a cavity's open ing permanently sealed, rain may enter and produce further rot. If a tree must ever be cut down, the cement fill may cause great difficulty; one hard cut into cement can ruin the chain of a power saw. If a tree does have a cavity, seal the opening to keep out unwanted rain, by tightly nailing on something like sheet metal or roof shingle cut to size and painted black for appearance. For a large cavity in the trunk of an important tree, ask a tree company about putting in in ternal iron bracing rods for support. Paint ing large surfaces of exposed wood should be done every year or so to keep wood fungus from entering a tree. Use only regular tree paint. Other types peel and might harm tender living tissues. Stubs will tend to die if left after pruning. They invite wood rot which could enter into the trunk's heartwood, and weaken sup port. When removing a branch or limb, leave a stub on the first cut, but then saw off the stub itself flush with the trunk. The cut will be surrounded by live wood tissue which will grow over the cut and seal it in. With the exception of the pear, pruning live wood from fruit trees in the dormant season advisable and encourages fruit production. Vertical branches, low ones pointing too sharply downward, those pointing toward the tree's center or those rubbing on larger growth, can be cut out. Even a modest limb may be removed from a cluster of too many limbs. However, never prune drastically. If a tree has never been pruned before, don't try to do the whole pruning job in one year. Keep a fruit tree low, but trim gradually—in a few years. Over‐pruning will encourage a forest of water sprouts from trunk and limbs. These sprouts will bear no fruit, are unsightly and will pre sent a much tougher pruning job than before. * Grading or terracing beneath a tree's limb spread is chancy business. It could result in a die‐off of limbs or in death of the whole tree due to a shutting off of oxygen from the roots. The more fill used and the less porous the soil, the greater the danger. There are no exceptions here. tree. Leave them where they fall. They will decay and put a certain amount of needed minerals back into the soil for the tree's surface roots. The best thing anyone can do for trees is to bring home from the bookstore or library one or two books about trees. The more that is learned, the more home owners will realize that a tree lives in delicate balance with its immediate sur roundings. To disturb that balance in some way may be the tree's and home owner's misfortune.

781-> Letters
TO THE EDITOR: Thomas Meehan's article (“At Bennington the Boys Are Coeds,” Dec. 21), contained an unlikely caricature of a “student militant” affixed with my name. The author also fabricated some remarks I am to have said, couched in journalistic jargon that would not make believable dialogue in a bad short story about radicals. Bennington students are among the most privileged in the nation, as free from “re pressive rules” as students at Columbia and other élite schools. The college, never theless, cannot be forever im mune to the repression that is affecting increasing num bers of people in the society. Nor do Bennington students have the “voice in the cur riculum and in the hiring and firing of faculty members” that Mr. Meehan claims I told him they have. This fall, in fact, a philosophy teacher was fired without student consultation and over the objections of a large number of students. To members of the news media, discrediting and ridi culing radical “spokesmen” obviously supersedes the de sire for accuracy. JOHN CAUMAN. New York. Mr. Meehan replies: “If I misquoted Mr. Cauman, as I evidently did, I apologize to him. He's wrong in saying, though, that Bennington stu dents have no voice in the cur riculum or in the hiring and firing of faculty members, for they most certainly do— through a group known as the Student Educational Policies Committee. I'm astonished that Mr. Cauman doesn't know of the existence of this committee, student members of which even give job inter views to prospective members of the Bennington faculty. I in no way intended to ridicule or discredit Mr. Cauman, but simply to point out how diffi cult and even absurd it is these days to be a student militant at Bennington, where there are no causes left to fight for. And my description of Mr. Cauman and his problems was meant to be lighthearted and mildly teasing. I think that I've been taken much too seriously by a very serious young man.” • TO THE EDITOR: The Bennington article pointed out with misogyn'c glee that Bennington girls pursue such subjects as Bul garian folk dancing. It failed to mention, however, that more of us take courses such as analytical logic and plant morphogenesis. Bennington is not a summer camp that pro duces nothing more than lanyard weavers and frisbee heavers; it is a community of students who firmly believe that Bennington is one of the few existing places (I hesitate to say institutions) where one can receive thoughtful, hu mane and relevant education. RANDIE DENKER, Bennington College, Class of '72. East Rockaway, N. Y. Mr. Meehan replies: “Ah, to be called a misogynist by a Bennington girl—the unkind est cut of all. I think, though, that Miss Denker misunder stands my reason for having written about Bennington. I wasn't in the least attempting to write a somber study of Bennington as an institution (I hesitate to say place) of higher learning, but instead to turn out a lighthearted report on what happens to an all‐girl college when it suddenly be comes coeducational — the stuff of musical comedy, not of Ph.D. thesis. “Of course, Bennington is a serious college for serious students. Still, what's wrong with Bulgarian folk dancing, which is indeed taught at Bennington? Misogynist or not, I'd any day prefer a girl accomplished in Bulgarian folk dancing over one capable of analytically logical chitchat about plant morphogenesis.” • TO THE EDITOR: Though the odds at Ben nington make for an unusual and not unpleasant atmos phere for the male students, I know of no men attending the school who believe that the ratio of men to women should remain the same. Such an opinion, which I do not and never have held, is indicative of a lack of understanding of the nature of the school. I was pleased and flattered to find gifts from an unknown admirer in my mailbox for a week or so while Mr. Meehan was on campus, but cannot imagine having admitted, sheepishly or otherwise, that four women were in open pursuit of me. The phrase “open pursuit” has no mean ing or me in relation to Bennington women. Bennington College is a vital and exciting community, not without its singular diffi culties and failings. The fact that women outnumber men 10 to 1 is hardly the most im portant aspect of the school to any of the students. It is a school where the learning process goes on continuously. In the last week, for instance, I learned never to talk to re porters. ALLEN C. KENNEDY. Bennington, Vt. Mr. Meehan replies: “At Bennington, I talked with some 40 of the 51 male coeds, and several indicated to me that they hoped the 10‐to‐1 ratio of females to males would be maintained next year. I'm certain that Mr. Kennedy was one of these, but if he now says otherwise, I apologize for having appar ently misquoted him. ‘Open pursuit’ and ‘sheepish’ were, of course, my terms, and not quotes from Mr. Kennedy. Certainly he told me that at least four Bennington girls were more than slightly in terested in him, and while he was talking I perhaps mistakenly interpreted the expression on his face as sheepish. And, on his final point, he's right: if he doesn't want his ideas and opinions later to turn up in print, he should never talk to report] ers.” • TO THE EDITOR: Mr. Meehan's article is extraordinarily interesting. But can it be accurate? Is it pos sible that the boys and girls at Bennington speak such ignorant, illiterate, inarticu late English as he reports, interlarding their sentences with “I mean” and “like”? JOSEPH COY GREEN. Chevy Chase, Md. Mr. Meehan replies: “Yes, it is possible. Curiously, many of the students at Bennington, in an apparent attempt to be hip, talk like undereducated jazz musicians, and such phrases as ‘It was, like, a real groove’ come surprisingly from the mouths of even the brightest of them. Along with maxi‐coats, Marcuse and mary jane, hip talk is part of the college scene these days, not only at Bennington but on most other campuses, too.” TO THE EDITOR: Dr. Klaus Angel (“No Mari juana for Adolescents,” Nov. 30) did an excellent job of going into adolescent hang ups leading to marijuana. However, he limits his ex amples to 17‐ and 18‐year‐ olds, who by definition are practically out of that stage. From my experience (as a high‐school sophomore), I see it at a much lower age level. Besides marijuana being wide spread among my peers, I don't have to look far to find eighth‐graders who smoke, and eighth‐graders who “speed” too. This phenomenon can most likely be attributed to some thing largely ignored in Dr. Angel's article, and that is an attempt at being under stood. It takes a while to get to know an adjusted person with a complex personality. He realizes that if he fit into a stereotype, he'd be understood more easily, but he wouldn't be himself. An adolescent, especially a younger one., won't let this get in his way. He will force himself into a stereotype to the point where he believes it's him. There are many stereotypes open to youths, but most require work (e.g., to be typed as an intellectual requires study). To be a hippie (that word had to come up), all that's required is long hair and marijuana. What could be simpler? And the results—what could be better? Peers sym pathize when “straight” peo ple are down on you for “nonconforming.” And nothing gives more satisfaction than to hear an old person put you down. The point is this: If more time was spent, on the part of teachers and parents, to understand kids for what they are, they'd be less concerned with being understood for what they're not, namely pot heads and hippies. RICHARD GOLDBERG, Rippowam High School. Stamford, Conn. • TO THE EDITOR: Dr. Angel states that his conclusions are tentative, but then proceeds with an ever mounting sense of conviction to demonstrate that marijuana is potentially hazardous for all teen‐agers. He does this on the basis of work with a rela tively small number of ado lescents in turmoil, neglecting to consider that kids in emo tional trouble represent the smallest percentage of mari juana users, and that abso lutely no statistics are yet available on the fate of the hundreds of thousands of kids who smoke, do not obviously suffer psychological damage and were in reasonably good shape to begin with. It is probably quite true that severely pot‐dependent kids crave cannabis because of the sense of omnipotence it gives them and for the feel ing of escape from a painful reality, but these kids are smoking huge amounts of cannabis. There is, as yet, no clinical evidence that docu ments the presence of par ticular psychological vulner ability of the average adolescent with good coping mechanisms to cannabis in small doses. This letter is not being written to condone marijuana use or to advise legalization: but until controlled research and intensive study can be completed, using proper epidemeliological techniques, “expert” assertions can truly amount to little more than educated guessing. If Dr. Angel turns out to be wrong, he may have succeeded in doing little more than driving yet another wedge between the generations. HARVEY R. GREENBERG, M.D., Assistant Clinical Professor, Child Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Director Adolescent In‐Patient Service Training Unit, Bronx State Hospital. Bronx. Dr. Angel replies: “Let me begin by stating that I did not say anywhere in the ar ticle that marijuana was dangerous for all adolescents. In fact, I said that a realistic versus a pharmacothymic reg imen is not necessarily an either/or proposition. The title may have contributed to this impression. My title was ‘Reflections on the Psycho logical Dangers of Marijuana.’ This was changed by The New York Times to: ‘A Psychoanalyst Suggests: No Marijuana for Adolescents.’ Nevertheless, the entire ar ticle was meant to show that there is a special psychologi cal vulnerability in adoles cence to marijuana. This consists of adolescent turmoil (in all adolescents) and the tendency to cope with it similarly, as during an earlier phase, by means of magic. Therefore, I believe that po tentially addicting substances are more dangerous in ado‐ lescence. “I do not know whether my first and second case have more turmoil than the average adolescent. To the superficial observer they ‘do not obviously suffer psycho logical damage’ It is difficult to determine what a normal adolescent is, since all have turmoil, conflicts and anxiety. One would have to study in therapy, for several months, all the hundreds of thousands of adolescents whom Dr. Greenberg mentions to deter mine the specific function that the drug serves in the life of each individual user. I don't see what the dose has to do with it. The issue is addiction or the degree to which ‘a pharmacothymic reg imen’ has taken over. This can be the case with frequent small doses or occasional larger doses.” • TO THE EDITOR: The clinical examples pre sented by Dr. Angel are most audacious. I wonder if the patients' permission was ob tained before he decided to exploit their difficulties. Anec dotal material can be used to support or criticize any posi tion. From my own extensive experience I can produce large numbers of healthy col lege students who also use marijuana. ARNOLD WERNER, M.D., Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Director, Psychiatric Services, Michigan State University Health Center. East Lansing, Mich. Dr. Angel replies: “None of the cases presented are at present in treatment with me. Also, the cases were so dis torted as to make them un recognizable even to the pa tients themselves. Not only were their name, age, sex and the type of school changed, but also any other part of their history that would dis tinguish them in any way from someone else. However, the underlying psychological problem was not changed. This problem is typical of great numbers of cases in each of the three categories of which examples were given.” TO THE EDITOR: In an interesting and other wise informative article on the Adolescent Unit of the Boston Children's Hospital (“Adolescent Stage: It's for Real,” Dec. 7), Rita Kramer referred to Dr. James Gill as “a former Jesuit who left the priesthood to go into psychi atry.” This most unfortunate statement is not true. Dr. Gill is a loyal Jesuit as well as an excellent psychiatrist, and the combination of his two roles has resulted in his being a very successful therapist. DANA L. FARNSWORTH, M.D., Director. Cambridge, Mass. Mrs. Kramer answers: “I am very sorry that I mistakenly described Dr. Gill as a ‘former Jesuit.’ He is still active as a Jesuit priest, although he has a full‐time appointment as a psychiatrist with the University Health Services at Harvard. In fact, Dr. Gill has been a pioneer in the area in which psychiatry and religion meet, having gone through medical school, interneship and residency training in psychiatry after being or dained.” TO THE EDITOR: I was misquoted in Arnold Beichman's article, “Will Teacher Be the New Drop out?” (Dec. 7). In a footnote he attributed the following to me: “Only about half of black high‐school graduates are fully capable of handling a college curriculum.” This statement is (a) totally misleading, (b) taken out of context, (c) diametrically opposed to my own views, which are based on considerable experience with minority students in higher education, and (d) un supported by the facts at hand. Unfortunately, graduate student Beichman did not check with me before he wrote his article. There is no compelling evidence that black high school graduates, as a group, are more or less “capable of handling a college curriculum” than are whites or any other general population group. Nor is there evidence that a specific proportion of any population group — black, white, or other — possesses such a capability. The point that Mr. Beichman missed is this: a sub stantial proportion (perhaps as many as half) of current black high‐school graduates were counseled earlier into technical or vocational second‐ ary‐school programs and hence were not exposed to those academic courses con ventionally required for ad mission to, and success in, traditional baccalaureate pro grams in the arts and sciences. The resulting under‐represen tation of blacks in American higher education is not caused by lack of native ability but rather by lack of opportunity in an educational system which too easily and too early tends to channel all its stu dents onto one‐way tracks. One logical way to extend opportunities is to increase educational options for all our young and to keep those op tions open. FRED E. CROSSLAND, Program Officer, The Ford Foundation. New York. Mr. Beichman replies: “Mr. Crossland's letter is astonish ing. He accuses me of mis quoting him. He fails to say that I was quoting a summary of his views as published on the front page of The Wall Street Journal on July 28, 1969. I indicated my source as the Journal in the footnote on page 49 of my article. Mr. Crossland seems to have ig nored the original publication of the views which he now explicates. “As a matter of fact, the Journal quoted him directly: ‘Given present standards, it's preposterous and statistically impossible to talk about boost ing, black enrollment to 10 per cent even over the next five years.’ This seems to me entirely congruent with the more elaborate argument of his letter.” TO THE EDITOR: Three captions in your lay out of my article on the New Mobilization (“The New Mobe (I): Who's Who? What's What?,” Nov. 30) are not quite right. “Bring the War Home!” is an S.D.S. cry; it is not an official New Mobe slogan. The Moratorium planners do not occupy a “corner” of Mobil ization headquarters; they have their own floor of offices in the same building—and that is where the picture of Sam Brown was taken. And in the text of the article, a typographical error has evi dently altered the proper name of S.D.S.‐R.Y.M.‐II. It is, of course, Revolutionary Youth Movement. WALTER GOODMAN. White Plains, N. Y.

782-> Palo Alto, Calif.: Changing Mood in the Universities?
PALO ALTO. Calif., Sept. 17 —When President Nixon's tough Kansas State speech against the fist and bullet uni versity activists gets serious praise on the much more liberal Stanford University campus, it is a fairly good sign that the 1970 school year is opening on a different note. The Santa Clara sheriff's of fice sent police on to the Stan ford campus fourteen times during the last school year, the president of the university re signed, and the relaxed young acting president, Richard W. Lyman, had rocks pitched through his bedroom window. Since then two deans have left Stanford for less combative jobs in foundations, and the dean of the law school has an nounced he will be leaving. Still Lyman says, there is a tendency in the universities, as in Washington, to prepare for coming violence on the basis of wars of the past, and this year, he hopes, things will be different. Stanford has prepared. for the new academic year as best it can, but there is no way to protect so vast a campus from atrocities like the University of Wisconsin bombings without turning the university into an armed camp. Administrators here agree with President Nixon that the universities cannot be saved by the Federal Government or by outside police, and yet a uni versity is as fragile and vul nerable as a big jet to sudden violence even by a single terrorist. Some precautions have been taken here. Bright lights have been installed on campus to raise the risk to the rock throwers. A new student man ual has been prepared so that students cannot say this year, as they have in the past, that they didn't know the rules. A special assistant to the acting president has been appointed to gather evidence and direct prosecution proceedings, and the university has made avail able an 18‐acre plot out of its 8,800 acres in the San Fran cisco Peninsula for 200 low and moderate‐income housing units. The Major Threat The universities, however, are at the mercy of outside events and outside agitators beyond their control. Nobody here is willing to predict what will happen if another upward turn in the war, like the Cam bodian invasion, or a disaster like the Kent State killings, should produce another violent reaction among the students. One thing, however, seems fairly clear. All the excite ment last spring about mount ing a massive campaign by stu dents to help elect peace candi dates in the November elections has dwindled to a whisper. The Student Committee for Involve ment in Politics, created at Stanford in the spring, has not been nearly as active this sum mer as the leaders expected. This may, of course, change when all the students are back in the last week or two of the campaign, but even some of the peace candidates in this part of the country are wonder ing if massive student support would not help their opponents. Nevertheless there are some hopeful signs. For example, there is now some evidence that faculty members are re viewing their own role in the face of all these disturbances. It is hard to generalize about this, but it is fairly clear that many teachers, accustomed to the respect and even affection of their students, have been badly shaken by the hostility of the militants, and have tended to withdraw and some even to join the militants rather than face the charge of defending the establishments. This is clearly not the aca demic world of reason and re flection many of them antici pated when they chose teach ing as a profession, and while fewer have left than expected, many of them have been over whelmed or even intimidated. Now, at least, there are signs that some faculty leaders will be making a new effort to define the role of the university this coming year, and to gain a new concept of their role in the university. Many of them are now rejecting the militants’ assertion that the universities must be “relevant” in the sense of turning the campuses into centers of political action for change, but it is still too, early to predict how deep or how far this reappraisal will go. Fear of Conflict In fact there is some anxiety here about what will happen if the confrontation this year changes from a battle between student militants and adminis trators to open conflict be tween the student militants on the left and student activists on the right. This was one of President Nixon's themes at Kansas State. The large majority of the good guys should defend the university from the wild men, he suggested, but how to do it? Other than opening up more honest discussion and creating a more reasonable at mosphere, administrators here are still baffled about how to deal with the terror of the few.

784-> Aluminum Concern's 3‐ and 6‐Month Net Dips Moderately
The Aluminum Company of America, the nation's largest aluminum producer, reported yesterday moderate declines in earnings in the quarter and six months ended June 30. A sharp reduction in taxes this year helped to keep the drop in earnings at a moderate level according to the midyear state ment. Second‐quarter net income was $30,780,768, or $1.40 a common share. This was down 4 per cent from $32,046,746, or $1.46 a share, in the similar three months last year. Before United States and foreign taxes, earnings fell 14 per cent to $49,028,352 from $56, 983,071 a year earlier. Pro vision for such taxes totaled $18,247,584, compared with $24,936,325 in the 1969 period. For the first half, income after taxes dipped 1.6 per cent to $61,506,036, or $2.80 a share, from $62,513,505, or $2.85 a share, in the similar period of 1969. Before taxes, earnings were $101,377.718, down 9.3 per cent from the year earlier pretax earnings of $111,811,556. Taxes took $39. 871,682 this year, contrasted with the $49,298,051 provided for the six months of 1969. The company said taxes were lower this year because a large proportion of the total income was from subsidiaries based in foreign countries, where the tax rates are lower. Also, the sur charge was figured at 2½ per cent for each quarter this year compared with 10 per cent for each quarter last year and sev eral subsidiaries were now us ing the equity method of ac counting, which decreased prof its and taxes. Sales and operating revenues in the quarter were $392,061, 464, off 1.4 per cent from $397,756,698 last year. For the six months the volume in creased 1.7 per cent to $786, 326,166 from $772,838,497. Production of primary alum inum by wholly owned smelters was at record levels for the quarter, totaling 363,000 tons, and for the six months, total ing 724,000 tons. This compares with 341,000 and 677,000 tons, respectively, last year. Ship ments of aluminum products were 391,000 tons in the quar ter down from 408,000 tons in the similar period last year, and 785,000 and 798,000 tons for the respective half‐year periods. Despite she decline in indus trial production during the sec ond quarter, Alcoa's shipments were only off slightly because of record exports and continued growth in the packaging and electrical markets, the compa ny said. The company's aver age price realizations during the quarter were generally higher than last year, despite softness in some products and markets where demand slipped.

785-> Article 1 ‐‐ No Title
“It's almost like Puerto Rico,” said Bertha Calo as she weeded her garden out side her $41,000 house at 1033 Underhill Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx. “It's very quiet and pleasant here.” For the Calos, their home, which they purchased a year and a half ago, is the first of the 18 years they have spent in New York. Up to two years ago they had lived in tenements on Manhattan's West side and worked—Mr. Calo as a diamond cutter and Mrs. Cabo as a beautician. Their daughter, now 22 years old and married, was raised in the city and likes it, here. So, instead of moving back to Puerto Rico, the Calos took their $6,000 of savings and used it as a down payment on the two‐ family brick house. “We wanted to stay near our daughter and give her band,” said Mrs. Calo as she stayed on the alert for a cry from her granddaughter, who was asleep in the house. “Maybe in five years we'll go to Puerto Rico, but for now we like it here.” For the Calos and the thousands of other Puerto Rican families here who have bought homes or cooperative apartments or who have moved into middle‐income housing in the area, the Soundciew section—so called because of its proximity to East River and Coney Island Sound—represents a far cry from the crowded, vermin‐in fested tenements in East Harlem or the South Bronx where they were raised. In Soundview, in new one and two‐family homes with back yards and gardens, or in high‐rise apartment buildings with elevators, incinera tors and play areas for the children, they can live away from the noise, dirt and crime of their old neighbor hoods. In buildings with names such as Tower Gardens, Mark Twain, Cloverleaf Tow ers and Rosedale Gardens, they can live and raise their families with the assurance that they are in a better neighborhood and still close to their places of employ ment. The area, which is in the east central part of the Bronx, was once predominantly Ital ian and Jewish and contained hundreds of acres of what was once considered to be waste lands. Many former World War II soldiers will re member the area from the time that it housed hundreds of G.I. families in steel quon set huts, along what was then Eastern Boulevard, while there was a shortage of hous ing. Further east, toward Clason Point, goats grazed alongside mini‐farms, tended lovingly by wizened Italians who dreamed of home. Closer to the Pelham Bay subway line, two‐story, four‐ family homes and new‐law tenements met the needs of people of the rising Jewish and Italian middle class. Today, many of the older homes are owned by Puerto Rican families who are mak ing the move into middle income status. Young Puerto Rican lawyers and politicians have bought apartments in the cooperatives that are alongside what is now Bruck ner Expressway. On large sites, high‐rise middle‐income housing has been built and at least six 21‐story structures are going up. The smaller parcels of land have sprouted two‐fam ily row houses that sell for as much as $45,000. “This area has the greatest concentration of middle‐in come Puerto Ricans in the city,” according to Manuel Samalot, a real estate broker and builder. “When I first started selling houses in the area about 15 years ago, there were very few Puerto Ricans here, the area was predominantly Italian and Jewish. There were very few houses available to Puerto Ricans, so we started to buy property and build houses. Now I would say that the area is more than half Puerto Rican.” Mr. Samalot said that he had sold more than 1,500 to Puerto Ricans in the area bounded by the Bronx River, Castle Hill Avenue and West chester Avenue. He noted that as more and more Puerto Ricans scrape together the money for a down payment they are moving into the area and broadening its boundaries into the Parkchester and Unionport areas of the Bronx. “Many of them make fan tastic sacrifices to buy homes,” he said. “In many cases both parents have to work or they convert the ground‐floor playroom into a third apartment to be able to carry the payments.” For Emilio Mercado and his family, their apartment in Leland House, a middle income development at 945 Underhill Avenue, represents a dream come true. He was born in East Harlem and in the early nineteen‐forties his parents moved to Simpson Street in the Bronx to get away from the deplorable conditions in their old neigh borhood and to find a better area in which to raise their children. Emilio joined the Army when he was 151/2 years old, using his brother's name and birth certificate. When he was discharged in 1949 after serving three years, he re turned to Simpson Street, where he met his future wife, Priscilla. Without a high school di ploma, Emilio got a job as shipping clerk in a factory. Today, after 20 years with the concern, Rab Electrical Manu facturers, he is general man ager and on his salary of $15,000 a year is able to af ford the $193.60 a month rent for the family's comfortable apartment of five rooms. They have lived there for al most six years. Mr. Mercado devotes most of his sparetime to commu nity work and was recently elected to the Local School Board. “He's at meetings almost every night,” said Mrs. Mer cado, with a smile, “but he does find time to spend with the children.” The Mercados have three children who attend local public schools and are on the honor roll. The schools, Public School 100 and Inter mediate School 131, are con sidered among the best in the Bronx. Another resident of the area, Santos Figueroa, 53 years old, came to New York with his wife, Ana, in 1947 from San Juan. Eight years ago, Mr. Figu eroa opened a dry‐cleaning shop and a year later pur chased the necessary equip ment to open another such place. His wife and two children help run the stores. Mr. Figueroa uses the dry cleaning plant as a training school for neighborhood youngsters. “No one ever gave me a hand when I was a kid,” Mr. Figueroa said recently as he stood in the doorway of his shop at Gleason and St. Law rence Avenues. “I see so many of the kids today that are turning to drugs and are literally going down the drain that I just had to do something. I teach a couple of kids what I know and when they're ready I just give them a push and get another boy.” Mr. Figueroa is an active member of Blessed Sacra ment Roman Catholic Church, 1170 Beach Avenue, and is working with one of the local priests on a proposal to ex pand his shop into a regular school for pressers. The church itself reflects the changes in the neighbor hood. Until 12 years ago it had limited services in Italian Today there are masses in Spanish; there's a Spanish priest and all of the priests of the parish speak some Spanish. The Church of the Revela tion, a few blocks away on White Plains Road, still has weekly services in Italian and modern synagogues at test that Jewish families still live in the area. However, not everyone is happy with the area. It con tains thousands of units of low‐income housing, and many of the residents complain that children and adults from the projects as well as drug addicts prey on the middle‐income tenants, strip ping cars or breaking into milk dispensers and other coin‐operated machines in tbe basements. Some tenants from the older middle‐income housing have already moved away from the area or have put in applications for apartments in Co‐op City, a new develop ment under construction in the North Bronx.

787-> Isolated Outpost Is Home To Montagnard Families
DAKSEANG, South Vietnam, July 30 — The women among the 260 montagnard families sharing the dark, stifling bunk ers here say that they would not leave their husbands. It is a normal thing for wives and mothers to say, but Dakseang is an isolated camp a long rectangle of barbed wire bunkers, sandbags and howitz ers in the Central Highlands. eight miles from the border with Laos. There are 247 children liv ing in the bunkers—the well dressed ones wear Vietnamese Army shirts that fall to their ankles—and they kept still and hid though they were upset when Dakseang was under siege in April and May by 2,000 North Vietnamese. “We live here and we die here,” said a man named Uong, who is a platoon leader. The soldiers at Dakseang are nearly all montagnards — the generic name for tribesmen of the Central Highlands who are not of the same racial origin as the Vietnamese and who speak different languages. Most Vietnamese do not like the montagnards and call them moi —savages. “No Other Place to Go” “There is no other place to go,” Uong said. “We are out on operations for seven days and then we stay here for the next seven days.” Uong, who is 25 years old, lives in a bunker with his wife, his mother, his mother‐in‐law, three children, three of his younger brothers and a young er sister. His wife said she was fright ened during the fighting, but she insisted that she did not want to leave. The idea seemed to surprise her. “My son Is here,” Uong's mother said, as if it was plain that this was all that counted. Uong, who said his family was always on his mind during the fighting, said he would not send them away, even when the next attack comes — as he knows it will and as they know it will. His children will be all right, he added, for if life is not easy here, at least they are to gether. There was a school, but it was destroyed in April, and the men are too busy to teach the children to read and write. Most of the women do not know how. A 5‐year‐old boy climbing the sandbags near Uong's bunk er could not understand what, “peace” means. The word con fuses him, for he is not quite clear on what life without war is like. Some of the other children seem to share his con fusion. Not Much to a Village Dakseang was once a village, but there is no trace of it now. Villages in Vietnam are such frail collections of small huts, straw mats, old teapots and ancestral ties that they can easily be erased. The camp at Dakseang was established in August, 1966, by the United States Special Forces — one of 14 camps whose function is to gather in telligence and to halt enemy movement on supply trails. The montagnard soldiers are in the Civilian Irregular De fense Group. Originally re cruited, trained and led by the Special Forces, or Green Berets, they are still paid by the Amer icans although technically un der the command of the South Vietnamese Special Forces. Their future is uncertain. The United States Special Forces arc to leave South Vietnam by the end of the year. The Viet namese Special Forces, accord ing to Saigon, are to he in corporated into the Vietnamese Rangers, an elite volunteer group of infantrymen with spe cial training in commando war fare. The montagnards do not know what will happen. It is their pay that concerns them most, for their families are large and soldiers in Viet nam find it hard to make ends meet. The Americans pay them more than South Vietnam would, and they can just man age. Some of the montagnard soldiers are deserters, but they see no reason to worry about it, nor do they feel shame. A montagnard called Brai— it is not customary for a man to have more than one name— was a farmer before he joined the South Vietnam Regional Forces, whose soldiers are as signed to their home districts, or regions. “They did not let me go on leave when my mother died so I deserted,” he said. “She died of malaria, as my father had. I did not desert with my weapon or ammunition or equipment. Another reason why I deserted is that the com pany commander often beat us. So did other officers.” Afraid of arrest by the Gov ernment, he joined the defense group. A Talk With the Berets The 11 Green Berets of the advisory team are not men who talk easily with strangers and they dislike civilians. They suspect questions, even inno cent ones, which make them even more suspicious. They do not seem at ease with the 14 members of the South Viet namese Special Forces. The Green Berets seem bored—and able to stand anything but boredom. When they talk of the mon tagnards—uncorrupted by the cities, physically superior to most South Vietnamese, less sophisticated in their outlook— the Americans are fiercely pos sessive. They remind a visitor of the manner in which the British military once talked of the Gurkhas of Nepal. Because the Green Berets en joy their own toughness, they appreciate some of the more primitive aspects of the monta gnards’ habits. They even ex aggerate them, and they hope the montagnards will never change. A young lieutenant has a dog that he never lets off a leash except when it ig in his lap. “Well,” he said, “if I let it loose the Yards would’ eat it For sure. Wouldn't want that to happen.”

788-> AMERICAN YACHTS SCORE 2D SWEEP
NEWPORT, R. I., June 16— The second of four races in the international team sailing for the Onion Patch Trophy pro duced another sweep of the first three places for the United States today, but again the of ficial outcome was inconclusive. The American yachts, Pat Haggerty's Bay Bea, Richard S. Nye's Carina and John Potter's Equation, placed in that order on corrected time. Probably none of the opposition from Argentina, Bermuda and Eng land could upset the standing of two straight victories for the American side, but because measurement certificates for yachts of each of the foreign teams continued to be missing, nobody could be sure. There will be another race off here tomorrow and on Sat urday the race to Bermuda with the concluding Onion Patch Trophy competition as a part will begin. This afternoon's 18‐mile event was round a triangle that in cluded a beat, reach and run in light to faint air that began out of south by west. The three American yachts almost com pleted the final leg abeam of each other under spinnakers, then struggled across the line under genoas for the last sev eral hundred yards in a dying, short‐lived easterly. The only yacht near them at the end was Argentina's Juana and she held down fourth place when David Stackpole, the Ida Lewis Yacht Club's vice com modore and a member of its race committee, computed time allowances for eight of the 12 starters that had measurement certificates. The only English yacht with such a document was David Low's Lutine, a new stock fiberglass boat that placed fifth after an opening fourth place in the 175‐mile race from Oyster Bay, L. I. ??

789-> Classes at Washington High Resume With Police Patrols
Classes at George Washing ton High School resumed yes terday with teachers and the police patrolling the corridors of the school, which has been plagued with disturbances for more than two weeks. Only half of the school's 4,000 students were reported in attendance, and teachers checked students' credentials as they entered the building, at 193d Street and Audubon Ave nue in Washington Heights. About 100 of the students who did not attend classes were at State Supreme Court in Foley, Square as Justice Thomas Dickens reserved de cision on a Board of Education request for an injunction against parents who have been demanding that a grievance table be set up in the lobby of the school. Mrs. Jacquelin McCord, third vice president of the triumver ate of vice presidents that rums the school's parents association and one of the leaders of the parents' drive for the table, said that they would take no action until Justice Dickens made his decision. “We have no intention of being charged with contempt, of the injunction against us,” she said after the hearing. “We want it known that we will obey the restraining order against us until a decision has1 been rendered.” When asked if she would urge the students to return to classes pending the court's de cision, she said the restrain ing order prevented her from doing that. “The activities of the stu dents remains in the hands of the administration,” she said. Allen Hodge, vice president of the Student Government Or ganization, said that the stu dents would not return to classes and that they would hold a rally today outside the school. “Peace cannot come to George Washington while the students and parents are ha rassed and the teachers are given more rights and better treatment,” he said. Attempts to reach Sol Levine, the school's fourth principal this month, proved fruitless, with his office saying that he would have no statements. The chronology of events, as stated in papers filed with the court by both sides, begins early in February when some parents of students in the school, approached school offi cials asking that a table, manned by parent volunteers, be set up to hear student com plaints. “The proponents of this plan viewed themselves as an inde pendent entity empowered to render assistance directly where possible, in other cases to direct pupils to appropriate school offices, and to them selves demand action on par ticular complaints. “Increasing controversy arose over this proposal. The teachers and school authorities were concerned that an unsu pervised ‘parents' table’ would interfere with the normal guid ance functions of the school, would create new pressures that the school was ill‐equipped to handle and would in general encourage disorder. The pro ponents accepted no limitations on their proposed activities.” In their counterclaim the parents state: “We envision the table as a place where students could come with questions about pro grams, about drugs, about any thing that was troubling them. We would try to get the infor mation they needed to them, either by directing them to the appropriate staff person, or by obtaining the information from the principal or proper outside agency and referring it to the students. We saw the table as a place where students could bring their grievances and get some action.” On March 6, after daily dis turbances at the school, Dr. Seelig L. Lester, Deputy Super intendent of Schools, issued a statement (under duress — the board's papers say) accepting the proposal for the table and agreeing that “volunteer par ents and students will assist in screening intruders coming into the building, in offering a service to the students where by complaints which are to be brought to the administration will be brought through the parent and student volunteers, and we accept this offer of as sistance.” Following a teacher boycott of classes, on March 9 Dr. Irving Anker, Acting Superin tendent of Schools, modified the agreement signed by Mr. Lester. In a memorandum to Carl Cherkis, the acting principal— Louis Simon, who had become acting principal on March 3, re signed when the agreement was reached — Mr. Anker said that the commitment to set up the table should be honored, but that “this assistance is to con centrate on helping direct par ents and visitors, on reporting possible intruders and clearing the main lobby so pupils will go to classes.” Parents and students viewed this as an “emasculation” of the agreement. They set up the table in the lobby of the school, and accepted complaints from students, forwarding them to the principal's office. They operated the table for three days and say that they re ceived 130 complaints. On March 11, they were or dered to close the table. The following day they slept in the principal's office overnight and on Friday disturbances re sumed.

790-> Market Place
HILE the Nixon Admin istration expresses con fidence that the slowdown in the nation's economy has been tamed—that the slow down is neither too deep nor too shallow—concern exists at some private observation points that the decline is deepening unduly. You will hear dour com ments if you plug into Sind linger & Co. for example, where the confidence level of both executives and the com mon man is constantly meas ured. For the week ended last Friday, the Sindlinger in dex of executive confidence (among the men who have an important influence on busi ness decisions that make the economy perk or fizzle) was down to a low point of 50.9 per cent. This index was at 55.2 per cent a week before, and it had been going up gradually for three weeks. The previous low point was on March 6 when the index rested at 52 per cent. * Meanwhile, people like us lost some of our normal op timism. The index of every man kept by Sindlinger slipped to 62.6 per cent from 63.5 per cent a week earlier. Albert E. Sindlinger, who keeps the index, tends to as sume the attitude of the con sensus—or so it would ap pear. In a telephone interview yesterday he sounded un usually dour. “What I'm concerned about is that a month ago people thought President Nixon's biggest problem was infla tion,” he said. “Now the peo ple we have polled see the biggest danger as recession. Recession is a three‐to‐one choice over inflation as Nix on's No. 1 problem. “To me, the data I have collected result in chart pat terns similar to those of 1957 and 1960. You will recall that we were then headed into re cessions.” * If you thought the 1969 bear market was bad you should consider the bear mar ket of January, 1970. The Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., of Larchmont, N. Y., points out just how severe the January decline was, noting that shrinkage in common stock values on the Big Board alone last year was $61‐billionan average of $5‐billion a month. But in the single month of January, 1970, the market was thrown for a loss of $45.5‐billion, or nine times the average monthly loss shown in all 1969. Fortunately, Capital Gains notes, there was a February rally that carried Big Board stock prices back up $32.8‐ billion. Nevertheless, this still left stock prices lower by $73.5‐billion than at their 1968 year‐end close. Capital Gains goes on to take issue with mutual fund managers who measure their performance against the Dow Jones industrial average. Ope fund manager said his net asset value per share—adjust ed for capital gains distribu tions—had risen 90 per cent in 10 years compared with a Dow‐Jones rise of 17,8 ter cent in the same period. “That incredibly small ?? year increase in the Deft bugged us because we knew from our own figures that the general market — meas ured in dollar values—had more than doubled in those 10 years from $301‐billion to $607‐billion,” Capital Gains comments. “Furthermore, we also discovered that while the widely publicized Dow average was advancing 17.8 per cent in 10 years, the New York Stock Exchange's own composite index of all com mon stocks had risen 60 per cent.” The Armco Steel Corpora tion's regular stock‐option plan has not worked too well for key officials of the Mid dletown, Ohio, steelmaker. The proxy statement an nouncing the annual meeting in Middletown for April 16 notes that none of the top officers has taken up a single share. It would appear to be too late to move under this plan, for the time being anyway, because the prices on the options are well above the present market. The presi dent, C. William Verity Jr., is entitled to 20,000 shares under the plan. An execu tive vice president, D. E. Reichelderfer, is entitled to 12,000 shares. Another ex ecutive vice president,. Harry Holiday Jr., also is entitled to 12,000 shares. All of these options are at an average of $30.46875 a share. All direc tors and officers as a group can buy up to 162,200 shares at an average option price of $30.1932 share. But the stock is well below that level. It closed yester day at 26, down 1/8. Now the proxy statement has an alternate plan that could help—although it ap parently does not get the special tax benefits that are extended to qualified option plans. The alternative plan (which Armco probably did not in vent) substitutes equal amounts of stock for every man qualified under the orig inal plan. Trouble is, the stock is priced under the al ternative plan at the market on Jan. 23, the date it went into effect. On that day Armco stock closed at $26 a share, the same as yester day.

796-> 1 IN 4 IS ENROLLED IN MEDICAID HERE
Nearly one of every four persons in New York City was authorized to get help under the Medicaid program as of the start of this year—1,903,810 persons, or 23.5 per cent of an estimated 8.110.000 residents. A just‐published state study showed that an average of 591,798 residents received help on their medical costs during 1969. Two‐thirds of these were also relief recipients, and the rest were considered too poor to pay their own medical bills. The total medical spending on their behalf during the year was $692,510,531, and the benefit payment for each per son enrolled averaged $377.45, according to the new program analysis by the State Depart ment of Social Services. Of the total cost, 38.3 per cent was federally paid and 30.8 per cent was paid by the state and the same percentage by the city. More than half the Medicaid spending in the city went for hospital bills, as follows: ?? Just over 5 per cent went to other care. The study reported a state wide total of 2,719,835 persons authorized for Medicaid, or 14.9 per cent of an estimated 18,261.537 residents, including the city eligibles, as of the start of the year. The total included 1,416,487 persons on relief rolls, includ ing 1,039.272 in New York City, and I,303,348 other medi cally needy, incuding 864,538 in the city. Statewide, the actual beneficiaries averaged 958,236 a month during 1969, including 530,910 relief recipients. Of the total spending of $1,028,726,380 during the year, 40.7 per cent was paid by the Federal Gov ernment, 29.7 per cent by the state and 27.3 per cent by municipal governments. The study attributed its city and state population estimates to the State Health Depart ment, calculated as of last July. The State Commerce Depart ment was cited as estimating individual income during 1968 for all residents as $4,151 state wide—$4,346 for New York City and $3,454 upstate. The Social Services. Depart ment reported Medicaid bene fits for all persons enrolled statewide as averaging $380.33 during 1969, including $386.41 for people upstate. Of the statewide beneficiaries, 28.9 per cent were children and 19.3 per cent were adults involved In aid to dependent children. Of the rest, 23.2 per cent were aged 65 or older; 9.5 per cent were disabled; 0.3 per cent were blind and 18.7 per cent were other adults.

797-> City to Ban Meter Parking In Midtown by November
Daytime parking of passenger cars at all 1,000 metered spots in mid‐Manhattan will be banned by next Thanksgiving at the latest, Traffic Commissioner Theodore Karagheuzoff said yesterday. He made the forecast as he happily watched traffic move rapidly on First and Second Avenues between 34th and 72d Streets, where private ‐ car parking was barred on the bus lane side from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. and the most stringent no‐stop ping rule was ordered between 7 and 10 A.M. and between 4 and 7 P.M., also on the bus lane. The ban on First and Second Avenue is only the forerunner of the elimination of every legal parking space for passenger cars between First and Ninth Avenues from 34th to 72d Street, the Commissioner indi cated. On the other avenues, the north‐south boundaries will vary as conditions dictate, he said. And he conceded that on some peripheral side streets, where congestion impedes mov ing traffic, stricter rules also might be ordered. The new plan, suggested in basic form by Mayor Lindsay, was viewed by traffic officials as the opening wedge of a concerted program to bar all private cars from daytime street parking in the heart of Manhattan. Mr. Karagheuzoff estimated that the elimination of the meters would cost the city about $300,000 a year in revenue, but he said that it was “a small price to pay for moving goods and people more quickly.” The problem of removing the meter heads is purely one of manpower, the Commissioner said, adding: “We just can't do it all in one week.” As he watched the traffic move under the new strict parking rules on First and Second Avenues, Mr. Karagheu zoff made notes and said: “I don't believe it.” At first his data showed a speedup time of as much as 50 per cent, but he arbitrarily ruled that this was too great to be accurate. After working a slide rule for a few minutes he said the traffic speedup was “at least 25 per cent on average.” But drivers and riders liked the new First and Second Ave nue rule; motorists on through trips did, too. Most truckers also liked the rule, for it frees the bus curb lane for pickups and deliveries between 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. Some store managers were unhappy, because the no‐stop ping rule at peak periods meant delivery problems, particularly with bread and milk, which have to be in early. Mr. Karag heuzoff said he thought the new rule was “a workable com promise,” for while it prevent ed deliveries on the avenues during rush hours, this was balanced by easier access to curb space for delivery trucks during midday. The bus lane of northbound First Avenue is on the east side, and on southbound Sec ond Avenue it is on the west side. It is on these sides of the avenues that the meters will be removed immediately. Be cause of a shortage of man power, it will be another week or 10 days before they are re moved on the remaining sides. However, Mr. Karagheuzoff said that near the Queensboro Bridge and the entrance to the Queens‐Midtown Tunnel, all standing by cars on Second Avenue is to be barred for about four blocks. Meters in those areas will be removed as soon as possible. In a before‐and‐after check, Traffic Department enginders said that based on time runs, a trip that took 11 to 14 min utes last winter now was a five‐to‐six‐minute “breeze.” All private car parking is now banned on unmetered Fifth and Madison Avenues from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. Mr. Karagheuzoff said this rule, probably would be amended soon to bar standing, in accord ance with the, new, more drastic midtown program. The first day's test on Sec ond Avenue was marred at the peak period last evening by a fire between 56th and 57th Streets. As a result, it took eight minutes to cover the 34th to‐72d Street trip, while on First Avenue, where flow was “normal,” the, journey was being made in five minutes. While the immediate plan calls only for eliminating metered parking, it was indi cated by traffic engineers that this “could be the beginning of the end” for all daytime street parking in Manhattan—metered or unrnetered — from possibly 72d Street south to the Battery, from river‐to‐river. Mr. Karagheuzoff merely said: “Let's take one thing at a time.” Compliance with the new First and Second Avenue rule was reported good. “Maybe because metermaids were out in force,” the Com missioner suggested. A random check with store owners brought this consensus: “If it helps traffic, it helps business.”

799-> Twins Top Orioles, 4‐2, as Killebrew's Double Scores Deciding Run in 8th
BALTIMORE, May 2 (AP)— Harmon Killebrew's two‐out dupble in the eigth inning drove in Minny Mendoza with the deciding run today as the Minnesota Twins posted a 4‐2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Mendoza, pinch‐hitting for the pitcher, Jim Perry, singled with one out to start Minne sota's winning rally after Perry and Mike Cuellar of the Orioles had waged a strong mound duel for seven innings. With two out, Leo Cardenas moved Mendoza to second with a single before Killebrew deliv ered his key hit. Cuellar was removed after he intentionally walked Tony Oliva and the Twins pushed across an insurance run when an Oriole relief hurler, Eddie Watt, hit Brant Alyea with a pitch. The Orioles had taken a 1‐0 lead in the first inning on Paul Blair's sacrifice fly. George Mitterwald blasted his first home run with a man aboard to give the Twins the lead in the second, but Boog Powell tied it in the Baltimore sixth with his sixth homer. The victory was Perry's fourth in five decisions while Cuellar's won‐lost record slipped to 3‐2.     R.H.E.  Minn. 020 000 02 0‐1 8 0 Balt. 10 0 0 01 000‐2 6 0 Batteries—Perry, Perranoski (8) and Mitterwald; Cuellar, Watt (8) and Hendricks. BOSTON, May 2 (UPI) —Jim Fregosi's two ‐ run double was the highlight of a three‐run Cal ifornia Angels' rally in the sev enth inning today that gave the Angels a 8‐4 victory and broke a five ‐ game Boston Red Sox winning streak. Errors by Luis Alvarado and Ray Jarvis set up the Angel rally. After Fregosi doubled, Alex Johnson singled him home. The three unearned runs gave a California reliever, Greg Garrett, his first major league victory. Rico Petrocelli drove in all four Boston runs with a three‐ run homer in the first and a sacrifice fly in the third. The homer was his fourth of the season. The Angels, trailing by 4‐0, got three runs in the fourth on singles by Sandy Alomar and Fregosi, a balk by the Boston starter, Vicente Romo, Jim Spencer's triple and a single by bill Voss. Singles by Johnson and Spen cer drove Romo out in the sixth end the tying run scored as Ken McMullen hit into a double play. Roger Repoz hit a homer in the ninth for the other Angel Batteries Wright, Garret (4), O'Donoghue (6), Tatum (7) and Azcue; Romo, Jarvis (6), Brett (7), Phillips (9) and Moses.

800-> Book Tells of America's Cup Defense
Anybody wishing to spend over $700,000 on the de sign, construction and equip ment of a 12‐meter yacht and the care and feeding of a crew is urged to read “De fending the America's Cup,” a new book written from in terviews with those who made Intrepid the successful 1967 defender against Aus tralia's Dame Pattie. There were 15 authors, and Rob ert W. Carrick, the editor, taped 250,000 words from them, then boiled what was said down to 60,000. Stanley Z. Rosenfeld supplied 114 photographs. The book (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, publisher; 187 pages, $12.50) differs from others on the subject in that the emphasis is less on the sailing of races than on the endless details and problems that go into the creation of a defender. The book covers the time when Bill Straw bridge, who became manager, got the idea in 1965 and or ganized a syndicate to the September day two years later when Bus Mosbacher steered the defender to her fourth easy victory off New port. As the introduction says, “Defending the America's Cup” is more a story of peo ple than events and the taped talks impart a flavor of easy going informality and some times humor. Carrick's skill ful blending gives the impres sion of a group discussion in which what every man says flows naturally into what was said before. But all 15 were interviewed sep arately, and piecing the parts together wasn't easy, Car rick said privately. Mosbacher gave four hours of his time, the editor said. The skipper tells of the ceaseless pressure of sailing a cup contender. (We had a great boat in Intrepid, but that just increased the pres sure because there was no excuse for losing.) He says that a man who can sail a frostbite dinghy well can sail anything well and that “the less you use the wheel, the better off you are. I have al ways felt that a good boat will go faster steering her self, or nearly so.” The most significant sin gle statement is made by Olin Stephens, the designer. Without meaning to, he probably tells at least part ly why the French went to the expense of building a brand new American‐de signed 12‐meter, Chancegger, as a trial horse for their own challenge candidate France. Speaking of Intrepid having Constellation in such a role for testing sails, Ste phen says: “I believe it was ever so much better having Constel lation than the kind of boats we've had in the past. The new Twelves could sail cir cles around older boats like Nyala and Nereus, so it was pretty hard to be sure one sail was better than anoth er. But when the trial horse Is a good, modern boat in its own right, then I think you can see much more quickly if anything is wrong. There wasn't much wrong with Intrepid, but certainly there were some sails that it was good to have a sensi were better than others, so tive indicator.”

801-> Sergei Denham
ERGEI DENHAM, who died Jan. 30, at 73, pro vided a small but none theless significant foot note to the history of Ameri can dance. Born in Moscow, he settled in the United States after the revolution, and worked both here and in Europe. His connection with ballet started in 1938 and did not end until 1966. It was in 1938 that Denham became a direc tor of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, one of the em igré Russian dance troupes that helped spread the pop ularity of ballet in Europe and America during the thir ties. At first the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo was based primarily in Monte Carlo, Paris and London, but even before the European war in 1939 it had toured the Unit ed States. During the war years it settled down to become virtually an American company, and in this form it survived—with a few disrup tions—until 1962, although in the later years the company rarely played in New York. Three years ago Denham tried to start the company again in Monte Carlo. But the time for it was past and the venture ended in a speedy failure. He seems to have been a picturesque character—oddly enough I neither met him nor saw his company—and Agnes de Mille has written reveal ingly of him in her dance classic “Dance to the Piper.” His importance as an impre sario and entrepreneur might well be compared with that of the late Col. Wassily de Basil. Both men helped to bring ballet to new publics. They were pioneers of ballet as a popular art form rather than ballet as a minority entertainment. Of course in the history books the names of the peo ple who built up permanent institutions—the Balanchines, the Kirsteins, the Chases, the Joffreys — always loom largest. Yet the popularizers, the businessmen, and, yes, the traveling salesmen, these too have their place. As I say, I never met Denham, but I have a feeling that he loved the dance. And he did a good job for it.

802-> 2 TEACHER UNIONS ON COAST MERGING
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 5 — The two teachers' unions in Los An geles, with a school district second in size only to New York's, announced today an agreement to merge. If members of the Los An geles Association of Classroom Teachers and Local 1021 of the American Federation of Teach ers ratify the agreement, the organizations would be consoli dated Feb. 1 into the United Teachers‐Los Angeles. The new organization would represent more than 80 per cent of the city's 25,000 class room teachers. The merger would be the first of major urban affiliates of the National Education As sociation and the American Federation of Teachers, which is a member of the A.FL..C.I.O. About 1,800 teachers in Flint, Mich., merged last October in the first consolidation of the two ??ucation organizations. The two state teachers' groups in Massachusetts are talking about the possibility of a merg er and in recent months, there has developed a movement to ward consolidation in other areas of the country, particu larly in urban areas. A merger of the tational unions would create the largest trade union in the world with 1.8 million members. The United Teachers‐Los An geles would be affiliated with both the National Education Ascsociation and its state branch, the California Teachers Association, and with the Cali fornia Federation of Teachers. Members of the merged union would be given the option of joining an affiliate. Leaders of the two merged unions expressed militance in commenting on the agreement. Bob Ransom, president of the Los Angeles Association of Classroom Teachers, asserted that “the school board and cen tral administration will no long er be able to frustrate teachers by pitting one organization against the other.” Los Angeles teachers do not have a contract now. The two groups staged the city's first school strike on two days last September and have a tentative agreement with the school board that the administration will consider a written proposal sometime this spring. But the unions assert that California law provides no mechanism for collective bar gaining, simply requiring school boards to “meet and confer” with teacher organizations. The merger agreement came after two months of discus sions. Under the plan, Mr. Ransom will become president of United Teachers. Larry Sibel man, head of Local 1021 of the American Federation of Teach ers, will be executive vice president of the new organiza tion. Members of the two groups will be polled separately on ratification of the merger agreement during the week be ginning Jan. 18.

805-> friedmanism, n. Doctrine of most audacious U.S. economist; esp., theory “only money matters”
HALF‐JOCULARLY, Milton Fried man says that his favorite country in the world is Japan, because he's such a tall man there. Friedman admits unhappily to being just 5 feet 3, but adds that when he was an undergraduate he measured at least 5 feet 4½. He's been squashed down since then, he says. But if Milton Friedman has been squashed down in height, that's sure ly about all. In economics, he is certainly the most irrepressible, out spoken, audacious, provocative and inventive thinker in the United States —and even at 5 feet 3, he may stand taller than all his colleagues in the profession. When the Nobel Prize is next awarded for econom ics, it is regarded as even money that Milton Friedman will win it. Nonetheless, it's hard to get re sponsible people, whether in aca demia or in government, to acknowl edge that they've been influenced by Friedman. He is disturbing, if only because of his contempt for the conventional economic wisdom. He is too aggressive in challenging the premises themselves of long‐stand ing economic policy. He's just too damned radical. And, in many circles, the fact that he was tied up with Barry Goldwater during the 1964 campaign doesn't recommend him either. Still, there is no doubt that at Harvard and M.I.T., where he considered a heretic, to say nothing of the University of Chicago, where he is the chief luminary of the “Chicago school” of economics, his ideas have had an enormous impact. Meanwhile, down in Washington, the people who make policy have begun to realize that there might be a lot of good sense in what Milton Fried man's been saying. Currently, the doctrines known as Friedmanism are engaged in major assault upon the Federal Reserve System, the high church of economic orthodoxy. The Fed is the issuing authority for the nation's money. It is empowered to regulate the supply of money in circulation —usually defined as actual currency, plus checking‐ account balances — through such devices as the sale and purchase of Government bonds, the setting of reserve requirements for banks, or even the actual printing of bills. It also exercises certain lever age over the use of this money by influencing the interest rate at which credit flows. The Fed's goal is to contribute to economic stability, normally by “lean ing against the wind,” a wind which may be inflationary in some cases and deflationary in others. Friedman ism shares this goal but contends that the Fed has been going after it backwards. Friedman argues that the Fed has blundered by tinkering with interest rates to stabilize the economy. In stead, the Fed should conceatrate on regulating the quantity of money itself and let interest rates fall where tney may. Friedman says the Fed's preoccupation with interest rates is not useless merely; it is positively harmful. In fact, he goes a step fur ther by arguing that not only interest rates but Federal fiscal policy itself— that is, Federal spending and taxa tion—have a negligible impact on economic stability. This rather extreme view—which holds that taxes, spending and inter est rates do not compare in impor tance with the size of the money supply—has been designated, chiefly by its disgruntled opponents, as Friedman's “Only money matters” doctrine. Friedman seized upon this doc trine in the course of preparing, with Dr. Anna Schwartz, the book called “A Monetary History of the United States,” now recognized as a classic in the literature of economics. From the data he accumulated, he made the observation that economic in stability over the past century has been the consequence principally of abrupt fluctuations in the money sup ply. During the Great Depression of the nineteen‐thirties, for example, the Federal Reserve Board allowed the quantity of money in circulation to shrink by more than a third, with disastrous results. From these obser vations, Friedman concluded that the Fed should aim to keep the money supply stable—or have it increase (via a fixed rule laid down by Con gress) at a steady percentage to keep with economic. MILTON Friedman's reputation as a provocateur waxes by the mo ment as this doctrine makes headway in the corridors of power, particular ly in the Fed, which changes chair men this week. But because Friedman, at 57, is the reigning “monetarist” in the United States, it should by no means be assumed that his disruptive ideas stop there. His mind ranges across the entire field of economics and spills over into politics itself. To him, virtually no concept, no institu tion, no personality is sacrosanct. When he was a 21‐year‐old grad uate student at the University of Chi cago, he emerged from a couple of days in a sickbed with a corrective of the work of Prof. Arthur C. Pigou of Cambridge, one of the leading economists of the day, which was published in the eminent Quarterly Journal of Economics. Ever since, he's been a gadfly, but because his capacity to nettle is matched by an indisputable scholarly brilliance, he could never quite be ignored. Some say his most significant work is not on Monetarism at all, nor on political economics, but in an ab struse book meant only for the ex perts called “A Theory of the Con sumption Function,” which showed that consumption, in the short run, tends to remain constant despite sharp fluctuations in income. Though it may be true that Friedman is at his best in technical economics, he has not become a major public figure because of his esoteric economic the ories. Rather, it is because he is will ing to leave his ivory tower and, in behalf of ideas that are dear to him, come out scrapping. HE was born in Brooklyn of Jew ish immigrant parents and raised in Rahway, N. J., where his father did sweatshop work that provided a mar ginal income for the family. When he reached college age, he won scholarship to nearby Rutgers and came to the attention of a young economics professor named Arthur Burns, who recognized in him a su perior mind. Friedman also came un der the influence of a young profes sor named Homer Jones, who had brought with him from the University of Chicago certain ideas about how to rescue the country from the De pression through a selective return to laissez‐faire economics. Friedman, who at first specialized in math, acknowledges that it was Burns who steered him into eco nomics, while it was Jones who had the greatest impact on his early in tellectual development. Jones, he says, steered him to the grad uate school at the University of Chicago. —At 57, he practically a school of economics by himself. “Although the chief current target of his arguments is the Fed eral Reserve System, it should by no means be assumed that his disruptive ideas stop there.” BUT much as his brilliance was recognized, Friedman was far from an immediate suc cess in the intellectual world. Leaving Chicago, he had dif ficulty getting a university position. Some academic man darins maintained that he was more interested in being dar ing than thorough, and there was some truth to the charge. Others considered him exces sively aggressive, a compen sation, friends observed, for his small stature and uncome ly visage. In at least one in stance, and probably more, he was a victim of academic. So, from the mid‐nineteen thirties to the end of World War II, Friedman held a vari ety of Government jobs, and for a time it appeared he would end up a government statistician. Thanks to Arthur Burns, he was given a staff appointment at the National Bureau of Economic Research, where he worked full‐time at scholarship from 1936 to 1940. But apart from one year on campus, during which he was the subject of a bitter intra faculty fight, it was not until 1945 that he got his first teaching post, at the Univer sity of Minnesota; and only the following year that he was invited to return, with faculty status, to the Univer sity of Chicago. Apart from various visiting professor ships, it is there that he has remained since. Because he has championed economic freedom in an age when the left has put its faith in Government intercession— whether of the Marxian or the Keynesian variety — Milton Friedman has inevitably been considered a “right‐wing” economist, an impression seemingly confirmed by his association with Goldwater in 1964. But if the term “right‐wing” implies an inordinate sym pathy for the vested interests of society, along with a high degree of indulgence for ex isting socal institutions, then nothing could be further from the truth. Friedman is no Chamber of Commerce eco nomist, and surely no Bircher. Whatever the classical foun dations of his thinking, he professes ideas that are warmly social and espouses programs that are, within the framework of our time, gen uinely radical. Friedman may not be a pure egalitarian, but he has no tolerance for a sys tem of government that pro claims programs to help the poor but winds up with a structure that enriches the rich. It's been said there is some thing anomalous in Friedman's denial of the responsibility of government for establishing social and economic justice— a responsibility rather com monly acknowledged by to day's Jewish intellectuals. Friedman does not conceal the influence of Jewish social thought, as well as his own impoverished upbringing, on his intellectual development. He rejects the contention that he lacks the concern common to so many Jews for humani tarian ends. But he says that Jewish intellectuals often for get that a Jewish community survived for 2,000 years in the Western world because it was able to carve out for itself a niche in the free market. So he believes that the underprivileged and the poor in our own day have far better opportunities to im prove their status in a fluid, competitive system than un der a paternalistic bureau cracy that preserves the status quo in the name of justice. AT the heart of the Fried man principles, then, is a deep cynicism about the processes of government, founded large ly on the judgment that men are essentially incompetent or venal, if not _both. In a way, the feeling goes back to Montesquieu and Jefferson during the Enlightenment, and to Lord Acton in the last century. But if Montesquieu, Jeffer son and Acton feared political tyranny, Friedman's preoccu pation is chiefly with eco nomic tyranny. He simply does not believe that a gov ernmental system can be de vised which will not be taken over by vested economic in terests and exploited for the preservation and enhance ment of their own wealth. He concludes, then, that individ ual opportunity is best served when the power of govern ment is least. Despite the favor he has found among many conserva tives and right‐wingers, Fried man has sometimes contem plated characterizing himself as a “philosophical anarchist.” The term, however, is proba bly too strong. It is enough to say that he would organize his society on the basis of individual economic freedom, curbed by government only to the degree necessary to keep markets free, competi tion open and innocent by standers unharmed. This essentially anti‐Govern ment approach appealed strongly to Goldwater in 1964 and in the course of several meetings together he borrowed heavily from Fried man without ever accepting the Friedmanite cosmology in toto. Four years later Richard Nixon, though more conventional in his economic thinking, also turned occasion ally to Friedman for ideas. If the press has tended to exag gerate Friedman's personal in fluence on both men, neither of whom he saw very often, Friedman himself makes no apologies for voting Republi can and giving advice to one or the other. However differ ent his social objectives may be from theirs, he reasons that they are more likely than liberal Democrats to build a system that approximates his ideals. MOST of Friedman's for mulations on the political economy were laid out earlier in this decade in a book called “Capitalism and Freedom” (known by the wags as “Capi talism and Friedman”). Many members of the economics community regard it as a shameless political tract, un worthy of a scholar. But Friedman, while acknowledg ing it as a popular and not an academic work, is extreme ly proud of it. He has named his summer home “Capitaf” in its honor. He is pleased that it is collateral reading in eco nomics at many colleges and that, in paperback, it sells tens of thousands of copies every year. Many of the ideas Friedman conveys in platform talks and in the column he now writes every third week for News week first appeared in “Capi talism and Freedom.” Taken as a whole, it unfurls the Friedmanite cosmology. Ex amined in parts, it provides interesting and useful hypo theses for solving some of the country's most puzzling poli tico‐economic problems. Friedman's prescription for maintaining the economy vig orously competitive, thereby striking at privilege and serv ing the consumer, is an odd melange of ideas previously heard from both left and right. He would abolish pro tective tariffs (left), oil sub sidies and quotas (left), and farm ‐ price supports (right). He would abolish corporate income taxes (right), but he would require corporations to attribute all their earnings to stockholders, who would be taxed on them at the regular rather than the capi tal‐gains rate (left), and he would discourage amassing of great reserves as a temptation to gobbling up other com panies. He would deprive the regula tory agencies of their rate setting powers (right), without impairing safety regulations (left), in order to encourage more price competition within such industries as securities, airlines and railroads, and he would open radio and tele vision licenses to public bid ding (left). He would repeal such codes as would require auto manufacturers to install seat belts, on the grounds that individual purchasers can make that decision (right), but he would retain such re quirements as the installation of antipollution devices, on the grounds that these devices protect the rights of third parties (left). Friedman acknowledges that in the case of natural monop olies, such as the telephone system, there is no ideal means of maintaining com petition. But so great is his distrust of bureaucrats that he concludes that, in prefer ence to a public corporation or a regulated industry, it is better to take a chance with private monopoly. His formula for dealing with poverty is, perhaps, even more daring—though it is the one that the Government, under President Nixon, has come closest to adopting. Friedman, once asked what he thought was the best way to help the poor, replied, “Give them money.” To im plement this simple idea, he devised the now celebrated plan for a negative income tax, which would put money into the hands of the poor without their having to pass through a labyrinthine wel fare apparatus. But as Friedman sees it, the negative income tax would change little, unless accom panied by other basic reforms. What he proposes is to do away with the bureaucracy not only of welfare but of the war on poverty, urban renew al, Medicare, minimum wage and even Social Security itself. The Social Security system, cornerstone of the New Deal's program for social justice, particularly irritates him. Fi nanced by a “regressive” sys tem of taxation, it takes from the poor at a much more onerous rate than from the rich, yet rewards the rich more generously than the poor. Similarly, Friedman says that Federal housing pro grams—which bulldoze away the homes of the poor while subsidizing mortgages on the homes of the rich—are basi cally discriminatory and un just. As for the minimum wage, Friedman figures that it rigs the market place in favor of the upper echelons of the labor force, and drives the old and the young, whose market value is below the legal minimum, completely out of work. Friedman is frank to admit that he does not, in principle, approve of a system that takes money from some citi zens to give it to others, whether the beneficiaries are rich or poor. He feels it is an impingement on freedom and, if he had his way, the poor would be supported by private volunteer charity. But he acknowledges that reliance on charity would be impractical, if not inhumane, and, as he sees it, the negative income tax is the best alter native. As long as it provides the poor with a livable in come, while presenting them with built‐in incentives to work, their buying power would assure them an ade quate diet, decent medical care and suitable housing. Furthermore, he says, freed of oppressive bureaucracies, they could make their own spending decisions and, hav ing an impact on the law of supply and demand, influence the market place to meet their needs. EDUCATION, too, Fried man would open to the com petition of the market. Like most Americans, he observes that the quality of the public schools has declined disas trously in our time, even though billions in new funds have been spent upon them. The chief victim of this in feriority in educational op portunity, he points out, is not the rich but the poor. “Let a poor family in a slum have a gifted child,” he says, “and let it set a high value on his schooling.... The ‘good’ public schools are in the high income neighborhoods. The family might be willing to spend something in addition to what it pays in taxes to get better schooling for its child. But it can hardly afford simultaneously to move to the expensive neighborhood. ... Our present school system, far from equalizing opportu nity, very likely does just the opposite.” What Friedman wants to do is to break the virtual monopoly of the educational bureaucracy over mass schooling in the United States. To achieve this end, Friedman would grant for each school age child a “voucher” good for a certain sum of money, preferably equal to the aver age per capita cost of public education. A family would then be empowered to present this voucher either at the nearest public school or at the private school of its choice, where it would serve as full or partial tuition payment. Such a system, he says, would at once encourage competent educators to build a network of private schools, which would then compete for stu dents against the public schools—giving both a posi tive incentive to maintain a high level of quality. The Government's role in this plan would be to enforce certain minimum standards, perhaps including a prohibi tion of racial discrimination. Otherwise, it would leave the private schools free to cater (be “responsive”) to the needs and peculiarities of their stu dent bodies. IT goes without saying that the Keynes‐oriented econo mists of our day—and that probably includes a substan tial majority—do not share Milton Friedman's faith in the competitive market, or hi: distrust of the processes of government. Many see ever his advocacy of a fixed rule for governing the money sup ply, leaving to fallible men bare minimum of discretion, as proceeding directly frorr ideology rather than from scholarly analysis. “Sure, Milton has forced us to tighten up and see things in a more balanced way,” said Arthur Okun, a Keynesian and former chairman of the President's Council of Eco nomic Advisers. “But he doesn't see things in a bal anced way himself. You can't buy and sell everything on the market, like honesty and racial equality. Under Milton's system, why not wives? Why not votes? Milton talks as if it's a perfect—or perfectible‐ marketplace, where everyone has perfect information and perfect understanding when he makes his marketplace de cisions. But I think Milton's world is only a caricature.” Paul Samuelson of M.I.T. says that Friedman mixes up sequence with causation and that in his desire to be a “big swinger” on the economic stage he engages in “intel lectual tightrope walking.” Nonetheless, there is more than enough hard logic in Friedman's arguments to keep the Keynesians from dismiss ing them as hokum. And there is even some factual evidence —as in the recent successful readjustment of European ex change rates on the open market — that at least a few of his positions on economic freedom are correct. AS for Friedman's money doctrine, what the generation of economists nurtured on the teachings of Lord Keynes seemed to have forgotten is that Keynes himself had rec ognized a major function in the money supply. This was ob scured by the lessons Keynes taught about the role of gov ernment fiscal policy in main taining economic stability. Friedman never claimed that he invented the money doc trine, but he did reintroduce it to the general body of economic thought, in a fash ion so scholarly and persua sive that it could scarcely be ignored. Samuelson has in jected more and more of Friedmanesque monetary theo ry into successive editions of his basic economics textbook —in use in most colleges— while denying vigorously that Friedman has had anything to do with it. Samuelson, often looked upon as Friedman's principal rival for America's first Nobel prize for eco nomics, now readily admits that “money matters,” but in common with other Keynes ians he dismisses as nonsense the Friedman doctrine that “only money matters.” Now two of the seven mem bers of the Fed's board of governors have aligned them selves publicly with the prin ciples, if not with the details, of Friedman's teachings, and there is indication that per haps one or two more have become private convents. In Congress, the prestigious Joint Economic Committee has rec ommended that the Fed shift to essentially Friedmanite policies, and within the Presi dent's Council of Economic Advisers, Chairman Paul Mc Cracken has confessed to being “Friedmanesque,” if not a full‐fledged Friedmanite. It is now being said that opinion at the Fed is so closely div ided that future policies will be determined by the incom ing chairman, Arthur Burns —who was Milton Friedman's first teacher of economics at Rutgers and is now one of his most intimate friends. Already, the Fed has con ceded the existence of Fried man, if only by beginning to publish periodic figures on the nation's money supply. One of the Federal Reserve System's 12 semi‐autonomous regional banks, the St. Louis branch, has been virtually captured by Friedmanism, and researchers there have done much to substantiate the essence of Friedmanite doctrine. (The research director in St. Louis is none other than Friedman's other Rutgers mentor, Homer Jones.) But William McChesney Martin Jr., the Fed's chairman since 1951, is an ex‐stock broker, not a professional economist, and, according to most careful observers of the Fed, he barely perceived what Friedman was trying to con vey. Besides, the members of the Fed, taken as a whole could scarcely help but react to a message that was so clearly directed against them. In his “Monetary History,” published in 1963, Friedman designates the Federal Re serve System as the villain bungling the nation into eco nomic disruptions. If Fried manism has quietly infiltrated the Fed, Friedman himself has found no reason to change that judgment on the basis of Federal Reserve policy since. In bringing this judgment up to date, Friedman cites the Fed's much‐disputed deci sion to stuff a large quantity of money into the economy just after Congress, as an anti‐inflationary fiscal move, passed the surtax in 1968. What followed was a vast new surge of inflation, which even many non‐Friedmanites blame on the Fed. Then, in the middle of last year, the Fed decided to re duce the rate of increase in the money supply to zero. Again and again, Friedman has argued that this policy is so drastic that it will lead directly to an economic reces sion. The full impact of this policy, he said, would take about six months to be felt —which makes him believe that a recession is now im minent. Friedman acknowl edges a rather remote chance that he is mistaken, since eco nomics is a science based on probability rather than mathe matical certainty. But he is prepared, as are his antagon ists, to consider the recession which he predicts as a funda mental test of Friedmanite doctrines. So persuaded is Friedman of the institutional incom petence of the Fed that if he really had his way, he says, he would abolish it altogether. In its place, he would have Congress legislate a fixed an nual rate of increase in the money supply, somewhere around 4 per cent. At the moment, he says, economists still do not know enough about the processes of the economic system to justify constant intercession, and a fixed rule could hardly be worse, and would probably be better, than the Fed's tink ering. ARTHUR BURNS, in testi fying before the Senate Bank ing Committee prior to his confirmation last December, gave the first public clue on the position he takes on Fried manism. To no one's surprise, Burns revealed himself to be far more conventional in his views than Friedman himself. He regards a reduction in Federal spending and a bal anced budget as fundamental to halting inflation. He con siders it important to have the Government's anti‐infla tionary posture appear “credi ble” to the business commu nity. He does not dismiss interest rates as a significant factor in economic stability. But Burns conceded that he saw more than a little truth in Friedman's recession fore cast, and he said his “im pulse” was to follow Friedman —though not with the rigid Friedmanite formula — in maintaining a relatively con stant but gradually increasing supply of money in circula tion. Thus it became quite clear that, after William Mc Chesney Martin goes at the end of this week, Milton Friedman will have won a victory (though hardly an. unconditional surrender), and the Fed will never again be quite so casual about whether or not “money matters.” WHAT makes Friedman such a formidable antagonist of the Keynesians, apart from the strength of his ideas, is his skill as a debater and polemicist. Samuelson says that Friedman's style surpass es his integrity and that Friedman simply ignores argu ments and evidence that are not useful to him. He main tains that Friedman's personal powers of persuasion are so great that, if he died tomor row, most of his ideas would vanish with him. Whether or not this is wishful thinking, it is true that Friedman can be devastating on the speaker's platform. A year ago, in a celebrated debate on “Mone tary vs. Fiscal Policy,” Walter Heller, President Kennedy's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, was torn to shreds by Friedman's argu‐ ments. Yet Friedman, if he was once considered a pushy Jew ish kid from New Jersey, is now acknowledged to be un failingly thoughtful and cour teous. Desisting from the tech nique of withering insult, he couches his arguments, both on the platform and on paper, in the most sweetly reason able terms, though without ever sacrificing a cutting edge. If he resorts to one tricky semantic ploy, it is in charg ing his opponents with failing to “prove” some contention. But since it is virtually impos sible to prove anything in eco nomics, his opponents often turn it around and use the same ploy on him. With all of this heated back‐and‐forth, much of it spilling outside the boundaries of the economics community, Friedman has become some thing of a public figure. Though he has many distin guished followers in the Chi cago School, it is he who is constantly in demand at other universities, both to lec ture and to make extended visits. As a general rule, he accepts as many of these in vitations as possible, for he considers them part of his re sponsibility. He is also called upon at far higher fees to speak before business groups, but he turns most of these down on the ground that they are a form of self‐indulgence, discernible results. Friedman rarely refuses an invitation to testify before Congressional committees, however, and he gave a pro digious number of hours to the President's Commission on an All‐Volunteer Armed Force, since he feels very deeply that young men should not be com pelled to serve as draftees and that the military services should improve salaries and other benefits to the point where they become competi tive in the job market. He has also been telephoned by President Nixon, who has solicited his advice on the prospect of a recession. All of this attention unquestionably flatters him. He enjoys the feeling of being an influential person. But he recognizes that, for reasons of temperament and conviction, he will prob ably never hold a Federal pol icy‐making position. There is no reason to doubt, however, that he enjoys being an out sider, challenging, provoking and irritating the convention al‐minded and forcing them to ponder the possibility that their most strongly held be liefs might require a bit of change. BUT then, why should Friedman contemplate having it otherwise? At the University of Chicago, he has influenced a generation of the country's finest young economists, and students continue to vie to be come his disciples. His col leagues admire him and freely admit his preeminence among them. They are the focus of his social life and his partners in Socratic discourse, his fa vorite pastime. He has a charm ing wife, Rose, herself a Uni versity of Chicago economist by training, who cooks his dinners and edits his writing. His 24‐year‐old son David, a University of Chicago gradu ate student, idolizes him and faithfully plays back his ideas, albeit in a much fiercer ver sion. He has a light teaching schedule, which enables him to hop to Japan or London or Miami for professional meet ings and, most important, to spend almost half the year in the spot he loves the most on earth, his summer home in Vermont. Just after the war, Fried man started spending his sum mers in Vermont, near the cottage of his good friend, Burns. Ultimately, he and Rose bought several hundred acres on top of a mountain, a mile or so from the Connecticut River on one side and the Burns house on the other. A few years ago, they bulldozed a road to a point just beneath the summit and there built a comfortable, modern house, hexagonal in shape and with huge panes of glass that over look the Connecticut River valley and some of New Eng land's grandest mountains. Here Milton Friedman and Rose normally remain from midsummer to Christmas, oc casionally leaving for a trip of a few days, now and then receiving visitors, but most often isolated from the world. It is here, at a small desk be tween a huge stone fireplace and the panorama outside, that Friedman, in an old wool shirt and baggy pants, sits down to work. Depending on his mood, he spins new theories or pre pares new polemics. Only at the first snowfall does the routine change. Then he throws a pair of skis into a four‐wheel‐drive Land Rover and makes his way to a near by chairlift. Friedman isn't as adroit a skier as he is an economist, but he plays both games the same way. He takes on the toughest mountain, then audaciously, irrepressibly, relentlessly, scrappily, fights his way through the trees and across the ice from the top to the bottom. More often than not, he arrives a bit bruised but still on his feet. Yet, with barely a moment to catch his breath, he's ready to take on the next adversary, mountain as well as man, that dares challenge him. Not bad for a guy who's 5 feet 3. ■ wrote “Fall From Grace: The Republican Party and the Puritan Ethic,” published in 1968.

806-> ‘Appalled’ Perelman Going Eastward Ha!
The United States is about to suffer a total loss of one of its least expendable na tional resources—the humor ist S. J. Perelman. Mr. Perelman has made an apparently irrevocable de cision to move to London in October, there to live as a self‐exiled American. He will become a “resident alien,” with no expectation of re turning to the nation in which he has won acclaim as lampoonist laureate. The 91‐acre farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that he and his brother‐in‐law, the late Nathanael West, bought in 1932 has been sold, aid its contents will be auctioned at the site on Sept. 25. M. Perelman will live here briefly until he sails for London on Oct. 21. “The fact that I think it's volcano time in this country is not responsible for the move, though I'm just as appalled as everyone about the conditions,” the 66‐year‐old Mr. Perelman said when reached by telephone at the farm, near Erwinna, Pa., where he was packing about 1,000 of his books for storage. “I've had all of the rural splendor that I can use,” he said, “and each time I get to New York it seems more pestilential than before. think Swift said that life is not only nasty and brutish, but short. That seemed to me the perfect description of life in a termitary like New York. “Plants can live on carbon dioxide, but I can't. I think T. S. Eliot used the phrase ‘twice‐breathed air.’ I'd hesi tate to say how many times the air in New York has been rebreathed.” ‘Insanity and Violence’ Mr. Perelman said the na tion was afflicted with “in sanity and violence,” symp toms of jingoism, and rampant political fatuousness. Its citizens cultivate man ners that are scant on couth, he said, noting that incivility was a plague for which there was no anti toxin. He confessed that he was disaffected with the Ameri can political climate “all the way down from the co‐author of the Mundt‐Nixon bill—I won't specify which sponsor I mean to every hard‐hat and red‐neck in this country.” He spent four months in London last winter and found there what seemed “a far more rational society than our own.” “The obvious good man ners and consideration of people there toward each other may be only selfish, but it's good enough for me,” he said. Mr. Perelman's wife of nearly 40 years, Laura West Perelman, died on April 10. He said that she had agreed With him about three years ago to move to London. The author of 18 books of satire (including “Parlor, Bedlam and Bath” in 1930; “Westward Ha!” in 1948 and “The Ill Tempered Clavi chord” in 1953) and the cre ator of scores of improbable characters was born Sidney Joseph Perelman in Brooklyn in 1904. He was reared in Rhode Island and educated at Browr University, where he editec The Brown Jug. He started in 1925 as comic artist for the magazine Judge. “The captions on my drawings got longer an longer, and soon they ells placed the drawings,” hi said. Two Marx Brothers pic tures, “Monkey Business” and “Horse Feathers,” rank high among his screenplays. He said that after his move there would be no dim inution in the United States of his writings. He will con tinue to write for The New Yorker from London, and he expects that his books will appear at irregular intervals. He added, “Today the news in this country is so filled with insanity and violence that the newspapers, from which I derive many of my ideas, have scant room for the sort of thing that turns me on—the bizarre, the un usual, the eccentric. In Britain they still have the taste for eccentricity.”

808-> Volome Record Also Hit
R. J. Reynolds Industries, Inc., in its first statement since its formation as a holding com pany for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and other diversified operations, report ed yesterday record sales and earnings for the quarter and six months ended June 30. Second‐quarter consolidated net earnings were $45,685,000, equal to $1.03 a share. This was 2.1 per cent ahead of the $44,731,000, or $1 a share re ported a year earlier. Con solidated sales and revenues for the quarter were $623, 512,000, up 8.7 per cent from $573,793,000 a year before. The half‐year volume was $1,183,115,000, up 10.5 per cent from $1,071,053,000 year earlier. Earnings in the six months were $85,455,000, or $1.90 a share, an increase of 9.6 per cent from $77, 967,000, or $1.70 a share, in the 1969 period. The record performance was attributed to increases from each of the company's princ ipal operating components, A. H. Galloway, chairman and chief executive, said. Tobacco sales, which accounted for 73 per cent of the consolidated total, were 5.1 per cent ahead of the quarter and half‐year periods last year. The gains were attributed to a 1.1 per cent increase in ciga rette unit sales in the quarter and 1.4 per cent in the six months and the effect of ciga rette price increases. Revenues for transportation (McLean In dustries) were up 28 per cent for the second quarter and 46.4 per cent for the six months. Sales of other products were up about 11 per cent for both periods, the report said. Earnings from tobacco oper ations rose $6,075,000 for the quarter and $13,534,000 for the six months. Transportation earnings were $2,464.000 lower for the second quarter but $2, 129,000 ahead in the six months. The 1970 earnings were ad versely affected by start ‐ up costs for expanded trade routes in the Caribbean, Far East and Mediterranean and costs in preparation for the proposed agreement to charter 16 con tainer ships from United States Lines, Inc., the report said. These factors and increasing competition will continue to hurt earnings for the remainder of the year, the report added. Sea‐Land Service, Inc., a divi sloe of McLean, is awaiting the decision of the Federal Mari time Commission on the pro posed agreement with United States Lines. The Kraftco Corporation, the world's leading producer of proc essed packaged foods, reported yesterday that earnings for the second quarter rose 10.4 per cent to $19,085,000, equal to 69 cents a share, from $17,289, 000, or 62 cents a share, last year. Sales improved to a record total of $683,184,000 from $636,439,000 in the year‐earlier period. For the first half, sales and earnings reached records, Gor don Edwards, chairman and chief executive, noted. Earn ings rose 5.7 per cent to $39, 132,000, or $1.40 a share, from $37,006,000, or $1.31 a share, in the first half of 1969. Sales were $1,364,161,000, up 6.7 per cent from $1,278,543,000 in the similar period of 1969. Mr. Edwards said the im proved earnings resulted from better over‐all performance of the company's Kraft Foods, Sealtest Foods, Humko Products, Breakstone Sugar Creek Foods and Metro Glass, divisions. He said there was some improvement in United States milk and ice cream operations and in activities in Britain. Time Inc. had record rev enues in the second quarter and first six months this year, which was reflected in higher half year operating earnings, accord ing to yesterday's report by An drew Heiskell and James R. Shepley, chairman and presi dent, respectively, of the world's largest publishing company. Second‐quarter revenues were $169,674,000, up 3 per cent from $164,757,000 last year. This brought the total for the six months to $310,762,000, compared with $292,819,000 in the first half of 1969. Net profit for the June quar ter was $10,203,000, or $1.41 a share, against $10,449,000, or $1.44 a share, last year before an extraordinary gain of $95, 000, or 1 cent a share. For the six months, the net earnings were $11,286,000, or $1.56 a share, compared with $10,149,000, or $1.41 a share, in the 1969 half‐year when there was an additional $5,305, 000, or 73 cents a share, de rived from extraordinary in come. This brought the net in come to $15,454,000, or $2.14 a share, for the first half of 1969. Operations of the Gillette Company for the three and six months ended June 30 resulted in increased sales and earnings over the year‐earlier periods, despite high operating costs, Vincent C. Ziegler, chairman and chief executive, reporte yesterday. Second‐quarter consolidated net income was $15,078,000, or 52 cents a share, up about 11 per cent from $13,566,000, or 47 cents a share, last year. Sales were up about 17 per cent to $161 971,000 from $138,520,000 in the year‐earlier period. For the first half, net in come was $32,278,000, or $1.11 a share, up about 6 per cent from $30,553,000, or $1.05 share, a year ago. Sales were $324,465,000 against $287,915, 1000 a year ago, a gain of about 13 per cent for the maker of razors and blades, men's and (women's grooming products, small appliances and writing instruments. PPG Industries reported yes terday earnings for the second quarter of $9,684,000, or 47 cents a share, down from the year‐earlier $13,885,000, or 68 cents a share. Sales for the three months ended June 30 were also below those for the same period last year, totaling $287,351,000, compared with $296,216,000 in the 1969 quarter. Sales and earnings for the first half of 1970 showed a de cline from the year‐earlier period. Net earnings through June 30 were $17,051,000, or 83 cents per share, compared with $25,503,000, or $1.25 per share, in the first half of 1969. Sales in the first half of 1970 were $550,453,000 compared with $568,497,000 in the same period last year. Second‐quarter sales were up about 10 per cent from the first quarter this year, the company reported, and second‐quarter earnings topped first quarter results by 30 per cent. The General Foods Corpora tion realized an 11 per cent increase in earnings on a sales gain of 9 per cent in the first fiscal quarter ended June 27, C. W. Cook, chairman and chief executive, reported yes terday. Both figures set rec ords. Earnings amounted to $28, 809,000, equal to $1.16 a share, compared with $25,903,000 or $1.04 a share, for the similar three months last year. Net sales rose to $529,353,000 from $486,348,000 a year ago. A sharp decline in earnings was reported yesterday by the Magnavox Company for the quarter and six‐month periods ended June 30. For the second quarter Magnavox reported a profit of $3,983,000, or 24 cents a share, down from $6,884,000, or 42 cents a share, in the sim ilar period a year before. Sales slipped to $102,068,000 from the year‐earlier $112,125,000. In the six‐month period, the company earned $9,323,000, equal to 57 cents a share, down from $18,035,000, or $1.09 a share, in the first half of 1969. Six‐month sales fell to $219,218,000 from $259,390,000 last year.

809-> M'COURTS FREED IN HASHISH TRIAL
A Maryland State Senator and his wife won acquittal yes terday in their trial here on charges that they helped smug gle 17 pounds of hashish, with a retail value of $30,000, into the United States. Frank J. McCourt, a 34‐year old lawyer and legislator from Baltimore, thanked the jury and said, “God bless you,” when if found him not guilty in Federal Court in Brooklyn at 9:15 P.M., after more than four hours of deliberation. His 27‐year‐old wife, Donna, smiled and rested her head or his shoulder as he announced that he would seek re‐election in Maryland. Conviction for smuggling the hashish, a marijuana derivative would have carried a manda tory sentence of at least five years in prison. Before the case went to the jury, Judge Leo F. Rayfiel granted a defense motion to acquit Mrs. McCourt on the grounds there was insufficient evidence against her. He also dismissed three of the four charges against Mr. McCourt. The prosecution's principal witness, Bruce L. Winokour, 27, of Baltimore, was arrested in July, 1968, after he brought the hashish here from Paki stan. Customs agents found the blocks of hashish concealed in Winokour's false‐bottomed suitcase at Kennedy Interna tional Airport. Winokour, who implicated the McCourts, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and went to prison for two years. He conceded that Federal agents had promised him leniency for his cooperation in the case against the McCourts. Testifying for the prosecu tion, Winokour said that he and the defendants had left the United States together in May, 1968, for a trip that ex tended from Europe to the Near East and eventually Paki stan. The witness maintained that Mr. McCourt had participated in the decision to buy the hashish, gave him $150 to make the purchase and bought his airline ticket to fly it to New York. After Winokour was arrested in New York, the McCourts re mained overseas for several months and were married in India. They were arrested at Kennedy International Airport when they returned to the United States in March, 1969. The prosecution relied large ly on the Winokour testimony. The defense rested its case without presenting any wit nesses, contending that the prosecution ha'd failed to sus tain the charges. Winokour, whose prior rec ord includes a burglary convic tion, coincidentally completed a prison sentence for a parole violation and was freed yester day in Maryland,

810-> NEW TEXTILE TRY IS DUE NEXT WEEK
WASHINGTON, June 16—A final effort to work out a volun tary method of restraining Jap anese textile exports to the United States will be made early next week, it became known today. As a result of the latest de velopment, the appearance of Secretary of Commerce Mau rice H. Stans before the House Ways and Means Committee has been put off until Monday and may come even later. It had been scheduled for Thurs day. Mr. Stans had promised the committee a report on the status of the negotiations and had indicated he would then disclose the Administration's position on proposals for legis lated import quotas on woolen and man‐made fiber textiles. Representative Wilbur D. Mills, Democrat of Arkan sas, the committee's chairman, agreed to postpone Mr. Stans's appearance. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese Minister of Trade and Industry, will come to the United States at the end of this week, though it is understood he will not reach Washington until Mon day. He is expected to bring Japan's final offer of a system of export restraint. The key issues are likely to be the comprehensiveness of the Japanese offer, its dur ation and the absolute quanti ties involved. If as expected the offer will cover only one year, an important issue will be the procedure for subsequent years, if any. The Ways and Means Cornmittee will complete its public hearings on trade legislation tomorrow. Executive sessions to start drafting legislation are expected to begin shortly after Mr. Stans's appearance. The textile question will be of major importance to the outcome, which at present is entirely un certain, according to committee members. In a related development, it was disclosed here that the executive commission of the European Economic Community handed a note to the United States Ambassador late last week warning that the Com mon Market would protect its negotiating rights and its eco nomic interests in case the United States should adopt re strictive trade measures. The note did not mention textiles as such. The commis sion also renewed its proposal for a meeting on trade matters at Geneva to include the United States, Britain, Japan and the Community.

812-> SOYBEAN FUTURES RISE 5C A BUSHEL
Under heavy public buying and short‐covering, soybean; futures prices ‘advanced nearly 5 cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday. Corn and wheat futures also moved ahead as much as cents or more while oats fu tures also showed an advance. In addition, soybean oil and meal recorded gains but iced broilers weakened at the close. ‘Trade was strong from the opening bell but there was a period of inactivity after about an hour. From the midway point, however, strong com mercial and commission house buying sent soybeans up about 3 cents. New buying thereafter sent them even higher. The activity in soy oil and meal stemmed largely from reported firm price at the cash level. Increased exports of soy beans as well as the possibility that the commodity's prices may have bottomed out for the . present, influenced buyers. The same influence—increased ex ports—also was felt in the corn and wheat pits. At the close of trading, wheat was up 11/8 to 23/8 cents a bushel; corn, up 15/8 to cents; oats, up 1 to. 11/2 and soybeans, up 33/4 to 45/8 cents a bushel. In fairly active trading on the Commodity Exchange here, silver futures prices declined, with the March option, the busiest with 828 sales, falling to $1.655 from $1.666 an ounce. The far December, with 538 , sales, fell. to $1.772 from $1.781 an ounce while the nearby December with 30 sales, dipped to $1.623 from $1.635 an ounce. A total of ‘2,‐690 sales were consummated. Copper ‘futures prices also showed ‘declines with the March contract, the busiest with 134 sales, dropping for 47.50 cents from 47.85 cents pound. The nearby December, with 37 sales, fell to 46.90 cents from 47.25 cents pound. A total of 237 sales in all were recorded.

815-> Many Negro Candidates Elected In Virginia Municipal Contests
RICHMOND, June 10 — Ne groes took seats on city and town councils throughout Vir ginia in yesterday's balloting. In Roanoke, the Rev. Noel C. Taylor, a Republican, led field of eight candidates to be come the first Negro elected to the City Council.

816-> NIGEL BALCHIN, 61, BRITISH NOVELIST
LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) —Nigel Balchin, a former brigadier general in the British army who became a best‐selling novelist, died in a nursing home here today at the age of 61. Mr. Balchin leaves his wife, Yovanka, his Yougoslav‐born secretary. An earlier marriage ended in divorce. Mr. Balchin is probably best known for his 1945 novel, “Mine Own Executioner,” des cribed as “fascinating and ar resting” by The New York Times when it was published in the United States the next year. The book, which the author later adapted for a film, was of the type called the psycholog ical thriller, with a psycho analyst's efforts to help a former fighter pilot recover from a severe “war neurosis.” Although Mr. Balchin's first published work has humorous, it was his 1943 novel, “The Small Back Room,” a sharp and critical observation of Britain's wartime bureaucracy that first brought him significant public attention. It is still regarded as perhaps his best book. Others include “The Borgia Testament,” published in 1949, a narrative of the life of Cesare Borgia in the form of a ghost written autobiography. One of his most recent novels was “Kings of Infinite Space,” pub lished in 1968. Mr. Balchin, a prolific screen writer, also adapted other people's novels for the medium, including “The Man Who Never Was” and “Fame Is the Spur.” In addition, he wrote the screenplay for the 1959 remark of the classic “Blue Angel.” Born in Wiltshire in 1908, he attended Peterhouse College of Cambridge University and was trained as a scientist and industrial psychologist. During World War II, he served as a scientific adviser to the British Army Council, with the rank of brigadier general. After the war, Mr. Balchin sought, he said, “to combine business and authorship in varying proportions,” dividing his time between writing and research in science and in dustry. “There is practically nothing in which I am not or cannot be intensely interested,” he once said of himself. And he alsc said that he could write only when he was holding down a full time job as well. Mr. Balchin's first marraige, to Elizabeth Walshe, ended it divorce in 1933. The couple hat three daughters.

817-> City Asks Stations For Time to Rebut TV Gasoline Ads
The city is requesting free time from three major tele vision stations here to rebut commercials asserting that new gasolines are helping to reduce air pollution. In identical letters to WABC TV, WCBS‐TV and WNBC‐TV, Jerome Kretchmer, the city's Environmental Protection Ad ministrator, charged that “such commercals are highly mislead ing.” He said, “they fail to mention the health and en vironmental hazards associated with the use of the advertised product, while claiming that the product contributes to a re duction in air pollution.” Mr. Kretchmer made his re quest under the Federal Com munications Commission's “fairness doctrine,” which holds that audiences must be informed of both sides of con troversial issues of public im portance. An attempt to counteract automobile and gasoline com mercials was made earlier this year by Friends of the Earth, an activist conservation organ ization. That group requested free time from WNBC to “counteract the propagandistic imbalance” of the commercials that were being broadcast. The conservationists said the ads were presenting only one side of the issue by showing cars as glamorous but not pointing out that they were pol luters as well. WNBC refused the conserva ionists’ request. The refusal was upheld by the F.C.C., but the commission said: “Obvious ly, a commercial could deal di rectly with an issue of public importance; if so, the fairness doctrine is fully applicable.” They city is making its re quest on the basis of that state ment by the F.C.C. Mr. Kretch mer said that air pollution, was an issue of public importance and that “the fairness doctrine requires free time to answer such allegations [in the commercials] concerning pollu tion.” In his letter to the stations, Mr. Kretchmer said examples of the commercials calling for re buttal were “certain ads for Esso ‘Big Plus’ gasoline (al leging clean air through reduc tion of lead) and Mobil deter gent gasoline (stating that a cleaner engine means cleaner air).” No specific amount of time was requested for rebuttal. Spokesmen for the stations said they could not comment on the request because they had not yet received the letters. Joseph W. Halper, former Superintendent of Recreation in Nassau County, was sworn in by Mayor Lindsay yesterday as the city's $35,000‐a‐year re creation Commissioner. Mr. Halper, who is 40 years old, succeeds Hayes W. Jones, who returned to private industry.

821-> World Council of Churches Plans Aid to Poor Nations
GENEVA, Feb. 22—The World Council of Churches has an nounced the creation of an Ecumenical Development Fund to finance projects aimed at promoting social justice and self‐reliance in the poorer countries.

822-> 30 British Dealers Open Antiques Fair At a Hotel Here
The show by 30 British an tiques dealers, which opened here yesterday, is probably one of the most attractive markets of its size to be ar ranged in New York, and it is also the most homogeneous. It is the first all‐British show to be staged in this coun try, and it will run through Sunday at the Royal Manhat tan Hotel, Eighth Avenue and 44th Street. Individualy, many of the English pieces that comfort ably crowd the show area have their familiar counterparts, or near relatives, in the New York shops and as perhaps the most popularly collected antiques in the American home. Collectively, however, they present a picture that is pecul liarly and traditionally British, with one‐of‐a‐kind antiques and art objects and material from other parts of the world. Two areas, rarely seen in any number in other New York shows, have generous represen tation in the British shows. One is English clocks, in a not able collection brought here by Meyrick Neilson of Tetbury, Gloucestershire. The other is English silver, which a number of dealers arc showing. At the opening of the show, which had been in the making for about two years, one dealer said: “Trade hasn't been too good, but I hope our venture here will be good enough to warrant another trip some day.” A pair of handsomely carved and gilded stools, or window seals—a family heirloom—and a marquetry wine cooler are among the rarities being shown by Mrs. Mary Watson, head of Houghton Hall Antiques in Yorkshire. Mrs. Watson, who is Lady Manton in private life, set up shop six years ago and has since established branches in Ireland and Belgium. A card attached to a marque try card table says It was be gun in 1786 and finished 50 years later by a maker who worked on his masterpiece “at odd times in the evenings un less more profitably employed.” It is now owned by G. T. Rat cliff, who value; it at $7,000. Another item at the show is a late 17th‐century bracket clock by Joseph Knibb, a $40, 000 item in Mr. Neilson's dis play. Show hours are 11 A.M. to 11 P. M and admission ?? $2.50.

825-> EXCESS SURGERY DISCERNED IN U.S.
A Stanford University anes thesiologist, saying that there. Is a disproportionate number of surgeons In the United States, has raised the question of whether there might also be an excessive number of surgi cal operations performed. Dr. John P. Bunker, chair man of the Department of Anesthesia at Stanford, made his remarks in a special article in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medi cine. Dr. Bunker, who made a comparative study of surgery in the United States and England and Wales, found that there were twice as many surgeons in proportion to pop ulation in this country as in England and Wales, and that American surgeons performed twice as many operations. This fact by itself, Dr. Bunk er conceded, does not mean that American surgeons often perform unnecessary opera tions. But, he added, when surgery is done only after con sultation with a nonsurgeon, there seems to be a smaller number of operations per formed “where indications [for surgery] may be equivo cal.” In an editorial in the same issue of the New England journal, Dr. Francis D. Moore, a Harvard surgeon, objected to Dr. Bunker's comparison of countries. Dr. Moore said that a pediatrician in Britain is a “relative rarity” and that one might incorrectly conclude from this observation that American pediatrics was “grossly overexpanded.” However, Dr. Moore said he was convinced that “unneces sary and meddlesome” opera tions “are more commonplace here than in Great Britain.” Dr. Bunker said his main concern was that “with a limit ed total medical manpower pool, more physicians engaged in the practice of surgery means fewer for other possibly, needier medical disciplines.” “Thus,” he added, “we have the paradox of a country that provides ‘luxury’ surgery for the well‐to‐do but cannot pro vide basic medical care for the indigent.” Dr. Bunker said that where as the British surgeon only sees patients who are referred to him by other physicians, the American surgeon often refers patients to himself for surgery, “thus creating his own de mand.” He cited the experience of the United Mine Workers Medi cal Care Program: “The Mine Workers Fund was concerned with the large amount of what appeared to he unnecessary surgery, par ticularly gynecologic operations and appendectomies. When a requirement was added that all operations be endorsed by pre operative specialist consulta tion, the number of operations fell by as much as 75 per cent for hysterectomies, 60 per cent for appendectomies and 35 per cent for hemorrhoidectomies.” Dr. Bunker observed that in prepaid group health plans, such as the Health Insurance Plan of New York, Where con sultation is the rule and the surgeon receives a salary rather than a fee for service, the rate of surgery is half that in the Blue Shield fee‐for‐serv ice insurance plan. “The ‘incentive’ of a fee for service,” Dr. Bunker remarked, “may tend to increase the number of operations in cases in which indications are bor derline.” On the other hand, he said, 9n the absence of such eco nomic incentive, many pro cedures that are desirable but not essential may not be per formed.” In his editorial, Dr. Moore commented that “money may he at the root of it all” and that “among the many rea sons for the excessive develop ment of American surgery, as compared to Great Britain, are those based on the laissez‐faire system of American medicine, solo practice and fee for serv ice.” In Britain, most health care Is dispensed through the Na tional Health Service, under which physicians receive the same salary regardless of how many patients they treat.

827-> DELURY SEEKING WAGE REOPENER
John J. DeLury, president of the Uniformed Sanitation Men's Association, said yesterday that the union would ask the city for an 8.7 per cent pay in crease to compensate for the rise in the cost of living since the current contract went into effect on Oct. 1, 1968. The contract runs until Dec. 31 of this year, but Mr. DeLury said that he would ask Herbert L. Haber, director of the city's Office of Labor Relations, to reopen negotiations on a cost of‐living increase as soon as possible. If the city refuses, he said, the union will “take a very strong position” and members will refuse to work overtime, an action that would seriously hamper the city's garbage‐col lection efforts. Mr. DeLury made his re marks on the WNBC‐TV pro gram “Searchlight.” He said that although the 1968 con tract contained no reopening clause, “I believe where there's a just cause, and where peo ple need this relief immediate ly, I believe that we'll be suc cessful in getting a reopener.” He said that the 8.7 per cent figure represented the total rise in the cost‐of‐living index since the contract went into effect. “I believe that the city is well able to find the money when the needs are there to take care of the employes,” Mr. DeLury said. In response to a question, Mr. DeLury said that he expected other city employes to ask for cost‐of‐living increases if the sanitationmen were successful. On political quetions, Mr. DeLury said that Mayor Lind say was “a better Mayor at the present time than he would he for Governor.” He added: “The people elected him only last November, and I think he should at least hang around for three or four years.” He said that it was “pos sible” that his union might not endorse Governor Rockefeller for re‐election, although he de clined to name a candidate more likely to get the sanita tionmen's support. The union endorsed the Governor in his campaign four years ago.

828-> Colombian and U.S. Jets Hijacked
Hijackers commandeered two jetliners yesterday — one in the United States and the other in South America — and or dered them flown to Cuba. The Colombian hijacking was delayed because of mechanical difficulties. The hijackings were the fourth and fifth of the year in the Western Hemisphere. A gunman forced his way into the cockpit of United Air Lines Flight 361, which was heading from Cleveland to West Palm Beach, with intermediate stops in Atlanta and Tampa, Fla. There were 99 passengers and a crew of seven aboard the Boeing 727 jet. The jet touched down in At lanta at 10:04 A.M. to refuel, then 32 minutes later took off toward Cuba, where it landed at 12:13 P.M. The plane later returned to Miami with all pas sengers except the hijacker and his wife and four children. Detectives Keep Away None of the passengers were allowed to leave the plane. Fed eral agents and detectives swarmed through the terminal, but a United spokesman, Jim Ramsey, said they had “strict orders to stay away from the plane.” An Avianca airliner, with 78 persons on board, was hijacked while flying from Bogota, Co lombia, to Barranquilla. The plane landed at Cartagena, apparently only to refuel, and re mained on the ground five minutes. The plane touched down lat er at Barranquilla, took on still more fuel, and took off again for Cuba. But minutes out of Barranquilla, Capt. Sinforoso Gutierrez, the pilot, radioed, that the plane had “mechani cal problems.” Again, the plane set down in Barranquilla, where it was con firmed that there were four hi jackers, apparently armed with explosives. They threatened to blow up the craft unless offi cials at the airport “collabor ated” to repair a faulty hydrau lic landing gear. The plane later took off for Cuba with the repairs incomplete. 2 Polish Hijackers Sentenced Special to The New York Times VIENNA, March 11—A tri bunal here imposed prison sen tences today on two young Poles who hijacked an airliner on a flight from Wroclaw to Warsaw Nov. 20 and forced the pilot to fly to Vienna. Wieslaw F. Szymankiewicz, 20 years old, was sentenced to 27 months in jail, and Romuald Zolotucho, 19, to two years. Both told the court they had seized the Polish Airlines plane to flee their country and seek “better life” in the West. The court ordered both de fendants to be expelled from Austria after they had served their sentences. A request by the Polish government for extradition of the two hijackers was ignored by the Austrian authorities.

831-> Peking Giving Little Information in Official Press
HONG KONG, Jan. 5—Com munist China has, in the last year, steadily reduced the flow of information to the outside world through its official press. The traditional New Year edi torial, published jointly on Jan. 1 by three major publications Jenmin Jih Pao, the official party and government news paper; Hung Chi, the party's theoretical journal, and Chieh fang Chun Pao, the armed forces newspaper — also shed little light on the leadership's plans. It did not come to grips with domestic issues and con tained little that was new in the field of foreign affairs. Specialists in Chinese affairs here agree that it is much more difficult to understand develop ments in China now than it was during the height of the Cul tural Revolution. Then, al though the situation was con fusing, there was a tremendous volume of material for analysis from both official and unofficial publications. Wall posters and Red Guard newspapers, which often contained information not disclosed in the official press, have since been banned. “I'm afraid my reports have become very repetitious be cause Peking isn't telling us anything new,” a European dip lomat said to a colleague, who admitted that he was having the same problem. China News Analysis, a news letter with a large following here and abroad, has announced a reduction in the number of issues that will be published an nually. “It is much more difficult now than it was formerly to understand what is going on in China,” its editor, the Rev. Louis La Dany, a Jesuit, com mented in the latest Issue. “The image is blurred” and writing demands “more time and care, more careful reading and reflection than ever be fore,” he added. The dearth of information has given rise to two schools of thought about what is happen ing in Peking. One holds that the leadership is continuing to make and im plement policy but is using a more direct pipeline than the press to convey its instructions to subordinate authorities and the people. Analysts of this school of thought note refer ences in the press to speeches and directives that have never been published. The other group of China specialists believe the scarcity of information reflects a hiatus in policy‐making because of a conflict within the hierarchy. They believe the clash of inter ests exists also in Peking. Indeed, the situation in some regions appears less fluid than in Peking. In these provinces, where moderate elements have at least temporarily triumphed over radical factions, broad casts often make more positive statements on political and eco nomic issues than Peking. Some provinces appear to have made more progress than Peking in rebuilding the Com munist party apparatus—shat tered by the purges of the Cul tural Revolution. The New Year editorial did not give a progress report but merely said the work of rebuilding the party should be grasped firmly. Many regions have confident ly predicted an economic “leap forward” in 1970. Such eco nomic optimism was conspicu ously missing from the New Year editorial. A political analyst said the writers of the New Year edi torial appeared to have concen trated on foreign policy as a field less likely to generate controversy. He said a detailed discussion of thorny domestic issues could lead to misinter pretations, which might aggra vate existing dissension. The joint editorial was the first since Oct. 1, when the Chinese Communists celebrated the 20th anniversary of their seizure of power. Unity was the theme of the Oct. 1 edi torial. Unity has been a theme of press comment since the major political event of the year, the ninth congress of the Chinese Communist party, in April. But the New Year editorial found it necessary to call on the people to “rally still more closely around the party. Cen tral Committee with Chairman Mao as its leader and Vice Chairman Lin as its deputy leader.” A prime purpose in the re construction of the Communist party apparatus is to promote the Central Committee, of which Mao Tse‐tung is chair man, with a chain of command throughout the nation. Party building is moving slowly and Peking has provided only limited guidelines, perhaps out of reluctance to clarify issues that divide the moderate and radical elements.

834-> Heavy Backlog of Controversial Legislation Awaits the 91st Congress Today
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18—An edgy and troubled 91st Con gress resumes work tomorrow on a heavy backlog of politi cally and socially controversial issues. Welfare reforms, postal re forms, crime and drug controls, consumer protection, voting rights, unemployment benefits, school aid, revenue sharing with the states, environmental controls, expanded aid for the nation's hungry: These are some of the major issues left unresolved in the pre‐Christ mas adjournment rush 26 days ago. Because a second session can resume where a first one left off, bills involving these and scores of other issues need not be reintroduced. Some have passed the Senate, some have passed the House and others are in committee. Thus, Congress is expected to settle down to work far more rapidly than it did a year ago, when it marked time for months, awaiting President Nixon's budget revisions and legislative requests. President Nixon will deliver his State of the Union Message to Congress shortly after noon this Thursday, giving broad out lines of what he wants in new and left‐over legislation. He will follow this up, per haps late next week, with his proposed budget, which is being trimmed even further than originally planned. This is an election year, and partisan disputes between the Republican Administration and the Democratic‐controlled House are certain to mount in the months ahead. The first such clash of the new session is expected to come today, when the Senate takes up a House‐passed $19.7‐billion health and education appropria tions bill that President Nixon has threatened to veto as in flationary because it exceeds his requests by $1.1‐billion. The threat of a Presidential veto also hangs over a Federal pay‐increase bill now awaiting final Congressional approval. But the major fight of the session will probably come over the President's proposed welfare reforms, calling for a $1,600 guaranteed annual in come for poor families, includ ing the “working poor.” While many liberal Demo crats endorse the income main tenance plan in principle, they contend that the $1,600 floor is too little. They also object to requiring certain heads of households — such as mothers of school‐age children — to ob tain work or job training to qualify for a family allowance. The outlook for the welfare reform plan is uncertain. The Administration is pushing hard, but the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Wilbur D. Mills, Democrat of Arkansas, is known to be cool to the proposal and has indicated that his committee may produce a dif ferent set of welfare reforms. The President's proposal for converting the Post Office De partment into a Government owned corporation is in trou ble, too. Months ago, the House Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee narrowly voted to shelve the corporation plan. Instead, the committee is writing postal reform legislation of its own, retaining basic control over the Post Office Department but removing the Postmaster Gen eral from the Cabinet and giv ing him a nine‐year term. Efforts by the Administra tion to provide free food stamps for the nation's poor also face grave obstacles. Last September, the Senate passed a broad food stamp bill, more than doubling the outlay and providing free stamps to families with incomes of less than $60 a month. But the House Agriculture Committee voted last month against free stamps and has I proposed new restrictions, such as barring stamps to those who fail to register for employment or fail to accept jobs that pay at least a minimum wage. The committee also voted to bar stamps to strikers, hippies and college students who are sup ported by their parents. Among the other major is sues now in one legislative stage or another are the fol lowing: ¶Crime control. The Senate is expected to act this week or next on a modified version of an Administration bill de signed to curb organized crime. Other crime‐control bills also, are pending. ¶Drug abuse. Awaiting Sen ate action is a drug‐control bill that would eliminate man datory minimum sentences for all drug offenses except those committed by professionall criminals. It also would estab lish a commission to study marijuana. ¶Voting rights. A House passed bill extending some of the features of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to all states is awaiting Senate committee action. The bill which is backed by the Administration, has been severely criticized by ivil rights leaders. ¶Electoral reform. A bill calling for direct election of the President and Vice President and requiring a run‐off elec tion if no candidate receives at least 40 per cent of the vote passed the House last year but is still lodged in Senate Judiciary Committee. Also awaiting final action are bills designed to protect con sumers more fully, upgrade air way safety through airway user taxes, extend unemploy ment benefits to 4.5 million workers not covered now, grant antitrust exemption to news papers entering into joint op erating agreements, extend the program aiding elementary and secondary schools, ban cig arette commercials on radio and television and clean up the nation's waterways.

837-> George W. Naumburg Is Dead; Banker and Philanthropist, 94
George W. Naumburg, re tired banker and philanthropist, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 94 years old and lived at 778 Park Avenue. Mr. Naumburg had been ac tive for many years with his father and brother in the bank ing firm of E. Naumburg & Co. In 1931, at his suggestion, Mr. Naumburg and his brother, the late Walter W. Naumburg, liquidated the business to de vote their full time to various charities. Mr. Naumburg's first charit able work had been many years earlier with the National Child Welfare Association, and children thereafter remained his principal concern. In the nineteen‐twenties, af ter studying the subject of delinqent children, he ini tiated, financed and supervised mental hygiene work at Phillips Academy In Exeter, N.H. Some years later, he established a program of psychiatric treat ment for delinquent children at the Hawthorne‐Cedar Knolls School in Westchester County. For many years, Mr. Naum burg was a trustee of the Jew ish Board of Guardians, whose efforts are devoted to mental hygiene work with children. He was a founder and, at his death, vice president of Par ents' Magazine. Mr. Naumberg also established a fund for Har vard University Ph.D. candi dates specializing in child psy chiatry. Another project of his was the annual Naumbere Orchestra concert series on the Mall In Central Park. His father, Elkan Naumburg, started the series in 1905 and donated the band shell in 1923. After his death the following year, the Naum berg brothers continued the series. Mr. Naumberg was a trustee of the Beckman‐Downtown Hospital and was active in the work of the Federation of Jew ish Philanthropies, whose fi nance committee he headed for many years. From 1932 until hip death, he was president of the Baron de Hirsch Fund, which provides assistance for refugees to the United States. He also was a director and vice president of the Citizens Budget Commis sion. During World War I, Mr. Naumburg was assistant chief of the Cotton Section of the War Industries Board. In the 1930's he was treasurer of the National Economy League, an organization whose aim was to curb Federal spending. Mr. Naumburg, who attended Phillips Exeter, was graduated from Harvard University in 1898. He was one of the initial members of the Balustrol Golf Club and also was a member of the Bankers, Wall Street, Lotos, Harmonie and Chemists Clubs, and the Bohemians. Surviving are his widow, the former Cecile Louch helm; two sons, Dr. George W. Naumburg Jr. and Philip H.; two daugh ters, Mrs. Ellin London and Mrs. Virginia Krag; a step daughter, Mrs. Doris Judell; two stepsons, Walter and John Steppacher, and 10 grandchil dren. A funeral service will be held Thursday at 11:30 A.M, at Frank E Campbell's, Madi son Avenue at 51st Street.

838-> Bookings Fat, Profits Lean In N.Y. Hotels
New York's hotel keepers may be turning down the covers on more beds these days but they aren't turning up with corresponding profits. Something always seems to go wrong as they make their way to the bank. Their labor and maintenance costs con tinue to rise, employes are harder to find and businessmen are shortening their stays at hostelries because of the tight‐money situation. These problems came to light in a recent series of interviews with inn keepers in hotels throughout the city. Hotel men generally agree that their main headache is a profit pinch. Al though the room occupancy rate of ma jor hotels here last year rose to 75.5 per cent, the highest in years, compared with 73.6 per cent of capacity in 1968, their earnings are decreasing. They put the blame chiefly on higher labor costs. For instance, wages of chambermaids have risen from $61.26 a week in 1965 to $79.25 last year, while wages of room clerks climbed from $80 to $101 during the same period. Equipment costs and other expenses are items. Philip L. Lowe, president of ITT Sheraton Corporation of America. said that Sheraton's rubbish‐removal costs for its hotels here jumped 30 per cent in 1968 while its real‐estate tax rose 7 per cent in 1969. Sheraton oper ates the St. Regis‐Sheraton, the Park Sheraton, Sheraton‐Russell, Sheraton Motor Inn and the Sheraton Inn at La Guardia Airport in New York. Mr. Lowe said the chain's laundry costs for its New York hotels would rise about 17 per cent this year over the 1969 level. The Sheraton president said that New York hotels need a better weekly dis tribution of occupancy. He noted that many hotels are filled during the week days but are mostly empty on weekenas. Mr. Lowe said that the East Side ho tels have an occupancy rate in the high 80's during the week with a sharp drop off to the low 50's and 60's on week ends. He said that the West Side hotels have a different pattern, falling off not so sharply either on weekends or in the summer due to lower rates and more business‐type meet ings. To help recoup labor and cost increases, most hotels here have raised their room rates about 3 to 4 per cent annually in recent years. However, last year some in creased their rates 8 per cent and others are planning to do so or have already acted this year. Getting competent help is another problem for the hostelries, especially in the skilled categories. “You either have to steal from other restaurants or ho tels or get them through friends,” says Kaye Apollo, the maitre d' at the Polo Bar in the Westbury Hotel. The debonair Mr. Apollo, who broke into the business at the Claridge Hotel in Lon don in 1928, said it took him two months and twelve in terviews with applicants be fore he found an assistant chef for the Polo Bar. Mr. Apollo said that the eleven unsuccessful appli cants for the opening all lacked proper training and the man finally picked for the job, John T. Jakab, was recommended to him by a friend of Roger LeBosser, the head chef at the Westbury. The other eleven applicants were sent by employment agencies. The Westbury maitre d' said that Mr. Jakab, who learned his trade by cook ing in various restaurants in France, is “doing a first‐rate job” and “we are very satis fied.” Mr. Apollo has been with the Westbury Hotel for 33 years. He has been maitre d' at the hotel since 1941. Miss Hazel M. Moore, the executive housekeeper of the plush Plaza Hotel, agrees that competent hotel help is hard to find. She said that “whereas in the past, we had to show a new domestic how to make a bed in the Plaza style only once or twice, we now have to continue giving demonstrations and must su pervise their performances for days and sometimes weeks.” Mr. Scanlan said that this is partly a result of a lack of immigration of well trained Europeans, who, with the new higher standard of living in their countries now find that they can do just as well by remaining in their own countries. Mr. Scanlan formerly was executive chef at the Waldorf. Some of the new hotels have started classes to train new and inexperienced per sonnel. For instance, Loew's Hotels, a subsidiary of Loew's Corporation, has started, partly because of a shortage of front‐office help, a train ing program for chamber maids and kitchen help. Preston R. Tisch, president of Loew's Hotels, said, “We sent 25 chambermaids to our school last year for nine weeks to teach them to be come front‐office cashiers.” He added that 75 per cent of them are now cashiers and the rest, “who didn't quite make it have returned to their former or have become floor supervisors because of their added knowledge.” Discussing profits at Loew's hotels here last year, Mr. Tisch said, “they were about the same as 1968, mostly because we worked harder to bring in new busi ness.” Loew's operates the Americana, Summit, War wick, City Squire, Midtown and Regency in New York. Alphonse W. Salomone, president of the Hotel Asso ciation of New York City, Inc., said there was no doubt that most hotels here are still making profits, but “their earnings in most cases have been decreasing in re cent years because of higher costs.” Mr. Salomone said that he expected the profit‐pinch to hit hotel men here even hard er this year because of the tight money situation. He said, “We have already started to see a decline in room occu pancy during December and in January.” The hotel executive attrib uted this mostly to cutbacks by businessmen on their travel time because of tight money. He added: “Reserva tions are down and out‐of town businessmen seem to be planning shorter stays here or postponing them in definitely in order to reduce costs.” However, Mr. Salomone was optimistic over the pros pects for the industry during the next decade. He said that the advent of the jumbo jets would bring substantially more visitors to New York who will require lodging as well as food. Mr. Salomone, who is also president of Realty Hotels, Inc., which operates the Bilt more, Roosevelt, Barclay and Commodore hotels, said that Realty Hotels's $22‐million renovation program that was started two years ago and is still going on has helped the chain's sales considerably by attracting new customers and getting old ones to return. Arthur Dooley, vice presi dent and general manager of the Plaza, agreed that tight money is having its effect on business. Mr. Dooley said that expense account busi ness in both the Plaza 9 and the Persian Room of the hotel was off 20 per cent last year compared with the 1968 lev el. He predicted that ex pense‐account sales would return to the normal growth patern when the tight mon ey situation eases. Another hotel executive suggested that more business would be attracted to hotels here if the city had a new convention center. Daniel C. Hickey, president of the Knott Hotels Corporation, said that Manhattan, with 35,000 first‐class hotel rooms, “certainly is deserving of a new and larger convention center than the New York Coliseum which would at tract even more businessmen and organizations here.” Last year 829 organizations held conventions in New York, or 17 more than in 1968. As a result of these meetings, 2,825,000 delegates and their wives spent an estimated $724,625,000 in the city, a good portion of it in hotels, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. Mr. Hickey noted that costs for wages in Knott ho tels here in 1969 climbed 15 per cent over the 1968 vol ume and “they will be up another 10 per cent this year over last.” The chain's hotels here are the Berkshire, Vol ney, Pickwick Arms, West bury and the International Hotel at Kennedy Airport. The Knott executive said that occupancy at the chain's hostelries here in 1969 ranged from 82.5 per cent to 99 per cent of capacity, well above the average for hotels here. The addition of the new Madison Square Garden has helped sales for the hotels in that area. These include the New Yorker. McAlpin, Statler‐Hilton and the Penn Garden. More than two years ago when the New Yorker Hotel was in receivership it hired a sports personality, Arthur Susskind Jr., to induce teams that were scheduled to per form at the new Garden when it opened to make their head quarters at the hotel. Mr. Susskind succeeded not only in getting many of the teams to register at the hotel but has also increased the patronage of out‐of‐town buyers who once had flocked to that hotel before it went into receiverslip. His job also was made easier when the Hilton Ho tels Corporation began oper ating the hotel in January, 1968. Hilton has given the hostelry a new look through a $5‐million renovation and improvement program. The McAlpin Hotel has tried a different approach to attract new business. Paul T. Underhill, general mana ger, said that since it opened its Alpine Cellar in Septem ber, which has Bavarian en tertainment, including a Ger man band, six attractive girl singers and a male singer, sales at the Alpine Cellar have risen steadily. Mr. Underhill said that oc cupancy at the hotel is at 71 per cent of capacity, up 2 percentage points over the 1969 level. The McAlpin, which was built in 1912, has 1,200 guest rooms. Because of rising costs for labor, supplies and mainte nance, the McAlpin now charges $14 a day for a single room compared with $12 a day in 1968 and from $20 to $26 a day for a double, against $16 to $24 in 1968. In their attempts to cut costs, hotel men have found the National Hotel & Motel Exposition, which is held every November at the New York Coliseum, helpful. The show offers them hundreds of new products and equip ment designed to help them operate their properties more efficiently and profitably. Although most innkeepers agree that there are more than enough hotel rooms now available here to handle ex isting business, some are worried about the future. Recently, the Hilton Hotels Corporation disclosed that it plans to construct a 45‐story tower adjoining the New York Hilton that will make the hotel the largest in the world. Planned for comple tion in 1972, the tower will add 1,250 guest rooms to the 2,150‐room hotel, which is on the Avenue of the Ameri cas between 53d and 54th Streets. One room‐clerk inter viewed last week who asked not to be identified, said he cared less that the hotels' profits are being pinched since “his salary has been squeezed for years.” He explained that he start ed as a room clerk for $35 a week some 20 years ago and now was just making slightly over scale. He noted that “management expects us to dress like a banker but doesn't pay us enough to do so.”

839-> News of the Rialto
BOUNCE is a prime asset in the theater—that knack for rebounding when pru dence tells you it would be better to stay down for the count. Actors need it, so do writers, producers, directors—especially artistic directors in the non‐commercial theater. Michael Kahn has bounce. Not too long ago, he worked out a program for this summer's American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., on the assumption that both Len Cariou and Brian Bedford would be back. But the gods were off on their own schemes. Recently, Kahn brought last summer's production of “Henry V” to Broadway and promptly lost Cariou. The actor, who scored as Henry, was lured into the forthcoming musical, “Applause,” as Lauren Bacall's leading man. Brian Bedford, in a gesture of aid to the APA, which needed a third production for its stand at the University of Michigan, agreed to go into “Private Lives.” What happened to that venture everyone knows. So Kahn bounced and now has worked out another program which, for reasons of economy, will consist of only three plays at Stratford, instead of the usual four. First, there'll be “All's Well That Ends Well,” June 16. On successive nights will come “Othello” and Shaw's “The Devil's Disciple.” Kahn himself will stage “All's Well” and “Othello” and, contrary to expectation, isn't about to invoke any radical maneuvers. He will, however, set “All's Well” in 16th‐century France. It's going to be “the most romantic production” he's ever done because, unlike others, who tend to think of the play as a problem comedy, even black, he regards it as a “romantic fable.” Roberta Maxwell, who won everyone's heart as the French princess in “Henry V,” so lovely was she and so good, has been cast as Helena. Joseph Maher is to be Parolles; Peter Thompson, lately of the At lanta Repertory Company, will be Bertram; Josef Sommer, from the Seattle Repertory Company, will be the Duke and Eva LeGallienne, of so many repertory companies, including her own long lamented Civic on 14th Street. For “Othello,” Kahn joy fully discloses, he's captured Moses Gunn. “I've been want ing to do this play since I've been at Stratford,” Kahn re ports, “but I couldn't find the actor. Gunn's going to be great. I worked with him on ‘Measure for Measure’ in Central Park.” Miss Maxwell is set for Desdemona and Lee Richardson, one of the Min nesota Theater Company's founding artists, will be Iago. The role of Emilia has gone to Jan Miner. “The Devil's Disciple” will be staged by Cyril Ritchard, who, in addition, will play General Burgoyne. Dick Dudgeon's interpreter re mains to be determined. P. S.: The student season will display “Hamlet,” open ing March 23, “All's Well,” April 1, and “Othello,” May 15. “Hamlet” will be guided by William Woodman, with the title role going to Danny Davis who was with the com pany last year. Richardson is to be Claudius and Amy Tau bin, who was the venture some lass in “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,” will be Ophelia. Tonight at the Roundabout Theater, over on West 26th Street, Anthony Sloan's free adaptation of Sophocles's “Oedipus” will have its offi cial opening, following the usual weeks of previews. The title role is being played by Gordon Heath. Gordon Heath? Not many in the audience if, indeed, any, arc likely to re member the name or the man's talent. Look in the archives, how ever, and you will discover that Gordon Heath was last seen on Broadway in a play called “Deep Are the Roots,” directed by Elia Kazan. He was the young Negro lieu tenant who, having just re turned from World War II, finds little changed in the Deep South. He cannot marry the white girl (Barbara Bel Geddes) with whom he's in love. “I guess you still couldn't do that in a place like Memphis,” Heath laughed the other afternoon. Tall, lean and handsome, Heath hasn't been in the neighborhood because, quite simply, he's made Paris his home. “I was a pretty naive kid back there in 1945–46. I'd been born in New York, my father was a social work er, later he went into politics. We were pretty middle‐class. I took violin lessons and I had no awareness of the problems engulfing black peo ple. I thought that if I was good, worked hard, I would find opportunity. Listen, Ka zan used to bring me all sorts of reading matter to make me understand what was going on in the outside world. I began to realize that there weren't going to be many chances for me after ‘Deep Are the Roots.’ Not at that time, anyway.” Heath went to London for the West End production of the Arnaud d'Usseau‐James Gow play, couldn't continue his work permit at the end of the run, and went to Paris where he discovered “a free air and a free people.” Paris was congenial for blacks and Heath decided to remain. From time to time, there would be work across the Channel. And there was occa sional work in the Paris the ater, too. But mostly Heath has made his living from a folksong club he started, a place where you could buy a drink and listen to him sing ing. “At first these were American folksongs, stuff I'd picked up from hanging around with Ledbelly and Josh White,” Heath recalled. “Then, after I learned French, I also sang French folksongs.” He still runs, and performs in, the club in which he has a partner, and during the last three years he's also had a theater, The Studio, on the Rue de Sevres. There, a pool of actors have been putting on American and English plays. His involvement with “Oedipus” was the outgrowth of a holiday spent in New York about two years ago. “I'd heard of the Round about,” he said, “and I went down there. I liked the work they were doing. I had the feeling that Gene Feist, the producing director, had a kind of flair, an imaginative way of putting on plays. We talked, there were mutterings about ‘Oedipus.’ I left my ad dress.” Feist didn't forget. He sent Heath the script and Heath said, “Yes,” and he's not sorry. The approach to the play is “boldly classic.” The first two acts deal with Oedi pus as a family man with all the pressures of his house hold added to those of the gods. “I've had a great time working on the part,” Heath says. But he's not likely to make New York his home, no matter how great a success he may have. “I think,” he adds carefully, “what I might like to do is split my life, spend part of it abroad and part of it here. But, of course, it all depends on how I go in the play, doesn't it?” March 5 has been selected for the premiere of the Ken neth Jacobson‐Rhoda Roberts Lee Thuna musical “Show Me Where the Good Times Are,” at the new 499‐seat Edison Theater in the Hotel Edison. ... The Ellen Stewart The ater will house “The House of Leather,” March 16. The musical was to have gone into the Academy of Music. ... The incoming musical “Cry for Us All” has become “Who to Love.” Based on William Alfred's “Hogan's Goat,” it's due April 7.

841-> REALTY TRUST SET BY BANKAMERICA
The BankAmerica Corporation announced plans yesterday to join the rapidly growing ranks of banking concerns that have formed real estate investment trusts. The company, parent of the Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank, said its proposed $125‐million trust represented a “new source to the tradi tional avenues of real estate financing which will have the effect of increasing the flow of funds into housing.” Its move pointed up the in tense interest of banks in real estate operations of late, though some observers are be ginning to question whether there are enough sound invest ments into which the hundreds of dollars to be raised can be channeled. At least four bank‐sponsored’ trusts have actually begun op erations in the last 18 months or so and numerous others are in various stages of prepara tion. Rapid‐fire announcements of new trusts, for example, came in the first three days of April from the Chase Manhattan Bank ($125‐million), the First Pennsylvania Corporation ($50‐ million) and Wells Fargo & Co. ($100‐million). Chase is the only one of the giant New York City banks so far to publicly disclose an in terest in real estate trusts, but the First National City Corpo ration is widely rumored to have a trust in the advanced planning stage. Such trusts customarily in vest the proceeds from the sale of shares of beneficial interest —and sometimes also deben tures — in high‐yielding mort gages on income‐producing properties and in construction loans for builders of various types of housing. The trusts are seen as reliev ing banks and thrift institutions from heavy demand for such loans, thus freeing them to make more real estate loans, not normally acquired by trusts, such as on single‐family hous ing to individuals.

842-> Owners Discussing Deal
The fight between the Madi son Square Garden Corporation and Transnation Development Corporation for control of Roosevelt Raceway, Inc., ap pears to he reaching a solution. Yesterday, Madison Square Garden indicated that it is not opposed to selling its 37.5 per cent holding in the race‐track to Transnation, holder of 26 per cent of the Roosevelt com mon stock. Negotiations on the sale have been going on for some time and are continuing. However, a final decision on the sale has not yet been made by Madison Square Garden. Attempts to get additional in formation concerning details of the transaction from both par ties were unsuccessful. A spokesman for the Garden confirmed That discussions con cerning the possible sale were continuing but he refused to elaborate. The Garden spokesman noted that the discussions with Trans nation also involved the possi bility of a merger between the two companies as well as Trans nation selling its interests in Roosevelt Raceway to the Garden. In a telephone interview, Philip J. Levin, the New Jersey real estate developer who is chairman and president of Transnation, said he could add nothing to the remarks of the Garden spokesman. In March, the Garden and Transnation announced they were discuss ing the possibility of a merger. Transnation, formerly the G. & W. Land Development Corporation, owner of the Ar Iington and Washington Park race tracks in Chicago, controls 26 per cent of the Roosevelt stock. Goldman, Sachs & Co., and its clients own about 7.5 per cent. Roosevelt Raceway has 1.3 million shares outstanding. In other merger develop ments, Pennzoil United, Inc., said that preparations are nearing completion for the spinoff of its distribution divi sion into a new corporation, United Gas, Inc., in compliance with a Securities and Exchange Commission order resulting from the consolidation of Penn zoil and United Gas Corpora tion in 1968. U.S. Natural Resources, Inc., said it has agreed in principle to acquire East Sierra Develop ment Corporation for common stock valued at about $12,500, 000.

Terry Bradshaw, the No. Ⅰ selection of the 1970 pro football draft, will report to the Pittsburgh Steelers training camp this summer without his college degree. So what. Bradshaw is attractive, articulate, newly rich and a talented quarterback headed toward a losing team. A college di ploma for Bradshaw would probably be as fancy a piece of unnecessary baggage as his Burgundy Thunderbird his boxer pupa But for many of the other 441 draftees— about half of whom will not be graduated with their classes, either—the lack of a diploma may, be a real hardship. Those who return to col lege next fall, after being cut from a pro team roster, or next spring, after a sea son in the National Football League or perhaps a minor league, will have to pay their own tuition — their four or five year football scholarships will have been pissed on to the class of 74. Some of those who never get degrees may lose opportunities in teaching, coaching, government work and other areas where a di ploma is a union card. And this waste of time and money is not the indi vidual's alone since most universities and colleges re ceive Federal and state funds, get tax advantages and are supported by alumni contributions and the tuition payments of nonplaying stu dents. A recent survey conducted here disclosed that only five of the top 10 draft picks would be graduated with their classes. This was hardly startling for people who have come to regard big‐time college football as a pro fessional farm system: If it is difficult enough for many nonathletes to be graduated in four years while taking part in extracurricular activities and responding to the social climate, it would seem almost impossible for a young man saddled with what could be considered, in some schools, either a fulltime job or a second major. Also, most college football is as valid a pre‐professional course as pre of the top 10 picked are pro‐oriented, and to some of them med or animal husbandry. But of the others selected, only about 53 per cent received their degrees. This figure was based on the 124 draftees—scattered through the 17 rounds of the draft— from the 10 schools that produced the top 10, and from 12 other schools that produced four or more players for the draft. Only 66 of the 124 were to be graduated this year, and even that total is not sure—it was supplied by athletic departments, and does not take into consideration players who were given five years to complete their courses. This is hardly new. In 1965, 34 New York Giants were interviewed. Twelve had no undergraduate degrees. Of the 22 that had been graduated, five took five years on “red shirt” programs that allowed their colleges to spread their eligibility. Of 38 Jets interviewed that year, 17 had no undergraduate degrees. Five of the 21 graduates took five‐ year courses. One Jet said: “You practice three hours an afternoon and you have meetings at night, so when do you have time to study? If you take only 12 credits in the fall, you have to take 18 in the spring to catch, up, and that's in human. And we didn't have a scholarship after four years, so if you didn't have a degree you had to pay your way through college if you wanted to stay in. If you didn't have‐the money, that was your tough luck.” This year's most publicized college football dropout was James Street, the University of Texas quarterback. He withdrew for a banquet circuit tour a week before midyear exams. Texas was No. 1 on wire service and Presidential polls, but Street was not selected in the pro draft. He returned in the spring semester, to pitch for the baseball team, and said that the sabbatical was an enriching educa tional experience. His coach, Darrell Royal, agreed. Basketball provided a number of dropouts. A Purdue spokesman said that Rick Mount dropped out with a semester to go rather than allow his “good grade index” be ruined as he pursued speaking engagements, all‐star games and negotiating sessions. Pete Maravich was re portedly expelled from Louisiana State, along with a team mate, for “excessive, unexcused absence” from classes. Some observers thought Maravich probably was in eligible for some of the games he played. Others found this speculation absurd—after all, Maravich's coach was also his father.

TSLAMORADA, Fla. — Capt. Jack Brothers, a highly re garded Florida Keys light tackle fishing guide, likes to remember the time when he lived in Brooklyn waiting for the weekends when he and a fishing companion could drive to Montauk on Long Island and fish for striped bass. He is somewhat nostalgic about this, but does not re gret having made his move to the Keys, whose waters offer some of the best light and heavy tackle angling in the United States. Brothers, who operates out of the Islamorada Yacht Club basin, is also director of the Islamorada Orvis Florida Keys School for Fly Fisher Men and Spin Fishermen, which is now operating every weekend the year around. Not long ago, men like the well‐known author and an gler, Joe Brooks, or Rhode Wand's striped bass fisher man, Harold Gibbs, were among the few who went after salt‐water species (if one excludes Atlantic sal mon) with a flyrod, but this has changed dramatically in the past decade. Now a man wielding a flyrod in the salt shallows, whether for stripers or bonefish or some other species, is no longer an oddity. The formation of the Salt water Flyrodders of Amer ica by Elwood (Cap) Colvin of Seaside Park, N. J., and others had much to do with thit, and the Orvis fishing schools (created by the Orvis Tackle Company in Man chester, Vt.) are spreading the gospel, also. Other Orvis fishing schools (there is one in Manchester, Vt.) will soon be opened in the Bahamas, in Connecticut and in New Jersey, accord ing to Broters and George Hommell Jr. Hommell is president of World Wide Sportsman, Inc., of Islamo rada, a fast‐growing tour agency and outfitting organ ization for sportsmen. One may make reservations for the Islamorada Orvis Fishing School through Hommell's organization. Brothers worked hard to find bonefish for Jack Sampr son of New York City and me. We spotted a few of them, but none came within range of our flyrods or spin ning rods. Brothers then took us to a spot in Florida Bay where we caught a dozen mangrove snappers, one of them over five pounds. Other fish caught included barracuda, Spanish mackerel, jack cre valle and bluefish. The blues, averaging about three pounds, were of a lighter hue than their cousins from northern waters, being almost silvery in color. That evening at Brothers's home, Sampson and I ate most of the snappers we had caught that day, and were reminded once again that mangrove snapper is one of the great food fishes of the world. The dinner conversation was easy‐paced for the most part, but grew heated when Brothers advanced the thesis that fly fishing for trout and salmon was less complicated than fly fishing for salt water species. We admired his dedica tion but not his logic.

846-> Subway Plans Test of Energy Storing
A system that stores the energy of a moving subway train as it helps bring the train to a halt, then uses the stored energy to help the train start up agan may be tested on the city's subway system as a way of reducing electric bills. The mechanical‐electrical sys tem was described yesterday by the Metropolitan Transpor tation Authority, which said it was seeking Federal and state funds to enable it to conduct a $1.7‐million, 24‐month test of the system. The transportation agency said that if the system was adopted for use on the subways, it could eventually re duce the cost of electric power for the subway system by sev eral million dollars a year. The Transit Authority which is un der the M.T.A., now spends $33‐ million a year to purchase power from the Consolidated Edison Company. The system would have further side benefits in addi tion to saving power, according to M.T.A. It would reduce the grating noise from the present air brake system, in which metal brake “shoes” contact metal wheels. It would also reduce the amount of heat created in tun nels and platform areas by the present friction braking system. The stored‐energy system would make use of the present traction motors under each car, which receive power fom the third rail. Each car would be equipped with an extra pair of motors — each motor coupled to a heavy metal flywheel. This is how the system would work: When a train motorman ap plied the brakes the electrical field in the car's traction motors would be reversed, causing them to generate electric power instead of using it. The train would be braked as the mo mentum was used to drive these “generators.” The power from motors‐turned‐generators would be applied to the flywheel motors, causing the flywheels to rotate at high speed. When the train was ready to resume motion, the motorman's movement of the controls would not reverse the fields on both the flywheel motors and the traction motors. The flywheel motors, now spinning on fly wheel momentum as the train sits in the station, would then become generators their power would help drive the traction motors, which have re sumed their normal propulsion role. The flywheel‐generator com bination, the agency said, would produce as much as half ithe electricity needed to ac celerate the train and keep it in motion until the next stop. The agency said the system would reduce both peak‐power requirements and total con sumption of power. The cost of electricity is based on peak demands as well as total con sumption, the agency noted. The energy‐storage system, according to the authority, could make it possible to op erate more air conditioned cars without major expansion of the existing power supply system. The Tri‐State Transportation Commission, acting on behalf of M.T.A., has requested the Federal Department of Trans portation to allocate two‐thirds of the cost of the test. The Garrett Corporation, a division of Research Inc. of Los Ange les, which devised a system to be tested, would put up $100,‐ 000 of the cost.

848-> FOE IN CAMBODIA ATTACKS 4 TOWNS
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, Aug. 9—Communist forces attacked three towns north and south of Pnompenh and another near the ancient temples of Angkor yes terday. All the attacks were repulsed, according to a statement by the Cambodian military command. The command said that the neaviest attack had been against Saang, 12 miles south of here and the scene last April of the first major battle between Cam bodian and Communist forces. The town's battalion com mander said, however, that the attack had involved only sev eral dozen Vietcong firing mor tars into the town while an other small enemy force struck at Cambodian lines with fire from automatic weapons and recoilless rifles. Enemy forces also attacked Government positions in Ang tassom, 41 miles southwest of the capital, the statement said. No casualty reports were avail able. The Government state ment reported that the enemy had withdrawn after two hours of fighting. The fighting at Saang and Angtassom, although inconclu sive, pointed up the increasing restiveness and mobility of en emy forces south of the capital. Commanders in the field said today they expected the attacks would be stepped up as Viet cong units in the area were re placed by more disciplined North Vietnamese regulars. Enemy troops also attacked the district town of Preytotung, 40 miles northeast of Pnom penh and 12 miles east on Highway 7 from Skoun, where a week of intermittent fighting ended Friday when Govern ment forces pushed enemy troops out of the town. Fighting at Preytotung The Cambodian statement said that “numerous North Vi etnamese” had been killed in the attack on Preytotung and that some enemy documents had been captured. Government casualties were not reported. Also attacked were Govern ment positions around Siem reap, the now deserted tourist town just south of the enemy held Angkor temple complex in northwestern Cambodia. The command's report stated that the fighting continued into the morning and that at last report two Government soldiers and two enemy soldiers had been killed. The command also reported fighting between Government troops and the enemy near the mountain chalet built at Kiri rom by Prince Norodom Si hanouk, the deposed head of state. Kirirom, a resort town 60 miles southwest of Pnom penh, has been in enemy hands for a week, and new fighting occurred when a Government force penetrated enemy terri tory there. 12 Americans Killed SAIGON, South Vietnam Aug. 9 (Reuters)—Twelve Americans were reported killed and at least 50 wounded last night and today in increased battle. field action in the northern re gion of South Vietnam. In the biggest clash, troops of the Americal Division's 196th Brigade came under heavy fire during operations in Quangtin Province about 50 miles south of Danang, the United States command reported. Five American soldiers were killed and five others wounded before artillery and helicopter gunships drove back the enemy, the command said. Enemy losses were put at 26 dead. The United States command said three Americans had been killed and one wounded in other ground action in South Vietnam. Two others were reported killed when a UH‐1 helicopter was shot down in Phuoclong Province just north of Saigon. There were no casualties when a second Huey was downed in northern Quangngai Province, the command said. The 25th Infantry Division's headquarters at Dautieng, about 50 miles northwest of Saigon, was struck by 20 mortar rounds early Saturday night fol lowed by another five rounds two hours later, the command said. Early today 20 more rounds landed in the camp. Casualties there were de scribed as light.

849-> Christian Overture to Jews Called ‘Hoax’ by Rabbi Here
The executive vice president of the Synagogue Council of America said yesterday the re cent notion that Christians were interested in “all forms of interreligious contact with the Jewish community” was “a hoax.” In a speech here to the Na tional Governing Council of the American Jewish Congress, Rabbi Henry Siegman said that virtually all initiative for con tact had come from Jewish or ganizations. “To this day there Is not a single Protestant denomina tional agency or ecumenical agency, including the National Council of Churches, which has a single full‐time person as signed to the problem of anti Semitism or to the area of Christian‐Jewish relations,” Rabbi Siegman said. Referring to the Mideast situation, Rabbi Siegman said Jews were disillusioned “at the Christian silence during and since the ‘six‐day war’” of June, 1967.

850-> PACIFIC GAS SETS BOND‐SALE PACE
Institutional investors re mained on the sidelines yester day as the week's largest com petitive taxable bond offering reached the market to yield 8.55 per cent, or 5‐100ths of a percentage point more than a comparable issue that sold slowly on Tuesday. This indifference to higher yields apparently reflected a view that the supply of issues up for sale in the next several weeks would provide ample opportunity to make purchases at even more attractive rates. “Our market's lousy,” one trader commented. “There's just too many bonds around.” The key offering was the sale of $75‐million of double‐A bonds by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, which awarded them to a Blyth & Co., Inc., underwriting group on a bid of 99.62 for an 8% per cent coupon. The 8.55 per cent yield com pared with 8.50 on a Kansas Gas and Electric Company of fering also won by Blyth—the day before. The manager estimated that 45 per cent of the Pacific Ga: bonds were placed yesterday mostly with small investors. somewhat smaller percentage remained from the Kansas City deal. In appraising the relative at tractiveness of the two offer ings, both double‐A rated, was noted that the Kansas Ga: issue offered some “scarcity” value because the company had not sold an issue since 1966. The Pacific Gas bonds, on the other hand, could be expected to provide a somewhat better trading market. The Pacific Gas bonds, due in 2002, were priced at 100.816. The interest cost to the corn pany was 8.66 per cent, down from 8.94 at the preceding sale in November. Meanwhile, the supply of bonds for future sale continued to build as the International Harvester Credit Corporation announced plans to sell $100 million of debentures and notes Df unspecified maturity and several other concerns set Financing plans. Other sectors of the bond market, where the calendars are not so crowded with offer ings, fared a bit better. The market for Government securities advanced during the lay and that for tax‐exempts, while not buoyant, was fairly steady. Little progress was made in selling the large Cleveland and Maryland issues from earlier in the week, which showed com bined sales of late yesterday by stockholders of Rival Manu facturing. Rival netted $2,171,000, or $2.07 a share, on sales of $27,720,000 last year. Dart has not yet reported profits for 1969, but in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1969, it earned $31,798,000, or $1.62 a share, on sales of $515,495,000. In merger developments, the Power Corporation of Canada said it would make a share exchange offer valued at $135 million for the stock of Consoli dated‐Bathurst, Ltd., a news print and pulp producer. The offer will be made by the end of next month on the basis of two and a half Power Corporation common shares for each share of Consolidated Bathurst. Power Corporation al ready owns 975,000 shares, or about 16.5 per cent, of. Consoli dated‐Bathurst's 5,917,818 out standing common shares. Pullman, Inc., said it has ac quired the Aloe Coal Company of Imperial, Pa., which has been providing a solid waste disposal service using sanitary landfill techniques for a large portion of Pittsburgh. Through the acquisition, Pull man will hold an 80 per cent interest in Aloe Coal with the balance retained by William and Arthur Aloe, brothers and co‐founders of the privately held concern. An agreement in principle has been reached for Telecheck International, Inc., to buy the construction materials division of Amfac, Inc. The purchase for approximately $17‐million in cash and notes will include all receivables, inventory, machin ery and equipment of the divi sion. The division is a major distributor in Hawaii of build ing materials, glass, lumber, plumbing supplies and fixtures. Western Union Corporation said it has completed arrange ments to acquire a controlling interest in PR Newswire As sociation, Inc. Western Union's subsidiary, the Western Union Telegraph Company, last June announced its intention to acquire an interest in the pri vately held news distribution firm. The transaction calk fnr an exchange of more than 60,000 shares of Western Union Corporation investment letter stock for an 81 per cent interest in PR Newswire. Under the agreement, PR Newswire would continue to be managed by Herbert Muschel, president, and David Steinberg, executive vice president. American International Group, Inc., insurers, said that its board of directors have ap proved an offer to acquire all the assets of American Inter national Underwriters Overseas, Inc., Bermuda, and all of the capital stock of American In ternational Underwriters Cor poration from C. V. Starr & Co., Inc., for 1,983,200 shares of American International Group common stock. The purchase includes cer tain assets of Starr including its land and buildings situated at 102 Maiden Lane, New York, and the stock of the 206 Sansome Street Corporation in San Francisco. Based on American Interna tional Group's closing price of 83 yesterday on the over‐the counter market, the transaction is valued at more than $160 million.

852-> Fighting the ‘Mainstream’ Seen for ‘Black Decade’
Three basic assumptions inform and undergird much of my thinking about the future of black education in the seventies. Naturally enough, these points of view grow out of the living and the pondering of that strange set of cele brations and lamentations which have shaped the experiences of black people in America since World War II. So they are not my private property. Nevertheless, so that my particular bias may be clear, they must be initially stated and identified as part of the intel lectual baggage I bear. The first assumption is that we who are black in America are not simply a deprived minority who will one day make it into the national mainstream, but that we are instead America's major internal colony. (Indeed, this recognition of our participation in the experience of the colonized peoples of the earth is perhaps the major single development in the thinking of many black persons of my own generation.) In such a context, education becomes highly political. And that is the second assumption: that the education of black people in America is a profoundly politi cal matter. For the issue becomes far more than the struggle to have an “equal” education. Rather it builds into the larger question of who shall control the methods, goals and content of that education. • Few struggles between colonized and colonizer are more important than that for the control of the education of the children of the oppressed. For the very meaning and future of their existence in relationship to the “Mother Country” is often at stake here. (On the other hand, few issues are harder to redefine for those who have fought so hard all of their lives for the “right” to be assimi lated into the camp of the colonizers.) Finally, these meditations on the fu ture are also shaped by a recognition of the fact that chronological decades are often most uncooperative in their comings and goings among us. They have a tendency to begin or end not when a movement has burst upon the scene, or at the clear denouement of an epoch, but arrive instead at some groping, am biguous moment when all is uncertain and unclear. January, 1970, is such a moment for the consideration of black education, especially when it is tied to political struggles here and overseas. It comes in the midst of an era, and to understand this moment it is necessary to remember the last quarter of the century. In the time scheme of black America the end of World War II marked one crucial turning point. A new decade had begun in 1945. The colonized peoples of the world were clearly in movement, and we were participants. The 1954 Supreme Court decision was for us the next epochal point fo cused initially on the educational aspects of the struggle. Thus another decade be gan for black America, but with an agenda set largely by liberal white America's response to the initiatives of the colonized here and abroad. For that agenda, for that epoch, the apogee was somewhere between the March on Washington in 1963 and the passing of the Civil Rights Bill of 1964. But in the very heart of those days, another era, another decade was begin ning. The black agenda for education and politics (and all other things con cerning our lives) was being searched out. Whatever the lack of clarity of that black agenda, more and more per sons began to insist that black manhood and responsibility (to say nothing of black decolonization) clearly rested on the use of our initiative in searching out the new directions. Whites and white American institu tions could no longer define the educa tional struggle and its goals for us. Not only was it essential to our integrity, it was necessary simply because the liberal agenda had clearly proven bankrupt at most and inadequate at least in educa tion as in all else. For many reasons, then, the search was rightly ours. We are now In the midst of that search. The assassinations of Malcolm and Martin Luther King may have pro vided the two focal turning points for the period. That is not yet clear. But what is clear is the fact that January, 1970, finds the search going on. Naturally enough the character of this searching that spills over into the seven ties is shaped by its beginnings. For black‐conscious educators from nursery school to graduate seminars, the quest is mercilessly informed by the insistent struggle against the cultural and political hegemony of the Euro‐American way of life and thought which have wreaked such havoc upon the globe. The struggle is for the meaning of black authenticity, for a new definition of man, one illuminated by a set of ex periences wider and deeper than that of Western white man. The search now and in the seventies is toward creative black alternatives to the white public and private education which has helped shape America into its present ominous emptiness of spirit. The search is also for the means to keep these black experiments in educational creativity under the control of the black community. For the assumption of the black dec ade is that those who have colonized us for 300 years are essentially unqualified to educate our children, to help to know themselves, their fathers and their fu ture. (Of course, the tragic corollary is that they have also proven unqualified for the education of their own children.) Increasingly the seventies will find the American “mainstream” called into question. The racist assumptions that search will be for ways to change the direction of that stream, to move against its poisonous presence. The search will be for an education which will create a generation of young black children who seek to use their gifts and skills for the building of a community which becomes a black bea con to the world. Obviously such a sense of vocation will involve continuing confrontations on many levels with the existing order. The moribund institutions of education which continue to colonize our minds will be given no rest in their exploitative mediocrity. The conventional academic and scholarly wisdom will be called into question. The racist assumptions that stand at the crux of the social sciences in America will be exposed. • Those who specialize in educational analysis of black people will be chal lenged relentlessly. The foundations of American assumptions about the educa tion of blacks (and whites) will be at tacked on every hand, and—as is already evident—there will be resistance, but the struggle will be carried on. For this is the coming of the black agenda, one which recognizes with W. E. B. DuBois that we must either achieve full humanity on these shores or be crushed in the attempt. Out of such educational struggles will come new forms of black experimenta tion. Indeed, experimentation will con tinue to be the mode in the seventies, not because it is chic, but because it is necessary for our life. So our movements toward decoloniza tion and liberation and in search of a new humanity, while sharing many as pects of other situations, must strike out in totally new directions. For we are required to come to new and healthy birth in the midst of a spiritually and politically corrupt organism. This kind of horning has not often been known by man. We are therefore pressed to move without models. That is why the beginning of the seventies finds us in the midst of our own Black Decade, into an age of exper imentation and transition in education (as in all else that is seriously black). This is the deepest significance of the attempts at black studies on white cam puses. This is behind the demand of students at Fisk and Howard and scores of other “Negro colleges” that their schools become truly black universities. This is the significance of independent black experiments like the University of Islam, Nairobi College in California, Mal coln X Liberation University in Durham, the Center for Black Education in Wash ington, D. C. and the Topographical Institute in Chicago—as well as scores of others. It is also the motivation for the hundreds of independent black ele mentary schools which have developed across the nation since 1964. We are in search of an alternative to American death. We see no evidence that the main stream of white America has the will, the spirit or the energy to create an alternative to the chaos of the West. We therefore move and build in the midst of this Black Decade, for we sense that our time has come. Education in every formal and informal sense — shaped by political and spiritual reali ties — stands near the heart of the matter. So we struggle to shape it for our people — for our world.

853-> WESTPORT. SPLIT OVER BUSING VOTE
WESTPORT, Conn., Dec. 9— A petition to unseat the chair man of the Board of Education here began circulating today after the chairman cast the de ciding vote to bring 25.Bridge port slum children into the nearly all‐white Burr Farms Elementary School. Petitions Sought to Unseat Head of Education Board Special to The New York Times The chairman, mrs. Joan Schine, is the object of an at tempt by the Recall Committee of Westport to obtain signa tures of 2,100 electors and thereby force a recall election for her post. The committee has 60 days to collect the sig natures under provisions of the town charter. The recall elec tion would follow in 20 days. Pleas Sent to 5,950 The announcement of the petition was made today In a mailing to 5,950 Westport homes. It said that the peti tioners would not be signing against anything, but would be assuring everyone in town an opportunity to be heard on the controversial issue. The announcement blamed Mrs. Schine, a five‐year mem ber of the board whose term expires next November, with also casting the deciding vote preventing the issue from go ing to a referendum. In a separate letter to the Board of Selectmen, which would conduct the election, the committee said it “demanded Mrs. Schine's recall because she spearheaded the move which will bring Bridgeport ghetto pupils into Westport schools Feb. 1, 1971, against the wishes and desires of Westport citi zens.” The mailing to homeowners warned that 80 Bridgeport chil dren were scheduled to come to the Westport) schools next September and 700 more were expected in the near future un der a program called Project Concern, which has been suc cessfully utilized to bus slum children into affluent suburbs around Hartford and New Ha ven and in Boston. Mrs. Schine, a Democrat, was supported in a 3 to 2 vote for Project Concern by two other members of her party. While the petition announcement car ries the names of a 61‐member steering committee, including Republicans, Democrats and un affiliated voters, the recall com mittee is believed to have been begun ‘by Republican leaders. The Board of Education had received a standing ovation from an audience of about 500 after it voted to adopt Project Concern. However, the issue has kept a large part of this wealthy commuter town in ac rimonious ‘debate for much of the year. As many as 1,000 per sons have attended meetings where there have been bitter exchanges and school board members say they have re‐, ceived threats.

Doctors, lawyers, writers, ance men, other salesmen, and or professional men belong to bankers and brokers, insur many independent business clubs—eating clubs, men's social clubs or country clubs, where they often en tertain business contacts. Generally, such entertain ment expenses for food and drink can be deducted for in come tax purposes. If they use a little shrewd planning, they can also deduct part of their club dues. The value of such planning was pointed up in a recent case carried through the United States Tax Court by a Buffalo, N. Y., obstetrician and gynecologist, Dr. Harry G. LaForge. The physician didn't score a 100 per cent victory, but one plus factor was that the court rebuffed Internal Rev enue Service lawyers on an important point. The victory was that the court ruled that if the ex penditures for food and drink at clubs were properly busi ness related, then the portion attributable to wives could also be used in figuring the per centage of club dues that could be tax‐deductible. Basically, the rules for de ducting club dues are twofold. The taxpayer must show, first, that the club was used primarily for business.This involves business ‐ related use for more than 50 per cent of the actual time the club is used by the member. Thus, if a man uses a club 20 times a year, 11 of the the visits must be business‐related. Dr. LaForce, not an active club man evidently used the country club of Buffalo five times in 1964 and the same number in 1965. In 1964, three occasions (dinners and cocktails) were business‐re lated and in 1965, four of them were for business rea sons. Next, the taxpayer must show what percentage of the dollar amounts spent at the club during the year for food and drink can be properly called business‐related. In 1964, Dr. LaForge claimed $86 in business spending at the club, and $73 in personal spending. In 1965, his stand ing was broken down to $85 business and $51 personal. He also made claims for deduction of dues in another club, the Buffalo Club. • The Tax Court disallowed the dues deduction for the Buffalo Club, because the 50 per cent use test was not ful filled, but it found that “the primary use test has been met with respect to the Coun try Club of Buffalo.” After some slight reduc tions, the court applied the percentage rule and held that 53.9 per cent of the amount spent at the Country Club was for business, and hence permitted the physi cian to deduct 63.9 per cent of the $750 in dues paid in 1964. For 1965, it ruled that 47.7 per cent of expenditures were business‐related and so he could deduct 47.7 per cent of the $891 in dues paid for 1965. In making its decision, the court rejected the I.R.S. claim that spending on the wives should not be included. “To maintain that the expenses allocated to wives is here only “associated” with enter tainment is an attempt to undermine the business meal rule,” the court said. Thus, like Dr. LaForge, other businessmen can en tertain their wives and the wives of possible customers (in his case physicians who make referrals) and use the totals for figuring the dues deduction. Under the business meal rule, the I.R.S. has long in sisted that the entertainment must be “directly related” to the host's business or must be “associated” with it. • In the first case, the ac tual discussion of business must have transpired during dinner or cocktails. Or, to be business “asso ciated,” the eating and drink ing usually must occur di rectly before or after the dis cussion. One exception is the “quiet business meal” con ducive to business talk. However, tax men sound a warning that might be called the “wandering eye” test. If there is a floor show or other distraction, the I.R.S. might effectively chal lenge a particular deduction. In the case of Dr. LaForge, one bill was marked “Las Vegas,” indicating some form of entertainment, and he lost a deduction of about $10. This points to the impor tance of good record keeping or other substantiation. Dr. La Forge kept itemized state ments sent by the clubs and the bills for his spending. In each cape, he jotted on them the names of persons entertained and why, or who they were. In fact, the I.R.S. did not challenge the busi ness expense because of the well‐maintained records.

856-> Hugo Weisgall Conducts Own Works
Hugo Weisgall's music was the subject of the “Com posers in Performance” con cert in Rogers Auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum on Tuesday night, and Mr. Weis gall was on hand to conduct the two works presented. The first was “Fancies and Inven tions,” a cycle of 10 songs to poems from Robert Her rick's “The Hesperides,” and the other was “The Strong er,” his one‐act opera of 1952 based on Strindberg's clay. The Aeolian Chamber Play ers, with assisting instrumentalists, made up the small orchestra, Julian Pat rick, baritone, sang the songs, and Johanna Meier, soprano, was The Woman in the opera, which has only one singing character. The opera, which has been performed here previously and has been recorded, re vealed itself once again as a viable work in which the composer achieved a telling and expressive unity of words and music and managed to avoid the monotony that al ways threatens in a one character work. The song cycle, which was completed only this year and was given its first New York performance, did not make an equally good impression on this listener. The econ omy of Herrick's poetry was destroyed by word and phrase repetitions, and no substitute benefit was offered by the score. The music, skillfully con trived and sounding some what like that of Berg, might have the makings of an in teresting instrumental work, but it did not enhance or illuminate the poetry. Both Miss Meier and Mr. Patrick provided excellent performances, as did the in strumental ensemble.

857-> A God Who Made Dam Builders Think Twice
EL RIO, Tex.—A massive stone statue of Tlaloc, the Aztec rain god, towers over the Mexican end of huge Amistad Dam on the Rio Grande and silently observes the rising popularity of Amistad Reservoir, the Southwest's newest flood‐control and water‐sports recreation complex. The engineers who built Amistad Darn don't really believe that Tlaloc controls the rain, but then again. . . . In June of 1954, less than a year after the dedication of Falcon Interna tional Dam nearly 300 miles farther down the Rio Grande, a deluge of un precedented violence descended on the countryside. Some 22 inches of rain fell in three days, wiping out villages, roads and bridges and almost overflowing Falcon Dam, which did not then (and still does not) have a suitable tribute to Tlaloc. The lesson was not Iost on the Mexi can Government. When construction started on Amistad Dam, a six‐mile‐long, S‐shaped, 254‐foot‐high earth‐filled structure about 14 miles north of Del Rio, officials decided that a lordly statue of Tlaloc would add an ornamental touch—and a sort of solid‐state insur ance policy. Amistad Darn was completed in 1968, the reservoir is filling gradually and there have been no destructive floods. Although Amistad Reservoir, with a shoreline longer than Lake Mead's, still little known outside Texas, it at tracted a half‐million visitors last year —and it was not much more than half full. In January of this year, at the bottom point of the slack midwinter season, the National Park Service re ported 30,000 visitors, more than double the total for the same month last year. As a result, a boom has come to the once‐sleepy border town of Del Rio, at the junction of U. S. 90 and 277. It had 19,000 inhabitants in 1960, and expects to show 30,000 in the 1970 census. In the quiet old days, Del Rio was noted mainly for its shipments of angora wool and as the site of the only winery in Texas. Amistad Reservoir is administered for recreation purposes by the Department of the Interior. When Congress gets around to making the arrangement of ficial, the reservoir, or lake, will become a national recreation area. Then, funds permitting, the Park Serv ice can go ahead with its ambitious plans to develop at least a half‐dozen permanent marinas and recreation sites. The Mexican Government has already provided some tourist accommodations on its shoreline. In addition to facilities for wafer sports, fishing and camping, the Park Service plans extensive interpretive ex hibits to illustrate the story of prehis toric man in the river basin. Some of the nation's finest pictographs and petro glyphs have been found in caves and on canyon walls at the upper end of the reservoir. Unfortunately, some of the 45 known archeological sites have been, or even tually will be, inundated by the lake. Other sites will be brought within the reach of boat‐riding vandals, already a problem. For the greater part of each year, the level of the lake is expected to re main 1,117 feet above sea level. It will cover 67,000 acres—more than 100 square miles—with a shoreline of 851 miles (547 in the United States) and nearly all of it accessible to the public. All the land and water below the flood level, plus a half‐dozen sites above that level, are under the control of the Park Service. The Government is build ing, or will build, boat ramps, roads, trailer facilities, utility systems, camp grounds, picnic areas, trails and park ing spaces. Concessionaires will be given responsibility for building docks, boat storage, bait and tackle shops, motels and restaurants. Two temporary marinas already are in use, and there are several hundred privately owned boats on the lake. Mo tels, restaurants, resorts and stores ca tering to the water trade are springing up along the several highways that bor der or cross the lake. In addition, several large parcels of privately owned land overlooking the lake have been subdivided and are being sold for homesites. Dozens of new homes are already occupied, and many more are being constructed. Since it is situated at the junction of three rivers, a railroad line and several highways, the reservoir might well have been called “Lake of the Bridges” or “El Lago de los Puentes,” if you prefer the Spanish version, for it is crossed by some of the most spectacular spans in the Southwest. Millions of bass and catfish have been planted in the lake, and some specimens have already achieved great size. The reservoir has flooded out two small lakes on Devils' River: those lakes were built long ago for hydroelectric power and were popular with fishermen. Easy public access to both the Ameri can and Mexican shores is one of the chief reasons why Amistad Reservoir is fast becoming a well‐populated recrea tion area. There are customs stations on both sides of the international bound ary in the middle of the darn, as well as uncompleted visitors centers and ob servation towers, but travelers are waved through without the need for permits of any kind. By comparison, the shores of Falcon Reservoir are almost entirely blocked off by private ranch holdings. A new paved road leads from Amis tad Darn to the bustling Mexican city of Ciudad Acuna across the river from Del Rio. A paved highway runs from Ciudad Acuna to Mexico City, some 850 miles away. Although it Is not mentioned in tour ist Iiterature, the statue of Tlaloc is its own best advertisement. Some 36 feet high and constructed of 152 huge slabs of basalt in the bold angles and broad planes of typical Aztec sculpture, it rises majestically at the summit of a long, tapering flight of stone stairs, as if to survey the entire river world. Besides being the Aztec lord of the rains and the South, Tlaloc is the hus band of Chalchiuhtlicue, goddess of the East and of all running water and streams, and protector of newborn chil dren and of marriages. Tlaloc sometimes is shown wearing a mask of serpents, and serpents mean grief. Also called Nahualpilii, the serpent‐prince, Tlaloc ocan for those persons who die by drowning.—J.V.Y.

860-> MANSFIELD SEES A 2D NIXON TERM
WASHINGTON, July 10 —Senator Mike Mansfield, the Democratic leader of the Senate, predicted today that President Nixon would win re‐election in 1972, as things now appear, despite foreign and domestic problems. “The chances are in his favor,” the Montana Democrat said. “We haven't come forward with a candidate of stature who could match him. Of course, what may happen in two years I don't know. But as of now his chances are better than any Democrat's.” Senator Mansfield made the political assessment despite his expressed belief that Mr. Nixon is “in trouble” domestically and has the country “in up to our necks” in Cambodia, even after the withdrawal of troops. “The best man we have at the present time is Ed Muskie,” the Senator told a group of reporters over breakfast, “but you have to get out around the country and develop charisma and charm and a following. He has all these things but not in enough degree at this time.” Mr. Mansfield disposed fairly abruptly of the two other Democrats generally regarded as major contenders for the 1972 nomination, former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. “Hubert has lost his platform, and he needs to reestablish himself,” the Senator said of the 1968 Presidential candidate, who is now running for the Senate in Minnesota. “I don't think he can come back in a two‐year period enough to catch Muskie.” The Montanan said he believed that Senator Kennedy had been “always out” as far as the 1972 nomination was concerned, even before the Chappaquiddick accident. He is fully occupied with running for re‐election in Massachusetts, Mr. Mansfield said, “and I don't think he's looking beyond that election at this time.” Although not optimistic over his prospects, Senator Mansfield expressed strong support for Mr. Muskie as a national candidate. Had the Maine Senator headed the ticket in 1968, he said, the party might have beaten Mr. Nixon. Domestic Trouble Mr. Mansfield said the President was in trouble domestically “because his program hasn't stopped unemployment or reduced inflation or cut the cost of living.” As for Vietnam, the Senator said President Nixon had told him privately that he intended to “get out” before his term axpired at the end of 1972. Senator Mansfield said he believed that the President meant "all out, air cover, support troops, everything.” “I know the President would give anything to get out and put this thing behind him,” Mr. Viansfield observed. With respect to Cambodia, the Senator said. “Indirectly, we're still involved, in up to our necks.” This involvement, he explained, consists of the presnIce of South Vietnamese troops, United States advisers, United States logistic and air support and a fivefold increase in our military mission in Pnompenh.

861-> CITY WILL CLOSE 5 RELIEF CENTERS
The city announced yester day that five of its 50 welfare centers would be closed by Feb. 1 because of the “fiscal crisis.” Municipal union lead ers responded promptly with plans for a “job action” to protest the resulting heavier loads on caseworkers. Human Resources Adminis trator Jule M. Sugarman said that two large centers with total caseload of 16,600 and three small neighborhood cen ters that served 250 to 500 per sons a week would shut down. But he added: “The entitlement of eligible clients to public assistance and Medicaid will in no way be cur tailed, nor will any center em ployes be laid off?’ The two large centers to be closed are the Mott Haven So cial Services Center (5,500 cli ents) at 328 East 150th Street, the Bronx, and Bushwick Social Services Center (11,130) at 30 Thornton Street in Brooklyn. The three neighborhood or “sat ellite” centers affected are in Brooklyn at 281 Dumont Ave nue in Brownsville, 122‐24 Bushwick Avenue in Williams burg and 142 Kings First Walk in Brownsville. Of the 508 staff members in the five centers to be closed, 352 are to be assigned to six other centers taking over the caseloads. The 156 remaining administrative, casework and clerical employes are to be re assigned to fill vacancies else where in the Department of Social Services, which operates all the centers. Clients affected would be re ferred to other centers. Mr. Sugarman conceded that the “necessity for economy” as ex plained by Mayor Lindsay would impose some hardship— longer waiting periods and longer traveling distances for some clients and a difficult ad justment on the part of staff members. Victor Gotbaum, executive director of District Council 37, State, County and Municipal Workers, protesting that the city had violated contractual agreements, announced a news conference at 11 A.M., today, to explain details of the pro posed “job action.” A spokesman for the district council said that the “action” might take the form of a re fusal by caseworkers to accept more than 75 cases. That is they number specified as maximum in the contract, he said. According to the union spokesman, the caseload for each worker was nearing 90 and threatened to shoot up more rapidly as more and more caseworkers left the depart ment because of the frustration of trying to meet the needs of so many people. He said further that the So cial Service Department had failed to add the full comple ment of 750 extra caseworkers promised by the end of October to meet the rapidly rising num ber of welfare cases. “As of now, only some 600 have been added,” he said, “and meanwhile many workers have left the service.” Stan Hill, president of the Social Service Employes Union, a member union of District Council 37, is scheduled to appear also at the Gotbaum news conference at 365 Broad way. The “job action” might also take the form of a slow down, a council source said. The shutdown of the five centers would bring about econ omies in rents and in salary expenses, he said. With the reassignment of the personnel to existing vacancies the de partment would save $1.2‐mil ‘lion otherwise needed to fill those vacancies. With the re moval of operations from the five locations the department would save $312,000 in annual rent.

864-> Red Reality Beats Crack Ruler by Head at Aqueduct
Thtee eligibles for the $50, 000 added Carter Handicap which will be contested at Aqueduct a week from tomor row, and a naneligible for that fixture, who had won five of his six 1970 starts, were among the six principals yesterday in the Big A's featured Sailor Handicap. When the $15,000 mile race had been completed, one of the Carter hopefuls, Cragwood Sta ble's odds‐on Red Reality, was the winner over Andrew Som erville's Crack Ruler. The mar gin wasa head. A second look at the race's proceedings on film was re quired before the outcome could be made official by the stwwards. Ron Turcotte, aboar Crack Ruler — the 6‐year‐old has had victories this year at Bowie, Liberty Bell and Pim lico — maintained that. Jacinto Vasquez, guiding the favorite, had interfered with him in the stretch. The officials took one quick view of the photographs and detected no infraction. Red Reality's victory was made of ficial and his supporters re ceived a $3.80 straight payoff or $2. Red Reality is a 4‐year‐old gelding that was purchased for $60,000 in 1968 at Hialeah at the Florida 2‐year‐old sales. He raced only once as a juvenile, but last season scored six tri umphs in 17 starts, including three successes. In yesterday's outing, Vas quez kept his mount off the pace for most of the trip while the early leaders were using up their speed. He sent Red Reality into the lead near the end of the stretch turn and then spent the rest of this jour ney concentrating on having his charge outlast Crack Ruler, who lost for the second time this year. Tunex finished third and the winner's time was 1:36. The Cragwood gelding's tri umph gave chalk players in the crowd of 23,773 a chance to whoop it up some more. Red Reality was the fourth favorite to win in the first seven races, and second choices took the other three contests. Rokeby's Arts and Letters, 1969 horse of the year and early favorite for tomorrow's $75,000 added Grey Lag Handi cap, had his final serious work out yesterday, for the 1⅛th mile fixture. Traveling evenly, over Bel mont Park's main track, the highly regarded colt was clocked for five furlongs in 0:59 1–5 and eased up six fur longs at 1:12 3–5. The tune‐up, listed as “handy” by the clock ers showed a first quarter‐mile in 0:23 1–5, and a second quar ter in 0:23 3–5. The Rokeby star has had only one start this season. He finished fourth in the West chester while carrying 130 pounds last month and failed to show a rally in the stretch.

866-> Party Chiefs in Congress Offer Shriver a New Role
WASHINGTON, June 3—The Democratic. Congressional lead ership publicly asked Sargent Shriver today to head a new party council that would op erate outside existing organiza tions to revive popular support for the party and its candidates. The call to Mr. Shriver to head a proposed National Coun cil for Congressional Leadership was issued in a press release distributed with Mr. Shriver's approval. It appeared under the names of John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House; Carl Albert, the House majority leader; Mike Mansfield, the Senate majority leader; Edward M. Kennedy, the Senate major ity whip, and the heads of the Senate and House Democratic campaign committees. They joined more than 100 Democratic Senators and Rep resentatives who have signed a formal petition urging the post on Mr. Shriver, the first head of the Peace Corps, who recently resigned as Ambassa dor to France. Mr. Shriver was reliably re ported to have had a hand in drafting the language of the announcement—his spokesmen said he had insisted on a para graph declaring that the new council would be independent of all standing party groups. Nonetheless, he was said to be unready to respond to the appeal. Mr. Shriver, although faced with a bruising primary fight, has not yet publicly abandoned the idea of opposing Gov. Mar vin Mandel of Maryland for renomination. It was apparent he would not undertake both a campaign in Maryland and a nationwide speaking and fund I raising drive. Mr. Shriner who is a broth. er‐in‐law of Senator Kennedy, could not be reached for com ment today. But two close ad visers said that he would need “several days to respond” to the plea by the Democratic Congressional wing. “He has to formulate the terms under which he will ac cept it,” one aide said. The name of Lawrence F. O'Brien, the Democratic Na tional Chairman, was not among those making the ap peal to Mr. Shriver. At the Na tional Committee's office here, a spokesman said there was “a little embarrassment that we're not informed of what's going on.” Asked if there was “friction” in established Democratic or ganizations over the Shriver in vitation a committee source re plied, “Not yet.” The Congressional leaders' statement said that the Nation al Council for Congressional Leadership would have a grass roots constituency of “econom ic, social, political, ethnic and regional groups. It said that the council would supply speakers and speech material, provide research and “campaign coun seling,” and serve as a “coordi nator of efforts in support of Democratic candidates. The chairmanship of the council would apparently give Mr. Shriver the vehicle for making wide contacts with Democrats and citizens across the country, Mr. Shriver has not emphasized, but neither has he disavowed, the hopes of many of his advisers that he might be considered for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1972.

869-> City Ordered to Revoke Permit for S.I. Grading
A State Supreme Court Jus tice yesterday ordered the city to revoke a grading per mit issued to a Staten Island developer accused of despoil ing private land to sell earth for land fill. In a six‐pkge decision, Jus tice Theodore G. Barlow ruled that a plan submitted by the Ceesons Developers Corpora tion to the Highway Depart ment violates the Land Con tour Law of 1969, which re quires a written permit for land‐contour work, including grading and filling. In this case, Ceesons ap plied for and received last year a permit to cut to grade part of the easterly slope al Grymes Hill, a wooded am, residential area of Staten Island overlooking the Nar rows. The issuance of the per mit was challenged in court on Oct. 26 by Eastover Park Joint Ventures, a group that owns land adjacent to that of the developers. In its petition, Eastover de manded that the city revoke the permit under Article 78 of the Land Contour Law because the developer's plan, if carried out, would leave “a massive scar on one of the most beautiful hills on Staten Island—reminiscent of an abandoned strip mine.” The petitioners contend that Ceesons used the per mit “to illegally avoid the normal procedure for the development of the property” and to fulfill a contract to sell thousands of tons of fill to the nearby Silver Lake un derground water tank project. The decision criticizes Cee sons for misrepresenting on the plans “as to ownership of some of the area” and for not showing “all the grading work which must be done.” Throughout the Article 78 proceedings, the city main tained that Ceesons was operating well within the law, the purpose of which is to protect streets and nearby property owners from the creation of ponds and collec tion of drainage caused by faulty planning. “I am shocked that the city attempted to defend this when they had such a simple way out—to revoke the per mit,” said John J. Turvey, a lawyer for Eastover. Spokesmen for the High way Department and Ceesons said they would have to study the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

872-> Sorensen Attacks 3 Rivals for the Senate
For the first time, one of the candidates in the campaign for the Democratic nomination for Senator from New York at tacked the other three yester day. Theodore C. Sorensen crit icized the campaign spending of Representative Richard L. Ottinger and the campaign “gimmicks” of Representative Richard Max McCarthy and de nounced as “disastrous” Paul O'Dwyer's suggestions for nar cotics control. “I didn't mention their, names,” he said after a gong clanged to end the luncheon of the Brooklyn Rotary Club where he made his attack. But his phraseology made it clear whom he was talking about. For the most part, the tour candidates have marched to their own beats in this un focused campaign, pretty well ignoring their opponents. As Mr. Sorensen altered that pattern yesterday, the other three were doing the following: ¶Mr. Ottinger visited a Man hattan storefront where addicts are steered toward rehabilita tion programs and accused the Nixon Administration of de priving New York City of funds to keep such places open. ¶Mr. O'Dwyer hurried to the closing a throes of wordy “teach‐in” at the High School of Art and Design and called for a “Wagner Act for Stu dents.” ¶Mr. McCarthy, campaigning through the Rochester area spoke on the problems posed by inflation. A combination of factors makes this election as hard for the candidates to shape as for the politicians to predict. New York has no runoff, so that the man with the most votes in the primary on June 23 will be the Democratic nominee. But voter interest is not great. This has made for a campaign in which each man tries to build his own positive image without paying much attention to his opponents. Yesterday, that changed a bit. Mr. Sorensen went to Brook lyn to file a Federal Count suit on behalf of Pfc. Malcolm A. Berk of 69‐44 178th Street, Flushing, Queens, who is under orders to go to Vietnam. This violated a 1789 New York law, Mr. Sorersen said, that bars sending a New Yorker to war without the consent of the Legislature, except in cases “specially provided for” by the Federal Constitution. Then, after a walking tour, he visited the Rotarians at the St. George Hotel, “to talk a little hit about campaigning,” he said. Mr. Sorensen, a former aide to President John F.Kennedy, argued that he had the most experience of the four candi dates “but I can't get that fact across shaking hands on Fulton Street.” One candidate, (he meant Mr. Ottinger) was spending $2‐mil lion he said. “Is the election going to be decided by which candidate can spend the most?” he asked. One candidate (he meant Mr. McCarthy) was using “gim micks.” “Is the election going to be decided by who can jump the most often into the Hudson River?” He was referring to Mr. McCarthy's recent plunge into the river to dramatize pol lution. Later, in answer to a question on drug control, he said that another candidate (he meant Mr. O'Dwyer) favored the Brit ish system of giving free heroin to addicts. “It has failed in Britain,” Mr. Sorensen said, “It would be even more disastrous in this country.” Mr. Ottinger's campaign manager, Steve Berger, told about the talk, said later: “No. This campaign will not be de cided on the basis of which candidate will spend the most money. The Democratic voters of this state will vote for the candidate who has dealt most effectively with the issues that concern them.” Mr. O'Dwyer, who had not heard about the Sorensen talk, paused in a corridor of the Art and Design school before talk ing to the pupils to reiterate his plan for free drugs for ad dicts which, he said, would take the profit out of the drug traffic and thereby, curb an addicts incentive to steal. Mr. McCarthy's campaign committee chairman, Maurice Sonnenberg, said: “Having failed to drive Con gressman McCarthy off the bal lot, Mr. Sorensen now attempts to paint him and his superior House record as ‘a gimmick.’ He knows full well that a man of modest means must pursue a campaign for United States Senator with a great deal more energy and imagination than one who perhaps presumes to be the United States Senator before the race is ended.” He was talking about the legal challenge by some Soren sen supporters to Mr. McCarfi thy's nominating petitions, which ended last week when the Secretary of State ruled the petitions valid. Mr. Ottinger visited the Clin ton Community Orientation Cen ter at 350 West 49th Street, a neat wood‐paneled storefront across from the parking lot that replaced the old Madison Square Garden, to issue his warning on narcotics. The Nixon Administration was threatening to cut off $3‐ million to the city for opera tion of 28 such centers, he said. “Some 2,300 addicts would be back on the streets,” he said, as two young clients of the center nibbled on ice cream bars and shook their heads in solemn agreement. An Ottinger aide, Bill Chafe, who had done the research on this, said that the city was assuming it was going to get the money and Mr. Ottinger agreed later that it probably would — “but only because a whole bunch of us have been screaming about it,” he said. Mr. O'Dwyer carried his cam paign to 100 or so youngsters, the remnants of a two‐day “teach‐in,” who listened in ap parent confusion to his referen ces to the Wagner Act — the 1930's bill of rights for labor — but brightened when he suggested it was time for a bill of rights for students. A set of rules should be agreed to, he said, “so that there would not necessarily be a rumpus every time a problem arose.”

874-> BRITON TRIUMPHS BY 6‐3,11‐9,12‐10
WIMBLEDON, England, July 1—It will be Mrs. Margaret Court against Mr. Billie Jean King for the women's title at Wimbledon on Friday, just as everybody knew all along. Playing with her left ankle taped after an injury on Monday, Mrs. Court was fleet afoot today in disposing of Rosie Casals, 6‐4, 6‐1, in the $100,000 All‐England tennis championship. The going was tougher for Billie Jean. Pinned to the baseline by the sharpshooting of Francoise Durr, she was down, 2‐5, and had 4 sets points against her before beating the French girl. 6‐3. 7‐5. It's official now. Roger Taylor will meet Ken Rosewall in one men's semifinal tomorrow, Andres Gimeno will face John Newcombe in the other. Has 8 Match Points In some unfinished business, after rain stopped play yesterday, Taylor defeated Clark Graebner, 6‐3, 11‐9, 12‐10. Leading by 8‐7 in the third set when they resumed, Roger had 8 match points before clinching it in 20 minutes. Gimeno led Bob Carmichael, 6‐1, 6‐2, 1‐2, overnight and gotl the service break he needed in the ninth game for the third set at 6‐4. “My peak came up at Wimbledon,” said Gimeno. Two years ago, when seeded third, he was summarily removed by unseeded Ray Moore of South Africa. Last year he hurt himself in his match with Graebner. Thsi year he was dubious about entering. Mrs. King was a prohibiive favorite over Miss Durr. In all their meetings around the world as contract pros. Francoise had won one in an exhibition. At first sight Miss Durr seems unsuited to the game. Her grip has one finger flat on the racquet handle, her backhand is hit awkwardly from a stoop with a flailing motion as if she were scything hay, and her second serve hangs in the air, big as a pumpkin and waiting to be devoured. But the whole picture is mirage, as Mrs. King discovered to her cost. Miss Durr can bash the stuffing out of the ball. What's more her intelligence tells her where to hit it. She Loses Control After winning the first set, Mrs. King lost control. She served three double‐faults and had a foot‐fault called against her in the second game, losing it finally as Miss Durr put a volley into the clear. With little Gallic shrieks of encouragement, Francoise bustled about the court moving the ball from side to side, long and short. She was 3‐love now, abruptly went into a decline as Mrs. King found the range and suddenly was at 5‐2, hitting the ball sharply off both wings. “5‐2, I can't believe it,” she said. Then set point to Miss Durr. Billie Jean hit a forehand by her. Danger lurked ahead. Three more set points at 5‐4, and Mrs. King saved them all. Her first serve was now blazing into the court, and she was hurtling up to put away the volley. Five games running for the match at 7‐5. Not vintage King, perhaps. “My knee is in good shape, my tennis elbow has gone, and I'm happy about my game,” she said. Rumors had been flying that Mrs. Court might have to scratch. She tore a couple of ankle ligaments in her match with Helga Niessen and dropped out of the doubles and mixed doubles to rest. With the ankle heavily taped and with four pain‐killing injections she went on court and was immediately put to the test by Miss Casals. The little Californian pulled her forward with drop shots, pushed her back with lobs. Margaret was at full tilt, though covering the court like a greyhound. With all her strokes in order, she raced to 4‐1 before Rosie got the range. Then Miss Casals was wonderful. She held service, broke the Australian to 3‐4 and trailed love‐40 in the next game. Two aces got her to deuce. She fielded three smashes for advantage and rocketed a serve into the corner that Mrs. Court could barely touch. Four‐all now. It wasn't good enough. Margaret played with all the speed, skill and finesse that had given her 26 major titles over the years. She had eight of the next nine games for the match.

875-> Roundup: Cubs Win One With Durocher off Air
It was as if Leo Durocher's nightly radio program had been the Jonah of the Chicago Cubs. Just as the tempestuous waters calmed when the sailors on the Biblical ship threw Jonah overboard, the Chicago Cubs won again as soon as their manager gave up—at least temporarily—the sports show on which he answered telephone questions from fans. The announcement about Durocher's vacation from the program came yesterday and last night the Cubs ended their 12‐game losing streak by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals, 5‐0. The Cubs thus averted equaling the longest losing streak in their history—the 13‐game string they suffered through in 1944. Durocher began the radio show last Feb. 16 and recently produced a controversy when he used the show to disclose that he was considering a plan to bench Ron Santo, his third baseman. There were reports that Philip Wrigley, the Cubs’ owner, had said he would prefer that Durocher limit his talking to the field and the clubhouse but when asked if he was considering a managerial change, Wrigley replied: “Nope. Leo is running the team. I guess everybody is pretty much on edge the way things have been going.” In temporarily retiring from his radio duties, Durocher made his second acknowledgement that things weren't going too well. The first came Tuesday night when he fined Joe Decker, one of his starting pitchers, $100 for defying him. Durocher had more success with Ferguson Jenkins last night. The Cubs’ righthander held the Cardinals to four hits, eliminating the need for a relief pitcher. NATIONAL LEAGUE Atlanta at Cincinnati—The Reds gained their first victory in their new stadium, crushing the Braves, 9‐2, as Wayne Simpson picked up his 12th triumph in 13 decisions. Tony Perez drove in four runs, Pete Rose knocked in three and Tommy Helms hit his first home run since the fourth game of the 1969 season. Philadelphia at Montreal—The Expos swept a doubleheader from the Phiflies, 11‐1 and 4‐1. Bob Bailey hit a two‐run homer in each game and Coco Laboy drove in three runs in the opener in support of Rich Nye's four‐hit pitching. San Diego at San Francisco —Ollie Brown set a Padre record by driving in six runs with two homers, but the Giants won, 12‐7. Dick Dietz drove in four Giant runs and Ron Hunt added three, Houston at Los Angeles The Dodgers made their 1,000th game in Los Angeles a winning one, downing the Astros, 6‐3. Bill. Grabarkewitz hit a three‐run homer and scored the tie‐breaking run in the eighth on Willie Davis's single. AMERICAN LEAGUE Cleveland at BaltimoreJim Palmer raised his wonLost record to 11‐7 in the Orioles’ 3‐0 victory, their eighth without a loss over the Indians this season. Dave Johnson, Frank Robinson and lost record to 11‐7 in the Andy Etchebarren singled in the runs. Washington at Boston—The Senators tried to make it five straight victories with late‐inning rallies, but fell one run short in a 6‐5 loss. The Red Sox broke open tie game on two‐run homers by Carl Yastrzemski and George Scott in the seventh. Oakland at Chicago—Sal Bando's run‐scoring single in the sixth and a two‐run homer by Bert Campaneris in the ninth gave the Athletics a 3‐0 triumph. Jim Grant, one of three Oakland pitchers, extended his scoreless‐inning string to 40 1/3. California at Milwaukee—Jim Fregosi's two‐run homer in the seventh snapped a 2‐2 tie and sparked the Angels to a 4‐3 victory over the Brewers. Kansas City at Minnesota —The Twins won, 2‐1, scoring the decisive run in the 10th on a bases‐loaded sacrifice fly by Rich Reese, a pinch hitter. Wild throws by Paul Schaal and Ed Kirkpatrick set up the run.

876-> The Florence Few Americans Have Ever Seen
FLORENCE, Italy — In a jewelry shop on the Ponte Vecchio, a prize‐winning designer draws a gold lion, sketches in two emer ald eyes and adds a few diamond teeth. In a leather shop on Via Montebello, a tall young man, movie‐star handsome, spreads a tissue‐thin sheet of gold on the lid of a red‐leather box and then presses against it a metal stamp with a fleur de lis design .... In a small, quiet room above a store on Via Vigna Nuova, two women twist and weave rainbow‐colored straw into soft evening dresses, hats and perky looking animals. . . . In a huge studio (formerly a church) on Borgo San Frediano, a middle‐aged Italian in a dust‐covered smock chips away with hammer and chisel at a block of marble that has almost become a scaled‐down copy of Michelangelo's statue of David. . . . These people and thousands of others like them, all working at home or in half‐hidden rooms scattered along nar row medieval streets, make Florence a city unique in Italy and very likely in Europe, too. Here, the tradition of arts and crafts has flourished for centuries. I knew that when I came to Florence this time. Before I left, I discovered something extra. About people ... self development ... even the Renaissance. “This is city for shopping,” de clared Pietro Bottani, a small man with a round, smiling face, who headed the Italian buying office of R. H. Macy & Co. for 38 years until he retired in March. Macy, Gimbel Brothers, Alex ander's, Sears‐Roebuck, Montgomery Ward, the Associated Merchandising Corporation (which serves more than 400 American department stores) and about 25 other American retail outlets maintain large staffs of buyers here. “When I took over this office in 1932,” Bottani said, “the first thing I did was to move it from Milan to Florence, be cause Florence is the center. Floren tines have artistic talent in their blood. Even the buyers are surprised some times. A buyer says to an artisan, For the American market, we have to have this article made this way or that. Right before his eyes, the man creates a sample that is often more beautiful than the buyer had dared to imagine. Skill and good taste have always flour ished here.” In some crafts, like straw work, the artisan tradition goes back at least to the 14th century. With gold, it extends more than 1,600 years beyond that to the Etruscans, who ruled this part of Italy before the Romans took over de cisively in the third century B.C. When the Medicis began to govern Florence in the 15th century, they made it a haven for the painters and sculp tors who created the Renaissance. Les ser artists helped these masters and branched off on their own into spin‐off trades, making practical and decorative articles in straw, colored stones, gold, marble, wood and leather. Partly because the tradition was steadily encouraged by the Medicis and subsequent rulers, and partly because Florence never became a center for heavy industry, arts and crafts flourish in the city today. A tourist who takes the time to ex plore the shops along the Arno River, Borgo San Jacopo, Via de' Tornabuoni, Via de' Fossi, Via Maggio and Via de' Guicciardini finds articles of astonish ing beauty and originality: a marble coffee tabletop with a blue sea, tan ships with red and gold sails, a white lighthouse and a fishing village of pink and beige houses worked into it; mirror and picture frames elaborately carved, skillfully antiqued and as handsome as those in the Uffizi Gallery; lampshades, wooden boxes and serving trays with Renaissance and Etruscan paintings on them; neckties and evening gowns of soft, pliant straw; leather handbags, wallets and desk sets made by hand. Also, small and large marble copies of Roman, Greek and Renaissance stat ues; pink, white and blue chess sets and checkerboards made from onyx and ala baster; a pin that is a tree, with a gold trunk, green emerald leaves and dia mond blossoms; another pin, this one more classical, that is a dazzling cluster of diamonds and sapphires; a pair of wooden candlesticks, carved in the Ren aissance, that can easily be made into lamp bases, and beside them another pair, identical even to the antique finish and worm holes, that was made last month; lanterns, once carried in Ren aissance processions, now mounted on poles to make attractive floor lamps. Here in the city of the Uffizi Gallery, Pitti Palace, Bargello and so many other extraordinary treasure houses of art, even the stores are museums. And an other marvel: The clerks, are patient with browsers. At the open‐air market in Piazza del Mercato Nuovo, an intense, dark‐eyed young man approaches a middle‐aged American woman. She is staring at the multitude of hats, bags, slippers and handbags made of multicolored straw, the leather cases for eyeglasses and purses stamped with gold, the copies of Renaissance paintings that all but spill over the counters. “Let me help you!” he pleads in English. But the tourist is “just looking.” “It is a pleasure,” the young man declares, and bows slightly from the waist. The woman, perhaps conditioned by memories of New York clerks, widens her eyes In surprise. She glances un certainly at the young man, but his ex pression is kind. “If you need any help. . . .” He bows again. This tourist is one of the lucky peo ple for she has time to spend in brows ing. Thus, she is discovering Florentine manners, as well as handicrafts. And perhaps something else, as I did. Most Americans who come to Florence miss many of the best things in the shops and the museums, too. They spend only two or three days, sometimes less, in this city, flying along the streets, tearing through the Uffizi, glancing at the cathedral, speeding past the stores. Before they arrive, they don't realize how much fascination they will find here. But travel agents—they should know! Yet, without exception, the conducted tours provided here by Italian, British and American concerns are a disgrace. There are only two—one in the morning, the other in the afternoon. The visitor who takes both will get a hurried look at about one‐tenth of the major attrac tions and will leave with the delusion that he has “seen” Florence. A booklet published by the Azienda Autonoma di Turismo, Via de' Torna buoni 15, outlines a “brief” itinerary that links most of the outstanding mu seums and churches. It requires five days. A tourist who also wants to ex plore the stores needs an extra two or three. Besides browsing through them, he may, if he asks, be able to visit the studios where the articles are produced. It is a journey into the past—to an age that cherishes tradition, to a world that guards antique attitudes of dignity, self respect and passion for personal devel opment, to a side of Italy that almost everyone who comes here overlooks. Raffaello Romanelli—tall, slim, with a grave, cultivated manner and a ready smile—guided me through his gallery at Lungarno Acciaiuoli 72. I was escorted past large and small marble statues of David, the Discus Thrower, Moses, Venus; modern figures in wood, all exe cuted by a young American artist; onyx lamp bases; boxes decorated with stone mosaics finished so smoothly that it is impossible to feel the space between the stones; coffee tabletops with an cient and modern paintings reproduced on them. “We can make these tables with any picture you want,” Romanelli said. “Just give us a color photo, a post card, any thing like that.” Bending down, he ran his hand across the marble. “They are indestructible from cigarette burns, alcohol, stains, even weather,” Romanelli went on. “You can leave them outdoors, use them in a tile floor inside or out, plaster them into a wall, hang them like pictures. That one [he pointed to the scene of a fishing village, ships and a lighthouse] costs $480. It's about 24 by 47 inches.” A blue and tan chess set in Argentine and Florentine onyx was $50; a 23‐inch high David, $240. From the gallery, we took a short taxi ride across the Arno to the studio, a series of rooms with soaring ceilings in a 15th‐century building at Borgo San Frediano 70. The walls are lined with statues like those in the gallery. “Lorenzo Bartolini, one of the great artists of the 19th century, used this studio,” Romanelli said. “My great grandfather, Pasquale, was his right arm. My grandfather, Raffaello, was very prolific; he filled half the world with statues. My father was a member of the New York Institute of Design, the Academie de France. I took over in 1949. At the moment, I'm trying to find more sculptors.” In the old days, he explained, a master sculptor took apprentices 14 or 15 years old, who paid him while they learned. Today, the boys are paid about $4 a day; after five years, they earn around $15. “One way to make a statue for the gallery is to make a cast of the original in plaster of paris,” Romanelli said. “Another way is to chip it out with hammer and chisels. Those tools haven't changed from the time of the Greeks, who worked from models and achieved perfect proportions. Michelangelo often worked from designs, so he made a lot of mistakes. The right hand of David— it's out of proportion, but it creates a dramatic effect.” In front of us, a sculptor in his 30's, wearing a beret and a dust‐covered smock, penciled a series of curves on strip of marble that would decorate a fireplace. He than began cutting the curves with an air drill. His name, he said, was Giovanni Antoniazzi. His father also works at Romanelli's; his grandfather, Ermenegildo, another sculp tor, in Washington, D. C. Would his son be a sculptor, too? Turning off the air gun, Antoniazzi frowned with thought, “If he is capable,” he replied. “You can't take somebody from the street and say, ‘Be a sculptor.’ I like it, otherwise I wouldn't do it. You see, it's a sickness, not a job. Sculptors are always a little crazy. Sometimes they get out of bed on Sunday morning and come to work to finish a statue that interests them.” Romanelli smiled. “In America, I un derstand, arts and crafts are becoming a weekend hobby.” The sculptor raised his eyebrows. “Yes?” But he hadn't finished; he wanted me to understand. “One man here is 66 years old,” he said. “Nobody is stopping him from quitting and living on his pension. But he loves it. It's not like being a mechanic. If you're born with the instinct, you feel it and do it. If we had to stop and do something else, even if it paid better, we would suffer.” Antoniazzi put down the air gun and looked gravely around the studio. “But many young people no longer feel this way,” he went on. “They want to earn a lot without working hard, without thinking much.” He shook his head and fondled the gun. “It's the re sult of progress. Progress gives you well being, but it destroys the personality. If a sculptor has no personality, he has nothing.” “In Italy,” said Vincent Leggiadro, a young American sculptor from New York who rents studio space from Roma nelli and sells in Romanelli's gallery, “a man knows what's important. That's why I feel at home here. An Italian man wants the best food, the best woman, the best life. That's self‐respect, to want the best.” Three years ago, Leggiadro won the Gold Medal prize awarded annually by the Accademia delle Belle Arti di Roma. He has worked in Florence for the last two years and is married to an Italian girl. He led me next door and up a steep flight of narrow stairs to his apartment studio, a big room with a table set for two near the door. A stove used for heating graced one wall; wooden stat ues and paintings were along another. It looked like a stage set for “La Boheme.” “I do some painting to make money, but I like sculpture better,” Leggiadro said. “Every time I pick up that chisel, it's an adventure.” His hands reached out eagerly, as if he were about to begin righ then and there—beside the dinner table. Wherever I traveled in this world of artisans—all so hidden from tourists and yet so easily accessible to them—I met modern workmen with old‐fashioned no tions. All were seeking the “best life,” not the easiest one. Paolo Bruscoli, a tall, handsome young man, looked up in surprise from the rectangular tissue of 24‐carat gold he had placed on a piece of soft red leather'We were in the workshop next to the Francesco Bruscoli leather goods sales room at Via Montebello 50 r, near the Excelsior Hotel. “Why do I do this? Because I work with my head, as well as my hands,” Bruscoli explained carefully, as if to a child. “We have 1,500 stamps, each one with a different design, to press gold into the leather. Think of the patterns you can make with them? It's a job you never finish learning. I have a chance to make something beautiful on my own every day.” He took a metal stamp from a rack on the wall, heated it over a gas flame and thrust it against the gold. Then, using a piece, of cotton, he carefully wiped off the gold leaf that had not been stamped into the leather. “We save the cotton and burn it,” he said. Suddenly he grinned. “My grand father collected gold for his wedding rings that way.” The Bruscoli family began turning out handsome leather articles and leather bound books in 1880. Since then, the art has passed from father to son. Paolo began at 15. The concern has done work for the President's palace in Rome, the Vatican and the National Library of Florence. Yet, the things it makes are not ex pensive. A leather‐covered jewel box decorated with gold fleur de lis and lined with velvet costs about $10, handbag about $30. The shop is filled with these articles, and with billfolds, eyeglasses cases, desk sets and picture frames. At the Leather School just beyond the right transept of the Church of Santa Croce, I watched more artisans making other neat gold designs of flowers and leaves on leather. The school, established by monks of the St. Francis order, trains about 45 young apprentices and sells their work. At no extra charge, they will stamp gold initials on any article that is purchased there. “It's our tradition!” Armando Piccini said, anxious that I understand. We sat at a glass‐top table in a plush, sunny salesroom of Fratelli Piccini at Ponte Vecchio 23 r. His is one of the gold smith shops that line that sturdy 14th century bridge. Around us, showcases glittered with animal‐shaped pins, neck laces, rings, bracelets, all made of gold and platinum and studded with dia monds, emeralds, sapphires and rubies. “The goldsmith's art here really goes back to the Etruscans, though artists like Cellini made it a Florentine spe cialty in the 16th century,” Piccini ob served. “Do you want to see one of our most popular novelties, brand new this year?” A quiet, earnest man in his 50's, he pointed to a long necklace of blue and white gold beads that ended with the gold head of a leopard painted with enamel. “It's from the 16th century,” he said. “Look at the paintings in the museums. You'll see men wearing necklaces like that, always with a symbol—maybe a cross or a globe or a book—at the end of them. We're selling a lot of them. They cost $1,800.” Crossingjhe salesroom to a safe along one wall, Cellini brought out a scroll showing that he had won the Diamonds International Award in 1958. It is given in New York for the best design of the year. When I wandered through the huge museum rooms of the Opificio delle Pietro Dure (Factory of Hard Stones), Via degli Alfani 78, I discovered another tradition. I saw boxes, pictures and tabletops decorated with portraits, land scapes and floral designs; all were made with multicolored stones so highly polished, so closely fitted together, that it is all but impossible to see the lines between them. In the factory behind the museum, I watched a man cutting a stone flower petal with an ancient saw. The saw— it was like a hunter's bow—was a steel wire held taut by a curved branch of wood, which serves as the handle. An other man was polishing a floral mosaic with paste and water, first by rubbing stone against stone, then stone against wood. A third was fashioning a flesh colored ear lobe on a stone portrait with a drill similar to the ones that dentists use. Like so many other things in modern Florence, the Opificio began with the Medicis. Ferdinando I founded it in 1588, and many of the objects in the museum, including a huge table that is one of the world's marvels of stone work, date from that era. “All the Medici rulers had a passion for jewels and stone mosaics,” explained Dr. Anna Paola Pampaloni. A slim young woman with curly blonde hair and lively blue eyes. “But when Italy was united in the 19th century, the work stopped here. The Italian royal family was never interested in it.” Instead of making new objects, the Opificio now largely restores old ones. But local artisans still turn out such mosaics in traditional and modern de signs. I saw them in stores around the Church of Santa Croce and the Pitti Palace. Dr. Pampaloni led me past a huge courtyard piled with colored stones that the Medicis had collected from all parts of the world. Then through a room in which a sculptor, making a copy of a lion in bas relief, tapped out the lines of the animal's mane with hammer and chisel. And, finally, to a small studio, where Renato Bresci, a genial, round faced man, was fashioning a tiny stone ear with his dentist's drill. “It takes a lifetime to learn this work,” he assured me gravely. “It takes a lifetime....” Now the words came from Marcella Alessi, a handsome middle‐aged woman with glistening black hair. She works in a small, tranquil room—it is crowded with straw boxes, animals and dresses— above the straw store of Emilio Paoli, Via Vigna Nuova 26 r. “My family always did this work— my father, my grandfather, everybody,” Marcella said. “I like it because I never stop learning.” As she talked, she formed a bouquet of flowers out of colored straw and attached it to a straw box lid. “We are always inventing things— the colors, the articles themselves.” Marcella went on. “Last fall, we made Christmas trees.” Standing up, she be gan hunting through a closet at one end of the room. “Here!” She pulled out a green straw tree with leaves formed like tiny baskets. “You can put gifts in the leaves, or candy.” She stood for a moment, smiling at the tree, and then patted it gently be fore going back to work. According to Gian Paolo Paoli, cur rent operator of the family store, now in its 75th year, the craft has been centered around Florence for centuries. “I have studied the history a bit, and I have seen a manuscript written in the 1300's that speaks about straw work in Florence,” he said. “I believe it is even older. In the 1700's, Florence exported straw articles to London and the United States. Only it wasn't the United States. How do you call it? The 13 Colonies? In 1968, Paoli sent one of his em ployes to Pittsburgh, where she demon strated straw weaving at Gimbels. The show created so much interest that he is thinking about putting in a demon stration room in his own shop. Until he does, tourists are welcome to go upstairs to watch the workers and to explore the shop below them. It is filled with dresses, handbags, placernats, flowers, hats and animals. The dresses and coats, all Florentine high fashion, cost about $26 to $45, the handbags about $3 to $22. Several American buyers in Florence believe that arts and crafts are dying out in Italy because it is sometimes difficult to find articles in the quantities they want. “Of course, it is difficult!” declared. Roberto Bosshard, director of the Mos tra Mercato Internazionale dell'Arti ginato, Piazza della Liberta 1. The Mostra is a popular attraction for visitors — particularly buyers — be cause it publishes arts and crafts infor mation in four languages, including English, and has a library of 150,000 color slides of articles made in all parts of Italy, each with the artisan's name and address on it. “It is difficult to find articles some times because exports from the whole country have approximately doubled in the last five years,” Bosshard said. “Many young people do go into industry because they can earn more money more quickly that way. But many still learn these crafts. Do you know why?” He leaned across his desk and spoke slowly. If an artisan is sad one day, he makes things with a sad eye; if he is happy, with a happy eye. Every article he turns out is different from the others. And that is why this work is interesting, why it is creative.” In this busy, half‐hidden artisans' world, unknown to so many tourists, creativity is still a passion, “a sickness, not a job.” Here in Florence, a visitot can journey back through time to a living, ancient age and meet people who are still at home In it. Here the Renaissance never ended.

877-> John Jay Hooker Sr., Prosecutor Who Put Hoffa in Prison, Dead
NASHVILLE, Dec. 24—John Jay Hooker Sr., the Nashville lawyer who was the Govern ment's chief special prosecutor in the jury‐tampering trial of James R. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, died at his Frank lin, Tenn., home today, appar ently of a heart attack. He was 67 years old. Mr. Hooker had been prepar ing to defend Jesse Hill Ford, the novelist, “The Liberation of Lord Byron Jones”) charged with shooting and killing a young Negro soldier at the author's home near Humboldt. Mr. Hooker was counsel for The Chattanooga News‐Free Press, which last June accused The Chattanooga Times of un fair competition. Mr. Hooker actively cam paigned for his son, John Jr., a Nashville lawyer and busi nessman, who was the Demo cratic nominee for Governor in last November election. Mr. Hooker Jr. lost to the Repub lican, Winfield Dunn. The elder Mr. Hooker was born at Lebanon, Tenn., on Sept. 9, 1903. He received a bachelor's degree from Cum berland University in Lebanon, and his law degree from Cum berland's Law College in 1924. He was an instructor in the law college, and served a term on the Tennessee House before moving to Nashville in 1930. He was active in state poli tics, and several times had been mentioned as a prospec tive candidate for Governor. He had been president of the Nashville Bar Association and the Tennessee Bar Association. Mr. Hooker was asked by President Kennedy to under take the prosecution of Hoffa, who was accused of attempt ing to fix a jury that tried him here on charges of conspiring to violate the National Labor Relations act. Hoffa was found guilty of jury tampering and sentenced to prison for eight years. Appeals carried to the Supreme Court were denied, and the sentence is being served. Mr. Hooker also prosecuted a Hoffa defense lawyer, who was convicted of participating in the jury fixing effort. Surviving Mr. Hooker are his widow, Mrs. Effie Sanders Hooker; two sons, John Jr. and Henry of Nashville; a daugh ter, Mrs. Alice Buchtel of Los Angeles, and his mother, Mrs. Alice Williamson Hooker. A funeral service is expected to be held Saturday at the First Presbyterian Church here.

878-> San Francisco Commuters Shun Car Pool Campaign
SAN FRANCISCO, May 17— The operators of the San Fran cisco‐Oakland Bay Bridge have spent nearly two months learn ing something sociologists have known for a long time—com muters who use cars hate to give them up. A campaign to cut traffic on the bridge, which initially in volved 12,000 automobiles, has resulted in only eight new car pools. “Of course,” a bridge spokes man said, “we hope a lot more than that were unreported.” On March 19 the California State Division of Bay Toll Cros sings handed out 12,000 post card‐questionnaires to morning commuters on their way from Oakland to San Francisco. The form was simple. All it asked was whether the driver would be willing to take part in a car pool. By last month with the re sponse down to a trickle, the number of cards mailed in with names, addresses and telephone numbers was 1,200, or about 10 per cent. Of that number, 1,000 were matched by computer according to zip codes. Brief lists of the names and telephone numbers of people in each neighborhood willing to join car pools were sent out. A second postcard was mailed, asking if the recipient were successful in forming pools, also, 1,000 bumper stickers wer donated by a San Francisco radio station urging: “Pool — Cut Smog and Congestion.” So far, 49 of the second catds have been returned to the divi sion. Eight said car pools had been formed. The chief engineer at the bridge, E. R. Foley, conceded that neither the car pool cam paign nor any other immediate measures could be expected to lessen by many the 165,000 vehicles that use the 10‐lane span on an average day. The record load for a single day approached 200,000. “We're fighting for percent age points and fractions on a badly overloaded facility,” he said. Recently the division assigned a single lane to commuter buses during the peak morning and evening hours. It hopes to en courage more use of public transportation because the buses now make the trip an average of twice as fast as commuter cars. The principal hopes for re lieving the congestion, how ever, are a new trans‐bay bridge years away at best, and com pletion of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District railway tube, which is expected to carry thousands of commuters a day by 1972.

879-> Fitz Hugh Lane is the hero,
The publication of this volume in an extremely handsome format, co piously illustrated in color as well as black and white, and aimed at general distribution is, as the pub lisher's blurb writer states, a sign that the study of American art “has reached a new maturity.” For this is neither a comprehensive survey of 19th‐century painting nor a series of essays on the artists usually con sidered most important. The text is individualistic, not to say idiosyn cratic: It is an erudite and impas sioned argument for a specific es thetic and philosophical theory. In attempting to answer the old query, “What is American about American art?” Barbara Novak summarily ex cludes a startling number of the painters usually greatly admired. Realism, Idealism, and the American Experience. By Barbara Novak. Illustrated. 350 pp. New York: Praeger Publishers. $13.95. As the author states in her pref ace, she has chosen artists for de tailed discussion not only for their “inherent interest,” but “for the way in which their works elucidate ideas that concern me.” Left to one side are not only the expatriates Benja min West, Whistler, and Mary Cas satt but all the Peales, Gilbert Stuart, George Inness, and even those lead ers of the second generation of the Hudson River School, John Freder ick Kensett and Frederic Edwin Church. The author's hero, the “par adigm” of her theories, is a painter obscure in his own day and forgotten until some 20 years ago: Fitz Hugh Lane. Miss Novak's touchstone is what she calls “Iuminism.” This is a meth od of seeing which she finds exem plified in copiously quoted passages from Emerson, and which she ac knowledges was first called to her attention by John I. H. Baur, now director of the Whitney Museum. According to the theory, “iuminism” connotes much more than “a poetic rather than analytic” handling of light. Basically, it is the application to painting of “the Emersonian trans parent eyeball.” It is “an attitude not only to light but to things in nature.” Through powerful subjectivity, “the artist's feeling is transferred di rectly to the object, with no sense of the artist as an intermediary. It is thus a realism that goes beyond ‘mere’ realism to be touched, in some instances, with super‐real overtones, and, in others, to register that mag nified intensity that turns realism into a form of personal expression ism. . . . The quality of artistic ano nymity, the concern with the fact of the physical object, with its thing ness and thereness, are continuous right up to the bland surfaces of much the 1960's.” Miss Novak regards as an aspect of “luminism” what she considers as indigenous “classicism,” descend ed from “the psychology of the folk artist” who seeks unity in his com positions by balancing shapes and lines into static geometric patterns. (A pair of illustrations present a sur prising parallel between the compo sitions of Piero della Francesca's “The Flagellation” and Mount's “The Power of Music.”) This tendency to enclose space in linear forms, plus what Miss Novak calls “conceptual ism”—viewing an object not visually but through an intellectual concep tion of its nature—makes “luminism” communicate the feeling that nature, even in an evanescent mood, has been frozen, will change no more. Miss Novak writes of “luminist eternity.” The qualities eloquently defined as “luminism” and brilliantly analyzed in detailed discussions of many can vases are certainly basic to much of American painting. They may well be even more basic than Miss Novak recognizes. Had she not dismissed the main figures of the Hudson River School, often with inaccurate and un perceptive disdain; had she accorded men like Church, Kensett and San ford Robinson Gifford the detailed and intelligent analyses she devoted to her favorites, she might well have discovered that “luminism” was not a deviation from the central Hudson River style but one of its profound est aspects. Miss Novak, who is associate pro fessor of art history at Barnard and Columbia, would surely have broad ened her conclusions had she not so rigidly honored the academic shib boleth that separates art from life. She nowhere indicates that her hero, Lane, was a cripple tied to a wheel chair, a fact that (like Toulouse Lautrec's deformity) must have af fected his art. More seriously, she does not carry her explanation of America's concern with the emotion al and philosophical content of tan gible reality to any environmental experiences outside the study and the studio. Completely ignoring the struggle to subdue a continent, hardly men tioning religion apart from Transcen dentalist philosophy she deals with Emerson as if he were the acknowl edged theoretician of American art. She insists on this, although she demonstrates hardly any direct con nection between the “luminist” paint ers and the philosopher. Had she raised her eyes a little, she would have seen that as a group, painters, if they were to survive, had to flee the Transcendentalist world (usually to Italy or New York). New England intellectualism was death to the vis ual arts. The Transcendentalists and the painters were altogether separate growths. Similarities appeared be cause both were rooted in the same environment. That Miss Novak's book raises such questions is one of its virtues. Using her passionate conviction as a searchlight, she has re‐examined range of art which includes not only her favorites, Lane and Heade, but Allston, Cole, Mount, Bingham, Ho mer, Eakins, Ryder, Harnett, and a garland of contemporaries. Except when she makes quick excursions into the work of painters she has not fitted into her theories, her analyses of pictures are sensitive, informed and intelligent. If her obsession throws strong shadows, it also catches unusual lights. Her book is one of the most stimulating that has recently been published on American art. ■

881-> Garage Growth In City Raising Planning Issues
The desire of many renters of office space for parking facilities inside new office buildings is presenting builders with the need to make hard and costly business decisions and some planners in city government with the sense that city regulations May need revision. In general the builders say they are reluctant to construct underground garages unless the office building is in a midtown area near shopping or theaters, where a high degree of tran sient use may justify the cost. On the other hand, garages are often appeal ing to prospective tenants who want space for executives’ automobiles. “Parking is a losing proposition and we don't provide it unless it's re quired” said Robert V. Tishman of Tishman Realty and Construction Com pany. The executive vice president of a major general contractor said that in some locations garages under office buildings may generate only $3 or $4 per square foot per year of income, not enough to make construction economic. But Seymour P. Gline, vice president of Meyers Parking Systems remarked, “While the landlord probably makes less from a parking garage than he could for other uses, it's a tremendous feature in renting.” And parking ex perts say that in good locations mid town a return of $5 or $6 per square foot per year can be realized. In many instances builders apparently agree, since about half the new midtown office buildings, according to one in formed estimate, have parking garages. This accounts for the concern among the city's planning officials. They are generally, hostile to any steps that tend to encourage more cars on Manhat tan's streets, and they contend, that the easier parking becomes, the more cars are attracted. But their control is limited. Zoning regulations permit office builders to install 150 car spaces as a matter of right and an additional 50 per cent upon application to the Buildings De partment. Only beyond that is special permission from the City Planning Commission needed. Certain classes of buildings with special needs, such as hotels or hospitals, are likely to seek such permission. In apartment construction in Man hattan's high‐density residential dis tricts, builders are required by the zoning law to provide parking for at least 40 per cent of the total number of apartments in the building. Because of the expense, they gezerally do not provide more. One planning official predicted that even tually special permits would be required for all parking built in connection with con struction projects, in order to strengthen municipal control. “But right now,” he added with a smile, “it's a policy in transition.” It is “in transition” be cause there is no full agree ment on what parking policy ought to be, interviews with city officials disclosed. Ac cording to one, there is a “hawk” position and a “dove” position. The hawks want to make the provision of parking in residential buildings volun tary, reducing the likelihood that builders will provide it. But the doves say that if there is no parking in the buildings residents will park on the streets, and, worse, they will be forced to drive to work to avoid alternate side‐of‐the‐street parking reg ulations. A full one‐quarter of the traffic in Manhattan is generated from Manhat tan, a study has shown. Among traffic officials there is still another view—that municipal garages should be provided for short‐term parking by shoppers and salesmen as a means of cut ting down on illegal parking in the streets. One result of the parking requirement for apartment buildings has been to put an added financial strain on subsidized housing. The cost of providing underground parking—40 per cent in R‐10 zones in Manhattan but 60 per cent in R‐7 of the Bronx —must be absorbed by rais ing the housing costs, some times to the point where the cost per unit may be so high as to jeopardize the project's eligibility for Federal assist ance. Low‐and moderate‐income families for whom the hous ing is designed will often be reluctant to pay the economic rent for such space, generally $30 or $35 per month. But so far city officials, con cerned over the long‐term effect on traffic, are said to have resisted appeals to loosen the requirement suf ficiently to satisfy the spon soring agencies. In the financial district downtown the parking situ ation differs from midtown. There the trend is toward large parking facilities asso ciated with buildings along or near the rivers, but little or none in the narrow inter ior streets south of Chambers Street. The World Trade Center, for example, will have space for 2,000 cars, of which about 1,600 will be public spaces. The Uris office tower along the East River, with three million square feet of office space, will have cav ernous underground space for 600 cars. A Uris spokes man, explaining that this was negotiated with the city, said that it would in part make up for the large number of surface spaces that the of fice, project is eliminating. Richard Weinstein, head of the Mayor's Office of Lower Manhattan Development, said that the policy was to dis courage parking in the cen ter of the island's lower tip and concentrate it if possible along the perimeter. Ideally, he said, there would be no vehicular access from the peripheral garages to the streets. Figures prepared by the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association show that a surge in offstreet parking along the perimeter is already under way and will reach a peak far above the present level when all building projects under way or planned are completed. These projects in dude the World Trade Cen ter, Battery Park City, the Washington Street urban re newal project and South bridge Towers, now nearing completion. In structures completed prior to 1960 there were 4,535 parking spaces; in those completed since 1960 there are 1,180. But under present proposals, when all the still incomplete or prospective residential and commercial structures are finished; the association said, there will be 14,263 spaces. The net gain, however, is uncertain. An undetermined number of surface spaces, principally along Water Street, are being eliminated as the lower Manhattan projects proceed. For the builder, even the most ardent advocates of un derground parking garages concede, the economics of providing such space can be “very close,” as one put it. At least one builder who is putting up an office building in the heart of a prestigious midtown shopping area said he was hoping for $7 per square foot per year for his underground parking. But without these ideal condi tions, such a return is con sidered dubious. In some cases experts fore see a danger that streets will become “overparked,” creat ing an acute traffic hazard. Some believe this may be the fate of 58th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. There, a freestanding garage with space for more than 200 cars is planned, largely to provide parking for the Plaza: Hotel. This in addition to under ground spaces in new build ings will ultimately mean more than 600 offstreet ga rage spaces on the street. Normally land costs in the central avenues and side streets make free standing garages out of the question. They do not produce the revenue to justify the cost. But standards of normality change. “Ten years ago if you told me you wanted a garage on 46th Street off Fifth Avenue and the land cost was $100 a square foot, I would have laughed,” said Abraham Mar cus, a parking consultant. “Now I would be glad to build a garage if the land value were $200 a square foot. Right now I know a garage going up where the land cost $400 a square foot. I don't believe it will be a success. Of, course, 10 years ago I didn't believe it either.” Commenting from an archi tectural standpoint, Richard Roth of Emery Roth & Sons said that only about 60 per cent of the underground ga rages in office buildings are well laid out. In these, he said, the column spacing “worked.” In the rest, it doesn't, and the result there cannot be driver parking. “The garages near the the aters and hotels get big rents,” he said. “But more times than not it just doesn't work. Where it does, we put them in.”

882-> TREASURY SEEKS $18‐BILLION RISE IN CEILING ON DEBT
WASHINGTON, May 25 — Sagging corporate profits and other economic woes have re duced the Government's tax revenue, Administration spokes man said today as they asked Congress for $18‐billion more in borrowing authority. Without Congressional ac tion, the debt ceiling would automatically drop on July 1, under existing law, to $365–1311‐ lion—below the actual debt level. The, Treasury's request for an increase in the debt ceiling to $395‐billion—$2‐billion more than had been expected as re cently as last week—set off round of Democratic criticism of President Nixon's handling of the economy. Democratic leaders in the Senate and House joined in declaring that the economy had reached a crisis stage be cause of rising unemployment coupled with continued infla tion. They urged President Nixon to summon a national conference on inflation and. unemployment. The holding of a meeting of business and labor leaders, as well as professional economists, was urged at a joint news con ference held by Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Senate major ity leader; Representative Carl Albert of Oklahoma, the House majority leader, and John W. McCormack, the Speaker of the House. They said the conference should develop national policies, to be enacted by Congress, to reverse the contradicting “in flationary and recessionary trends of the last year.” Senator Mansfield also called for drastic action to reduce in terest rates and he said that President Nixon should give. consideration to wage and price controls. There were these related de velopments: ¶President Nixon ordered the heads of all executive depart ments and agencies to make tough evaluations of current programs “to make the most effective possible use of every tax dollar.” ¶Senator Fred R. Harris, Democrat of Oklahoma, intro duced legislation for creation of a Federal board with power to freeze wages and prices for six months if necessary to con trol inflation. ¶Representative Henry S. Reuss, Democrat of Wisconsin, urged passage of his bill call ing the President's Council of Economic Advisers to establish price‐wage guidelines. ¶A group of union econo mists met with Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz urging him to ask the President to es tablish tight credit controls, or to act to freeze prices, wages, salaries and profits. Mr. Shultz said he would relay their views to the White House. In connection with the Ad ministration's request for an increase in the debt ceiling, Representative Wilbur D. Mills Democrat of Arkansas, who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Secretary of the Treas ury David M. Kennedy at a committee hearing if the Sec retary's economic projections were not too optimistic. Noting that the Treasury had, overestimated corporate profits for 1969, Mr. Mills asked “Wouldn't it be safer to assume the $89‐billion level of corporate profits you now pro ject will not be attained in 1970?” Representative Mills also questioned a prediction of $800‐ billion personalincome— if we are to realize such a level, there would have to be either a general upturn immediately, or a great increase in infla tion by the end of the year.” Mr. Kennedy and Budget Di rector Robert P. Mayo, however, insisted that the request ed budget ceiling, would take care of contingenices, It is based on an assumption that the “Government should always have $6 billion on hand in cash —rather than $4‐billion _ as in the past—and an extra $3‐bil lion reserve. “I think we are kidding our selves if we try to act on this request without considering the state of the economy. in greater depth,” Representative Al Ull man, Democrat of Oregon, told the. Administration spokesmen. “I have never seen the econ omy in worse disarray.” Mr. Ullman asked Mr. Ken nedy whether he considered mounting unemployment or continuing inflation the more serious problem, and whether the Administration had changed any of its policies to deal with joblessness and segmented re cession.” Mr. Kennedy said bath situa tions were matters of concern, but he said considerable demand had been drained out of the economy and “we expect im provement by year end and further improvement next year.” Mr. Kennedy conceded un der further questioning that there had been a reaction against what he had hoped would be a trend toward low er interest rates early this year. But, he said, “I think we are at the peak now.” Monetary policy, he said, has shifted somewhat but the Administration has not changed its basic approach to the needs of the economy. Mr. Kennedy said that ru mors that the Administration would soon go to Congress with new tax proposals, should be put to rest. There are about $4.8‐billion worth of revenue measures now pending, he said, and no more recommendations are expected this year. But, he said, if another large deficit threatens in the fiscal year 1972—beginning July, 1, 1971—“there could be a strong recommendation for increased revenues.” Lower corporate taxes and other factors have reduced rev enues $3‐billion for the year ending June 30 and $1.1‐bil lion for the following year Mr. Kennedy said. New estimates of the budget deficit were $1.8‐billion for this year and $1.3‐billion for next year. Under questioning, Mr. Mayo said that if the budget had been kept on the basis used until a few years ago, when the effect of Social Security and other trust funds was not included the operating deficits would have been, $11‐billion this year and $10 billion next.

883-> Anguilla Tranquil, But the Memory Lingers On
THE VALLEY, Anguilla, W. I.— Anguilla roared into the news last year when British paratroopers landed here and a battleship stood ready nearby. Today all is calm and the scarcity of tourists makes them the more highly prized. The only British military forces left are construction workers. Anguilla is one of the most north eastern Caribbean islands, being only seven miles, or an 8‐minute plane ride, from St. Maarten and a 45‐minute flight from St. Thomas. Its status as a nation—it was settled by the British in 1650—seems to be willingness to stay within the orbit of Britain, but under certain basic condi tions. Anguilla's attitude toward re turning to the St. Kitts‐Nevis Federa tion, which it left in 1967, was suc cinctly expressed to me by one quiet Anguillan businessman. “They'll have to kill us first,” he commented in a fierce whisper. Americans in a holiday mood may think Anguillan officials indifferent. This is not deliberate nor hostile, but a shy ness natural to West Indians and prob ably intensified by anticipation of the thousandth wisecrack about “The mouse that roared.” Hotel and taxi people here are openly friendly, familiar as they are with American speech and infor mality. Visitors to this island need only keep in mind a few facts. By heritage, An guillans are British and have never been associated with any other European na tion since the original settlement in 1650; ethnically, they are West Indian and should not be referred to in, any other way; politically, they are Anguil lan—and certain matters relating to that status should be tactfully ignored. Life on Anguilla is serene. Some find it nostalgic. Others have been heard to mutter, “Thank God, I'll never have to go there again.” The constant fear of those who love it is that it must be discovered sooner or later, that a syn dicate will put up a five‐story hotel visible all over the island. So far, the churches outnumber the bars. Anguilla's population is about 6,000, half of whom are children. Another 3,000 Anguillans, perhaps many more, are working in the United States Virgin Wands or in the States themselves. The large proportion of Anguilians who have lived abroad may account for the so phistication of these islanders. They are aware of the world's draw backs, standards and the price of its conveniences. A jet hop to New York is ho‐hum. They send money home and the evidence is everywhere: New houses go up slowly as sons return to build another room, then go abroad again for more cash. The Anguillan countryside looks like a sparsely settled suburb because An guillans own the land they live on. This explains why the capital, The Valley, does not look like a town. Each build ing, even the shops, sits with space around it. Yet The Valley has a dental clinic, medical building, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of America, high school restau rant, several stores, a modern super market with a handsome movie treater above it and, on its outskirts, a furni ture factory. The Valley has three wells for piped water, some electricity and an ice plant, but the island as a whole lacks com munal services—paved roads, 24‐hour electricity, telephones. Despite the publicity that Anguilla has received in recent years, it remains unknown, even among its island neigh bors. Before I took a flight here from St. Maarten, I was unable to learn how many hotels were open or even what was the state of electricity, rental cars or entertainment. The Piper Comanche I flew on rolled onto a strip quite long enough for much larger planes. The island is gently roll ing, and the unpaved roads gave the shrubs a dust covering reminiscent of Oklahoma in the late 1930's. There seemed to be no tall trees, and the fields were not plowed, just indiffer ently fenced for goats, cattle, pigs, chickens and turkeys. Since I had heard Anguilla referred to disparagingly as a sandbar or fishing reef—or even less—I was surprised at the fat, healthy‐looking livestock. Never theless, at first impression Anguilla's dry, stunted appearance lacked the trop ical exuberance that even semi‐arid is lands boast. But young coconut palms were thriv ing along some beaches, and hotel gal leries were draped in flowering vines. Small fields of flourishing vegetables behind most houses testified to the soil's fertility and the people's industry. The papaya trees, even those hardly more than a year old, carried an incredible crop—papayas the size of watermelons. The stunted landscape of this poten tialy Verdant island is the heritage of hurricane. In 1960, Donna hit Anguilla head on, stripping it to the bare ground. Even the bush was torn away. Only the stone first stories of houses re mained. After the storm, one man could clear ly see another on a naked hillside half‐mile distant. There followed six years of drought so severe that it killed off the cattle. In 1968, rains came again and the Anguillans took hope and re built and replanted. Visitors to the island during those years came away saying nothing was here. What is here now is only a few years old. The hotels and guesthouses, the here‐and‐there areas of flowering beauty—all are tributes to the Anguillan spirit. The island is 15 miles long, but very narrow. And, despite the flatness, the view is good. St. Maarten, to the south, is so close that the valleys put on a show all day as the sun changes the shadows; St. Kitts, Saba, Statia and sometimes even faraway Nevis lie on the horizon, some days as clear as paste‐ons. Anguilla is protected from seas all around, and enjoys unexpected calm for an island that is the vanguard of the West Indies against year‐round trade winds and northern swells. And on an island so narrow and with gentle ter rain, all the beaches are easily acces sible—if not by car, at least by an easy walk or bicycle ride. Most of the 36 major beaches are empty stretches of clean white sand. Some, like Forest Bay, have special attractions; there, traditional wooden sailing ships are made by hand at the water's edge. (Shipbuilding has been an Anguillan industry for generations.) To watch a man eye a tree trunk, whack away what he doesn't need, carve out a perfectly fitting strake and see the ship take shape day after day until the splash of launching is always fas cinating. At the extreme east is the hamlet of Island Harbour, and it is there that one sees what the whole island could look like if Donna had missed. Coconut palms grow thick along the shore. The coast is cliff, for Anguilla, and the vil lage rises above the bay. Lobster fish ing is big business. It is the sort of setting that inspires some visitors to guess secretly how much a little land would cost. One beach curves deep enough to form the island's harbor and port of entry—Road Bay. A ribbon of land crosses Road Bay, separating the harbor from a large salt pond. On the strip stands the village of Stoney Ground: off its pier, wooden sailing ships wait for cargoes of mica or salt, or hope that the once‐thriving cattle business may be picking up enough for a ship ment. At Sandy Ground, you can hire a 16‐foot outboard (with skipper) for $6 an hour, or a 21‐foot sloop, also with skipper, for $5. You can water‐ski, fish or explore the shore, or in season sail to nearby Scrub Island for duck shoot ing. The favorite goal is Sandy Isle, 10 minutes away by powerboat. Sandy Isle is a one‐acre dot on the sea with about a dozen palms, pretty underbrush and perfect beach. The two main hotels on Anguilla, and a third one not open when I called there, sit right on their own beaches, with the neighboring islands always in view. There are no beach chairs, no concessions, no bulldozed bald spots to widen the sand. The beaches are lav ishly wide, with a fringe of seagrape and other low trees. Rendezvous Hotel, on Rendezvous Bay, consists of a long single‐story building with a broad gallery around two sides. Guests sit on the gallery until the dinner bell rings, watching fearless little yellow bananaquits and humming birds; the birds seem to assume that all tourists have been imported solely to feed them sugar. The atmosphere and simple furnishings of the hotel are reminiscent of the family resorts on the Jersey coast generations ago. All bedrooms face the sea, and prices begin at $30 a day, double occupancy. The rate includes three meals. Furnishings at the Rendezvous are standard and the meals are good. How ever the electricity goes off at 9:30 P.M., and then it's every man to his own kerosene lamp or flashlight. Randal's Hotel, on Maunday Bay, has a central recreation lounge, dining room and large gallery. It is still improving and still expanding, and eventually will be replaced by an even larger building. Here, too, the bedrooms face the ocean. The beach is almost a mile long and ends in a natural rock jetty, where a lookout roost is under construction. Rates are $30 a day, double occupancy, including three meals and 4 o'clock tea. And the last one to bed turns off the generaor. The third hotel on the island is Good now's, also on the southwest and on a beach, but it was closed when I stopped there the other day. A letter of inquiry could be addressed to Mrs. Ruth Goodnow. The guesthouses here are not on beaches, but anyone interested in inex pensive and simple accommodations will have beaches within a 20‐minute ride. Among the guesthouses are the Hibiscus, Mr. Lloyd's and Mrs. Lloyd's. Their minimum rates begin at $10 to $14 a person. Anguilla is served by Valley Air Serv ice, Anguilla Airline and Windair from St. Thomas and St. Maarten. There a daily ferry service between Marigot, capital of French St. Martin, and Blow ing Point, Anguilla, or a party can char ter small craft out of Marigot for the six‐mile run. Taxis are available at Blowing Point and the airport at $4 an hour. Taxi owners can arrange for a rental car (there are about 20 on the island) or rental bikes. A driver's license costs $1.25. Anguilla could easily have its entire surface coated with high‐rise hotels and condominiums. The island would then offer only what others already provide —saturated beaches in front of concrete boxes. So far, Anguillans sense, con sciously or unconsciously, that they have something rare: a land where everyone owns his own home. The number of supermarkets, small industries and the good supply of home grown provisions and livestock form base for catering to a large increase in winter renters and apartment dwell ers. If the citizens so decree. Anguilla, for all its present political uncertainty and lack of cash, may become a unique West Indian island—not for transient tourists, but for stable family vacation ers and seasonal residents.

886-> Home Calls on the U.N. to Act in Mideast Crisis
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Sept. 24—The British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas Home, called today for urgent United Nations action to end the “horrifying series of events” in the Middle East. However, he ruled out the idea of foreign intervention. He called for the end of ni jacking and kidnapping as being “jungle law” that could bring an international reign of terror. The authors of the United Nations Charter recognized, he said, “that if nations tried to impose upon each other their own notions of justice and to do it by force, that would be the finish of any international order.” At the same time, he said, “we must ca.11 on all those who have taken up arms to lay them down and once again to submit themselves to the rule of law” even if “they claim to carry them in the name of jus tice.” Warning to Governments “If the end can justify the means, then more and more groups of unknown men will take up arms,” Sir Alec said. “They will put themselves above and beyond the law. They will put themselves above the legal governments of countries represented here. “Kidnapping and hijacking make that lesson plain. The na Lions must deal with them.” Diplomatic sources pointed out that Sir Alec had carefully avoided restricting his remarks to the Middle East. They be lieved the words were intended to apply equally to African liberation movements and Latin American terrorism. On a long‐range settlement for the Middle East, Sir Alec expressed his hope that the United Nations, with the Big Four contributing, was on the way to success. The United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union have been meet ing on the Middle East simul taneously with the efforts of Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, Secre tary General Thant's special representative for the Middle East. “But all this has for the ‘moment been overlaid by the ‘civil war in Jordan,” Sir Alec said. He noted that the very people the United Nations was trying to aid, the Palestinian refugees, were fighting with the country that has given them refuge and were “in declared and violent opposition” to United Nations efforts toward a Mideast solution. Sharp Sees U.N. ‘on Trial’ Mitchell Sharp, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, also stressed the im portance of a resolution of the Jordanian crisis, saying: “The United Nations is on trial in the face of an obvious threat to the peace.” He said that for their own sake all states must back the peace efforts of Dr. Jarring and, like Sir Alec, he said that the aims of terrorists could not justify the means. He also declared that “air hijacking must come to be re garded as abhorrent, never to be condoned or justified, re gardless of the motive of the hijackers.” Noting that the Middle East crisis was only the most urgent of many world problems, Mr. Sharp cited as threats to world peace and security “the contin uing race conflict in southern Africa,” the war in Indochina with no progress at the Paris peace talks, “a crisis in the international development pro gram” for lack of funds and the growing problem of pollu tion in the environment.

887-> Greene being funny about Greene and serious about life
Many of Graham Greene's admirers feel his best work is in those novels of his middle period which present religious themes in terms of intense spiritual drama — “Brighton Rock,” “The Heart of the Matter,” “The End of the Affair” and “The Power and the Glory.” For such readers the early works are merely a prepara tion for the great achievement of the Roman Catholic novels, and every thing since has been a slight or severe disappointment Other readers, however, have on the contrary always found it easiest to take Greene's work most seriously when it has been least solemn. I be long firmly to this second group and would argue that his best novels are “The Comedians,” “The Ministry of Fear” and “Our Man in Havana,” and that not only are the Catholic novels mentioned above not his best but (with the exception of “The Power and the Glory”) actually among his worst. Certainly they con tain some good things, for Greene is always a very highly skilled practi tioner of the novelist's craft; but taken as wholes they are the work of a novelist whose mind (to adapt a phrase of T. S. Eliot's) has been violated by ideas. Greene himself has always made a distinction between his “novels” (“Brighton Rock,” etc.) and what he calls his “entertainments” (“This Gun for Hire,” “Our Man in Havana,” etc.). “Travels With My Aunt,” the title page tells us, belongs to the “novel” category, but reading the book very soon establishes that it is also ex tremely entertaining and often very funny. The comedy is of a peculiarly Greenean kind. The book starts with the funeral of the narrator's mother —not a subject every writer would take as the setting or a comic scene. During the funeral Henry Pulling, the narrator, meets his Aunt Augusta who introduces herself to him and to the reader with the words “I was pre sent once at a premature cremation.” This marvelous line firmly estab lishes the mood of the book, which is unmistakably the work of the au thor whom the French call “Grim Grin.” Henry Pulling himself (an unmar ried retired bank manager whose only hobby is growing dahlias) has a “weakness for funerals. People are generally seen at their best on these occasions, serious and sober, and optimistic on the subject of personal immortality.” Aunt Augusta, how ever, at the age of 75 is anything but serious and sober. She belongs firmly to that most formidable breed of the English eccentric, the maiden aunt—the sort of part that in the cinema is always played by Margaret Rutherford or Dame Edith Evans. Pulling returns from the funeral with his aunt, bearing his mother's ashes in an urn which he intends to place among the dahlias. Aunt Au gusta's peculiar remarks (Pulling's father, she says, “needed bedrooms for more than sleep”: his mother “was a very saintly woman. She should by rights have had a white funeral. La Pucelle.”) lead to the speedy revelation that though Pulling is indeed his father's son, he is not his mother's. Nor is Aunt Augusta such a maiden aunt as Pulling at first supposes: she makes no pretense that a white funeral would be appropriate when her turn comes. Though she has never married, she has had many “friends,” her current lover being a Sierra Leonean called Wordsworth. When Pulling's house is raided by the po lice, it is found that Wordsworth has adulterated the contents of the urn, for it now contains less of the mortal remains of the late Mrs. Pull ing than of marijuana. Graham Greene has always been the most adroit parodist of the works of Grim Grin. On at least two oc casions when the New Statesman competition has invited readers to submit parodies of his work, he has adopted a pseudonym, entered the competition and won. Much of “Travels With My Aunt” can be seen as just such deliberate self‐parody, an extended entry. The cremation of the saintly mother in this book, for example, must surely be deliberately intended as a send‐up of the crema tion of the saintly lover in “The End of the Affair.” In the course of his travels with his aunt, Pulling learns about her, about himself and about his parents (the identity of his real mother is not hard to guess). At the same time the reader is taken from the crema torium on a tour of Greeneland con ducted by a genial, comic and nos talgic guide. An intensive study of all of Greene's previous 17 novels would doubtless be needed to recognize all the spots revisited, but some are obvious enough. In Brighton, for example, Pulling learns of an episode in his aunt's past when she ran a church for dogs with “the Rev. Curran” (Rev. for Revered, not Reverend). The scene of Pinkie's spiritual tor ment in “Brighton Rock” is thus far cically cut down to the question of whether or not dogs have souls: “Cur ran wanted to start the churching of bitches after the puppies came, but said that was going too far—even the Church of England has abandoned churching.” Further travels take Pulling to Paris; on the “Orient Ex press” he smokes pot with the daughter of a C.I.A. man; then, shady business in Istan bul; Boulogne; a jail in Para guay. By the end of the book the parody has run out of steam, but well before this Greene's more serious inten tions have become apparent. At the beginning of the book, Pul ling was a kind of zombie, a walking dead man. His aunt's view of life—“never, never despise. Never presume yours is a better morality”—and the discovery in himself of a streak of anarchy, begin to vitalize him, until by the end of the book he notes that he feels “oddly elated to be alive.” The book is much concerned with the inevitable approach of death and with various in genious dodges whereby it may be avoided or at least post poned. (One of Aunt Augusta's acquaintances prolonged his life for some weeks after death by means of a telephone answering service which told callers “Mr. Pottifer is at a meeting of the Commissioners. He will call you back.”) But the only successful way to delay death is by living, and this Pulling learns to do. He quotes Tennyson: “Death is the end of life; ah, why should life all labour be?” and the book ends with Browning: “God's in His heaven—All's right with the world!” The lines are so hackneyed that it is hardly possible that Greene does not intend them ironically. The book unmistakably turns its back on the Orphic preoc cupations with the hereafter that characterized Greene's Catholic novels, and whole heartedly embracbs a Bacchic emphasis on the here and now. It is a remarkable change of emphasis to have made, and one which seems to deny the very works on which the novelist's reputation is con ventionally supposed to rest. Greene makes the point with great wit, but it is clearly in tended no less seriously for not being made with solemnity.

888-> County Executive Calls for Widened Plan to Fight Drugs and Pollution
MINEOLA, L. I., Jan. 5—Nas sau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson called today for expansion of the county's pro grams to combat drug abuse and pollution of the air and water, which he said “are reaching disaster proportions.” In what could be his last an nual message to the County Board of Supervisors, Mr. Nick erson, who is completing his third three‐year term in office, said that “nearly all reliable barometers indicate an impend ing crisis in these fields so com plex and widespread that so ciety has no precedent for deal ing with them.” Mr. Nickerson, the first Dem ocratic County Executive in the history of the county, is ex pected to announce later this month his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Gov ernor. He has said he would not run for re‐election as county executive. In a possible foretaste of his statewide campaign Mr. Nicker son said the county would con tinue its fight against poverty and again proposed that the, state assume the full cost of welfare services, other than the Federal share. He said that low‐ and mod erate‐income housing remained the greatest area of need and the one over which the county government had the least au thority. He called again for the State Legislature to give hous ing powers to the counties. In asking for a greater return to the counties of the tax dol lars paid to the state and Fed eral governments, Mr. Nicker son said: “It is truer than ever that local governments will die unless there is an early reorder ing of priorities, unless massive amounts of new Federal and State funds—which are raised on a broad and progressive ba sis—are channeled back to lo calities where the problems abound.” On narcotics, Mr. Nickerson said the county planned to ex pand its programs and facilities this year to provide treatment for at least 2,000 addicts, dou ble the number treated last year. “Our goal is to provide im mediate detoxification to any person seeking it, and to offer a comprehensive, and county wide program of education and prevention,” he said. Mr. Nickerson proposed us ing methadone for the first time in the county in a “highly controlled” program capable of treating 150 addicts during the first year. Methadone is a syn thetic drug that blocks heroin addiction. The program also provides for a “half‐way house” for for mer addicts and a “hot line” providing 24‐hour information and counseling to addicts, youths, parents and educators. The expanded narcotics pro gram is expected to cost an ad ditional $300,000 the first year, of which the county's share will be $165,000. “But the cost of drug abuse and addiction in crime and wasted lives, is beyond calcula Ition,” Mr. Nickerson said. In discussing the threats to the environment in the county, Mr. Nickerson said that “proper environmental control is our only hope of preserving condi tions for a healthful and mean ingful life.” Among the steps that will be taken by the county to protect and improve the environment this year will be speedier sewer construction, a study of means to improve existing sewage treatment, more stringent regu lations to prevent pollution by industrial facilities and an evaluation of the pollution po tential of new industries com ing into the county.

889-> REALTY TRUST SET FOR CHASE BANK
The Chase Manhattan Bank, acting to plug the gap in mort gage money, became the first major New York bank to an nounce a plan to sponsor a sizable, closed‐end, real‐estate investment trust. The bank announced yester day that the trust would have an initial issue of at least $125‐ million in securities, which would be offered to the public in the “near future” if neces sary approvals can be obtained. Other leading city banks said yesterday that they had no such plans, except the First National City Bank. First National's pending acquisition of the Ad vance Mortgage Company of Detroit, announced March 15, would involve a possible explo ration of a long‐term mortgage investment trust. Chase Manhattan's proposed investment trust, which has been approved by the directors, calls for the proceeds of the issue to be used for investment in residential, commercial and other income‐producing real es tate through a variety of loan and equity arrangements. A Chase spokesman said yes terday that the number and value of the shares to be of fered by the trust have not yet been determined. Commenting on the Chase Manhattan project, David Rockefeller, chairman of the bank, said that the inability of traditional mortgage lenders to keep pace with demand for construction, particularly in the residential housing field, has generated a growing fi nancing gap. “Failure to fill this gap could mean that the volume of new construction may fall short of the needs of our nation. A real estate invest ment trust can make a material contribution to the closing of that gap.” Several of the big New York banks are known to be interested in setting up various types of investment funds in cluding the real‐estate invest ment type. But they have been postponing such plans until there is some resolution of mutual fund “reform” legisla tion now pending in Washing ton and hearings begin later this month in the Senate on the one‐banking holding company legislation. Chase Manhattan's decision to announce a proposed real estate investment trust was viewed in banking circles here yesterday as an indication that the bank was confident of its move regardless of how the one ‐ bank holding company issue would be resolved. As to when the Chase Man hattan investment trust would begin functioning, a bank spokesman said that “we hope to move along with it,” but first approval must be obtained through a registration with the Securities and Exchange Com mission and appropriate state agencies. The trust would be operated by Chase Manhattan but no name for it has yet been as signed, he said. Last month, the announce ment by First National City Bank of an agreement with the advance Mortgage Com pany to acquire that Detroit concern included a statement of an intent to look into the establishment of a “long‐term oriented, mortgage, investment I trust.”

892-> The Capital of Haute Cuisine Acquires a, Foreign Accent As Restaurants Go International
PARIS—Some self‐appointed guard ians of French, culture fretted a few years ago that foreign influ ences were eroding the language into what they callect Franglais. Now, the impact of tourism is giving cultural purists something else to worry about: On Avenue des Champs‐Elysées, French cuisine, the perennial touchstone of France's glory and grandeur, is disap‐pearing. Between Rond‐Point and the Arch of Triumph, the only classic French restau rant still functioning is Fouquet's, found ed in 1902. This fashionable landmark is sandwiched between eating places specializing in pizza, paella, caviar and couscous. A tourist who had not strolled the Champs‐Elysées in several years might think he had wandered into an inter national fair, and even frequent visitors are likely to find changes in the culinary scene since the last time they saw Paris. At year's end, Lowenbrau, the 450‐ year‐old Munich brewery, had estab lished a Bavarian beer hall in the mid dle of the Champs‐Elysées. Seven months earlier, across the street, Iranian entrepreneurs opened a Caviateria that specializes in blinis and four qualities of caviar. Cuisines from all points now meet on the Champs‐Elysees. Patrons can feast on a Danish cold table at the Copen hagen Restaurant, sip North African wine at Le Carthage, have an American hamburger at several places or pick and choose at a no tipping, no cover charge, self‐service cafeteria. Irish coffee has joined champagne, buttermilk, vodka and the myriad of other beverages available at most places, and French eating habits have been caught up in changes taking place along the Champs‐Elysees. Tourists no longer have to ask a waiter to use sign language to describe the ingredients of a dish. Many places now identify specialties in both French and English, while the Brasserie Lowen brau Munich lists its items in French and German. Sometimes, two gastronomic worlds and languages are combined in a single item, as at the Harlequin, a modernistic snack bar. It offers a hot dog au Gruyere. And linguistic purists on both sides of the Atlantic would get indiges tion from the way language is occa sionally chewed up in the culinary con version process on the Champs‐Elysees. Toaste is among the French words in the sandwich section of the menu at Le Drugstore des Champs‐Elysees. Les Pizza Pino Gelati combines the French definite article and the plural of the Italian word for ice cream on the bill of fare at the Pizza Pino. The New Store uses boldface type in its menu to stress Ti‐bone steaclz. Nonfood changes are often as pleasing to tourists as the bright new dishes. “It is the new formula that tourists like,” an executive of one place says. “There is no maitre d'hotel to hover over them and ask them if they want an aperitif to begin with. Nothing like that. If they ask for a glass of plain water, they get it without any snickering or fuss. They can pay in traveler's checks. They can eat anything they want at any time of the day. A couple can even order one item and share it, if they want.” It was Le Drugstore that unloosed the winds of change along the Champs Elysées in May, 1958. As Paris tourists have learned in the past decade, both Le Drugstore on the Champs‐Elyse es and its younger sister on St. Germain‐des‐Res introduced food items previously unknown to the French and Americans. The calories might be the same as in more familiar concoc tions, but the ingredients often are unique. Le Drugstore uses chartreuse, Cointreau, kirsch and bourbon to perk up its ice cream sundae and coupe specialties. Combinations of ice cream and alco hol are also available at other new places on the Champs‐Elysées. The New Store has a Coupe Speciale, which comes with sauce Bourbon, and a Mar tiniquaise, which includes a rum sauce. A $1 ice cream item at the Pizza Pino is Le Scotch Savarin. The English trans lation on the menu describes it as a biscuit “soaked in Scotch whisky,” with vanilla ice cream, hazel nuts, chocolate syrup and whipped cream. The Maison de l'Iran, which houses the caviar‐selling Caviateria, is some thing like a Near East version of Le Drugstore, which in turn is a French ver sion of an American drugstore. It is like a de luxe bazaar, for its merchandise includes handmade articles from Iran. A pair of camelhair gloves costs $5, and a khalanthar, an ankle‐length robe, sells for a bit under $100. But there are jewelry pieces that cost $1,000 and rugs 10 times that in price. Like Le Drugstore, the Maisons de l'Iran is an excellent place for browsing. There is no compulsion to eat anything, but if hunger does strike, a 30‐gram por tion of caviar ranges in price from about $3 to $6.50, depending on the quality. It can be eaten at a counter or at a table.

893-> An economist against military spending
The divorce of economics from politics is not ancient. A political economist, as John Stuart Mill used the word only a century ago, was someone who pursued the science of ra tional choice, or economics, without foregoing the art of public decision‐making, or poli tics. The goal of objectivity, or pure science, prompted the sep aration of theoretical econom ics from its practical applica tion. Of late, however, there has been increasing recognition that at least in the public policy area a reconciliation is essen tial. One who has argued the case for the political economist is Walter W. Heller, tutor and policy adviser to John F. Ken nedy. Another is Arthur F. Burns, Mr. Heller's counterpart in the Eisenhower and Nixon Ad ministrations who next month is to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Their two approaches, how ever, are vastly different. Mr Heller sees himself as an ad vocate as well as an adviser, a translator as well as an in structor. His ability at phrase making — “production gap,” “full employment surplus,” “fis cal drag” and “fiscal dividend” —ranks with the best on Madi son Avenue. Mr. Burns, on the other hand, expresses disdain for the art of the polemicist. In his new col lection of writings, “The Busi ness Cycle in a Changing World” he says that the Coun cil of Economic Advisers, when he was chairman, fought for policies it advocated within the Executive establishment but not outside. “It refrained from this essential political activity,” he writes, “because it felt, by and large, that professional economists should stick to their knitting, that economic counsel ing and political advocacy could get in one another's way, and that economists should not devote their precious time to do what politicians — who at least then were not in short supply — do better.” The knitting, as Mr. Burns sees it, is what this book is about: fathoming and damping recessions and booms, making sense of the unemployment numbers, plotting the role of government in an ever‐chang ing economy. He compares his approach with that of Mr. Hel ler in a review of the latter's 1966 book, “New Dimensions of Political Economy.” None of the writings in Mr. Burns's collec tion is new. They cover the two decades of his public life, the lat ter half of a career spanning 40 years. They sum up and draw upon earlier studies at the Na tional Bureau of Economic Re search when Wesley Clair Mitchell was the leading inves tigator of the business cycle and Mr. Burns was his fore most student. The book is autobiographical, but only by inference. There are no accounts of White House meetings, no first‐person en counters with Presidents. And yet Mr. Burns's discussion of the need to tame the military industrial complex — the 1967 Moskowitz Lecture at New York University — suggests possible influence on Eisenhow er that may not have been ap preciated. It suggests a Nixon Administration strategy that may not have been discerned. A nuclear age, he argues, makes defense essential. Nev ertheless, military spending in this, country has accompanied a steady march toward statism, a deterioration of our capacity to marshal savings and invest ment for economic growth, and changes in the character of American society which “have left us, despite our awesome military power, more anxious about our national security than our fathers or grandfath ers ever were.” The political problem lies in the constituency the military industrial complex has ac quired, “factory workers, clerks, secretaries, even gro cers and barbers.” Mr. Burns observes: “Local politicians and community leaders may not find it easy to plead for the extension of activities that no longer serve a military purpose.” The Administration strategy thus may have been to allow the Democratic Congress to take credit for what the Ad ministration desperately needs, a reduction in defense spending to permit it to pursue the politi cal liabilities as well, the re sentment resulting from the By Arthur F. Burns. 352 pp. New York: Columbia University Press. For The National Bureau of Economic Research. $8.50

According to new regulations, salaries and prize money cannot exceed fixed league limits.

895-> Criminals At Large
It might be suggested—not, of course, for the first time— that the rather frequent sus pense novel treatment of Nazi ism is a literary expression of human conscience. The ap proach generally is, not sur prisingly, strongly judgmental, and future socio‐literary histo rians may find the subject worthy of exploration. Arthur Arent, like others before him, has focused on the cold war between Israeli Intel ligence and still uncaptured neo‐Nazis in (Little, Brown, $5.95). Mr. Arent's presentation is soundly three‐dimensional and unusually convincing. Fer gus John is a brash young New York playwright eager to acquire the services of a fa mous Austrian actor—a concen tration‐camp graduate—for his next opus. At the same time, Fergus's former love involves him in the very peculiar matter of her grandmother, visiting from Vienna and bearing mys terious letters. This is a partic ularly grisly horror, and the author ties matters securely— and bloodily—together at the end. For Francois Ponthier and his (Mc Kay, $3.95) the time is 1940, and Lieutenant Richter of Luftwaffe counterespionage has a novel idea: who would be more inconspicuous as a Ger man secret agent in Jerusalem than a Jew? So Richter fishes oven‐bound Max Wolf out of Dachau, brainwashes him into gratitude to himself and loyal ty to the Third Reich, trains him in man‐to‐man combat and radio transmission, and ships him out. The bulk of the story deals with Wolf's activities in Palestine and his peculiar rela tionships with Richter and a British intelligence agent, but the narration lacks strength: it wears the pallor of excerpts from official records. Thomas B. Dewey's (Simon & Schuster, $4.95), as its title suggests, sends Chicago private eye Mac into the mists of Cali fornia hippiedom. A distracted father hires Mac to find his daughter, gone west with an unsatisfactory specimen named Bill. Mac finds them both in an L. A. colony: Bill, not quite back from a very bad trip; the girl suspicious and protective of her man. But Hell's Angels make the scene too; as well as the Prophet Daniel, preaching peace; Sammy, who's found a ready market for his medical imports among the flower chil dren; one of his salesmen, slaughtered in a rented house. This is not of Mac's best cases, but Mr. Dewey brings vi tality to his portrayals of the heterogeneous freakouts in the colony. The latest investigation for Ludovic Travers, (Macmillan, $4.50) by Christopher Bush, is a most tranquil affair, with the author kindly telegraphing each devel opment at least a chapter in advance to avoid palpitating the reader. Lady Marport, a stern body full of good works, hires Travers to find her 18‐ year‐old daughter, who's gone off to live in more flexible surroundings. The trail, clearly blazed, leads to a photogra pher's shop, thence to a dance school, and finally to murder. And in the end Travers, warmly avuncular, ties the knots to gether. Grimly humorous and, in to tal effect, quite telling is Shir ley Deane's (Vanguard, $5.95), the saga of the packaged vacation tour. Such tours, organized from England, seem to attract an unusually high proportion of nuts, and the present con signment, arriving toward the end of Corsican representative Terry Bronson's fourth tour of duty, is even fruitier than nor mal. A spinster moralist wants to bring in the R.S.P.C.A. for the horses. A doctor takes blis tering exception to a gushing widow. Someone takes to peer ing in nighttime windows. Someone is murdered. And Terry, clutching at the tatters of his job, has to sort it out. Doris Miles Disney's ap proach to her story in (Doubleday, $4.50) is not common to mys tery fiction, though the bones of the tale — three‐cornered love—have served as a plot armature since the year one. Two children—John and Marcy —grow up together through the pre‐Depression years, obviously meant for each other. A third child—Kit—appears briefly, is obviously smitten with John, but the family moves away. Through newspaper excerpts and longer descriptive passages, the narrative rapidly traverses 25 years: the return of Kit, schemes, traps, death. Miss Dis tells the old story well. ■

Special to The New York Times The officials were suspected of negligence of duty, including failure to pick up distress sig nals that the ship's radioman reported that he had sent out before he abandoned ship. The cause of the disaster has not yet been officially deter mined, but it is being narrowed by officials to overloading, shifting cargo and engine trouble. Investigations have disclosed that the Namyong‐Ho carried about 500 tons of cargo, 350 tons more than the legal limit.

Although they occur under very different circumstances, three phenomena involving volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides and devastating avalanches are strikingly similar. In all three cases solid material suddenly be gins to act like a fluid tor rent. One is the nude ardente, a cloud of incandescent ash that can descend a volcanic slope more than 100 miles an hour, destroying all life in its path. Such a cloud swept through the town of St. Pierre, on the island of Mar tinique, in 1902 killing all but one of its 40,000 inhabi tants in a few seconds. The sole survivor was a felon in a dungeon. Another is the turbidity current, a submarine land slide in which the sediment becomes mixed with water, forming a heavy fluid that races hundreds of miles across the ocean floor at ex press train speed. Such a current successively cut a dozen submarine cables off the Grand Banks in 1929. The times at which each break occurred indicated speeds approaching 60 miles an hour on the steeper part of the slope. The third such phenome non is the powder‐snow ava lanche that typically occurs during winter months after a new accumulation of dry, powdery snow. In seconds such an avalanche may sweep down a slope at more than 200 miles an hour. Such an avalanche does not stop when it reaches the bottom of a slope. It may cross a valley and sweep part way up the opposing slope before it comes to rest. It may have been such a phenomenon that tore through a ski hostel at Val d'Isere, in the French alps, last Tuesday, killing 32 per sons. It was said to be the worst avalanche disaster in French history. The diagram above shows the path of the slide. The avalanche plunged down the Le Dome slope, a mile and a half northeast of the town, across half a mile of slope to the Isère stream, beyond which it crossed a road and hit the chalet.

900-> CLEANUP SPEEDED ON DERELICT CARS
A new system of sticking shiny numbered patches on derelict cars to indicate targets for tow‐away contractors, has speeded the city's street clean up campaign, Sanitation Com missioner Griswold L. Moeller said yesterday. Starting in late March, one man in each of the city's 58 sanitation districts was as signed the job of attaching the four‐inch‐square tag to a rear fender of each abandoned car. The tag speeded the clean up rate from approximately 1,100 cars a week to a peak of 1,840, the Commissioner said. “Under the new plan,” he said, “we are hopeful that the presence of abandoned cars will, for all practical purposes, cease to be a problem.” The contractors who tow the abandoned vehicles away must be certain that cars are dere licts. They will be identified by a differently colored tag in each of the boroughs: green for Manhattan, orange‐red for Brooklyn, yellow‐orange for Queens, lime for the Bronx, and pink for Staten Island. A departmental spokesman said the new system would also allow the department to keep a control diary of aban doned cars ready to be moved and to check on how fast they are cleared from the streets. Also, he said, the plan will cut down on administrative work caused by various calls coming in to report the same vehicles. When someone sees a tagged car, he will know that it has already come to the department's attention, the spokesman explained. Commissioner Moeller urged residents to continue to report abandoned cars by telephon ing 964–1800. Last year, he said, 57,742 abandoned wrecks were towed off the city's Streets.

903-> NAPOLES SCORES KNOCKOUT IN 15TH
INGLEWOOD, Calif., Feb. 14 (UPI)—The world welterweight champion, Jose Napoles of Mex ico, punching with machine like precision, scored a 15th round knockout tonight over his challenger, Ernie (Indian Red) Lopez, who was dropped three times before the referee halted the bout. Napoles, defending his wel terweight crown for the third time in a year, used a left pab as his chief weapon and dropped Lopez thre times but could not put him down for the count. The champion, weighing 145½ pounds, opened up on Lopez in the first round and sent him, down for a two‐count, with Lopez taking a mandatory eight standing. Lopez suffered a nick under his right eye and a bloody nose that hampered him through out the fight. Napoles scored his second knockdown in the ninth round when he dropped hie foe from Arcadia, Calif., for a count of four. The third knockdown came in the 15th round but again Lopez, 146, was up at the count of five. With no steam left in his arms he vainly tried to land a telling blow but Referee Larry Rozadilla stopped it at 2:38. The challenger bewildered Napoles in the early rounds with feints of his left and right leads. But after a few rounds, the stocky champion worked out a strategy of throwing his left hook and stepping back to avoid Lopez's right and from then on the fight was his all the way. The game Lopez was given an edge in the third round when he landed a series of good rights to the champion's haed, and he was ahead in the fourth using similar strategy although bleeding from the nose. From the fifth round on, Na poles built a margin that was so decisive by the 13th that only a knockout could have given Lopez the victory. The challenger uncorked a desperation flurry in the 13th round and caught the relaxed Napoles with a series of hard rights. Napoles came back to stagger Lopez but the round was considered even. Rozadilla scored it 12‐2 for the champion while Judge Rudy (Jordan had it 11–4 for Napoles and Judge Lee Grossman scored it for the champion 12–3.

905-> Gallup Finds Approval of Nixon at Its Lowest Point
PRINCETON, N. J, Dec. 16— President Nixon's popularity has slipped to 52 per cent, the lowest level since he took of fice, according to the latest Gallun Poll. Special to The New York Times The Gallup survey pinpointed the nation's economic lapse as a major factor in the decline of approval for the President's performance in office. It dropped five percentage points since November, based on 1,379 personal interviews with adults in more than 300 representa tive ‐communities on Dec. 5 and 6. Mr. Nixon's previous low in the Gallup ratings was 53 per cent approval, during the na tionwide postal workers’ strike last March. The question asked in the current survey was, “Do you approve or disapprove of the way Nixon is handling his job as President?” Of those re sponding, 52 per cent approved, 34 per cent disapproved and 14 per cent had, no opinion. With unemployment at its highest level in seven years and consumer prices continuing to rise, Americans apparently re acted to Democratic charges in the November Congressional elections that the Nixon Ad ministration was at least part ly to blame. The Gallup organization re ported that Mr. Nixon's popu larity slipped about equally in the East, Midwest and Far West, but did not decline no ticeably in the South, which has been least affected by rising levels of unemployment.

906-> HOUSE VOTES CURB ON FRAUD IN USING SWISS ACCOUNTS
WASHINGTON, May 25—The House this afternoon unani mously passed a bill designed to curb massive tax evasion, stock and bond frauds and other forms of so‐called white‐collar crime through the use of secret Swiss bank accounts. As adopted by the House, after brief floor debate, the measure would require banks and other financial institutions to microfilm checks and other records of all foreign transac tions and of domestic transac tions for $500 and above byl themselves and their clients. The Secretary of the Treasury was directed to order and super vise the record keeping. The banks would have to retain the microfilmed records for six years. The microfilm could be subpoenaed by grand juries and the law enforcement authorities. The public knowl edge that the documents were being microfilmed and stored would presumably act as a de terrent to tax evasion and other crimes and serve as evi dence for prosecution. The bill now goes to the Sen ate, where the Treasury and the nation's major banks are ex pected to renew their effort to defeat or weaken a number of the measure's provisions, in cluding the record‐keeping re quirement. Representative William B. Widnall of New Jersey, the sen ior Republican on the House Banking and Currency Com mittee, made clear, in remarks supporting the House bill, that the Administration was shifting its activity to the Senate. Mr. Widnall said he was vot ing for the House bill because violation of tax and securities statutes through foreign bank secrecy had become so wide spread that it was “eroding the moral fiber of our nation” and had “seriously threatened” gen eral compliance with tax col lection. He noted, however, that Treasury officials would pre sent “numerous amendments” at hearings by a subcommittee of the Senate Banking and Cur rency Committee. He said he hoped these amendments “will be given the most careful con sideration at that time.” The differences between whatever bill the Senate should adopt and the House version passed today will have to be resolved in a joint conference committee. The Treasury and the banks contend that the House bill will create roomfuls of useless mi crofilm and would interfere with the privacy that bank cli ents should enjoy. In anticipation of a stiff con ference committee fight, Repre sentative Wright Patman, Dem ocrat of Texas, who is chair man of the House committee, unsuccessfully sought to strike from the bill the provision that limits record keeping on do mestic transactions to those of $500 and above. He argued that the limit was a “disastrous loophole” that would permit the affluent crim inal to avoid detection by writ ing checks for amounts below $500. “It will make the check for $499.99 the standard medium of exchange,” he said. An estimated total of 20 bil lion checks for foreign and do mestic transactions are written each year in the United States. Nearly half are for amounts below $25, and thus the limit of $500 and above on domestic checks would require the banks to microfilm only a small per centage in this category. Mr. Patman maintained that it was just as cheap, however, for the banks to microfilm all checks as it was to alter their automated microfilming equip ment so that it would sort out checks for $500 and above. Several Republican Congress men argued that while this was true for major banks, small banks were able to discriminate easily and removal of the lim itation would work an undue hardship on them. Mr. Patman's deleting amend ment was defeated by a vote of 28 to 15. Swiss law makes it a crim inal offense for anyone to dis close or even to seek informa tion about a bank account in Switzerland without a judicial order from a Swiss court. All accounts in Switzerland, wheth er so‐called numbered accounts or ordinary name ones, have equal protection under this bank secrecy law. Since Swiss law does not recognize as crimes tax evasion, securities frauds and mail frauds, the Swiss legal authori ties will not provide informa tion to the United States Gov ernment to prosecute American citizens for these offenses. The American authorities are thus dependent upon what evi dence they can obtain within the United States, and domestic bank records have proved a ma jor source. Robert M. Morgenthau, for mer United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, prosecuted cases ranging from a single stock fraud with profits in the hundreds of thou sands of dollars to $3‐million in untaxed income in another instance. In a case prosecuted in Washington last fall, two men were convicted of defrauding the Defense Department of $5‐ million on Vietnam war con tracts through fraudulent docu ments supplied by two Swiss banks. Mr. Morgenthau and others have estimated that the amount of illegal funds concealed by Swiss bank secrecy ranges into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Mafia has regularly re sorted to the Swiss secrecy de vice to hide profits from rackets such as gambling and narcotics.

911-> Whales Sing Siren Song for Scientist
The cavernous sound, strangely melodious, began on a low pitch, rose slowly to a higher frequency at which it sounded for a moment like a combined oboe and muted cor net, trailed off into an eerie high‐pitched, undulating wail like melancholy bagpipes and then faded into silence. Dr. Roger S. Payne, a 35‐ year ‐ old research scientist at Rockefeller University here, switched off the tape‐recorder on his office windowsill and leaned back in his chair. “That was the song of a whale,” he said with a grin. “Nobody knows how they make the sounds—they have no vocal cords—but we think it's with their larynx and the air in their lungs,” he said. Dr. Payne had just returned from the waters off Bermuda where he and his wife, Katha rine, had spent several weeks in a 35‐foot sloop using under water microphones to record the musical sound patterns of the humpback whale, a nearly extinct species that they both have studied for the last several years. The peculiar beauty of the sounds, which last from five to 30 minutes, has aroused the attention of musicians, singers and nonmusicians who have listened to Dr. Payne's tapes. They have so intrigued Alan Hovhaness, the symphonic com poser who heard them several months ago, that he eagerly agreed to compose an orchestral work that incorporates some of the actual taped melodies. The symphonic piece, “And God Created Great Whales,” a quo tation‐ from Genesis, will have its premiere on June, 11 as part of the New York Philharmonic's summer season of Promenades. The whale's appeal is not confined to classical musicians. After hearing the melodies, Judy, Collins, the folk singer, played some of them recently for a television production and theri: discussed the plight of whales. After Pete Seeger, the folk singer, heard the recording, he Composed “The Song of the World's Last Whale” and has turned over the rights to the Whale Fund, an offshoot of the New York Zoological Soci ety devoted to the problems of whale conservation. The recordings that Dr. Payne and.other scientists haye Made of whales have led him and his wife to the conclusion that whales, like birds, sing songs that have a definite melo dious pattern, and a repeated, theme. Although he is not unaware of the more pleasant musical facets of his research, Dr. Payne believes the songs wilt lead to a better scientific un derstanding of how sea animals communicate. In the dark world under the sea much of the ani mal life depends on sound for communication and knowledge. “Shrimps click, porpoises squeal, beluga whales squeak, some seals whistle and harp seals sound like a barnyard,” he explained. “One of the few ways we have to learn about these creatures since they're not readily available on land, is to study their, sound patterns and what they mean.” He has come to no firm con clusions about the significance of the whale's lengthy songs, which are often repeated for hours. But during his latest Bermuda expedition this month, he has made what he feels are some interesting discoveries and has arrived at some very ten tative conclusions about com munications among whales. “We already know there's a deep sound channel in the keen,” he explained. “This is a layer of water that, for vari ous reasons‐temperature, den Shy, and so forth—has acoustical qualities which permit the transmission of sound over very long distances, in some cases more than a thousand miles. “I'm not saying that whales sit on two sides of the ocean and‐chat with each other,” said Dr. Payne, “but it's possible they produce these sounds, either in or out of the sound channel, which may allow them to flock together. This could take the simple form of ‘Hump back whale here!’ or maybe even a more sophisticated ‘George here!’” Dr. Payne and his wife think that each whale may sing specific song. And they think they have identified by sound a whale that sang the same song in Bermuda this year that it sang at the same time and place last year. Mrs. Payne and Scott Mc Vay, administrative assistant to Robert F. Goheen, president of Princeton, and a student of whales, have developed a no tation form for the whale songs. The score for a typical song closely resembles the score for a piece of contemporary elec tronic music. Four whale songs recorded by Dr. Payne and other scien tists have been made into a long‐playing record. A 40‐page booklet printed in both English and Japanese (Japan and the Soviet Union are the two largest whaling nations in the world) by the CRM company of Los Angeles accompanies the record. It gives examples of whale song notation and explains the need for conserving the world's whale population, which faces extinction from overfishing. Part of the proceeds from the album's sale will go to the Whale Fund. “What most people don't realize is that more and more whales are being killed these days to get less and less oil,” he said. He pointed out that in 1933 there were 28,907 whales killed and they produced 2, 606,000 barrels of oil. In 1966, the latest year fir which fig ures are available, 57,891 whales were slaughtered but they produced only 1,546,000 barrels of oil. “This means they've killed off the large whales—the blues, the fin whale and the right whale —and now have to kill more of the small ones to make their quota,” Dr. Payne ex plained. The researcher says he was impelled to begin his acoustical inquiry after hearing an under water recording of whale sounds made several years ago by William Schevill of the Woods Hole Oceanographic In stitution. Dr. Payne first studied the humpback whale in 1967 off Bermuda, a stopping‐off point for the 40‐foot‐long mammals on their annual spring migra tion from the Caribbean to the waters off Nova Scotia. “The thing I really want to do is to go and live close to a herd of whales for several weeks,” he said earnestly. “That's the only way we can learn their habits and deter mine how they use their songs. We would be in a small boat, with some sort of homing de vices attached to the whales so we wouldn't lose them.” He hopes to go on such an expedition within the next year or two. “I think the thing that first got me interested in whales,” he said, “was the time many years ago when I saw a dead porpoise—they're the smallest whales — on the beach. Its flukes were cut off, initials had been carved in its hide and someone had stuck a cigar in its blowhole. I thought there ought to be a better way for man to learn about whales.”

913-> TV Review
The persistence of history in repeating itself was illus trated last night in Lewis Freedom's superior produc tion of “The Andersonville Trial,” seen over the Public Broadcasting Service network (Channel 13). In 1959, when the play by Saul Levitt was first pre sented on Broadway, every one thought of the Nurem berg trials upon seeing a dramatization of the trial of Capt. Henry Wirz, who said that he had only been follow ing military orders as more than 14,000 Union soldiers perished in the Confederate prison at Andersonville, Ga. Last night the issue of the individual moral responsi bility of a soldier was associ ated with the massacre at Mylai in South Vietnam and reports of antiwar G.I.'s balking at going into conflict. • The television revival of “The Andersonville Trial,” made possible under a direct program grant by the Ford Foundation, was directed by George C. Scott, who a dec ade earlier played the Judge Advocate in the Broadway company. Mr. Scott, to the surprise of absolutely no one, clearly has a new career opening up as a director. His sensitivity and feeling were responsible for the best mo ments of “The Andersonville Trial.” Despite the unfortunately enduring pertinency of its theme, “The Andersonville Trial” is really only half a drama. The opening portion resembles a Perry Mason of the Civil War as the proces sion of witnesses testify to the odious camp conditions. The transition from The New York Law Journal to theater really came with the portrayal by Michael Burns of the young Union soldier who has lost coherence under the ravages of war and confinement, a cameo scene that saw Mr. Scott at his directorial best. From that point on, “The “Andersonville Trial” got down to the moral issue of whether the higher demands of civilized behavior should take precedence over a direct military command. William Shatner, as the Judge Advo cate, and Jack Cassidy, as the civilian defense attorney, found mutuality of doubt over the proceedings. In these sequences Mr. Levitt's dia logue holds the viewer's at tention in full measure, albeit Captain Wirz ultimately is to be hanged, if only because in war the victors and not the losers decide what is moral. Richard Basehart, playing the infamous Wirz, came across the tube as more hysterical than monstrous. The touch of ambivalence in the difficult characterization became too showy for the play's own good. In softer moments, when he was testi fying in his own behalf, Mr. Basehart seemed more com fortable and was more ef fective. Mr. Freedman and Mr. Scott borrowed of Holly wood's rich reservoir of artistry, so much of which is not being adequately used these days. • Others in the company in cluded Buddy Ebsen, Cameron Mitchell, Albert Salmi, John Anderson, Whit Bissell, Nino Candidi, Lou Frizzelli, Wright King and Harry Townes. The polished profession alism of “The Hollywood Television Theater” suggests that Mr. Freedman has been away too long from the TV medium, and that Mr. Scott, given the opportunity for more creativity than a court room drama can provide, is going to be a director well worth following. Last night the two joined hands in a revival of topicality; perhaps some day they can get to gether on a new work and again bring to public broad casting the box‐office appeal it so sorely needs.

918-> BERNARD HORNE, LED STORE IN PITTSBURGH
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 5 — Bernard Shea Horne, retired board chairman or the Joseph Home Company department store and an authority on Izaak Walton, died yesterday in the Cape Cod Hospital, Hyannis, Mass. He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on Wednesday. Mr. Horne was 64 years old and had moved to Hyannis Port after his retirement in 1964. Mr. Horne had assembled the largest known private collec tion of angling works by Wal ton. Two hours before he suf fered his fatal stroke he had completed a definitive bibliog raphy of the 385 editions of Walton's classic.” The Compleat Angler,” first published in 1653. An ardent fisherman and con servationist, Mr. Horne was a member of the Pennsylvania State Fish Commission from 1947 to 1955, and a former chairman of that agency. Mr. Horne, whose grand father, Joseph Horne, founded the Pittsburgh department store, worked at the store since 1928 and he was a former president of the Pennsylvania Retail As sociation.

919-> MAINE DEMOCRATS VOTE ANTIWAR PLANK
PORTLAND, Me., May 17— Delegates to the state Demo cratic convention gave noisy approval last night to a strong antiwar plank in the party's platform after Senator Edmund S. Muskie discarded his prepared speech and spoke in support of the plank. The Senator, whose Keynote speech was to have been on violence and dissent, told the nearly 3,000 delegates that the President “did something no other President has done” by moving troops across an inter national border into Cambodia without consulting Congress. The peace plank urges an end to United States involvement in Southeast Asia and endorses two proposals now before the Senate: A nine‐point peace plan introduced by Senator Muskie that calls for a phased with drawal from Southeast Asia over an 8‐1 month period, and the McGovern‐Hatfield amend ment that calls for a phased withdrawal by the end of June, 1971. Early this month, Maine Re publicans, at their annual state convention, approved a resolu tion giving President Nixon vote of confidence. Senator Muskic, who is seek ing re‐election, is unopposed in the June primary. He is expect ed to win easily in the Novem ber General election.

920-> Police Study Shows Criminal Repeaters On Increase Here
Arrests for serious crimes are increasing here among per sons with previous arrests, the Police Department announced yesterday. “The criminal repeater is now a major social problem and solutions to this problem must be sought by means of a new sociological approach,” according to Chief of Detec tives Frederick M. Lussen. “It is all to apparent that increas ing arrests alone cannot curb the criminal repeater.” A study of criminal repeat ers was based on the criminal records of 6,766 persons ar rested for robbery and 7,488 arrested for burglary during the last 10 months of 1969. Sixty per cent of those ar rested for robbery had previous arrest records, most of them for serious crimes ranging from illegal possession of weapons and narcotics viola tions to felonious assault and homicide. Twenty‐four per cent of those arrested for robbery and 33 per cent of those arrested for burglary had been arrested pre viously for narcotics violations. The study of those arrested for burglary showed two out of three persons had criminal records. Of the 7,488 persons arrested for burglary, 4,965 had been previously arrested; more than half of these (2,588) had a prior arrest for the same crime—burglary. Many also had a lengthy history in other categories: 64 persons previously arrested for homicide; 1,226 with a prior arrest for robbery; 1,019 pre viously arrested for felonious assault; 2,043 for larceny, and 544 for illegal possession of weapons. Among the criminal repeaters were 67 persons who had been arrested not less than 20 times: 3 of these had been arrested 30 times. Two hundred and five persons had been arrested 15 times; 784 had 10 or more prior arrests; 2,629 had 5 or more prior arrests, and 4, 212 had at least 3 previous arrests.

921-> City's Half‐Price Incentive Plan On Food Stamps Voided by U. S.
Julie M. Sugarman, the city's Human Resources Administra tor, announced yesterday that the city had been ordered by the United States Department of agriculture to eliminate the half‐price purchase provision for new participants in the food stamp program next year. The half‐price provision was to have remained in effect through next August. It offered, as an incentive to low‐income families to join the plan, stamps good for $106 worth of food for $41, half the usual price for the stamps for the first month of enrollment. “Eliminating this provision means that the 438,000 persons we expected to sign up after Jan. 1 will have their initial benefits reduced,” Mr. Sugar man said. Mr. Sugarman gave no rea son for the Federal ruling, which also applies to other cities that had used the half price incentive. Mr. Sugarman called on the Federal Government to restore the half‐price feature for new participants and to approve the use of a declaration to enroll the nonwelfare poor. “Since the Department of Agriculture has also failed to fulfill its commitment to us to develop a simpler form of food stamp application for nonwel fare families, the thousands of new applicants we have been unable to certify under the present cumbersome procedures will suffer through no fault of their own,” Mr.Sugamaan said. He said that despite what he called the time‐consuming en rollment procedures for non welfare families,‐ the city had certified more than 95,000 non welfare persons as eligible for the program in its first three, months, through November. About $58‐million in coupons have been sold in that period, Mr. Sugarman said. Of that total, he said, $26.2‐million represents Federal money com ing into the hands of food merchants throughout the city.

923-> Bunker and Abrams Reported to Urge Ban on Herbicides
SAIGON, Thursday, Dec. 17— High‐ranking American officials here reportedly have recom mended a complete halt in the program of crop‐destroying herbicides long used to deny food to the enemy. Special to The New York Times The “crop denial” program is the major, remaining part of the military's controversial her bicide program. It is understood that both Ambassador Ells worth Bunker and Gen. Creigh ton W. Abrams, the militant commander here, have backed the proposal to stop it. The most widely used herbi cide here, 2, 4, 5‐T, known as Orange, has been banned since cide here, 2,4, 5‐T, known as April. But other herbicides, known as Blue and White, have been used since then in a limited effort to destroy some vegeta tion that could afford cover to the enemy but mainly to de stroy crops believed providing food for the enemy. The Vietnam ban on 2,4,5‐T, identified as a factor in animal birth defects, followed the April 15 decision by, the De partment of Health, Education and Welfare to prohibit inter‐, state saleS of the herbicide as a domestic weed killer. That herbicide made up about 90 per cent of the defoliants used here since 1961 to destroy vegeta tion and crops. The remaining part of the program, carried out by the other herbicides, has already been affected by budgetary re strictions. Officials report that funds for the effort have been cut from $27‐million in the last fiscal year to about $3‐million in the current year. It was understood that the issue of banning the remaining herbicides in use in Vietnam arose after the disclosure in October that troops of the Americal Division violated the Pentagon order against using 2,4,5‐T. The military command said that the troops used the chemical to strip away enemy cover and destroy crops on sev eral occasions in May, July and August of this year.

924-> 6 Are Dead and Scores Hurt in 2‐Day Riot at Gdansk
WARSAW, Dec. 16—Poland said tonight that order had been restored in Gdansk, the northern port city torn for two days by rioting and arson. The Government said that six persons had been killed in the clashes with the police while scores had been injured, many of them seriously. The toll was believed by unofficial sources to be higher. The rioting, which began with a demonstration of dock workers against a weekend edict raising food prices, swept out of control on Monday and spread through the city. The isolation of Gdansk, for merly the German city of Dan zig, made it impossible to con firm the reports of travelers, some of them relayed by dip lomats, that minor clashes had also occurred in Sopot and Gdynia, cities near Gdansk. According to a ‘Government communique issued tonight, “hooligans and adventurers, having nothing in common with the working class,” took ad vantage of the situation and ran riot. They “burned several public buildings,” including a floor of Communist party headquarters, according to several sources, “and looted dozens of shops.” Other sources, reporting eye witness accounts, said that some tanks had been seen in the streets of Gdansk and that heli copters had been reported to have dropped tear gas at one stage. A water cannon was reportedly used against a large group sitting on trolley tracks in the center of town, an in dication both of the extent of the disorder and the openness of the challenge. There were also reports that housewives had been among the first to demonstrate in Gdansk, with one group of nearly 300 shouting anti ‐ Government slogans in the vicinity of the Swedish Consulate. Scenes of violence, the worst in Poland since the Poznan riots of 1956, were shown on Polish television tonight. Viewers saw trucks and streetcars burning and self‐service food shops torn open end looted. The selected scenes shown to Polish viewers supported the statement issued earlier by the Government about the damage done in the riots. A later radio broadcast had dock workers, ambulance driv ers and other witnesses back ing up even more firmly the the Government's version that “hooligans” were respon sible for most of the chaos. Polish authorities had appar ently expected some trouble last weekend after announcing, nationwide price increases in meat and many other products. They were part of a major read justment of retail prices in tended to ease shortages and redirect buying habits. While the price increases were coupled with reductions in the cost of some commodi ties, Polish shoppers remained preoccupied only with the rises. The adjustments covered items covering two‐thirds of the value of retail products. The extent and severity of the food price rises caught most Poles by surprise. In Gdansk they apparently reinforced deep er resentments over the loss of some worker benefits being re placed by new incentives in recently introduced reform pro gram. Gdansk remained sealed off tonight as the police units ap parently sought to keep the sit uation under control and to clean up the damage. Telephone communications with Gdansk have been cut off since yesterday afternoon and all flights to the city have been suspended because of “bad weather.” Rail traffic into the city has also been suspended. This correspondent drove within 50 miles of Gdansk this afternoon but was stopped at Paslek by a courteous but adamant police patrol. “Gdansk is closed, you will have to go back to Warsaw,” one of the officers said. How long would it be closed? “You can try again tomorrow,” he said. Was there any place nearby to spend the night? “You must return to Warsaw. We have called to say you will be re turning past the checkpoints,” was the reply. There was no military traffic of any significance on the road, and cities and villages along the 200‐mile route from the capital seemed normal. First reports of the rioting which may have wide political repercussions here, were said to have come from radio opera tors on West German ship in Gdansk harbor reporting to their home office. The Gdansk television was cut from the national grid to allow local Communist party officials to appeal for calm, but the rioting was apparently be yond control. Rumors of the fighting reached Warsaw Monday night. There have since been additional reports of strikes and unrest in other Polish cities, although none severe enough to lead to clashes. There was grumbling but no disorder, here in War saw.

925-> ‘We Lay Waste The World’
“The world is too much with us,” wrote William Wordsworth a century and a half ago, “late and soon, getting and spending, we lay waste our lives.” Today he could well have written: “we lay waste the world.” There are those who believe that, in our increasingly intense pollution of the air we may have hold of an Achilles heel of the world's climate. Irrever sible changes could occur, lead ing either to a new ice age or, through a different change in wind patterns, to a melting of polar ice and flooding of coastal cities. There are those who believe careless use of new chemicals to preserve foods, squeeze larg er crops from the land or soothe the spirit could lead to epidemic birth defects. One scientist even argues that nuclear explo sions releasing radiation to the environment could terminate the ability of the human race to bear viable children. While there is little support in the scientific community for this last prediction, there is widespread belief that man's rapid alteration of his own bio logical environment threatens his long‐term survival unless it is monitored far more closely than now. There appears, however, to be one positive aspect to this ominous situation. In a world where international hostility and entrenched nationalism threaten mankind with swift de struction, the great powers are beginning to see, in threats to the environment, a common en emy. Many have argued that only under the menace of such a common danger would the es tablished patterns of thought be broken. Last week it became known that Soviet and American scien tists, as well as others, are working on a scheme for global monitoring of the environment. Stations and substations, earth satellites and ships at sea would watch for changes in earth, air and water, as well as in the populations of plants and ani mals living in those realms, that might indicate threats to the balance of nature. For two days last week American scientists met at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington to begin draft ing plans for one of the 20‐odd stations envisioned for the main monitoring network. The scheme is an outgrowth of the Interna tional Biological Program, a global effort by many nations now under way. Also last week the Soviet Un ion and the United States agreed on scientific and cultur al exchanges for this year and 1971 that place special empha sis on the exchange of special ists in such subjects as air pollution and waste water treatment. These developments call to mind the “convergence” theory espoused by a number of sci entists and others in both East and West, namely that the problems common to highly technological societies are forc ing nations of diverse ideologies to evolve along converging eco nomic and social lines. At the organizational meeting of the task force that will plan a prototype monitoring station Dr. Dale Jenkins, director of the ecology program of the Smith sonian Institution, pointed out that there are now some 2.5 million known chemical com pounds and that each year 500 new ones go into widespread use. Yet, he said, “little atten tion” is paid to their long‐term biological effects. The adverse effects known to have occurred are picayune compared to what can happen (or may already be happening) in the view of ecologists — those concerned with the inter dependence of all life forms in a particular environment and their interactions with that en vironment. The episodes in the news last week are therefore but a taste of what may happen: (1) A tanker broke apart on Cerberus Shoal between Nova ,Scotia and Cape Breton Island, pouring oil into the Atlantic Ocean, already so polluted that there is more oil than drifting life on portions of the mid‐At lantic. (2) A group of Colorado sci entists chargeli that a plant op erated for the Atomic Energy Commission by the Dow Chem ical Company had released enough radioactive plutonium to present “a serious threat to the health and safety of the people of Denver.” (3) Eleven companies, includ ing such giants as International Harvester, Penn Central, Olin, Procter and Gamble and Pure Oil, were charged by the Jus tice Department with seriously polluting waterways in the Chicago area. Similar charges have been made in New York and elsewhere. At the meeting at the Na tional Academy of Sciences, it was reported that DDT is being detected in winds blowing across the Atlantic from Africa to ‐tarbados While indu??rial ized nations have begun to cur tail the use of this persistent pesticide, which is fatal to many forms of life, it was reported that India is planning to use on a massive scale to kill ma larial mosquitos. Not to do so, the Indians argue, would be a form of genocide. The greatest concern is for effects too subtle to be imme diately apparent. A report re cently submitted to the Nation al Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says: “Virtually every person in the United States is exposed daily to food additives, drugs and pollutants of water and air that were un known prior to the present era.” “In most cases,” it continues, “the biological effects or these substances are poorly under stood.” While it is comparatively easy to test additives and drug for toxicity — their potency as poisons—it is difficult to assess their hereditary effects. “A par ticular drug,” said the report, “is never tested in all the situations (such as pregnancy) and in all the combinations with other en vironmental agents that would occur, should it come into gen eral use.” The thalidomide disaster, in which thousands of deformed children were born to mothers taking that tranquilizer, is the classic example. In recent weeks attention has focused on 2,4,5‐T, a defoliant widely used in Vietnam and, in this coun try, along power lines. There are indications that it, too, may cause birth defects. This report, drafted by a committee of leading geneticists and other specialists, rec ommended that the blood of mothers and newborn infants, taken from the umbilical cord and placenta, be monitored on a spot‐check basis to watch for any signs of increased mutation rates. It is known that radiation and some chemicals can cause mutations, or changes in the coded genetic information of the cell. A certain number oc cur naturally. Some lead to con genital abnormality and mental retardation. A widespread in crease in mutations could be dis astrous for the human race. Geneticists in the Soviet Un ion have been developing a similar monitoring project. The inclusion of such a program is being considered for the pro jected global monitoring, but the latter would be concerned with all life forms—not only human beings. The ecologists believe that preservation of the diver sity of life on this planet is es sential for the long‐term preser vation of life itself.

926-> The Dalai Lama's Tibet Lives On in Its Art
NEW DELHI—“For the Communists to succeed in Tibet,” the exiled Dalai Lama has said of the Red Chinese take‐over of his high‐moun tain country, “it was necessary that the ancient Tibet should die.” This meant strik ing at the basic traditions of Tibet, especial ly the all‐pervasive religious system and its outward manifestations. Ancient Tibetan art, perhaps more re ligious and mystical than that of any other country, became a special target. After the Red Chinese invasion in 1950, the set ting up of an “autonomous region” of. Ti bet in 1951 and the rigid clampdown that came in 1959, Communist China's commis sars, soldiers and Red Guards consistently and ruthlessly plundered and destroyed Ti bet's many art treasures. Yet, some artifacts of “the ancient Tibet” were saved and smuggled out. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetans' spiritual leader, himself was able to transport from his be leaguered country some priceless examples of Tibetan art. Other pieces were brought out by refugees, some of whom made the arduous trek across the great Himalayas with the Dalai Lama when he escaped in 1959. The Dalai Lama and some 801,000 of his followers are now living in exile in India, and many of the Tibetan art treasures are housed in the Tibet House Museum here in New Delhi; it was opened in 1965 under the auspices of the Dalai Lama. Other pieces — some for sale — can be seen in sidewalk shops, stores and private collec tions not only in New Delhi but also in Darjeeling, Nepal, Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok. The exhibits in the museum—thangkas (religious paintings on scrolls), images of Buddha, saints and holy teachers and other relics — are more precious and interesting to view now because for some years the Free World has been completely cut off from their source. The museum's magnificent thangkas, some of which were exhibited last year at Asia House in New York, date from the 16th century. Since they were designed to in duce religious meditation, Lord Buddha, in one of his many aspects and poses, or saints form the central figure. Around those figures, but with such fine use of proportion, details, color and space that they are subordinate to them, are hills, clouds, mists, fruit trees and other timber, flowers, rocks, flames, birds and real and mythical animals. Also por trayed are people in many kinds of activity: flying in the air with a sword to kill an evil spirit, making offerings, playing musi cal instruments, feeding birds and endur ing extreme torture. The tiniest human beings are drawn and painted so carefully that the patterns of their brocaded robes and the expressions on their faces are plainly visible. Among other items on display are 14th and 15th‐century bronze figures of Buddha, some gold‐washed; engraved silver bowls used in a ceremony to feed the hungry spirits of people too avaricious in their lifetime to practice charity; a ritual hand drum made of double skulls, male and fe male; a gold altar lamp; a magnificent mandala (a tiered crown representing the universe) and, of course, prayer wheels. The museum also has a collection of Tibetan coins of old. Its top floor houses ancient sacred manuscripts, and on the second floor is a small shop selling such things as jewelry, robes and felt shoes. Articles on display are annotated, and the museum has a detailed catalogue of them. The more technical terms are ex plained and supplemented by cordial, Eng lish‐speaking Tibetan attendants. With the Chinese plundering of Tibetan art and the dwindling of Tibetan refugees into India, it has become increasingly dif ficult and expensive to purchase Tibetan artifacts. Some authentic ones can be ob tained in the row of little sidewalk shops near New Delhi's Imperial Hotel; they sell, in general, copies of ancient Indian, Nepa lese and Tibetan objects. Some of these dealers will, if they find the customer is really interested in and knows something about Tibetan art, bring “treasures,” including thangkas, from cup boards in the rear of their stores. One of these dealers, a Tibetan named Injung Singh, has hanging on his walls a picture of the Dalai Lama and a famous monastery that he calls “the Dalai Lama's house.” He also has some fine bronze fig ures, engraved silver boxes decorated with turquoise and gold, silver flint holders or namented with turquoise and coral (they make striking pendants), silver trappings for horses, earrings and a belt—it is deco rated with silver‐embossed circles—used for holding bullets. The prices, which are subject to a little bargaining, are not unduly high. The writer recently paid $30 for a superbly engraved woman's silver pocket ornament about six inches in diameter and with a large coral stone in the center. Articles similar to these, although in small quantity and at steadily increasing prices, can be found in Darjeeling, 305 miles north of Calcutta in northeast India, and in small shops in Nepalese villages not far from Katmandu. A recent com mercial buyer found prices somewhat low er in India than in Nepal. In Singapore, Helen Ling carries some Tibetan artifacts. In Hong Kong, Charlotte Horstmann has some cups of wood and engraved silver for less than $70 apiece, as well as silver flint boxes and purses that make attractive costume jewelry. The rest of her collection is of museum quality and price. There are, for example, bronze and sil ver images ranging in price from $600 to $1,500; some superb multiple strands of coral, almost like a screen, hung by Tibetan women from the back or sides of the head, and a lovely jade bowl on a tall, engraved silver base, with a silver lid. Thangkas are rare'in Hong Kong. Jimmy Liu of that city's Four Treasures Art Gal lery recently sold most of his very large collection to European dealers and mu seums. However, since Mr. Liu is well known among Nepalese and exiled Tibetans as a thangka buyer, interested visitors should drop by the Four Treasures Gallery to see any new acquisitions. In Darjeeling, as elsewhere, there are private collectors of Tibetan artifacts. Among the collectors in that city is Tenzing Norkay. He and Sir Edmund Hillary were the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. In Bangkok, the collection of Dr. Heinz Breitkreuz, formerly a physician in China and now the medical director of a leading American pharmaceutical company, is noth ing short of extraordinary in quality and quantity. When he was in private medical practice in Shanghai in 1948, Dr. Breit kreuz made a caravan trip with his own mules and carriers to China's far west, on the Tibetan border. He stayed in Tibetan monasteries there, and explains that he began his collection when “witch doctors practicing locally were unsuccessful, I was asked for medical help was paid in thangkas.” Trapped in Shanghai by Red Chinese forces, the doctor was, to his surprise, allowed by the regime to bring his possessions out of China. Since then, he has added to his already sizable collection on yearly trips to Dar jeeling, one of Asia's most fascinating cities, where he has bought carpets, thang kas, figures and other curios from Tibetan refugees eager to sell them in order to support themselves in exile. In the finest sense of the word, Dr. Britkreuz's house is a museum.

927-> Church Occupiers Ordered to Court
Members of the Young Lords organization their support ers who have been occupying a red brick church in East Harlem for the last eight days were ordered yesterday to appear in court this morning and state why they should not be held in contempt. As the Puerto Rican activists and their sympathizers inside the Spanish Methodist Church raised shouts of “the people's church” and “all power to the people,” Deputy Sheriff Robert Lee stood on the church steps on 111th Street off Lexington Avenue and read the order. In it, the leaders of the Young Lords as well as John and Jane Doe were called upon to show cause why they should not be cited for either criminal or civil contempt in violation of an injunction signed last week barring the group from disrupt ing the church's normal activ ities. The order was signed by Supreme Court Justice Hyman Korn toward the end of a day of reverberations set off by the Young Lords' campaign to get a free breakfast program in the church and their seizure of the building. At noon, 50 white students from Columbia University and theological seminaries took over the executive offices of the Board of Missions of the United Methodist Church at 475 Riverside Drive in support of the activists' group. And at Criminal Court, preliminary hearings began in the case of the 13 Young Lords arrested in a fight with policemen in the church on Dec. 7. The group that invaded the 14th‐floor offices of the Board of Missions told Bishop Lloyd C. Wicke that they would re main until the Young Lords re ceived space for the programs. They also demanded that the charges against the 13 be dropped and called for an end to what they called “the police occupation of black and brown communities.” Early this morning the police said the offices were still oc cupied. The white‐haired bishop sat on his desk as he listened to the group because one of the demonstrators had seized his leather chair and refused to give it up. The churchman said that he would not oppose a citation of contempt against the Young Lords because they were not part of the regular congrega tion, and that he had to protect the congregation's “right to worship as they see fit.” He said he would be willing to meet and talk with the Young Lords but that they would first have to leave the church. At one point, Bishop Wicke turned to a bearded youth who addressed him vulgarly and said, “Young man, you have just insulted everything I be lieve in.” The youth responded by pressing the Bishop roughly against a wall. Both the leaders of the white group, and spokesmen for the Young Lords said the action at the Board of Missions had been independently staged and that there had been no advance planning between the two groups. In Criminal Court, Judge Aloysius Melia postponed until tomorrow any further hearing after the Rev. Humberto Carra zano described how the neigh borhood group had interrupted Sunday services on Dec. 7, leading to a call for the police. At the church itself, the hot breakfast program for poor youngsters continued. A nur sery at which children played and drew pictures was main tained on the upper floors. A loudspeaker system played songs like “Mighty, Mighty Spade and Whitey,” by the. Im pressions, interspersed with the speeches of Malcolm X. In the basement, piles of clothing were arranged for dis tribution. Visitors had to sub mit to thorough searches at the door for weapons or drugs. Among those who passed these inspections were Elia Kazan, the writer and director; Bud Schulberg, the writer, and Jose Torres, the boxer. All three said they had come in support of the Young Lords. In the midst of the tightened security and as anticipation of a “bust” quickened, prepara tions were made for a party last night marking the Epi phany, or Day of the Three Kings. “This is a very important holiday in Puerto Rico and we are going to party,” explained Yoruba Guzman, the Young Lords' Minister of Information. “If the police come, we'll just continue partying. We're going to have folk dances and songs and experience our culture be cause that's what the Lords are all about.”

931-> What Price For the Pursuit of Happiness?
— What good are all our leisure hours and all our riches it we do not delight in them? This was a central question in one of the most stimulating and elevated talk shows in Washing ton this year. It lasted eight days, filling 432 printed pages with extraordinary eloquent dialogue. The forum was a House of Rep resentatives hearing on the con dition of the arts and humanities in America, and what the United States Government was doing and could do to support and en courage them. More deeply, it was a conver gation about the quality of our intellectual and aesthetic life— what President Nixon called, in his message to Congress on the arts last December, “the intangi ble but essential qualities of grace, beauty and spiritual ful fillment.” Thomas Jefferson called it “the pursuit of happi ness.” The, picture of our cultural en vironment that emerged from the hearings was one bursting with creative energy, with soaring at tendances and burgeoning enter prises all over the country. It was also a portrait of overworked, underpaid performers, of artists unable to scrounge a liv ing from their art, of museums “drowning” in floods of people, of a civilization ignoring its past, destroying its values and wor shiping science and technology while giving niggardly taxpayer money to its most enduring evi dences—the arts and humanities. Agnes de Mille, one of the most famous choreographers this nation has produced, poured scorn on present priorities. “What is our image going to be? What footprints will we leave behind? Mylai? Unchanging marks on a dead satellite? Gen tlemen, we deserve better,” she told the House select subcommit tee on education. “While the Government is pre pared to buy a war, or a trip to Mars, or to support one‐fifth of the population on charity drawn from the working wages of an other fifth, it is not prepared to give more than a pittance for our spiritual and emotional well being.” That “pittance” Miss de Mille referred to in regard to govern ment help is the $40‐million Pres ident Nixon asked Congress to appropriate for the arts and hu manities this year. It is double the amount given last year, but a trickle indeed compared to the tens of billions of dollars spent annually on science, technology and war. Perhaps the most telling sta tistic to describe this imbalance was that offered by Clive Barnes, the dance and drama critic for The New York Times. He in formed Congress that the city of Hamburg gives more money each year to its Opera House and resi dent ballet than the United States Government gives to all the per forming arts. The sum was around $3‐million last year. The $40‐million will help sup port the work of poets, com posers, performers, philosophers, historians, theaters, colleges and film academies. If Congress gives all the money asked for by the President, more sums will be flowing into symphony orches tras, museums and ballet com panies, which had been short changed previously. Isaac Stern, the violinist, point ed out that for all too long, America's musicians, painters and poets have themselves sub sidized the arts “by living less well and earning far less than many laboring elements in this country.” The humanities are no better off, either in status or money. According to Barnaby C. Kenney, a historian and head of the Na tional Endowment for the Hu manities, any college freshman can tell the instant he steps on campus that all the new build ings are devoted to science. “He finds the history department in an old house which got through being a dormitory because it was a fire‐trap,” Dr. Kenney said. “He finds the English department working in the old physics de partment and the philosophy de partment is in the old geology building. This gives a kid a sense of values very quickly.” Dr, Kenney warned that the growing and now overwhelming ascendancy of science teaching and research over the humanities was wrenching America apart, wrecking its values and making it impossible to solve society's worst problems, “It is my own conviction that until the elec torate and the persons they elect can use historical and philosophi cal material to help decide the major public questions of the day, we shall not solve those problems,” Dr. Kenney said. With generation now pitted against generation and race against race, “there is no way to bring various opposing forces together excepting by a better understanding of the past, a bet ter analysis of the present and view of the future.” The hearings just ended were probably the most comprehensive and intelligently conducted on culture since Congress only five years ago voted to give money to it for the first time since the Works Progress Administration. (The House debate in 1965 in cluded mocking suggestions that belly‐dancers and baseball play ers were “artists” too and should receive aid.) Representative John Brademas of Indiana, the Democratic chair man of the subcommittee hear ings, was optimistic about the legislation being considered that would give the $40‐million to cul ture and extend the life of the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities three years. Mr. Brademas said he believed the hearings had dramatized the “financial crisis” the arts are facing and demonstrated the na tion's “increasing preoccupation with quality‐of‐life issues.” He cited bipartisan support, from President Nixon on down, and noted that the early apprehen sions in Congress that the. Fed eral Government would control the arts by helping to support them had “clearly not been borne out by the evidence.” The genuine fears expressed five years ago that Congress would create a “cultural czar” who would steer the arts and use them politically aren't around any more, according to those both in Congress and in the cul tural community. “And the is sue now isn't any more ‘should the endowments exist?,’ “ Mr. Brademas said. “It is simply. ‘how much money should they get?’”

933-> Patrolman Wounded in Eye; Assailant Seized in Bronx
A Bronx patrolman was wounded in an eye yesterday afternoon by a ricocheting shot gun pellet after kicking open the door of an apartment in which an armed man had attemoted to take refuge. The patrolman, Robert Johnson, 32 years old, of the 42d Precinct, was reported in fair condition at Montefiore Hospital, where he was sched uled to undergo surgery last night for removal of the pellet. A hospital spokesman said it was too early to know the ex tent of the damage to his eye. His assailant, identified as Green Beauford of Savannah, Ga., was disarmed by police men from the emergency serv ice squad. Patrolman Johnson and five other policemen had responded to a call reporting a man with a gun in an apart ment house at 1009 Morris Avenue.

934-> The Merchant's View:
Although total retail sales are showing signs of slipping, the department store segment is giving evidence of consid erable stability. Even inclem ent weather in many parts of the country has not seriously affected dollar volume in the big stores selling the major portion of non‐durable goods. In the week ended last Saturday, department store sales rose 12 per cent over the same week in 1969 al though reports from cities like New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Pittsburgh and Chicago indicated that stores were affected by unfavorable weather conditions. Total re tail sales during the week, according to the Department of Commerce, showed a 2 per cent decrease compared to the year before. • It is apparent that the slowdown in durable goods is affecting total retailing. Automobile sales dropped 15 per cent during the week and sales of durable goods of all kinds dropped by 13 per cent. In January, total retail sales, on a seasonally adjust ed basis, rose by 1 per cent. The sales figure for the month, without adjustment for seasonal factors, fell 1 per cent compared to the year before. Apparel merchandisers are looking for a clue to what women are going to buy in the way of skirt lengths and, so far this year, the trend is not too clear. Paris designs are emphasizing hems at mid calf and, in better lines of dresses, this longer look is gaining some acceptance. It has not, however, won the acceptance of all young wo men, particularly those in their teens. Eventually, the midi, as it is called, may win out, but young women are proceed ing slowly, chiefly because they have no desire to out mode their current ward robes. • Their indecision has cre ated production problems for garment manufacturers, par ticularly those who must build up some inventory for future selling. Many of them, rather than hazard a wrong guess, are making coats and dresses with open hems that can be brought to salable lengths just before shipment. A poll taken by The New York Daily News shows that an overwhelming majority of wbmen favor the mini‐skirt as against longer lengths. The consensus among fash ion designers and editors is that skirt lengths in the im mediate future will range from long to short. This thought was expressed by Emilio Pucci, the Italian de signer, at the Vogue maga zine fabric award dinner last week. He said that a woman would not dress according to convention, but as the spirit moved her. He predicted that woman's wardrobe would contain clothes in a variety of lengths and would offer many combinations to suit her mood. While the months ahead may prove to be uncertain in the matter of styled ap parel, economists are pre dicting a steady rise in sales volume over the long run. Growth in the country's population in the next dec ade bodes well for the fash ion industry, particularly since there will be a sub stantial rise in the number of working women. It is esti mated now that women who will have their own salary incomes will total 30 million by 1975 as against 24 million at present. • While total dollar volume of apparel purchases are ex pected to increase by an av erage of 8 to 10 per cent a year in the next decade, clothing expenditures will lose some ground in terms of percentage of total spending. In a recent study on con sumer spending, the Research Institute of America esti mated that clothing and shoes this year will account for 8.3 per cent of all spend ing. This compares with 9.1 per cent in 1955. The pro portion of disposable income spent on nondurable goods has fallen steadily in the last 15 years, it was noted, and it has been largely a result of the growing affluence of the consumer. As the income level of a family rises, a family buys more and better food and clothing, but not at a rate that keeps pace with the in crease in its income. The fact is that the level of expenditures in terms of percentage of total spending has declined and will con tinue to decline for such things as automobiles, furni ture, household supplies and most other goods. Services — which include housing, utilities, medicine and health, transportation, education and recreation— have taken an increasingly high percentage of total in come, and this percentage will continue to rise in the years to come. Consumer services, accord ing to the Research Institute, accounted for 35.9 per cent of income in 1955 and will rise to 42.6 per cent this year. On the other hand, total purchases of durable goods, including automobiles, will fall from 15.6 per cent of total purchasing in 1955 to 15 per cent. Total purchases of non‐durable goods in the same period dropped from 48.5 to 42.4 per cent. In the years ahead, spend ing for a variety of services will rise rapidly, the Re search Institute said. More will be spent on medical and health services, chiefly be cause the cost is expected to rise and because new and improved types of medical service will be available. • With more young people going to college, educational expenditures are rising. And there will be an increasing amount of money spent for courses in retraining person nel caught up in technologi cal changes. Outlays for home enter tainment and recreation items will go up sharply, it was said, but those for home furnishings in general will hold about even. Outlays for durable goods will claim a steady percent age of income over the long run, although there may be marked changes from year to year. There can be a slow down in the decline of ex penditures for non‐durables as a proportion of total spending, the study said, be cause of a change in the population mix. With smaller families, per capita spending on non‐durables can be ex pected to rise for many con sumers.

935-> Prices of Steel Scrap Soar, but Not Far Enough to Make Derelict Cars Vanish
Even though scrap metal is an increasingly valuable part of the nation's resources—a fact that was underlined strongly last week—an old car remains, in relative terms, a piece of junk. To consumers who notices that the, steel industry was in Washington last week to complain about the high prices it was paying for scrap, the most common re action probably was to won der about the abandoned automobiles that disfigure the landscape. If iron and steel scrap are selling for the highest prices in about 13 years, why are these derelict cars not being snatched off the streets of Brooklyn and the hillsides of West Virginia? Unfortunately, in the eso teric scale of values applied by the dealers, processors and brokers in ferrous scrap, few items rank lower than an automobile. A number of Government and industry spokesmen have suggested various types of subsidies and bounties that would make it economically worthwhile to remove these eyesores. Nothing has been done so far, and industry officials said last week that without some such financial sweetener the cars would probably stay where they were. The automobile consists mostly of ferrous metals— iron and steel—but, for the amount of these metals it does contain, it is extremely bulky. Unless the car happens to he in running condition, it is awkward and expensive to move. In most parts of the coun try, it is worth perhaps $15 delivered at the dealer's yard. This, however, is about equal to the cost of towing the car to the yard, even if its whels will turn so that it can be towed. A second consideration is that a car, as a piece of fer rous scrap, is contaminated by several non‐ferrous metals, including copper, aluminum, nickel, chromium, lead, zinc and other elements. In addi tion, it contains rubber, plas tics, polymers, glass, textiles, petroleum residues and ordi nary dirt. In a typical dealer's yard, an old car is first stripped of the non‐ferrous metals that can be removed without running into costs that are twice what these metals are worth. In other words, it is feasi ble to cut out the copper ra diator and remove the lead battery, but it would not be economical to recover the small amount of chromium in the decorative trim. Next, the car can be burned to destroy the up holstery and similar waste material. It is then crushed, and usually appears in a grade of scrap called No. 2 bundles. Even in this form, it is not a premium type of ferrous scrap. For instance, the American Metal Market was quoting No. 2 bundles de livered in Pittsburgh one day last week at $38.50 a ton. In the same Issue of the daily trade newspaper, No. heavy melting scrap, a pre mium grade that might con sist of, say, structural steel shapes or heavy plates, was quoted at $49 a ton. A newer and better way of dealing with an old car is feeding it to a shredding machine. After it has been shredded, a magnetic separa tor can pull the ferrous metals one way, allowing the non‐ferrous scrap and waste material to flow another way. However, like most better ways of doing things, this method costs more. The capi tal investment in a typical shredding machine alone is about $500,000. Thus, al though the resulting grade of scrap can be sold for higher prices, the method is only within the reach of the bigger processors. According to the Washing ton‐based Institute of Scrap Iron and Steel, an associa tion of processors and scrap brokers, the current prices are nearly high enough to make the collection of dere lict cars profitable in a few areas. These would be places like Pittsburgh or Cleveland, where there are many yards in strategic locations to ac cept the old automobiles, as well as many nearby steel mills to buy the scrap. However, the scrap indus try does not believe that prices—which have jumped in some cases about 20 per cent in the last 60 days or so — can or will continue at their current high levels. The steel companies that buy the scrap, particularly the small and medium‐sized mills that operate nothing but electric furnaces and therefore melt nothing but scrap, do not agree. They told the Commerce Department at a meeting in Washington last week that exports should be restricted to force prices down. This appeal brought cries of outrage from many scrap processors, who pointed out that the steel producers were happily exporting increased tonnages of steel, while cam paigning for more restrictions on sleet imports. The debate continued at while heat, but the consumer was likely to observe only the fact that the crippled and worthless old cars remained where the engines had died for the last time.

936-> Quakers Attempt to See the President
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24— Members of the American Friends Service Committee at tempted to deliver to the Presi dent today a report condemn ing Vietnamization and United States policies on the war in Vietnam. About 117 members of the pacifist organization began a Christmas Eve vigil at 3 P.M., outside the White House, to dramatize the report and their opposition to Administration policies throughout Southeast Asia. The report says “the re quirements for peace in Viet nam” are the retirement of President Thieu and Vice Presi dent. Ky and the withdrawal of all American armed forces by a given date in 1971. It also asserts that Vietnam ization seeks “the same, ends as in 1954,” when American participation began in Vietnam, with the aim of preserving “an anti‐Communist regime in Sai gon The report argues that the Administration is “restrained only, by the intolerance of the American public for American casualties” and questions the Morality of “maneuvering Asians into fighting Asians.” At a brief news conference on cold and windy Pennsylvania Avenue, Bronson P. Clark ex ecutive secretary of the com mittee, said that reports from Quaker workers in Vietnam indicated that “the list of refu gees, is growing all the time.” He denounced “the immoral doctrine that, wants to change the color of corpses from white to yellow.” Then he led five board mem bers to a White House gate and asked to see. President Nixon, who was reared in Cali fornia as a member of a dif ferent Quaker organization. A staff member of the Na tional Security Council, Wil liam Smyser, appeared instead and asked the small delegation into his office in the Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. The meeting lasted about an hour, with the ‘ rest of the Quakers standing silently in front of the White House, watched by the White House Police, and a Small groups of American Nazis who were seeking the release of Rudolph Hess. The Quakers’ committee has demonstrated here before and has met with members of the White House staff before including Henry. A. Kissinger, head of the National Security Council. But, Mr. Bronson ex pressed concern, during his news conference today, that nothing had ever come of those meetings. When he came out of Mr. Smyser's office Mr. Bronson said that he had been promised that the Quakers’ report and his own synopsis of the meet ing would be sent to the President. One of the members who attended the session with Mr. Smyser muttered, “It was the same, old thing. He listened to us, then tried faintly to defend Administration policies.” The vigil was expected to last into early tomorrow, and the Quakers have been offered positions as official “war pro testers” at the Christmas peace pageant taking place at the Ellipse, behind the White House:

937-> Science
Last week one of the world's foremost authorities, Art Buch wald, explained why so many potholes have recently appeared on streets and highways. It is all the work of the National Pot hole Association whose members stealthily chew up the pave ments. There are, however, other ex planations. In fact highway engi neers say no one should have been surprised at the epidemic. It has come about through a con spiracy between weather above the ground and subtle processes beneath the surface. In recent weeks these factors have been ideal for pavement rupture—ground‐soaking precipi tation, a prolonged spell of in tense cold, followed by repeated freezing and thawing. As a re sult, last Friday city officials broadcast warnings urging mo torists to exercise extraordinary care. What seem like innocuous puddles in the street may be so many traps, capable of blowing a tire or breaking an axle. What is probably the most common form of pothole results from a process in which a lens, or layer, of clear ice forms be neath the pavement, generating reduced local pressure which sucks up water from below. This water freezes, producing new lenses, until the pavement is forced upward by the expansion of the ice. At the next thaw, the ice melts, the raised pave ment loses its support and the next wheel to strike the weak ened spot breaks through. This process occurs primarily where abundant silt lies under the pavement. The silt acts in the manner of capillary tubes through which water rises spon taneously. It is such capillarity that causes water to rise in very narrow glass tubes. However, as pointed out last week by Dr. Robert D. Stoll, as sociate professor of civil engi neering at Columbia University, and a specialist in soil mechan ics, potholes also appear on via ducts and in other spots where there is no silt below the pave ment. They were so bad on the Henry Hudson Parkway, last week, that traffic had to be sus pended. In such eases the damage is done by the almost irresistible force exerted by water expand ing when it turns to ice. This can crack the hardest rocks. For example, it is said that the great pieces of marble carved by Mi chelangelo were split from the quarries at Carrara by water injections prior to freezing weather. The process begins when a cold spell shrinks the pavement, opening hairline cracks. At the next thaw, these cracks fill with water and when the temperature again drops below freezing, the cracks are enlarged. Maintenance men, with pots of hot tar, fill the cracks in an effort to stop the process. However, during a winter as severe as this one, keeping up with this process is a hopeless task. Dr. Stoll noted that, in the horse‐and‐buggy era, frost heav ing was less of a problem be cause it was not necessary to plow all snow from the roads. Snow insulated the underlying ground and ice lenses were less apt to form. Today automobile traffic demands that snow be re moved and the ground beneath the pavement is subject to deep frost action. One solution is to lay the street or highway over a two‐ foot bed of well‐drained gravel. Water will not work its way upward through gravel, as it does through silt. Such gravel beds are laid under expressways and other major highways, but the procedure is expensive. Fur thermore potholes tend to appear where road builders have tried to economize in the choice of con struction materials and pro cedures. If a municipality had unlimited funds, it could therefore avoid potholes. But such a community is nonexistent. Last Sunday it was noted by this correspondent that, if Wordsworth were alive today, he might have written, in one of his better‐known poems, that in our frenetic getting and spend ing, “we lay waste the world.” His original words were given as “we lay waste our lives.” They were, in fact, “we lay waste our powers.” The poet was in no position to complain, but a num her of his admirers, late and soon, did so.

938-> LENT SUPPORTED BY G.O.P. LEADERS
GARDEN CITY, L. I., Jan. 5— State Senator Norman F. Lent was virtually assured today that he will be the Republican candidate this year in the Fifth Congressional District. The 38‐year‐old lawyer from East Rockaway received the endorsement of the executive leaders of the towns of Hemp stead and Oyster Bay to repre sent his party for the‐seat now held by Allard K. Lowenstein, a Democrat. Mr. Lowenstein, who is on a fact‐finding trip in Europe and the Middle East, is expected to announce his political plans after his return Friday. Mr. Lent's candidacy was recommended to the town lead ers by Joseph M. Margiotta, the county Republican chairman. Although the recommendation will have to be acted upon by the full 1,850‐member G.O.P. county committee in March, it is considered unlikely that they will oppose the wishes of the leadership. Mr. Lent, who is chairman of both the Joint Legislative Com mittee on Public Health and the Senate Committee on Health, announced last Monday that he would not run for re‐election to the Legislature this year and would seek the seat held by Mr. Lowenstein. Mr. Margiotta had hoped to persuade Mr. Lent to run again for a sixth term to insure Republican retention of the seat, but Mr. Lent said he would not accept the nomina tion under any circumstances. When asked last week whether he would conduct a primary fight if he was not selected for the Congressional post, Mr. Lent said “I would enter a primary only if I was forced to.” Mr. Margiotta at that time favored the candidacy of Francis X. Becker, Mayor of Lynbrook, for the Congres sional seat. Mr. Becker's broth er, Robert, said tonight that the Mayor had not yet decided his course of action.

939-> Abortion Bill Advocate
ALBANY, April 8 — Con stance E. Cook has led the fight for abortion reform in the State Assembly this year in a tailored, matronly manner, rarely raising her voice and never doubting ul timate success. “She doesn't overplay her femininity on this,” Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea said today, sea crediting the sea soned 50‐year‐old legislator with de emphasizing t h e emotions of the issue. Mrs. Cook, a mother of two chil dren, feels the abortion debate this year is the final stage in an inevitable victory for women. “The whole thing is really not that tough,” Mrs. Cook, Republican from Ithaca, says. “It's basically an educational process, with legislators fi nally understanding the issue and with the public ahead of them on it.” Last weekend, after the narrow first‐round defeat of the Assembly's abortion re form bill, Mrs. Cook reset her resolve and escaped with her family to a two‐acre island they own in Lake Tomagami, in the Canadian wilderness. During the first part of the trip north, a 500‐mile auto journey, the Cook fa mily discussed the issue as they read newspaper ac counts and Mrs. Cook briefly outlined this week's strategy. “And then, by and by, it was talked out, and Connie never brought it up again,” Alfred P. Cook, the legisla tor's husband recalled. The next part of the journey was by snowmobile, and, before long, Mrs. Cook was hum ming by a log‐cabin fire, cooking french toast and looking forward to the 5‐de gree outdoors, with the near est telephone 30 miles away. Mrs. Cook entered politics quietly and diligently, serv ing as a law assistant to Gov ernor Thomas E. Dewey and then on legislative commit tees involved with such mat ters as unemployment insu rance and fire laws. Mrs. Cook, a graduate of the Cornell University Law School and a Fulbright scholar, showed a talent for grasping complex issues and did much of the spadework that holstered and pleased Republican lawmakers. In 1962, she dared to make waves in the sprawling 125th Assembly District — an ex panse of retreating farmlands, growing colleges and smoky factory towns—by being the first woman candidate for the area's Iegislative seat. Mrs. Cook won the election after a primary fight. Soon after arriving in Albany, Mrs. Cook chose as a specialty one of the perennial head aches of the Legislature — education law, and in partic ular the complicated system of formulas that produces state school aid to localities. Last week, on the day after abortion reform failed on the first push, Mrs. Cook stood as the Republican expert on this year's $2‐billion school aid bill and led the majority bill to passage. There was nothing Aunt Pollyish about the way she dealt with the men. Earlier in this session, she joined the three other women in the 150‐member Assembly in proposing that the rights and problems of women be looked into by a joint legis lative committee on women. “We move onto that one after abortion,” Mrs. Cook said today. There is a lightly off‐beat quality to Mrs. Cook. She campaigns in a 1924 Packard touring car that has a small Connie Cook bumper sticker and her husband, a part‐time consultant to food stores, at the wheel. The auto was pro vided as a lark by her brother‐in‐law, but it has re mained as an affectionate note in the grinding, lengthy upstate campaign. Mrs. Cook was born on Aug. 17, 1919, in Cleveland and moved to New York when her father, the late Walter Eberhardt, got a job as a construction engineer on the building of Rockefeller Center. She attended Hunter College High School and, ac cording to her husband, went in for fencing and rowing. “But now we mainly exer cise by walking the perimeter of our grounds,” Mr. Cook said, referring to their five‐ acre Ithaca homesite near Lake Cayuga. Mrs. Cook married her hus band, a widower, in 1954 and they have two children, Cath erine, 13, who talks of a pos sible medical career, and John, 7, who lately is most impressed with the Indians who trap beavers near the Cook's Canadian retreat. Mr. Cook feels his wife is smarter than he is. “Hell, she's a woman, right? And to get to where she is, she had to be at least as smart as the men in that game.”

940-> Cambodia War Said to Cause Major Peking Shift
Information reaching New York from sources close to Communist leaders in Asia sug gests that the United States move into Cambodia has trans formed the Indochina situation more radically than originally estimated. This evaluation is be ing taken seriously in Wash ington. United States specialists there say the evalution conforms in many respects to other infor mation becoming available con cerning China and its role in Southeast Asia. The key to the changed as pect in Indochina was said to be agreement by North Viet nam, the Vietcong, Prince Noro dom Sihanouk and the Commu nist Pathet Lao organization in Laos on an all‐for‐one and one‐ for‐all arrangement to which China has pledged full support. Those who have had a first‐ hand opportunity to assess the situation in Peking and Hanoi describe it “as a wholly new ball game.” What faces the United States now in Southeast Asia, they believe, is pro tracted war with virtually no possibility of arriving at a set tlement in Vietnam unless there is a settlement covering Laos and Cambodiâ at the same time. In fact, some who are close to Peking's thinking even sug gest that the settlement would have to cover “all of Southeast Asia, including Thailand.” It is conceded by United States specialists that the sweeping description of changes in Hanoi's attitudes as well as in those of the others in the new Indochina association may be offered for bargaining purposes. But those who have been following Peking's atti tudes with the greatest care be lieve that it has arrived at an entirely new posture since the opening of the Cambodian phase of the war. Peking is said to have made it clear that the Indochinese people have Its full backing. This goes not only for supplies and materials but for specialists and experts if needed, and for “volunteers” if requested. It does not mean a joint military command, it was said, but it does mean common strategy, military and diplomatic. What China, North Vietnam and their associates now fore see, it was said, is a protracted war. According to this view, they see no possibility that a diplomatic move by Washing ton, even if couched in the most generous terms, would provide an answering response from Hanoi—except in the un likely event that the United States was prepared to negoti ate complete withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Prior to the United States entry into Cambodia, it was said, it was possible to envisage a settlement embracing only North Vietnam and South Viet nam, with Cambodia and Laos left to one side, presumably continuing in their theoretically neutral status. Now, it was said, there is no question of such an approach.

Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia Are Windows to World The Baltic cities of Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia are Polish show windows to the world, normally brimming with tour ists, industry and international trade. “It's one of the best cities in Poland to live,” a Gdansk bartender told a visitor just a month ago. “People feel so cozy here. It's developing. There's plenty of industry and port activity.” High‐rise housing develop ments are sprouting all along the major highway and the rail links of the tree‐city complex of Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia, and officials predict they will merge and attain a population of a million by 1985. Gdansk, the former free city of Danzig, now has 380,000 in habitants, Gdynia has 170,000 and Sopot, the former German city of Zoppot, has 40,000. Sopot, one of Poland's major resorts, attracted more than 2.3 million tourists this ‐year, including 23,250 foreigners. The Grand Hotel survived World War II and remains grand. The white sandy beak is one of the finest on the Baltic. Gdynia is perhaps Poland's most modern city. It grew from a small fishing village at the head of the Polish corridor in the nineteen‐twenties. It is Po land's second largest port and plans to overtake Gdansk as the largest builder of ships. Gdansk is Poland's third larg est port after Szczecin and Gdynia and is building a new deep‐sea port in the Gulf of Danzig that could make it the biggest. Many residents who have streamed into the area since the Germans were pushed out in 1945 emigrated from parts of eastern Poland that were ceded to the Soviet Union, giv ing the area a frontier‐like at mosphere. Roots have not sunk very deep into the sandy soil. Foreign toUrists and seamen have given the Baltic Poles greater exposure to Western ers than those in the interior get. Booming industry and trade, relative prosperity and modern dwellings probably have made them more sensitive to economic squeezes directed from Warsaw. The voice of a Gdansk radio reporter yesterday seemed to register disbelief that Poland's “Pearl of the Baltic” was the site of disturbances with fires burning in the rebuilt Old Town quarter. “And all this happened in the town of which every stone was rebuilt with the hands of workars,” he said, “every brick placed with reverence, where every new house, every meter of asphalt pavement gives us I0Y•”

942-> Coins
EACH year, the birth day of George Wash ington, born in West moreland County, Va., on Feb. 22, 1732, is an oc casion for special celebra tions by many coin clubs throughout the nation. Groups meeting this week will no doubt carry on the tradition by making our first president the theme for exhibits at their February sessions and at regional shows. Numismatists putting to gether displays of monies bearing a likeness of Wash ington, or materials related to highlights in his career as a general and statesman, have a variety of materials from which to choose. His portrait has been on numer ous bills, ranging from frac tional 25‐cent currency to $5,000 Federal Reserve notes. The reverse side of the $5,000 note in the 1918 se ries pictures him resigning his commission. Modern‐day collectors are more familiar with the many $1 bills—both large and small size—carry ing Washington's portrait. There also are medals, me dallions and commemorative coins—some issued officially by the United States Mint— depicting major events of the Revolutionary War or mark ing highlights of Washing ton's presidential years, as well as our quarter in gener al circulation today. While many collectors are assembling exhibits in the hopes of winning prizes at club gatherings, there are others concerned with this question: “Isn't it time to change the design of our 25‐ cent piece?” The coin being produced for current use was originally issued on Aug. 1, 1932 and was intended mere ly as a commemorative to mark the 200th anniversary of Washington's birth. It was designed by John Flanagan, who modeled his design for the obverse side from a bust of Washington done by Jean Antoine Houdon, a French sculptor. The Washington quarter was authorized by a special Act of Congress dated March 4, 1931. It replaced the Standing Liberty quarter, which enjoyed a “life span” of only 15 years. The Mint's policy, established by law years ago, provided that the pattern of a coin should not be changed within 25 years. It was the belief that differ ent designs on coins of one denomination in circulation at the same time might cause confusion and provide great er opportunity for counter feiting. The major reasons for changing a coin (changes must be authorized by Con gress) are to commemorate an important event or to hon or a recently deceased states man. This was true in the case of the Peace Dollar, struck in 1921 to mark the end of World War I; the Franklin D. Roosevelt dime of 1946, and the John F. Ken nedy half dollar of 1964. Many consider the Wash ington 25‐cent piece a coin that has worn poorly and the introduction of clad coinage in 1965 did little to help this impression. Our first presi dent was a man of many faces when seen through the eyes of artists and sculptors, and with the high‐speed mint production and rough usage of today Washington changes in appearance within a few months after shedding the mint wrappings. The eagle— portrayed on our monies as a symbol of integrity — on the reverse of the Washington quarter also shows signs of abuse after a brief time in*circulation. With all due respect to the Father of our Country on his birthday, perhaps it is time to consider a change — many readers have suggested a United States coin to mark man's first landing on the moon. Numismatic items related to the life and times of George Washington will provide the motif for exhibits to be dis played by members of the Northern Valley Coin Club when they convene Tuesday evening at 8 o'clock. The club's monthly meet ing will be held in the Metho dist Church in Demarest, N. J. and the public is invited to at tend. There is no admission charge.

943-> To Reduce Car Pollution
Tougher exhaust standards for automobiles, to he applied on 1973 and 1975 cars, were a major part of the antipollu tion program announced last week by President Nixon. Some of the auto industry's antipollution devices are illustrated above. A: PCV valve, or positive crankcase ventilation sys tem, designed to remove unburned gasoline from the crank case. B: CCS, or Controlled Combustion System, involves controls for mixing air and fuel and modifying ignition tim ing. C: EEC or Evaporative Emission Controls, involves a series of pipes between the carburetor and fuel tank and a carbon canister to store fumes. It is on 1970 cars sold in California and will be on all 1971 cars. D: TCS, or transmis sion controlled speed. It retards spark timing to control nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. E: Reactors, or some form of afterburner to consume exhaust gases. F: Catalyst muffler, a device that will oxidize unburned fumes. The first four systems are estimated to cut 80 per cent of hydro carbon and 66 per cent of carbon monoxide emissions. E and F devices will probably be introduced to comply with the President's 1975 deadline.

947-> Benvenuti Settles for Immortality
TRIESTE, Italy, Feb. 14 (UPI)—They swirl around Nino Benvenuti all day and half the night, not sure what they seek but convinced he's got it. Some want to see Nino the movie actor. Others want to see Nino the Fascist. Or Nino the reputed Romeo. Or Nino the re puted pal of American gangsters. Or Nino the sports hero. In the middle of the hubbub sits Ben venuti, cracking the knuckles of his knotted fingers and glaring back at a bust of the Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, which looks down from one wall. “Sure, it's a good life,” he said. “But I've bled a lot for it.” So he has. His eyebrows, nose and fore head are pinched from the stitches skill fully inserted by doctors patching him up after big‐money fights. Red scars zigzag between his eyes. Knots of calcium and tissue warp his hands. Benvenuti looks what he is: the middle weight boxing champion of the world and the most flamboyant character in the sport since Muhammad Ali. “My goal is to become immortal,” he said recently. “To become extraordinary, fabulous.” He may not make it, but his banker won't care. Benvenuti is a rich man at 32 and getting richer. Contributing to his wealth are such diverse activities as proceeds from a western movie panned by critics, several businesses and a biography one critic dismissed as one step from fiction. But traveling along with the good time and high income were stories about gang sters and girls. The gangsters clouded his reputation. The girls glamorized it. Benvenuti looked at his wife Giuliana and shrugged. “This talk about women is ridiculous. My wife knows this. And this talk about gangsters is even more ridicu lous.” New York authorities took it seriously enough to wonder publicly if Benvenuti was friendly with some East Coast gam blers and mobsters. “I have always been honest inside the ring and outside it,” he said, but acknowl edged he considered gambler Joseph (Joe Carlo) Calabro—one of the men named in investigations—“a fine person.” The most serious charge against Ben venuti concerned a non‐title fight last year in New York against Dick Tiger of Nigeria. Nino lost it on points and appeared to be going halfspeed most of the time. He was. “I hit Tiger on the top of his head in the fourth round,” Benvenuti said. “I felt something go snap. A bone was broken. I fought like a cripple for the rest of the fight, but I preferred to fight instead of quit. I'm not a quitter.” It was the noisiest uproar since Benvenuti's election in 1963 to the Trieste City Council. He ran as a member of the neo Fascist Italian Social Movement (M.S.I.), a party composed of political heirs of Mus solini. “Fascist means one thing to you, another thing to me,” he said. “I'm a nationalist in the patriotic sense and I admire Mussolini very much, certainly more than I admire the politics of the party I served.” He served two years on the city council before stepping out of active politics the year he won the world light middleweight championship. The admiration for Mussolini remains open and public. His library shelves con tain a dozen biographies of the former dic tator. The bust on the wall is prominent among a half dozen modernistic paintings. Far behind Benvenuti is a poor, hard childhood as the son of a Trieste fish ped dler. But he retains sentimental attach men to the sea and owns a villa towering over the Bay of Trieste. Also far behind him are the days when managers tried to persuade him to turn professional before he realized his am bition of winning an Olympic gold medal. By the time of the 1960 Olympic Games held in Rome, the amateur welterweight called Giovanni Benvenuti had won 103 of 104 bouts and been named amateur boxer of 1957. He won the gold medal in the welter weight division, but a light heavyweight named Cassius Clay stole much of the limelight. Giovanni gave way to Nino and Ben venuti turned pro on Jan. 20, 1961. His first fight was a six‐round decision over a Tunisian. Four years later he was world light middleweight champion and on April 17, 1967, he outpointed Emile Griffith in New York to win the middleweight crown. He lost the title briefly when Griffith outpointed him in a return bout, then re gained it by again outpointing Griffith on March 4, 1968. Since, he has dispatched three American challengers. Now he is between fights, a time he devotes to loafing, attending English lan guage courses at the United States Infor mation Service (U.S.I.S.) library, serving as a volunteer fireman and driving his chil dren, Stefano, 7 years old, and Macri, 5, to school. “I have no idea what I'll do next,” Ben venuti said. “I will not fight Griffith again. That is the only thing certain.” Meanwhile, he sits among the antique furniture in a ranch house overlooking Trieste, greeting the men and women who make their way up a twisting, narrow cobblestone street to see him. Cr a nearby table, eight wrist watches tick away—set for no special reason at eight different times of day.

948-> Education
To those who remember the flood of industry and govern ment recruiters to college cam puses as recently as a year ago, often surrounded by stu dent pickets, the decline in job interviews these days would be surprising. The reason? The job market for fresh graduates, squeezed by economic pres sures, is drying up. Reports from across the country last week indicated that the June graduating class will have the toughest time since World War II in its search for employment. Recruit ers are no longer flooding the campuses. In times of high profits and prosperity, the competitiveness of business and industry leads to very generous hiring prac tices. Under such conditions, manpower appears cheap, much more so than machinery. On the off‐chance of getting ahead of the competitors by comering the talent and creativity mar ket, firms in past years of pros perity, tended to hire expansive ly, even to hoard manpower. Thus, when money gets tight, this is the easiest place to cut. At the height of the economic boom, some colleges reported more recruiters than graduating seniors, and students were often treated to all‐expenses‐paid trips to inspect a potential em ployer. But last week, The Chronicle of Higher Education, a founda tion‐supported weekly, found that the tide had changed con siderably. It reported that a survey of job offers from busi ness and industry at 141 cam puses, conducted by the College Placement Council, showed of fers to bachelor's degree candi dates were 20 per cent below last year. Master's degree can didates are even worse off, with a 24 per cent decline. John L. Munschauer, Cor nell's placement director, has advised students that “it may, not be prudent to be alienated, arrogant, or to have excessively long hair” while job‐shopping. He said the situation was far from critical, but students would not get their first choice as most of them did in the past. Any judgment now must still be considered preliminary. While normally recruiting goes into high gear in February, much will depend on the na tional economic picture in the two months ahead. An indica tion of how sensitive the job market is to the ups and downs of the economy is the fact that when the survey was completed a few weeks ago, the offers for Ph.D. candidates was still on the rise, by a startling 21 per cent. Since then the trend has been reversed, and it is expect ed that it will end up below last year's. Here are some examples from the on‐campus recruiting sur vey: ¶At Stanford University, where about 450 firms normally send emissaries, 48 companies and seven government agencies have canceled their visits. ¶At Cornell, for the first time in a decade, 20 firms and three Federal agencies called off their recruiting. ¶At the University of Geor gia, while no mass‐cancellations were reported, many firms were making fewer offers and some appeared to show up only to keep in the good graces of the campus. ¶One major aerospace com pany said it canceled all the 189 campus visits it had planned. The United States Civil Service Commission said that general college recruiting for the Gov ernment is already In consider able decline. For the current fiscal year 1970, 8,400 college graduates were hired, compared with a peak of about 14,000 in fiscal 1967. Some of these indicators at the moment may be excessively pessimistic. Business is nervous, and it is hard to tell whether the present retrenchment is cautious “wait‐and‐see” or the start of a real job freeze. More over, there is some continuing pressure by many forward‐look ing managers not to be stam peded into a serious cutting off policy. They warn that the ef fects of a policy of fear and retrenchment now may have se rious repercussions on produc tion and economic growth a decade hence. The reversal in the recruit ing situation comes, ironically, at a time when the cost of college education continues to rise because of mounting op erating expenses of the univer sities. Harvard announced last week, for example, that its tu ition would be Increased anoth er $200 next September to $2, 600 a year. At the same time, Yale cut back next year's en rollment in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences by between 20 and 30 per cent in an effort to combat critical financial def icits — $500,000 this year for graduate studies alone. The high cost of everything— from Staff salaries to heat and electricity — strains university budgets. Traditionally, in the private institutions, tuition has rarely covered more than half of a student's education cost (and much less than half for graduate students) While the re mainder must be covered by in come from gifts, grants and en dowment. But just as costs are at a new high, government funds are fading away. In addition to the more rou tine cutbacks, the Defense De partment has been prohibited by Congress to let any univer sity research contracts, except directly “mission‐oriented” ones. This is a severe financial blow since many military contracts were extremely permissive and open‐ended, thus supporting a great deal of basic research. In addition, if the stock mar ket continues its downhill slide, the largess of private donors is not likely to stand up either, and taxpayers are not enthusi astic about paying more for public institutions. Finally, as both government agencies and industry begin to feel the fiscal and sales pinch, the new college graduates will be among the first to get the backwash. For the moment, the campus scene is one of a variety of cross‐currents. A vocal sector of the college‐age generation still looks with contempt at the sys tem, in both the private and public sector, while a probably far larger group, desiring to get into the system, will resent that it is harder to get ad mitted.

949-> 3 ISRAELI PROBES MADE IN LEBANON
AVIVIM, Israel, May 25— Israeli forces made three limit ed incursions into southern Lebanon today, one of them With a tank column that was said to have engaged and knocked out a Lebanese Army artillery position north of Yarun. [The Lebanese Army re ported that Israeli tanks had crossed the border at two points and fought a three‐ and‐a‐half‐hour duel with Lebanese artillery. It said that one Israeli tank had been destroyed and a half track damaged. Lebanese casualties were listed as one soldier killed and six wounded.] In addition to the tank column, two small groups of Israeli infantrymen crossed the border and were said to have taken up positions during the day to scan the steep hills and deserted villages for signs of guerrilla activities. “This is no invasion,” a senior Israeli Army officer said. “This is a patrolling op eration.” The infantry units found nothing, officers said, although a squad of eight men that took up a position on a ridge south of Sal Hani called for some pro tective mortar fire, just in case of trouble. A platoon of 20 men spent the day on a hill overlooking, Yarun, but the village hash been deserted since the Israelis began shelling it on Friday. It was on the that day that ter rorists ambushed an Israeli school bus on a road nearby, killing four teachers and eight children and wounding 20 oth er persons. Nine of the families mourn ing their dead are here in Avi vim, an Israeli settlement of Moroccan Jewish immigrants, a few miles from the border. When Defense Minister Moshe Dayan visited them yesterday, he promised that the terror di rected against them would not go unchecked. “If the Lebanese Government declared it is not obliged to serve as policeman to curb the terrorists, we will do the job,” he said. The Israeli Army officer confirmed here that his forces had been crossing the border since Friday. Ambushes have been set on two nights since then, he said, although he de clined to say whether anyone had been caught. The two infantry groups that went across the border this morning were back by nightfall. The column of four tanks went into Lebanon at noon, and returned two hours later, after its brief duel with the Lebanese gunners north of Yarun. Special to The New York Times TYRE, Lebanon, May 25 — The Lebanese Army said today that Israeli tanks had thrust across the border at two points five miles apart in the Bint Jbail region and fought a three‐ and‐a‐half‐hour duel with Leba nese artillery. The Lebanese said they had knocked out one Israeli tank and damaged a half‐track, while losing one jeep drawing an anti tank gun, one soldier killed and six wounded, incuding an of ficer. The Armed Struggle Com mand of the commando groups in Amman, Jordan, announced that commandos had engaged the enemy during the Israeli thrust across the border. As Lebanese armored units moved south on the road be tween Tyre and Beirut, refugees fleeing the embattled border re gion passed them heading north. Many were from the Bint Jbail area, the one region in the south‐central plain around which the commandos acknowl edge having bases. It is situated two miles from the border, op posite the area where an Israeli school bus was attacked last Friday. Within an hour of the in cident, the Israelis bombarded Bint Jbail and three other vil lages, causing, according to of ficial figures, 20 dead and 40 wounded. The number of refugees who have fled from Arkub and the border region around Bint Jbail has now reached 15,000 accord ing to official sources. It was estimated that 60 per cent of the women and children of Bint Jbail, whose population was 17,000, had left before today's Israeli attack.

950-> IND RIDER SLASHED; SUSPECT GIVES UP
A tall man stepped into a southbound EE local of the IND subway after it stopped at the 34th Street station yes terday and, for no apparent reason, walked over to a 75‐ year‐old man and slashed him with a long knife on both sidees of the face. The attacker fied, but within an hour a suspect was in cus tody. The victim, a stranger to the assailant, was identified as Sam Saffrian of 83‐06 Vietor Place, Elmhurst, Queens. He was taken to St, Clare's Hos pital, where he was treated for lacerations of the face and ears. The attack took place at 12:45 P.M., when there were about 80 passengers on the train. The victim said no words were spoken between him and the assailant. Almost an hour later, a man walked up to the second‐floor police room in the Criminal Court Building, at 100 Centre Street, and said, “I just stabbed a man on the subway.” The suspect, identified as Ross Bur ford, 29, of 40 West 115th Street, was turned over to the Transit Authority police. Later in the West 35th Street police station the suspect, who was ideentified by the victim, was booked on charges of fe lonious assault and possession of a dangerous weapon. A sev en‐and‐a‐half‐inch knife was found in a trash can in the Criminal Court Building.

951-> Letters to the Editor of The Times
To the Editor: There certainly must be a better method of conducting labor negotiations than the manner in which the transit workers and the Transit Au thority arrive at a new con tract—delaying final offers and bargaining until the last pos sible moment. [Editorial Jan. 2.] For ours and similar institu tions which have to insure the presence of staff on a 24‐hour, seven‐day‐a‐week basis to see to the care of hospitalized pa tients, the necessity for making plans and arrangements for a possible transit strike is not only costly in money but in staff time, which could better be de voted to patient care. At University Hospital, New York University Medical Center, in preparation for a transit strike we detailed an assistant administrator and an adminis trative assistant to work full time for two weeks, and a num ber of personnel almost full time during the last week be fore the strike deadline, on plans to transport people to work. Staff meetings to dis tribute carpool and charter bus information also took up con siderable time. We reserved charter buses and had to pay one day's charges because we could not cancel the reserva tion prior to noon on Dec. 31. Multiply this by the number of our sister institutions in the city who also take care of sick people and the bill becomes enormous. As the strike did not occur, the outlays were wasted. Yet, because of the manner in which the negotia tions are conducted, the ex penditures and the efforts had to be made because if there had been a strike and no plans had been made, hospitals Would have been in chaos. In the name of common sense, cannot these negotiations be held far enough in advance of the deadline to assure a set tlement in good time? IVAN M. BENNETT Jr., M.D. Director, N.Y.U. Medical Center New York, Jan. 2, 1970 • To the Editor: It is time for the general pub lic to be made awareo of the actuarial implications of the jumbo jet. On a typical trans Atlantic flight today, there will be, on the average, two‐thirds of a squalling child, three‐ fourths of a drunk, seven‐tenths of an airsickness victim and one three‐hundred‐thousandth of a hijacker. With the advent of the jumbo jet, carrying up to 490 pas sengers, the chance of our be ing subjected to at least one of these nuisances approaches certainty. Indeed, with the new hijacking rules permitting des tinations other than Havana, we might look forward to a rise in the rate, which, in con junction with the vastly in creased passenger capacity, opens the possibility of com peting hijackers on the same aircraft. ARDIAN GILL New York, Dec. 27, 1969 • To the Editor: The lead editorial which ap peared Dec. 9 under the caption “The Effluent Society” quoted a recent report by the Federal General Accounting Office which presented the Willamette River in Oregon as an example where Federal and state efforts to clean up water pollution have been foiled by poor planning, inadequate funds and unchecked industrial pollu tion. The G.A.O. report as it relates to Oregon water quality control programs, and in par ticular to the Willamette River, is grossly inaccurate, and the conclusions drawn therefrom show a complete lack of under standing by the G.A.O. ac countants of water quality control problems and programs. First of all, the statement that Federal grants have been handed out on a first‐come, first‐served basis is a complete distortion of the facts. In Oregon a definite and compre hensive priority point system based primarily on financial and water pollution control needs has been used for deter mining which projects should receive grants ever since the Federal grant program was started in 1957. Secondly, the inference that the Willamette River is an example of where the Federal Government's efforts to clean up water pollution have been foiled by poor planning, inade quate funds and unchecked industrial pollution is entirely unfounded. Both cities and in dustries in the Willamette River Basin have made excel lent progress in reducing their waste discharges and restoring good water quality in the Willamette River. In a letter dated Oct. 6 of this year, addressed to Governor McCall, David D. Dominick, Commissioner of the Federal Water Pollution Control Ad ministration in Washington, commended Oregon highly for having one of the strongest and most progressive water pollu tion control programs in the nation. He mentioned specifically the progress made by the state in cleaning up the pollution in the Willamette River, and said that it is an example to the nation of what can be done where there is the desire, the ad ministrative support and the legal tools to do the job. My final comment is that in my opinion this particular Federal grant program has been administered most efficiently and effectively. Its main de ficiency has been the lack of adequate funds to meet the needs. MARK O. HATFIELD United States Senator, Oregon Washington, Dec. 17, 1969 • To the Editor: The fantastic, which from the outset has cloaked the Mid dle Eastern problem, now ap pears to have enshrouded American policy. Befriending and supporting, and conse quently strengthening the Ara bia of the Left in the hope of protecting America's oil in vestments is as hopeless a policy and as sure to boom erang as that safe‐conduct pass which Germany gave to Lenin when they shipped him back to Russia. What has in fact been guard ing and protecting the oil‐rich but small and militarily weak sheikdoms and principalities of Southern Arabia and the Amer ican investments there is noth ing else but the Israeli army. With Israel out of the way there would be nothing to stop Syria and Egypt from scooping in all those oil‐rich lands in the name of a Pan‐Arab Union and the rights of the strongest. And the Left would give those large and heavily populated but very poor countries their justifica tion. In the first instance, Ameri can foreign policy must always be rooted in self‐interest. In the Middle East it is to Ameri ca's interest to support a strong Israel. The goals of both coin cide—to keep, ambitious and rapacious Arabs from eating up their neighbors. MARCEL SALZBERGER Middle Village, N. Y. Dec. 23, 1969 • To the Editor: The two‐cent deposit has kept many soda bottles from being discarded in our streets. Why not a $50 junk tax stamp sold by the state to the buyer of every new automobile? Each time this vehicle is resold the seller would be reimbursed his $50 by the new buyer. When the car has eventually lost its intrinsic value it will always have a worth of $50 when returned to an officially designated junkyard. Aside from eliminating those unsightly cars from our streets the state would continuously have the use of this tremen dous pool of money. NORMAN SNIDER New York, Dec. 30, 1969

952-> By Erskine Caldwell out of Flannery O'Connor
There is something strangely askew in these stories, all of which are set in the hinterlands of Appa lachia. They seem to be written by someone who has heard of red hills, cornpone, bib overalls, and Tuberose snuff, but has never met the heady parorexia of the late Confederacy firsthand. Eleanor Glaze is ignorant, for instance, of the mating time of cats (she thinks it's in the spring), and her ear for Southern speech is of a flatness, flat. What she has mas tered is the fact that life in the South has been depicted as outrageously comic and bitterly tragic, that it is distinctively picturesque, and will hold up sturdily no matter how, whim sically you approach it. To cover all fronts, she has approached it in these dozen stories everyway you might think of. In “The Embrace,” a novella, she takes a shiftless family from Flan nery O'Connor, programs it to per form various high finks well known to the readers of Erskine Caldwell, and edges all toward a catastrophe of the kind both Southerners and Balkans are particularly good at. In this instance, a wife gets her hus band drunk and burns him alive. Miss Glaze's characters do other astounding things. They eat the la bels off soup cans, bite each other, quote Swedenborg in country stores, and own telephones which they do not intend to use. They are all ac complished eccentrics. (Eccentricity, we remember, is what native ways of doing things look like to an outsider. Miss Glaze is very much the out sider. She is herself so taken aback by the manners of the South she cannot interpret them). When she writes about matters in dependent of their locale, she writes with conviction and clarity. In “Sil ver Grapes,” the best of these stories, she demonstrates that she can inter pret human suffering as movingly and as sensitively as the best of writ ers. This story has what the others lack (and sorely need), an articulate protagonist. The author has clearly set herself the most difficult of tasks, that of interpreting the feelings of the inarticulate, the ignorant, and the unaware. To complicate her under taking, she has chosen characters who are locked inside themselves, whose inner lives are in dumb rebel lion against the half‐understood wishes of their hearts. In the best tradition of Western literature, she does not wish to undervalue human life. If these stories miss distinction by a hair, it is because they get stuck in the conventions established by oth er writers for depicting country life. If only Miss Glaze had looked at it all afresh, she would have written far better. Or if she had added to the tradition, that would have helped to dispel the feeling that we have heard these stories before. As it is, there is an almost mechanical process to her characters' actions and speech. Or it may be that she simply has n't mastered the convention in which she is writing. When, in “The Em brace,” a character designated as typ ically Southcrn‐small‐town says of an eccentric girl given to leaping about in a local forest, “...when she done her ballet dance in th' woods, her wrists an' ankles, they'd disappear,” we feel that a convention is being violated. The implausible is being palmed off on us as the possible. We also feel that the character is trying to say something in his own dialect, but that his creator is determined to touch up what he's saying. That may be the trouble with these stories. They are true, they are vaguely typical, they have power in potential. But their conveyer has not been content to let them speak for themselves, as if she distrusted real ity to be interesting enough. The re sult is an overwritten version of what might have been a brilliant book. When Miss Glaze has learned to let well enough alone, we ought to hear great things from her. Several of these stories appear to be the dismantled chapters of an abandoned novel; indeed, the title story answers to all the definitions of a short novel, and it may be that Miss Glaze is trying her hand with short stories while dyer eye is on the larger form. She has in rich measure the talent for either one, but not yet that discipline which gives prose nar rative a natural voice and an inevi table obedience to the laws of its own structure. ■

953-> Mild medicine for a serious sickness
Samuel Lubell, the pollster, ven tures in his latest book to tell us what ails us and what to do about it. As public opinion analysis, the book is useful, but as prescription it's an aspirin tablet. When Lubell tries to take up the responsibilities of doctor of society, he just fusses around in his personal medicine cabi net of opinions. The Hidden Crisis In American Politics By Samuel Lubell. 306 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Co. $5.95. The author says that “the hidden crisis in American politics” is “our inability to reconcile” the crisis in. race, pollution, crime, cities, youth, Vietnam and national priorities. This nation‐rending explosion of problems, which he also calls “our crisis of unresolved neglects,” is about as hidden as a hurricane The two crises he talks the most about are the degeneration of race relations in major cities and the break‐up of the Democrats’ majority coalition, matched by President Nixon's attempt to forge a new one on a divisive sectional basis. Six years ago, in “White and Black: Test of a Nation,” Lubell ad vocated giving blacks “residential mobility, to enable them to disperse and move freely in their search for new quarters.” Now, however, he writes about black “penetration” of white neighborhoods, about “uncon trolled population movements” and a “new trend of territorial racial conflict” in the cities, with lower income whites confronting heavily black districts “almost like two hos tile nations.” Too briefly, he acknowl edges that black moving into white neighborhoods have gotten, at least at first, better police protection and access to better schools. At much greater length he relates the re marks and envokes the emotions of whites in the border areas of urban racial conflict. Edging toward the brink of ad vocating residential segregation, Lu bell himself seems to be feeling some racial hostility. He writes: “Negroes, banging at every door they can reach, are demanding entry en masse in place of the old pattern of each individual making it on his own.” Saddened and angered by the racial pressures and conflicts in Cleveland's “Little Italy” and “Little Hungary,” he asks, “Why couldn't a housing policy be devised that would provide Negroes with the housing they needed without up rooting a piece of Europe that could never be reassembled again?” He says the possibility of developing “a pattern by which whites and blacks could live alongside each other” was “ploughed under” by Negro migra tions out of the South in the 1950's. “Can it be,” he asks, “that whites and blacks would get along more easily if they stayed seperate?” But Lubell's points of view are consistently elusive. As he probes into other people's opinions he ob scures his own. He writes a book and asks these provocative questions, but what does he believe about the answers? This is the hidden crisis in Mr. Lubell's politics. The issue is whether some neigh borhoods and some of the new cities should be accepted and planned quite frankly as enclaves for minorities. We have here the conflict of two goals, democratic integration and the reduction of our differences and divisions versus voluntary group separatism and the appreciation and enhancement of the heritage and customs of the group. Perhaps school busing and job integration can be the circulatory system that integrates the people while we devise new, somehow noncoercive means to have those who wish to do so live mainly among their own ethnic groups; but the great risk would be the perpetua tion of lily‐white sanctuaries, ghe toes and race hate. Furthermore, with legalized “borders” of any kind, we would sanction the very territorial gang‐sense that can ignite local revolutions or local genocides. Perhaps black and white will come to take each other more for granted side by each as we hasten to apply drastic remedies to the rotted‐out urban environment. Certainly one may not concur in Lubell's remarks that the harsh political reality is that the billions needed to rebuild the cities “are not going to be made available” and that “there is no quick way of stabilizing the disorganized conditions under which so many Negroes live.” Just such equanimity about other people's suffering, just such defeatism masquerading as realism, has inflamed the divisions Lubell so piously laments. Lubell sees the racial whiplash in the cities as the fundamental cause of the apparent break‐up of the New Deal. coalition. With spikily copious statistics and interviews, he demon strates that this conflict has cost the Democrats the white South and more and more white voters elsewhere. As the South was the conquered province during Reconstruction, so, Lubell says, are the Northern cities “the bypassed provinces” in the new Nixon coalition. However, his studies persuasively refute the presumption that “the Wallace vote” is readily available to Nixon's big‐business party. Poor and lower‐middle‐class white voters tend to identify their economic self interest with the Democrats and to distrust the Republicans. Lubell's polling justifies the assumption thet a voter who goes with a racist party as a protest is not as likely to vote Republican, because he is looking out for his own pocketbook. As Lubell sees it, Nixon is trying to build a majority out of the South and West against the North, a majority of white suburbanites and hards‐hats against the blacks, chi canos and white liberals: Lubell sees that this may or may not work; he concedes that we may slip into “four party politics,” with rebellious Wal lace‐like and leftist parties leaving us with no majority party at all. Lubell's empathy for poor and middle‐class whites makes a reader feel the justice of their resentments as they work hard for what little they have and then see others, often blacks, who are not working but are getting along as well or better on welfare. Again the question is what should be done. Resuming the job creating public works with which we experimented in the 1930's or lower ing taxes on the poor might help, but would be controversial, and Lu bell is not drawn to anything divisive. His proposals bear no convincing relationship to the problems he describes. Consider, for in stance, his advocacy of more Federal money for education and for a Racial Peace Commis sion in each state to propose steps for voluntary desegrega tion! His discussion of “the youth crisis” and “the on‐goings in the university zoos” shows that he has no feeling for the new styles among the young. Argu ing that the failure to reform the draft law in time was the main cause of the protests against the Vietnam war, he grossly understates the im portance of the moral revulsion against that war in the decline of the Democrats. Looking for self‐interest behind everyone's attitude and so often finding it, he ties dissent on the war among the young to the desire not to fight in it; he is im pressed by how often a father's desire that we go all out to win it is related to his wish that his own son need not have to go at all. Lubell's view of human nature is entirely too cynical. Like any people we are self‐interested, but we are also a moral people. His bias, Lubell warns us, is “the ceaseless struggle for national unification.” He tests —that is, evaluates—political parties by their “unifying abil ity.” By this bias he deprives his analysis of real moral rele vance. He resents the voters’ passionate arguments over the allocations in the Federal boot because we are becom ing a divided “claimant socie ty,” despite the obvious fact that our unruly debate over national priorities is the best news for democracy. since the defeat of Hitler's Germany. He fears that our conficts and our weakening powers of reconcil iation may tear us apart and lead to a world disaster. They may. The answer, however, is not patience with poverty and racism and submissive partici pation in our country's military oppression of foreign popula tions but hot demands and cold strategies for the speedy reduc tion of these evils. Preaching that national uni ty is our supreme need, as Lubell does and as Presidents usually do, too, comes too close to preaching mindless patriotism. We have had enough of that. Whether pollsters or Presidents agree or not, it is better to have disunity than to have injustice. In times like these we will be grateful for sound ideas to get our country working right again,‐but mere attitudes are not solutions, as. Samuel Lubell of all people should know.

954-> Chess:
No Player in Palma Event Could Be Taken for Granted Among the 24 men in the round‐robin tournament at Palma, Majorca, none could be taken for granted. Because they did not fear loss of prestige, the lower‐ranking masters fought with impunity and abandon, often speculat ing against a higher‐rated foe. On the other hand, favor ites often played too cautiously against the problematical dark horses. And they failed to gain a full point. Duncan Suttles of Canada, an inter national master, was on both sides of this issue. The Canadian's’ draw with Vasily Smyslov of the Soviet Union, a former world cham pion, was memorable. The finale of this double‐edged set‐to left the Russian happy to gain a perpetual check. Suttles, however, was taken over the hurdles by Renato Naranja of the Philippines, a lower‐ranking competitor: Though Black in a Sicilian defense, a debut in which the Canadian Is versatile, Naranja maneuvered craftily and saddled his antagonist. with a position devoid of mobility. The‐blocked pawns of Suttles thus interfered with any meaningful adtivity for his minor men. Black's grand strategy reached a climax with 31 ... N‐K6. The subsequent liquida tion promoted’ Naranja's attack into a mating net. Robert Huebner of West Germany, Black in a Nimzo Indian Defense, won from International Master William Addison of San Francisco at Palma when the American's can's kingside threat was cut down by an early trade of bishops with 16... BxB, etc. Hence, White's median pawns, deprived of mobility, were compromised. White suffered from lack of his bishop on either wing. To boot, the white rook was relegated to marking time, while Black promoted his positional edge. Finally, with 32 R‐R1 the rook became active. But Black's passed pawn and lively knight decided.

955-> ORR NETS 2 GOALS AND SETS UP THIRD
BLOOMINGTON, Minn., Feb. 21 (AP)—Bobby Orr scored two goals and set up another to night as the Boston Bruins de feated the Minnesota North Stars, 4‐2, and moved into a first‐place tie with the New York Rangers in the East Division. The game was the 17th in row for the North Stars with out a victory. Orr's three points increased his league‐leading total to 91. He has 24 goals. Orr scored his first goal in the opening period when he took a pass from Phil Esposito near center ice and eluded Tommy Williams to connect from 20 feet. His second goal came in the third period when the Bruins broke the game open after it had been tied 1‐1, after two periods. Orr took a pass from Garnet Bailey, who came in from the right wing after Wayne Cash man passed him the puck. Bailey set up Orr in front of the net and the Bruins' star put it in at 8:00 of the period to give Boston a 3‐1 lead. Ken Hodge had put the Bruins ahead, 2‐1, at 6:15 of the third period when he took a pass from Esposito and scored from about 10 feet. Orr got an assist when he passed to Derek Sanderson, who tallied from near center ice midway through the third pe riod. ?? MONTREAL, Feb. 21 (UPI)— Two goals and two assists by Yvan Cournoyer and a goal and three assists by Jean Beliveau tonight powered the Montreal Canadiens to a 5‐3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. Cournoyer scored twice in the opening period and assisted on two goals in the second pe riod as the‐ Canadiens snapped a three‐game losing streak in the National Hockey League. Beliveau shot his goal into an empty net with 18 seconds left in the game. ??

956-> Democrats: Now Is The Time For One Good Man
WASHINGTON — The tele phone calls poured into Lawr ence F. O'Brien's New York of fice last week—from reporters, Senators and former Vice Presi dent Hubert H. Humphrey. From Mr. Humphrey on down, the message was the same, if phrased more subtly by some than by others: Come back, we need you to save the party, there's no, one else, we're in trouble. By the end of the week, Mr. O'Brien was looking at a piece of paper on which he had doodled two words—“reassess, re‐evaluate.” The Democratic party's long ing for the return of Larry O'Brien as national chairman is an index to its lack of national leaders, its disorganization, its deep melancholy as it tries somehow to mount a counterat tack on the Republicans and that man in the White House. Mr. O'Brien left active poli tics a year ago, after having served since 1961 varioiusly as a White House aide, as Postmaster General, as campaign manager and as national chairman. He left because he felt the need to earn some money for himself and his family. He hoped that new managers and leaders and technicians would move into the breach. But they have not, so every one is clamoring for Mr. O'Brien to come back, and the chances are that ultimately he will. A few trial balloons have been floated, to no great effect. Rep resentative Charles A. Vanik of Ohio petitioned his colleagues to press for the election of Sar gent Shriver, the American Am bassador to France. Lester S. Hy man, a former Massachusetts Democratic state chairman, wrote a circular letter booming Joseph F. Crangle, the Erie County (Buffalo) Democratic leader. But the job description, as one powerful Democrat said the oth er day, keeps pointing back to Mr. O'Brien and no one else. The party's leaders think they need a man who (A) has no political ambitions of his own, (B) can raise money to help elim inate the Democrats' $8‐million debt, (C) knows the key politi cians in all parts of the country, (D) is an administrator. Senator Fred R. Harris's res ignation, after only one year in the job, came about largely be cause the young Oklahoman grew weary of sniping from both the right and the left and be cause he saw that the job was doing nothing for his own ca reer. But even if the Democrats do persuade Mr. O'Brien or someone else to take on the job, that will solve only one of their problems. They will still be in disarray, searching for issues and candi dates to unite the party—and to do battle with the Republicans in the 1970 Congressional elec tions and the 1972 Presidential contest. Where, for example, do the Democrats stand on the issues? The official answer was given by the declarations of the Dem ocratic Policy Council, a 76‐ member group headed by Mr. Humphrey. Despite the former Vice President's purported un happiness with the mildly lib eral tenor of Senator Harris's public pronouncements, the council went down the very same road. On Vietnam, the council with only slight circumlocution called for a total troop withdrawal within 18 months. It opposed the confirmation of G. Harrold Carswell for the Supreme Court and the further deployment of the Safeguard antiballistic mis sile system. It called for more spending on crime and pollution control. It was a traditional Demo cratic attack from the left on Republican incumbent, and it was about the only option avail able. The Democrats' quiescence in the face of President Nixon's political initiatives had produced nothing; it had produced, in fact, so blurred an image that fewer than half of the voters ques tioned last month by pollster Louis Harris were willing to call themselves Democrats. Nor had Mr. Nixon left any room on the right to allow the Democrats to reverse the long, slow slide of the South away from its historic allegiances. It is unlikely that the new chairman, whoever he is, will alter this ideological cast in any marked way. He is not likely to be able to provide much money for professional help for 1970 candidates. They will have to fend for themselves, with the help of labor money and advice from other organizations. The new chairman will have to focus on 1972, by continuing Mr. Harris's search for better staff members, by eliminating the debt so that a new cam paign treasury can be filled and by eradicating, somehow, the feeling of gloom and doom that has paralyzed the party. No one thinks it will be easy. —R. W. APPLE Jr.

957-> Books of The Times
No one who saw even photographs of the project is likely to have forgotten Ha bitat, the housing project at Montreal's Expo 67 that looked like shoeboxes stacked by a free‐form sculptor. But the name of Habitat's creator may not come so readily to mind. This is not as it should be, for Moshe Safdie is a genius; we should elect him Mayor of New York City, if not em peror of the world, tomorrow; and he has put together in his book “Beyond Habitat” the most interesting collection of ideas have come across since I first heard about the wheel. I hereby recommend his book to Robert Moses and his ‘spiritual heirs, readers of Better Homes and Gardens, riders of the Long Island Railroad, taxi drivers, residents of Stuyvesant Town, all New Yorkers, all Americans, all citizens of the world, and any warm body not in cluded in the foregoing list. BEYOND HABITAT. By Moshe Safdie. Edited by John Kettle. 244 pages. Illustrated. M.I.T. Press. $10. Actually, it isn”t a collection of ideas at all that Mr. Safdie offers up in “Beyond Habitat”; it”s a single perception radiating implications that are like spokes of light from a diamond. In 1967, the perception gave us Habitat, a happy solution to the problem of urban dwelling (according to the people living there today). A few years from now, Safdie”s perception may give us Utopia, if death and bureacracy, don”t get us first. Creation Seems Casual But now, having claimed all this, I find it next to impossible to describe this ex traordinary book. For though its creation seems to have been almost casual—it was edited from tape recordings, of a dialogue between the author and the editor—it will not cleave. It is a perfect imitation of Safdie”s life and thought: it proceeds at every point from that single, nearly inde finable perception; it develops organically; and every piece’ of it is attached to every other piece. So to offer an arm or a leg of it is to dismember the body and bleed it to death. All the same, I shall stab and carve. “Beyond Habitat” is an autobiography that recounts the first 38 years of its author”s life and brings him up to 1970. It tells how he spent his first 15 years in Israel before emigrating to Canada: how as a boy he studied the culture of bees, absorbed the communal spirit of a kibbutz, became im bued with Mediterranean architecture and its organic relationship to the land. How he studied architecture at McGill University, served his apprenticeship under Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, and broke away from him. How the idea for Habitat grew, out of his experience; how he sold it to Expo 67 and brought it into existence despite almost overwhelming, often in furiating, and sometimes amusing obsta cles. And it tells where he went from Habi tat: to projects in Washington, Manhattan, and San Francisco that were aborted by building codes, bureaucracies, and people who explained to him that they opposed “any extremes, good or bad.” And to proj ects in Puerto Rico and Israel that appear to be on their way to completion. “Beyond Habitat” is the autobiography’ of Safdie's ideas. How every project he has ever undertaken—from observing the geometry of beehives to planning a com munity for Arab refugees—has opened new vistas of his vision. “Beyond Habitat” is a bold attempt to redefine almost every aspect of architec ture‐the requirements of human living space, the form of buildings, the organiza tion of communities, the process of con struction, the role of, the architect, the function of interior decorating, the, nature of style, and even the process of creative thought. Series of Proposals “Beyond Habitat” is an attempt to re solve some of the profoundest conflicts of our century—between technological man and man in his natural state, be tween the need for community and the need for privacy, between city life and suburban life, between ghetto and gold coast, between form and function, and be tween mass production and individual consumption. “Beyond Habitat” is a series of modest and immodest proposals, outrageous and refreshing—that art as we tend to think of it is irrelevant, that the role of the architect is quickly dying, that Mies van der Rohe Was all wrong with his defi nition of the function that form follows, that people should be able to drive their cars into their kitchens, that interior deco rators are unnecessary, and—perhaps most outrageous of all—that the problems now crushing North America are soluble through rational thought. “Beyond Habitat” is Only 244 pages long (including 21 pages of excellent photo graphs). “Beyond Habitat” manages to be interesting on subjects that usually anes thetize the mind with the jab of a single sentence. Yet having said all this, I have still not come close to spelling out Moshe Safdie's central perception of the organic continuity between nature, man, the ideal city, and the future of the 20th century— the perception that was only dimly ap parent in that shoebox sculpture ‘at Expo 67. You will simply have to ‘remember Moshe Safdie's name and read his book. Model for Habitat Israel

961-> Evers Asks Whites To Aid the Growth Of South's Industry
Charles Evers, Mayor of Fayette, Miss., charged here last night that white business men had not done enough to locate industrial plants in the South and thereby provide more fobs for Negroes. Speaking at the annual din ner of the Interracial Council for Business Opportunity at the Americana Hotel, Mayor Evers asked his audience to “share some of the wealth...prac tice what you're preaching... you've got to help us help our selves.” In his address, Mr. Evers told the organization—which is de voted to the development of minority businesses—that cor porations must “make us feel wanted in industry. We only want a chance. Let's get to gether before it's too late.” Merck & Co., Inc., was hon ored by the council at the din ner for its work in developing black entrepreneurship. John H. Johnson, president of John son Publications, which pub lishes Ebony, Jet, Tan and Negro Digest magazines, was presented with the council's business achievement award for his success in creating one of the nation's major publish ing empires. Mr. Evers, the first Negro Mayor of a biracial town in Mississippi since Reconstruc tion, asserted that big business in the United States was “not being fair. Let's have some of the businesses down south in Mississippi, Georgia and Ala bama.” With more than a thousand people listening to his words, including representatives of some of the largest national corporations, the Fayette May or made a highly emotional presentation in his remarks. “If you don't change, America is going to be destroyed,” he said. “You have the balance of power.” The Interracial Council, founded in 1963 by the Urban League and the American Jew ish Congress, was created to help blacks and other minori ties start or expand their own business enterprises.

962-> U.S. AIDES DRIVING TEST CARS TO WORK
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16— The National Highway Safety Bureau confirmed reports today that some of its officials and engineers are testing cars sup plied by automobile manufac turers by driving them to and from work. Special to The New York Times Douglas W. Toms, director of the bureau, described the test ing as “a very small operation” ‘involving “like two or three Cars a week” that are leased from manufacturers at regular commercial rates. Mr. Toms answered ques tions prompted by a letter written to, John A. Volpe, Secretary of Transportation, by Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Democrat of Washington, chair man of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdic tion over auto safety legisla tion. Mr. Toms, who is preparing a report for the Senator, said that only 16 or 18 “top engineers and key adminis trtors” drove the cars. He said they occasionally took them home or on short business trips but were not permitted to transport members of their families. All of the cars, he said, are “of unusual engineer ing interest” and were leased for about a month at a time to test innovative safety equip ment or Components.

964-> Law
The most visible Southern strategy at work these days is not the Nixon Administration's alleged political appeal to Dixie, but Southern leaders' campaign to prove that the nation's integra tion laws discriminate against the South. They won an impressive vic tory last week when the Senate approved, by a 56 to 36 margin, the principle that school deseg regation guidelines “shall be ap plied uniformly in all regions of the United States . . . without regard to the origin or cause of such segregation.” This was quickly followed by actions on separate bills by the House and Senate designed to prohibit mandatory busing to re lieve racial imbalance. The bills forbid the Government to require communities to go beyond “free dom of choice” plans and to bus children as a condition of receiv ing Federal funds. Even Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi, who spearheaded the Southern offensive, could not predict what practical Im pact these measures will have, if they pass both Houses and President Nixon signs them into law. But in a city where fingers are perpetually wetted to the political winds, it was widely conceded that the Southern stategists had capitalized effec tively on their complaint that their communities are being subjected to a legal double standard that insists that the South eliminate classroom seg regation, while largely ignoring it in the North. The roots of this allegation reach back to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, in which the Supreme Court de clared unconstitutional the laws in 17 Southern and border states that segregated Negro and white children into separate school systems. This ruling was based upon the 14th Amendment's “equal protection” provision, which for bids states—but not individuals —to discriminate against Ne groes. Thus the Court held that any state that had created sep arate black and white school systems by law was in viola tion of the Constitution until it “disestablished” the dual sys tems. Lawyers have labeled this “de jure” segregation—meaning that it was created by law or other official action and must be un done. But in the North, where the flight of whites to the sub urbs left “de facto” segregation behind, Federal courts usually left the local school officials to their own devices, on the theory they had not violated the 14th amendment. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, giving the De partment of Health, Education and Welfare authority to cut off Federal aid to segregated school districts, H.E.W. adopted the same de jure‐de facto dis tinction. These legal distinctions re mained almost academic so long as the courts and H.E.W. were seeking only to break down le gal barriers against Negro en rollment in “white” schools barriers which did not exist in the North. But the seeds of a distinct double standard be tween the North and South were planted when H.E.W. and the Federal courts in the Deep South began to impose integra tion quotas on Southern dis tricts. Most of them had responded to the 1954 decision by adopting freedom of choice programs that let each child pick his own school. This placed the burden on Negroes to switch to white schools, and typically only a few did. Most communities were left with all‐black schools and light ly‐integrated schools, until af firmative steps began to be re quired. This received the blessing of the Supreme Court in June, 1968, when it held unanimously that it was not enough for Southern school districts to give all students free choice of schools, unless that was the best way to create “a system with out a ‘white’ school and a ‘Ne gro’ school, but just schools.” As a result, many Southern communities have been required to pair schools, redraw attend ance zones, and shift pupils and teachers around to achieve racial objectives. As Senator Stennis has delighted in pointing out, the North has its share of “white” schools and “black” schools, that look for all the world like their counterparts in the South, but rarely have Northern com munities been required to merge them. There are good arguments both for and against the “dou ble standard.” Because the South's all‐black schools were created by official acts, the courts are insisting that Southern officials must eliminate them. The Southerners reply, as former Mississippi Gov. J. P. Coleman—now a Fed eral appellate judge—argued in a dissent last week, that after a community makes a good faith effort it should be permit ted to “get back to educating children of all races in an at mosphere of learning.” The proposals arpproved by Congress last week are techni cally only half‐measures be cause they amend only H.E.W.'s power to cut off funds under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This leaves untouched the Su preme Court's desegregation doctrines. Furthermore. H.E.W. could conceivably interpret the uniformity amendment to re quire more integration in the North, with no let up in the South. But the Southern lawmakers are obviously convinced that the rest of the country would not stand for the same H.E.W. policies that have been applied to the South, and that if this results in a softening of H.E.W. guidelines for Southern schools, the Supreme Court would come under intense pressure to beat a similar retreat. So despite the fact that the Southern political resurgence has operated only on the funds cutoff authority, it has focused public attention on some trou blesome questions that have sur faced concerning the Supreme Court's desegregation doctrines. One is that the Court has never said what a Southern community must do to show that it has achieved a unitary school system and thus be re lieved of the obligation to elim inate racial imbalance that re sults from neighborhood pat terns. This has posed a painful di lemma for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over some Northern as well as Southern states. It has found it difficult to justify requiring af firmative desegregation steps in large Southern cities with de facto‐style segregation that is indistinguishable from that in the Northern cities in its circuit. Several years ago it ruled that school officials in Gary, Ind., and Cincinnati had no ob ligation to eliminate all ‐ black schools caused by neighborhood patterns. Recently it said the same about officials in Mem phis, declaring that they had created a “unitary” system and that the racial imbalance that persisted was due to resegrega tion as whites moved to the suburbs. The. Supreme Court has ac celerated the handling of the appeal by blacks of the Mem phis decision and may use the case to explore the problem of de facto segregation in the urban South. Another question Is whether the courts should insist on im mediate elimination of all all black schools in rural commu nities that have high percent ages of Negro students. It will be next fall before the bulk of these are integrated, but already there have beeen instances in which the whites have aban doned the public schools com pletely, turning districts that once had token but growing in tegration into all‐black systems, and raising the question of whether full integration should be demanded when it is likely to be counter‐productive. Finally, some observers are asking if integration efforts that cause such upheavals are wise. Prof. Alexander M. Bickel of the Yale Law School warned in a recent issue of “The New Republic” that “nothing seems to be gained, and much is risked or lost, by driving the process to the tipping point of reseg regation.” He called for a more flexible approach that would demand completion of the disestablish ment process in all of the school districts that have not yet abandoned dual systems, followed by a pragmatic inte gration policy that would place education first.

966-> Dartmouth's Lightweights Outrow Cornell First Time
ITHACA, N. Y., May 2— Dartmouth's varsity lightweight crew defeated Cornell by a length on Lake Cayuga today. It was the first victory for any Indian boat against the Big Red. The Indians opened at a 36 beat, with Cornell at 33 and neither crew could gain an ad vantage in the first 1,500 meters. In the last 500, with both at 37, Dartmouth pulled away. Dartmouth's time was 6:43.9, Cornell's 66:48.1. Cornell's junior varsity, split into two boats of fours with coxswain, edged Dartmouth when the Indians, then leading, caught a crab at 1,500 meters. The Big Red freshmen won by 4½ lengths.

967-> West Side Rent Strikers Lose Elevator Service
A group of tenants in a 12 story West Side apartment house who are on a rent strike charged yesterday that their landlord had denied them the use of the elevator. The rent strikers are pro testing the landlord's alleged plan to turn the building into, a cooperative. Under state law, 35 per cent of the tenants must agree be fore an apartment building can be converted to a cooperative. The building has 48 apart Iments. Mrs. Rebecca Shild, a member of the tenants’ asso ciation in the rent‐controlled building, which is at 120 West 86th Street, said 32 of the as sociation's 38 members had refused to pay their rent for December. Mrs. Shild charged that the landlord had been harassing the tenants since last March when, she said, he started to convert the building into a co operative. Mrs. Shild also said that the landlord, Arthur David Green berg, a 39‐year‐old photog rapher, had turned off the heat in the building and that the tenants faced a frigid weekend. Mr. Greenberg, who lives in the building and who describes himself as a society photog rapher, charged in return that the tenants’ association was harassing him and was “en gaged in an illegal rent strike.” Mr. Greenberg said that the building's passenger elevator was not operating because of “malicious mischief” by some tenants. “But,” he added, “any body who pays their rent can ride up in the service elevator.” Mr. Greenberg also denied that he had turned the heat off in the building, but said he had been forced to ration the avail able fuel oil because he did not have the money to pay the oil company. “When the tenants pay their rent,” he said, “we'll get more oil.” Mr. Greenberg also denied that he had decided to turn the building into a cooperative He said: “I saved my money for 20 years and bought this apart ment house on June 10, 1969. I'm not an absentee landlord. have in, apartment right in this building and am available for the tenants to see me every day. “I have offered to meet with them to discuss their differ ences, but they have refused.”

968-> Vietnam's ‘Korean Solution’
By withdrawing 65,000 American troops in his first year in office and promising to remove another 50,000 by April 15, President Nixon has defused the Vietnam debate in the United States. Although neither the debate nor the war has ended, the shape of the argu ment has been considerably altered. This change is reflected in the call issued by the Democratic Policy Council for removal of all American forces in eighteen months. Defense Secretary Laird visited Saigon for the stated purpose of seeking ways to step up troop withdrawals above 12,000 a month. As the recent hearings of the Senate Foreign Rela tions Committee showed, it is now generally assumed that the Administration does indeed intend to disen gage from Vietnam. But large questions remain: Can American disengagement continue irrespective of what happens on the ground in South Vietnam? Mr. Laird's assurances are not convincing. In any case is it the President's intention to leave a substantial American force in the country for the indefinite future? The Administration undoubtedly hopes that South Vietnamese strength or Communist forbearance or both will permit, before the 1972 American Presidential election, a reduction of United States air artillery and logistic support troops and their combat protection to a “residual force.” Estimates of the residual force needed—and accepable to American opinion—have ranged all the way from 30,000 to 150,000 men. * * * The critical issue between President Nixon and the critics of “Vietnamization” is the concept behind the residual force. Without such a force, some Adminis tration leaders argue, Saigon could not stand against the Communists but, with a residual force of adequate size and duration, the Thieu regime could resist both the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese for many years. This is the concept that has become known as the “Korean solution” for South Vietnam. Senator Hugh Scott, the Republican minority leader, has noted that the American people still accept the presence of 50,000 United States troops in South Korea seventeen years after the end of the Korean War. If a continuing American military presence proved necessary in South Vietnam, the good judgment of the American people would “surmount the hysteria of a limited number of critics,” Mr. Scott predicted. However, there are many fundamental differences between Korea and Vietnam, apart from South Korea's governmental and military strength. In Korea there has been a negotiated settlement; there is a cease‐fire, even if it is occasionally violated; a single, easily defended line divides North and South across a narrow peninsula; South Korea is at peace, free of internal guerrillas; the two American divisions there rarely suffer casualties. The reverse of all this prevails in South Vietnam. But, even if these factors were to be ignored, what is fundamentally unrealistic with the “Korean solu tion” for South Vietnam is that it aims at achieving, with much smaller American forces, the kind of vic tory for the Saigon regime that a half‐million American troops have not been able to obtain. Once the limit of American, withdrawal has been reached, Hanoi will have every incentive to attack. Saigon's position— from the point of view either of military resistance of negotiation—will then be far weaker than it is now. * * * The Nixon Administration rightly rejects the Demo cratic proposal to fix a date for unilateral American withdrawal, arguing that to do so would leave no incentive for Hanoi to negotiate a settlement. But the incentive will be no greater once American forces are largely gone. Where the Democrats are right is in urging an effort to revitalize the Paris peace conference. The first need is to appoint a high‐level American negotiator to probe Hanoi's recent hints of a new opening. Washington's downgrading of the talks has merely served to provoke reciprocal downgrading by North Vietnam. Another approach would be to propose negotiation of a standstill cease‐fire and Vietcong participation in a mixed electoral commission. If the aim is negotiation from strength, there will never be a better time. Yet the Administration seems hobbled to the increas ingly intransigent position of the Saigon Government, which in turn is relying on the continued support of American troops. This is a vicious circle which must be broken if the President's Vietnamization policy is to have real meaning—and if a “Korean solution” or worse is not to come about through default.

969-> Which Is the Burma Road— Ne Win or U Nu?
IGH in the green, jungle‐cov ered mountains of Southeast Asia, in the wild, all but im penetrable country on the frontier between Thailand and Burma, there are bands of armed men in rebellion against the Government in Rangoon. They live in remote camps; to reach them you must hike upwards for hour upon hour, or ride the ragged, sure footed Chinese ponies of the hills. An invitation is necessary, for there is no law to protect you in these regions. The woods are so thick you cannot even see the man who has you in the sights of his carbine. These are not the Communist in surgents who cause so much con sternation among Southeast Asian governments and Defense Department planners. They are the Karen Nation al Defense Force, the Kachin Inde pendence Army, the Shan State Army and the other disparate and loosely organized ethnic minorities of the Union of Burma—some of whom have been in rebellion for 20 years. They are armed with a motley assortment of carbines, Mil's and old British rifles left over from World War U. They are dressed in the cast off and black‐marketed uniforms of half a dozen armies. Many are little more than war‐lord armies now, and to many smuggling—especially the rich opium that grows in Northern Burma—has become more important than freedom‐fighting. In the chill air of a mountain eve ning recently, one of these rebel lead ers told me of his long struggle. “I used to tell my men about Biafra to keep their spirits up,” he said, “but I cannot tell them about Biafra now. Conditions in Burma have never been worse, but nobody outside cares. Maybe they don't even know.” URMA reaches from the tropical waters of the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal all the way up to where India and China meet in the snow‐capped foothills of the Hima layas. It is a strategic corner of Asia, bordering as it does on India, Paki stan, China, Laos and Thailand. But the rebel commander was right. Out siders know less about Burma and its 27 million people than about any other non‐Communist country in the Far East. For in the eight years since Gen. Ne Win seized power in a coup that deposed Premier U Nu, Burma has become increasingly xenophobic, cutting itself off from East and West alike in order to follow the “Burmese Way to Socialism.” All foreign businesses and founda tions have long since been kicked out, and diplomats are severely restricted, not only in their travel, but in their day‐to‐day contacts with Burmese of ficials as well. The United States enjoys cordial diplomatic relations with Burma, but Ne Win's policies have kept America's profile very low and it is getting lower all the time. “The best foreign diplomats can ex pect,” a Burmese said recently, “is to shake the tips of Ne Win's fingers once or twice a year.” In the hilly marches of his country, especially along the wild, thousand mile frontier with China, not even Ne Win knows what is going on. For a time, in the mid‐sixties, a movement known as “White Flag” Communists seemed to be a threat. Then came a rival “Red Flag” insurgency. Both were crushed. Now there is a worri some Chinese‐supported Communist rebellion led by one Naw Seng, operating in the Shan states, one of the world's richest opium ‐ growing areas, along the route of the World War II Burma Road. His men number in the few thousands (it is impossible to tell how many are Chinese and how many Burmese), but last year Ne Win admitted to no fewer than eight major clashes with at least 300 Government casualties. Similar clashes have occured this year. On March 28, for example, the Burmese Government announced that its troops had abandoned the border town of Kyuhkok in the northern Shan states after a Communist attack. The announcement said that Govern ment troops had not thrown every thing they bad into the battle for fear of hurting Sino‐Burmese relations. It seems a strange announcement, but keeping good relations with China is a cornerstone of Burmese policy. Every small country on the rim of China has its cliché comparing its smallness with China's bigness. In Burma, people say that if 700 million Chinese urinated at the same time, all of Burma would be washed into the Bay of Bengal. Sino‐Burmese relations reached low point in 1967, when there were serious anti‐Chinese riots in Ran goon. But although ambassadors were recalled, both countries maintain diplomatic relations. Ne Win has said that he knows the Chi nese are helping the Commu nist insurgents, but he has also confessed that there is not much he can do about it. Although he has not kowtowed to the Chinese, his position is that he would like to “restore the cordial and friendly rela tions which formerly prevailed between our two countries.” Aside from the Communist border problem, there is a constant, bewildering mélange of ethnic revolts. Since Burma gained its independence in 1948, no Burmese Government has had effective control of the entire country. In the re gions where Merrill's Ma rauders and the Chindits op erated against the Japanese a quarter of a century ago, faction‐ridden and squabbling rebel armies now hold sway. Some have made their accom modations with the Commu nists, but most have not. Under Ne Win's “Burmese Way to Socialism,” Burma's wealth and standard of living have steadily declined. For eight years, Burma has gone its own way in squalid isola tion, and what was once one of the richest countries in Southeast Asia has now be come a slum. But last year, U Nu managed to flee the country. He faked six public fainting spells, “the Govern ment became convinced I had brain trouble,” as he says, and he was given permission to seek medical attention abroad. Instead, he went on a world tour—including a stopover at the U.N.—to drum up support for a rebellion against Ne Win. Still by all odds the most popular figure in Burmese politics, he is now established in Bangkok, actively plotting the downfall of the regime. U Nu hopes to harness all the resentment that has built up against Ne Win over the years, not only among the rebel com manders but among key people within the Government as**well. “THE Burmese Way to So cialism,” as a doctrine, is a curious attempt to fit Marxism under a Buddhist parasol. In theory, it takes into account the Buddhist belief that all things are transient, and it at tempts to transfer the concept of making merit for personal religiosity to the public good. In an attempt to explain the philosophy of Ne Win's Burma Socialist Programme party (B.S.P.P.), now the only legal party in Burma, a Government pamphlet compares the “Burmese Way to Socialism” with Communism by saying: “A Communist party believes that the history of human society shows constant advancement towards a classless society in which the state has withered away. ... The B.S.P.P. holds the belief that the material world and the society of man are in a state of constant flux, appearing and disappearing, rising and falling, waxing and waning, dying and being born anew, always in the grip of a ceaseless change. However, it is also believed that the lot of man in his society can and must be improved by his work ing together with fellow men.” In its almost complete na tionalization of industry and trade, as well as the state ownership of the means of production and distribution, Burmese Socialism can best be compared with Eastern Euro pean Socialism. But the Bur mese system is so monument ally inefficient, and the results have been so economically disastrous, that Eastern Eu ropean diplomats in Rangoon complain that Ne Win is giving Socialism a bad name. Rangoon is now the dingiest capital in Southeast Asia. Flocks of crows fly through the streets and curs fight over bits of rice left out for them by devout Buddhists. There are no new buildings to be seen, and the town is crum bling and decayed. All along the streets, shop after shop is closed and boarded up. Al most everything has been nationalized and only the Government‐owned “Peoples Stores” are in business. But even in the Government stores commodities are unobtain able. In the early morning, long before the sun has set Ran goozi's golden pagodas aglow, long lines of people gather in the predawn darkness, ration cards in hand, waiting for the Government shops to open. They know that within a few minutes after opening time the shelves will be bare. Officially, the Burmese are allowed only enough cloth to make one lungi, the tradi tional Burmese sarong which both men and women wear, per year, Rangoon residents told me. They are allowed only enough cloth for one shirt per year as well. Con sequently, everybody in Ran goon either buys or sells on the black market. The smug gling across the Thai border is the only thing that keeps the people dressed. So inefficient is the Govern ment's distribution system that a local joke in Rangoon, where rainfall averages 100 inches a year, is that if water were nationalized there would soon be a drought. One of the least popular men in Burma is the Minister of Trade and Commodity Distribution. Wher ever he goes in the capital, a truckload of troops follows close behind his black Mer cedes. One senses an air of de spondency in the streets of Rangoon. Tens of thousands of Chinese and Indians, who used to run much of the com merce in the capital, have been forcibly deported. “They won't even let us take a wedding ring with us,” a young Chinese woman whis pered nervously, “but we are going anyway. It is the same with the Indians. At the docks you will see them being crowded on the ships. They must leave everything behind. Even their rings are torn from their noses.” Burma used to be the fore most exporter of rice in the world. But since 1962, rice ex ports have dropped from 1.8 million tons to less than half million tons a year. “There is no incentive for the farmers to grow rice for export any more,” a Burmese explained. “So they often just grow enough for themselves and perhaps a little for the black market. We are all supposed to be happy with nothing be cause we are no longer being exploited by the capitalist class. But wages have stayed the same since Ne Win took over and prices have risen fivefold.” There is a sense of lethargy and political apathy throughout Burma, however. Burma is blessed by its climate and, as one political observer put it: “As long as there is no starvation there will be no spontaneous uprising against Ne Win.” A LONG with the Burmese Way to Socialism came all the trappings of a police state— midnight arrests, imprison ment without trial, a con trolled press. The Military In telligence Service (M.I.S.) be came a minature M.V.D. But today almost all of Ne Win's political prisoners, ex cept for the Communists, have been released and Burma is more relaxed than it was a few years ago. The press still exhorts the masses in the best Marxist tradition. “The sugar cane farmers did not make over all their produce to the mills but diverted some to manufacture molasses, as the price ... was good,” said scolding editorial in The Work ing People's Daily. “They should be gently brought over to the right path.” M.I.S. agents still follow people about in Rangoon, but the Burmese lack of efficiency may have saved the country from the excesses of better organized police states. One former political prisoner said he was tailed by M.I.S. men for several weeks before he was finally arrested. He was not supposed to know he was under surveillance, but one afternoon the M.I.S. men came up to him and said: “Uncle [the polite form of address in Burma], there is a wonderful film playing in town tonight. Wouldn't you like to see it?” The suspect had no desire to go to the movies, but he went to be obliging, and the two M.I.S. men sat happily in the row behind him enjoying the show while still on the job. IT is hard to imagine two more different antagonists than U Nu and Ne Win. They knew each other before the war, when both were young, anticolonialist revolutionaries. U Nu came to power just before independence, after Burma's great resistance hero, Aung San, was assassinated along with most of his minis ters in a coup attempt by a disappointed and ambitious politician named U Saw. U Nu proved to be anything but an able administrator, and he failed to solve the problem of how much autonomy to give the ethnic states, the near lethal gene that independent Burma was born with. By 1958, his party was badly split and the Union of Burma seemed on the brink of dis solution. U Nu stepped down and Ne Win, who was by that time Chief of Staff, was asked to form a caretaker Govern ment. By 1960, conditions had so improved that a general elec tion, was held. Ne Win, prefer ring to stay aloof from the politicians he so despised, did not run for office. U Nu was returned by a large majority. Once the military had tasted power, however, they were no longer content to sit by and watch the civilians botch things up again. In 1962, Ne Win seized power in a lightning coup and locked up everybody who could possibly be con sidered in opposition. There can be no doubt that U Nu's style was anathema to the military mind. U Nu is a devout Buddhist ascetic who has often taken to the wearing of the saffron robes of a Buddhist monk. When the insurgents were at the gates of Rangoon in the late nine‐ teen‐forties, U Nu, at the age of 41, took a vow of chastity which he has kept ever since. The principles and the moral authority of Buddhism have always been the motor behind U Nu's politics. They stood him in good stead on the international scene, when he was dealing with John Foster Dulles and Chou En‐lai, but they were somewhat less ef fective in the day‐to‐day run ning of the country. His aides used to complain that when ever there was a crisis U Nu would go off to a Buddhist monastery to meditate, when, as one of his supporters put it, “he should have been kick ing bottoms in Rangoon.” The differences between U Nu and Ne Win run deep. Ne Win is an almost pathological ly suspicious man. He has an obsessive fear of assassina tion and hates to spend two successive nights in the same room. When he plays golf on weekends, a full battalion of troops is detailed to cordon off the course and the roads leading to it. U Nu, on the other hand, used to get in a car and drive out to the coun try unescorted, when he was Premier, to spend the after noon sitting under a tree friend. Ne Win is known for his fierce and sudden rages. He has been known to show his displeasure by beating up his subordinates in public. Once, while playing golf, he beat a man half to death with a golf club. His enemies are fond of saying that his unstable tem per is a sign of onrushing insanity. They point to the fact that he used to visit a psychiatrist in Vienna at least once a year. But even his enemies con cede that Ne Win is a very shrewd and cunning politi cian, and he has proved his ability to manipulate power. He thinks of himself as the “Bogyoke”—the great general who in Burmese history was traditionally tough, erratic, ruthless and unpredictable. The Bogyoke of the ancient Burmese kings always knew how to strike terror into the hearts of his subordinates as well as his enemies, and so does Ne Win. After taking over, Ne Win moved quickly to consolidate his power. He jailed nearly 2,000 people without trial. When students demonstrated against him, Ne Win's troops opened fire and killed at least two score and wounded many more. To drive the point home, Ne Win had the student union of the University of Rangoon blown up. One of U Nu's last acts as Premier had been to make Buddhism the state religion, thus restoring a thousand year‐old tradition that was broken by the British in 1885. But although it pleased the Burman majority (about 85 per cent of the country is Buddhist), many of the hill tribes are Christian and they saw the move as yet another step toward domination by the lowlanders. Although Ne Win is nominally a Buddhist him self, he did not believe in sharing his power and one of his first acts was to disestab lish Buddhism. In 1965, he moved cautiously to break the power and influence of the sangha, the Buddhist monkhood, which he saw as a potential threat to his rule. He said he would “end the improper activities of some members of the sangha who have worked hand in glove with political organizations and politicians... .” Angry monks in Mandalay declared that even if the Government should arrest 100 monks, 200 more would rise to take their places in protest. The Gov ernment promptly arrested more than 100, and no one to take their places. ESPITE the considerable evidence of Ne Win's strength, everyone who talks to U Nu these days is surprised by his total confidence that his cam paign to unseat Ne Win will be successful. U Nu lives in a white, Florida‐style villa in a section of Bangkok that is often called the American Ghetto. The rent is paid by his supporters. An American couple live next door and their blond ‐ haired children peep out the gate as a pro cession of Burmese exiles come to bow and touch their palms together in the tradi tional Buddhist greeting to the great man. He wears a lungi and around his head is tied a bit of cloth — the traditional gaungbaung. He speaks in a calm, quiet voice and his fol lowers lean forward a bit to catch his words. He is friend ly, not at all austere; the im pression is that you are meet ing an abbot rather than an exiled politician who has called for the overthrow of his country's Government. He seems relaxed, totally at peace with himself. One is reminded of the British historian Hugh Tinker's description of U Nu and his ilk: “Enlightened Buddhist leaders ... men with unlined brows, calm eyes and humorous mouths who have been enabled to pick their way through a jungle of in soluble problems and threats of disaster with minds un clouded by doubt and de spondency.” One can appreci ate the feelings of his aides who, when U Nu was in pow er, might have wanted him to show a little more doubt and despondency. U Nu's aim, he says, is “to turn Burma from a dic tatorship into a parliamentary democracy. That is our most important goal: If we could make but one change that would be it.” As for his own role, U Nu sees himself as a rallying point for opposition to Ne Win, but were he re turned to power he would hold an election and step down as soon as possible in favor of “younger men.” Once a parliamentary system is re stored, “Burma's economic policies must be changed,” he says. Even his own, milder form of socialism imposed too many controls on the econ omy, he now feels. “Except for a few key industries, the rest should enjoy the fullest measure of freedom,” he says. To many, it seems strange that such a devout Buddhist would have advocated vio lence and bloodshed even as a last resort to overthrow Ne Win. As one Western diplo mat in Rangoon said: “The Burmese don't advocate vio lence even when they are committing it.” U Nu's an swer is: “We are prepared to shed blood for Burma, but as Buddhists we cannot ex cuse it. We know that it is evil and we know we will have to pay for it. We believe in the afterlife, you know.” In other words, U Nu is will ing to run the risk of being reincarnated lesser be ing—perhaps a frog or a car rion crow—for the sake of his people. His friends assured me later, however, that U Nu had made so much merit al ready in his 63 years as U Nu that things looked pretty good for him in the next life. HAT are U Nu's chances of success? His lieutenants have worked out a scenario. First, U Nu's exiles begin ra dio propaganda broadcasts beamed at Burma from Thai land. “We will begin to com bine and coordinate our ac tivities inside and outside Bur ma,” says one of U Nu's chief lieutenants, Bo Letya, a for mer Defense Minister. Second, U Nu's forces will try to form a united front with the vari ous rebel groups. U Nu knows that he has a great mass following among the people, but he also knows the political apathy in Burma. Therefore, he is counting heavily on the students, and even more on the sangha, to help galvanize the masses into action. As for the army, U Nu's lieutenants admit that Ne Win probably has the top brass in his pocket, “but many of the majors and captains are sitting on the fence,” Bo Letya said. According to the scenario, rising civil disorder and agi tation on the part of the monks and students, support ed finally by coordinated armed uprisings throughout the country, will drive Ne Win to the wall. He will have to use troops to quell the dis order. If, at that time, units begin to desert, it will have a snowball effect and Ne Win will be beaten. U Nu does not expect Ne Win to fight to the end. He and his followers ex pect Ne Win to pull a Batista and fly away to exile in the Boeing 727 which the Union of Burma Airways now rents at great financial loss from Northwest Orient Air lines. U Nu already has his radio transmitters, smuggled in through Thailand, ready to begin transmission on the Burma border. In Rangoon and Mandalay, people are already twisting their radio dials in the hope of picking up the first broadcasts. U Nu's forces were encour aged by last December's stu dent riots in Rangoon when students marched through the streets chanting anti‐Govern ment slogans andburiing cars. U Nu's agents have been pass ing out pamphlets and the Government has seen fit to organize anti ‐ U Nu demon strations as a counterploy. But for all U Nu's optimism it will not be easy to topple Ne Win. U Nu's forces are desperately short of funds, and although there are more guns and ammunition to be bought on the black market these days than ever before— a product of Vietnamization —they still cost money to buy. “If U Nu had 2,000 men under arms, he would be in Ran goon within a year,” a sym pathetic rebel leader told me, “but where are we going to get the money?” Second, U Nu is finding it difficult to create a united front among the Karens, Shans, Kachin and other groups which operate back and forth across the Burma Thai border. He can promise them more autonomy, but some of them want complete independence and that would mean the dissolution of the Union of Burma. Third, although the Buddhist monkhood, the sangha, is a source of great influence in Burma, and therefore a poten tial source of trouble for Ne Win, it is not at all clear that U Nu will be able to unite the sangha in his cause. The sangha has been most pacific since the crackdown in 1965, and despite the student dem onstrations last December, the student movement shows lit tle potential for organized po litical action anymore. The key to all U Nu's schemes, and the ultimate source of Ne Win's power, is the army. U Nu might be able to win some of the units over to his side, and perhaps some elements of the navy and air force. But the army is a priv ileged class in Burma under the present regime and would have much to lose were U Nu to return to power. At pres ent, Ne Win's control over his 100‐battalion army seems secure enough. One necessary element in U Nu's plan is the continuing goodwill of the Thai Govern ment. Although nominally maintaining friendly relations with Burma, the Thais have turned a Nelsonian blind eye on U Nu's maneuvers. U Nu tries his best to be discreet. Last November, however, Dep uty Premier Gen. Prophas Cha rusathien, who is also Minis ter of the Interior and easily the most powerful man in Thailand, invited U Nu and all the rebel commanders to get together in the general's own house in Bangkok to dis cuss their plans. Curious be havior indeed for a country that professes friendly rela tions with Burma, and the Burmese have already com plained to the Thai Ambassa dor. But then it is an old Southeast Asian custom to make trouble for your neigh bors. For years the Thais actively supported a right wing rebel group against Cam bodia on their other border. VERYONE in Burma agrees that Ne Win's regime is unpopular. There have been gross mismanagement and corruption and it is hard for the average Burmese to see the present sorry state of the economy as a necessary step on the road to true socialism. It is almost universally agreed that if there were an election in Burma tomorrow U Nu would win hands down. “But there isn't going to he an election tomorrow,” a Bur mese pointed out, “and right now everything depends on who controls the army.” U Nu is much too important a figure in Burmese politics to be dismissed out of hand. But at present he lacks the means or the necessary power base from which to launch a successful rebellion against Ne Win. Should Ne Win stumble—and there are con stant rumors that he has had a heart attack or that he is about to take his family into exile—then his successors might well call upon U Nu to rally the people. But at the moment Ne Win has the pow er to do more or less with Burma what he will. As one Western diplomat in Rangoon said recently: “Ne Win may leave feet first some day, but U Nu had better not count on his flying away when the first shot is fired.” ■

970-> Dot took her fun where she found it
A fine novel is a dangerous thing. It makes one impatient with all the talk, however gen uine, about the crisis of con fidence, the crisis of language, the crisis of character. It makes one realize that the novel's most traditional elements, the telling of the tale, the limning of character, the classic social settings and their attendant at mosphere, the unavoidable and so‐often‐boring sex scenes can be revolutionized when they are communicated in a lan guage that is just right, a lan guage that both describes and transcends these elements. Why dangerous? Because when it comes along—as it has in Paul West's new novel—it looks so easy that one feels like blaming all the other novelists who don't wait until their material has found its right language: The first thing you notice when reading “I'm Expecting to Live Quite Soon,” though, will probably not be language. It will be Dot Daggers, “heavy legged, tall and auburn‐haired,” a Midlands housewife in the town of Shalethorpe. When you meet her, at the opening of the novel, she would seem to be finished. Her husband, Alley Jaggers (who was the title character of West's previous book) is in jail for a murder he committed but did not in tend. Her father is in the old home at Ollerton. About that language, here's a sample: “Through the smeared office window up by the main door, the duty nurse sees first the pastry‐pale face alien to sun light ... then, as Dot closes the distance, her wide, volup tuous mouth downturned as if gritting on a sour thought ... and, finally, the eyes ... gleaming like silver, like fisher men's lures.” Eyes lure—and the downturned mouth is voluptuous: these are clues that pay off in some of the freshest, strangest sexuality you'll find in recent novels ... for Dot, you see is not just filling in time for Alley by living with his obstreperous Mam and their dachshund. She's finding her self via the least obvious soul and‐body search imaginable. The search leads her into the embraces of the Armpit Man, and of a black man named Jim smith Williams. The journey leads her not merely into new sensual knowledge but into new areas of compassion. Hemmed in by her milieu, with all its gossip and small mindedness (just as her Alley is held by his jail). Dot goes from the kind of drudge who “if there was ever a job in the zoo—brushing wolves' teeth or wiping zebra's backsides— it'd be me ...” to a blooming woman and mother of baby Hopalong. The sequence in which she becomes impreg nated by Alley in the course of a prison visit is hilarious, strange and almost unbeliev able. But the desperation which infects both of them is treated with such comic tenderness that one, finally, believes it all. There is an embarrassment of riches here. If anything, small details are treated too handsomely and the book could have been, I believe, shorter and better without some of them. But cancel the cavils and listen as Dot, still a prison widow but now a mother‐wo man in her own right, flees (only to be brought back by her father's exit from the Home in a coffin): “Tall, flushed and streaming from the nose, she obliviously accepts the offer of a ride southward, bouncing on the seat high above the road and flinching as moths hit the wind shield. Behind her is a ton of linoleum in rolls, before her the dales: ravines of green grassed quiet, the green un tarred by smoke, the rivers un scummed and flowing ... the birds paradisal‐technicolored and pecking ... on the trees, the stone walls—dividing field from field—clean enough to eat off if you can find a flat piece, the winds warm, the frosts be nign, the sheep wise, the pigs house‐proud, the dogs tongued like bells, the fowls infallible layers, the cream self‐whipping, the very soil aching to be plant ed.... Even the mice are proud. She exults with the names of the dales as the truck jolts along: Maunsel, Darley, Miller, Dove; let them find us if they can. Let them try! She travels on, her mind daylit in the darkness.” “I'm Expecting to Live Quite Soon” lives at once by the grace of the extraordinary gifts of its author. ■

971-> A:
ANTHONY W. SHIPPS, Bloomington, Ind., writes: “The passage quoted in Ed mund Pendleton's letter to James Madison and queried by A.L.H. on March 29 comes from a metrical version of Psalm XI included in a work first published in 1696, ‘A New Version of the Psalms of David, Fitted to the Tunes Used in Churches,’ by Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady.” JANIS TOWNSEND, Detroit, has iden tified the passage by Emerson about which L.B. inquired on April 5. It appears in the first paragraph of the first section of “Nature,” published in 1836, Emer son's first book. The pertinent paragraph follows: “To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual Presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many gener ations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admon ishing smile.” William Martin, West Seneca,. N Y.; Seth J. Kaplan, New York; Barbara Harte, Detroit, and Richard Cronin, Fresh Mea dows, N. Y., are among readers who provided this answer.

The communiqué stirred more interest here for what it did not say than for what it did say. It was presumed that discus sions in Moscow covered the response to be given to the United States proposal for the resumption of peace negotia tions and the nature of tary and economic aid to be accorded Egypt in coming months. The communiqué did not directly refer to either of these matters, it was observed. It was also noted that while the communiqué affirmed the broad position of the two par ties on the conflict, there was no intensification of threats and no suggestion of early of fensive action.

973-> When is a canal not a canal?; Vinh Long
Vinh Long is a province in the central delta of South Vietnam. It is bisected, north to south, by the Mangthit Canal, which links the Mekong and Bassac Rivers, the two major delta waterways. This book tells of the failure of a two‐and‐a‐half year campaign to clear the Viet Cong from the banks of the canal so as to reopen it to barges carrying rice to Saigon. The Mangthit project, as the author describes it, was one of what must be by now hundreds of similar examples of Ameri can power blindly seeking a place to apply itself in Viet nam—a locomotive without an engineer, off the track, spin ning its wheels and tooting wildly before sinking out of sight in the mud of the paddy fields. What we have not had until now, so far as I know, has been a book that describes such an undertaking in detail. For this reason, despite some indifferent writing and chaotic organiza tion, “Vinh Long” is a valu able contribution to our under standing of what is taking place in Vietnam. The Mangthit project had its beginnings in July, 1966, in the office of Deputy Ambassador William J. Porter in Saigon. It was a time when American troops were flooding into the country to fight the main‐force war and the punitive bombing of North Vietnam was getting heavier every day. However, “pacification”—that is, the de struction of the Vietcong as a political force — which was Porter's particular responsibil ity, was then, as now, making little headway. The subject that day, as Har vey Meyerson, a former Chica go Daily News correspondent who went to Vietnam as a free lance, tells it, was rice. Enor mous sections of the delta, the country's rice bowl, were con trolled by the Vietcong or had become a no‐man's land. As a result, South Vietnam, ordinar ily an exporter of rice, was requiring annual imports of about 750,000 tons, which, of course, the United States had to pay for. An expert on the rice situ ation, briefing Porter (who is now the Ambassador to South Korea), pointed out that since 1963, when the Vietcong be gan setting up ambushes along the canal, rice barges from the southern half of the delta had been forced to swing west on the Bassac to a natural cross ing with the Mekong, about 20 miles from the Cambodian bor der. This detour of 65 miles took about two and a half days. The expert also suggested that it probably led to the smuggling of Vietnamese rice into Cambodia, where the price was higher. Somewhere in the room a figurative bulb lighted over someone's head. Before the meeting broke up it was decided to try to reopen the canal. The Mangthit project now be gan its own slow progress through the narrow, tangled channels of the American mili tary and civilian bureaucra cies. In November, a Rand Cor poration study put the reopen ing of the canal at the top of its priority list. But, as Meyer son tells it, Rand was only tell ing Porter's office what it want ed to hear, having done noth ing to test the underlying as sumptions—that rice was piling up in delta mills for lack of barges or that it was being diverted to Cambodia. NO matter. Mangthit had a heavy, serious, politico‐eco nomic sound to it. (I can hear the rice man saying, “Mr. Am bassador, these people will belong to whoever's feeding them.”) Robert Komer, the former Central Intelligence Agency official who was the White House advisor on pacif ication and was soon to replace Porter, got behind the project with hid customary enthusiasm. It soon became known in Sai gon as “Komer's Kanal.” General Westmoreland for mally approved the project and it then became time to inform the Vietnamese, who were, after all, going to have to carry it out. Corps and division commanders and province chiefs were summoned to a meeting in Saigon in Decem ber. They were apparently less than enthusiastic, but steady pressure brought them around. Two battalions and several militia units were assigned to the campaign, which was to be gin the following month. Corrupt and politically back ward as they may be, I can't help feeling a certain sympathy for Vietnamese military and civilian officials who have and civilian officials who have had to deal with such schemes for 15 years now. Their natural tendency has been to seek in an unofficial way accommoda tions with the Vietcong, usu ally for selfish reasons, it is true. Nevertheless, expert ob servers such as Robert Shap len believe that these ar rangements at the local level ought to be encouraged as demonstrating an eventual com promise solution to the war. One positive result of the du bious program of “Viet namization” may be that the contending factions will find such a compromise solution, al though it is certain to be a more difficult process than it would have been five or ten years ago. Not surprisingly, it was two months before the Vietnam ese troops showed up, in Feb ruary, 1968. By then, Meyerson says, the Vietcong's 206th Bat talion had already moved into position near the canal, having learned of the project while it was in the top‐secret plan ning stage. The Vietnamese troops remained close to their strong points, and when a clash finally occurred, on March 26, it was the Vietcong who did the attacking. This engagement is described vividly and at length by Meyerson. Saigon hailed it as a great victory, since the insurgents broke off the fighting and left behind 142 bodies—apparently an accurate count for a change. What Saigon didn't mention was that the Vietcong had stood off four Government battalions heavily supported by air strikes and artillery, in broad day light and shot down three American helicopters. One opening date for the canal was missed in July, and When Premier Ky officiated at ceremonies the following month a firefight was raging less than a mile away. It appears that few barges actually used the canal in the following months, and then the Tet offensive, during which Vietcong troops occupied sections of the prov ince capital for nearly a week, led to its closing again. In Aug ust, 1968, the canal was re opened. Five days later a Viet namese Navy flotilla was am bushed from its banks, losing 8 men killed and 54 wounded. On Meyerson's final visit to Vinh Long, in December, 1968, the canal was no longer being used. ■

974-> More Unemployed
Signs that the Nixon Adminis tration's effort to slow the econ omy was meeting with some success turned up last week in the form of the biggest monthly increase in unemployment figures in nearly a decade. The figures for January showed 3.9 per cent of the labor force, or 3.4 million workers, were un employed, compared with 3.4 per cent in December. This was still far below the rates that prevailed from 1957 to 1966 but experience suggests that as the economy continues to slow, jobs will be affected still further. The rise in unemployment has af fected whites more than Negroes even though the rate of unem ployment for blacks, 6.3 per cent, is far above that for whites, 3.6 per cent. The relationship between the unemployment figures and the fight against inflation was stressed by Secretary of the Treasury David M. Kennedy in a speech last week in San Fran cisco. “Easier labor markets, de clining corporate profits and the expected slowdown in the rate of price increases will hopefully reduce the inflationary pressure on wage settlements,” he said.

975-> Beaulieu, a Winner in Sulky, Takes No Chances at Window
WESTBURY, L. I., June 23— Dr. and Mrs. George Smith Jr.'s Columbia George encountered no problems en route to his victory in last Saturday's Com modore Pace, in which he eas ily defeated Truluck, Most Happy Fella and other 3‐year‐ olds at Roosevelt Raceway. Roland Beaulieu, the trainer driver of the colt, was certain that he had the best horse in the race, even though Columbia George campaigns with bowed tendons and is in danger of breaking down at any time. However, Beaulieu did not bet on Columbia George. It was not because the colt was an odds‐on favorite that Roland did not wager a couple of bob on what most observers agree is the best of this season's 3‐year‐old pacers. It was be cause Beaulieu doesn't bet. “There are drivers who bet and there are drivers who don't,” he said. “I'm one who doesn't. Oh, I used to gamble on my horses, but I have not made a bet in the last 10 years. I'll tell you what cured me. “Along about 1960,” the 54‐ year‐old New England reins man said, “I owned Knox Boy, a pacer I acquired for $550 at the Harrisburg sales. I had him racing and doing well at the fairs around Maine and New Hampshire. I wanted to buy a trailer, but did not want to withdraw any money from our savings account. “So I decided to take Knox Boy to Buffalo. I felt he was fast enough to win there and figured that because he was not known in that area, he would pay a big price. I en tered him in a race I thought he could take and bet $200 straight, $100 place and $100 show. I was shocked, when the horse finished out of the money. “A week later, I entered Knox Boy in another race I thought he could win, bet the same $200, $100, $100 and again he went nowhere. Now, I was out $800 and farther away from the trailer than I wanted to be. “Knox Boy came down with a virus and was sidelined for seven weeks. Subsequently, he was well enough to return to racing and one night the race way secretary asked me if I would put Knox Boy in, just to fill the event. I did. When I glanced at the program, I learned that the other seven horses were able to beat 2:08. I didn't think Knox Boy could make 2:10 at that time, so I did not bet. “Well, you can guess What happened. Knox Boy paced in 2:07 and a piece, won easily and paid $72.10. “Now you know why I don't bet.”

976-> COLLEGE REFEREES WEIGH A BOYCOTT
LANCASTER, Pa., June 23— Eastern college basketball offi cials are threatening to with hold their services for the 1970– 1971 season unless agreement is reached on a new fee scale with the Eastern College Bas ketball Association. A letter from Russ Beiss wanger, executive secretary of the Collegiate Basketball Offi cials Association, asks officials not to sign assignment sheets without noting that the dates are acceptable only if the offi cials' group and the E.C.B.A. reach agreement on a new fee scale. The E.C.B.A. includes vir tually all the colleges in the 190‐member Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference. Will Renken of Albright, vice president of the officials' group, explained that officials working E.C.A.C. games are paid one of four rates—$30, $40, $50 and $60, plus expenses. He said there were more schools paying in the $30 range. He compared this with the Big Ten and some other conferences, which he said pay from $100 to $125 for officials. The E.C.A.C. rates are determined by the college's abil ity to pay. Renken said that directors of the E.C.B.A. and the C.B.O.A. have come up with a new fee proposal, and he was not ex pecting trouble, but he de clined to disclose the terms of the proposal. “There are cool heads on both sides,” he said. “We have effected a compromise. They've backed off a little bit and we requested new consideration.” The E.C.B.A. membership will get a chance to vote on the new proposal in September.

977-> F.P.C. WEIGHS RISE IN RATES FOR GAS
WASHINGTON, July 17 — The Federal Power Commis sion announced plans today for, a legal proceeding aimed at enabling it to put into effect) by early fall a nationwide, temporary increase in th?? prices that can be charged by producers of natural gas. The amount of the increase remains to be determired. The commission said the rate increase was designed to pro vide an incentive for explora tion for new gas deposits. If the commission adopts the preliminary findings of its staff, the increase would, according to the staff's estimates, amount to something between 20 and 10 cents in the gas bill of the average household gas user, during the first year. The amount of the rise would more than double in the second and each succeeding year, a pace that would double the whole as bill in about 14 years. For gas producers as a whole, the increase would total around $35‐million in the first year, if the staff's recommendations were followed, and more thah double this amount in each succeeding year. The nationwide increase in the price paid to gas producers, which would be passed on through the distribution chain to consumers, would be only temporary, although in this in stance, “temporary” could mean several years. The increased prices that the commission puts into effect this fall would remain in effect un til they were superseded by prices determined on a more de tailed area‐by‐area basis. But if the regional prices subse quently determined to be fair were lower than the “tempora ry” ones, no refunds would be made. The power commission said that it wanted to make a quick revision in rates paid gas producers, nationwide, because a shortage of gas was devel oping that appears to be re lated to economic factors rather than any decline in availability of natural gas. The rate increase would be designed to provide an incen tive for exploration for new gas, commission officials said. It would apply only to gas that is sold under contracts dated after today. The establishment of the higher price based on con tract dates could bring into the market some gas from wells that had been discovered some time ago, which had been with held from the market in anticipation of a rate increase. In its proceeding aimed at determining how large the rate increase should be, the com mission announced that it would consider these basic fac tors: ¶The actual cost of discover ing and producing natural gas that is not found in connection with petroleum. ¶Whether the rate of return currently permitted gas pro ducers by the commission on their gas business, which is currently set at 12 per cent, should be modified. The rate of return gas for producers is higher than for most regulated industries because it is based on the concept that the return should be comparable to that for other high‐risk businesses. ¶Whether the prices paid to natural gas producers should be less stringently regulated than they are now. In this connection, the com mission will consider the extent to which the completely un regulated prices that currently exist—for gas produced and sold within the confines of one state—ought to be used as benchmark in setting its regu lated prices. Alternatively, it might decide to permit prices to move freely within some sort of range. The estimate that the aver age household consumer's bill might rise only 20 to 40 cents a year the first year—through rising very rapidly at a com pound rate after that — was based on the finding of the staff of the commission that increases in the costs of pro ducing gas had amounted to 3 to 5 cents per thousand cubic feet since 1961, when the first areawide gas rate was set for producers. Other areawide rates have not been set or are still in litigation. If the commission decided that cost increases, on a na tionwide average, have been higher than the staff did, or if it decided that the rate of re turn should be increased, or if it decided to stop regulating so tightly, the increases could be larger than the 20 to 40 cents. The commission announced that, in addition to soliciting written comments on the na tionwide increase, it would alsc hold public hearings during July and August in Midland, Tex., New Orleans, Denver and Pitts burgh. Those who want to testify or submit written statements are to notify the secretary of the commission by July 28. In addition to the proceed ing looking toward a nation wide increase that it hopes to order by Oct. 1, according to a staff official, the commissior announced that it would imme diately consider applications from independent producers for rates that are in excess of the currently established rates.

979-> U.S. Judge Fullam Picked to Handle the Myriad Problems of Carrier
Judge John P. Fullam of the Federal District Court in Phila delphia was named yesterday to handle the reorganization of the Penn Central Transporta tion Company under the bank ruptcy laws. In Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange's board of gov ernors voted at a special meeting to suspend until fur ther notice dealings in 21 rail road bonds that are indirect obligations of the huge rail sys tem and six stock issues, which are indirectly related. The exchange tovernors' or der does not affect the common stock of the Penn Central Com pany, the holding company that owns all the stock of the Trans portation Company subsidiary. Meanwhile, it was reported in Cleveland that the Central National Bank and the Cleve land Trust Company, both of Cleveland, had refused to honor paychecks drawn against the Penn Central Railroad Com pany. Even the railroad credit union, NYCOLL, would not ac cept the employe checks. John A. McDonough, general shop superintendent at the road's Collinwood yards, said Cleveland was the only place in the Penn Central System where this was happening. Judge Fullman, 48 years old, was sworn in as a Federal judge in 1966. When former President Johnson appointed him to the bench, he was serving as member of the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas in Bucks County to which he had been appointed in February, 1960. The following year he was elected to a 10‐year term. Twice, in 1954 and 1956, he ran unsuccessfully as the Demo cratic candidate for Congress from the Eighth Congressional. District covering Bucks and Lehigh Counties. Judge Fullman's name was chosen by lot in a drawing the 13 judges of the district court in Philadelphia held yesterday to decide which of them would handle the Penn Central reor ganization. Reached last night at his farm home near Wrightstown, Pa., Judge Fuilman said he had never handled railroad reorgan ization proceedings under Sec tion 77 of the Federal Bank ruptcy Act. This is the act under which the railroad sought and ob tained permission on Sunday to reorganize. Laughing, when he was asked whether he was a stu dent of Section 77, he said: “No, but I expect to be by tomorrow.” Judge Fullam will have the sole jurisdiction over the selec tion of the trustee or trustees who will run the railroad as agent of the court until it final ly is discharged from reorgani zation. He will hold a hearing on July 15 after which he will nitme the trustees, whose ap pointment must be approved by the Interstate Commerce Com mission. It will be Judge Fullam to whom the trustees will have to report monthly on the financial health of the Penn Central, both as to its revenues and earnings and to its balance sheet posi tion. Before paying any major obli gation, or disposing of any major asset, the trustees will have to get Judge Fullam's ap proval. It will be his court that will have to act on such points as what the trustees will be paid and which salary contracts and pension contracts will be honored, what securities trustees certificates — can be sold for working funds and what the trustees can spend for capital improvements, includ ing new equipment. And if the Penn Central's earnings are restored sufficient ly to meet its past‐due install ing bonds, which presumably will go into default now that the road is involved in bank ruptcy proceedings, it will be Judge Fullam who will have to approve the payment. It will be Judge Fullam's court to which the Interstate Commerce Commission will send any approved reorganiza tion plan before the creditors of the Penn Central have chance to act on it. Judge Fullam has emerged as somewhat of a champion of the underdog since ascend ing the Federal bench five years ago. One of his notable rulings in this respect came in April, 1968, when he heard an appeal by 27 hippies arrested by the police in Rittenhouse Square, the Central City Park in Phila delphia that is surrounded by luxury high‐rise apartments. The hippies contended that their Constitutional rights were violated because they did noth ing disorderly while congregat ing in the square. The judge agreed. He ruled that the police were “totally unjustified” in making the arrests in the summer of 1967. The judge made this point: The police should make ar rests only on the basis that what people do is wrong—not solely for their status in life. “It's not a crime to be a hippie,” Judge Fullam said, “and the police could not law fully arrest on the basis of suspicion or even probable cause to believe the arrestee occupies the status of being a homosexual or narcotics addict.” One of his admirers recalled yesterday how some years ago when at a stormy meeting of organizers of the Bucks County Community College in Newton, Judge Fullam helped to call the session to order by getting up and saying, “We ought to begin this meeting by singing ‘We Shall Overcome.’” The Penn Central's executive vice president in charge of freight traffic, E. G. Kreyling Jr., issued a statement yester day in which he said the sys tem's freight customers “are sticking by us during this cri ses, with only a very few ex ceptions.” Mr. Kreyling said the rail road was “gratified” by the as surances it was getting from shippers. But the railroad's Philadel phia‐area commuters had some costly news to digest. The rail road asked the Southeasterr Pennsylvania Transportation to join with it in a request to the state Public Utility Commis sion for authority to raise fares on six of its Philadelphia‐area commuter lines by 20 per cent The authority partially suhsi dizes the commuter operatior in the Philadelphia area.

980-> Words on Carswell
President Nixon's nomination of Federal District Judge G. Har old Carswell of Florida to the Supreme Court was stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee last week as opponents used parliamentary ploys to delay a committee vote. As a result, it now appears that the full Sen ate may have to wait until the beginning of March to vote on the Carswell appointment. Opponents of the nomination hope to use the time to rally support—generally conceded to have little chance of success— for their drive to reject the Southerner. At the moment, only, three Senators have pub licly announced against confir mation of Judge Carswell—Dem ocrats William Proxmire of Wisconsin and Walter Mondale of Minnesota, and Republican Charles Goodell of New York— although in preliminary votes on the committee, at least six other Senators have shown themselves in opposition. As public hearings on the nomination wound up last week, the opponents brought a num ber of witnesses to testify about Judge Carswell's alleged anti civil rights biases. Several law yers claimed he had been “in sulting and hostile” to Negro and civil rights attorneys ap pearing before him in civil rights cases, had lectured from the bench about “Northern law yers coming down here and arousing the local people,” had advised a city prosecutor on how to “circumvent” a civil rights ruling by the United States Court of Appeals, and had been consistently overturned by higher courts in civil rights de cisions. Dean Louis H. Pollack of Yale Law School said that after study ing Judge Carswell's legal opin ions, “I am compelled to con clude that this nominee presents the most slender credentials of any man put forward in this century for the Supreme Court.” The judge's main supporters on the committee—Chairman James O. Eastland, Mississippi Democrat, and Roman L. Hru ska, Nebraska Republican — asked Mr. Carswell to reply to these charges in writing. He did, saying: “Since I do not remem ber specific colloquies with coun sel in the cases referred to, I can only state that I consistently approached hearings with an open mind, to be convinced by counsel of the merits of the ar gument.... I am not a racist and I harbor no notions of racial superiority, which are them selves insulting and obnoxious. My record shows.”

981-> BIG ANTIMONY FIND CITED IN MONTANA
John C. Lawrence, president of Agau Mines, Inc., and of the United States Antimony Cor poration, said yesterday that the affiliated concerns had veri fied the presence of major anti mony reserves on their property near Thompson Falls, Mont. He said the companies were constructing milling facilities with a daily capacity of 1,800 tons of antimony. Mr. Lawrence said that “in dependent consulting firms” had indicated ore reserves on the property of at least 330,000 tons. He added that the com panies already were selling some high‐grade antimony to help meet the development and construction costs. Milling facilities are expected to be completed by July 15 and to be in operation about a month later, at an initial output rate of 100 tons a day. Antimony is an important in dustrial commodity, tin‐white in color, hard and brittle.

982-> A Briton looks at Americans abroad
Ludovic Kennedy, a well known British television com mentator and author of several books, takes his title from Lyn don Johnson's greeting to a group of White House visitors in January, 1965. “Mrs. John son and I are very happy to have you here and we think you are all very lovely people,” said the President. Making allow ance for understandable and well‐documented cracks at some of his cast of charac ters, the author is obviously more friendly than sarcastic when he cites this phrase. His thesis is good. As a Brit ish subject, he admits to hav ing been struck by “how com pletely the Americans now filled the role once occupied by the British of the world's policemen, educators and bank ers.” He is not ashamed of his own country's colonialist epoch which “put an end to widow burning in India, cannibalism in Borneo, infanticide in Poly nesia,” even if the adminis trators “extolled the virtues of Parliamentary Democracy but practiced instead a benevolent dictatorship.” He is tolerant of the practice of Americans abroad “living in enclaves and keeping up the American way of life.” After all, he recalls, global represen tatives of the old Empire al ways had bacon and eggs for breakfast and roast beef on Sundays, regardless of climate, and set up fields for golf, polo and cricket. Whenever they had a quorum, they created a club. He sees a certain con tinuity in the contemporary world where “there is no corner of a foreign field that is not in part American.” He minimizes the overseas impression of G.I.'s and tour ists — “least representative, most boring and conformist of any country's ambassadors abroad.” Instead, he seeks to concentrate on resident U.S. official and business communi ties around the earth and the unconscious thrust of the American way of life. He writes: “The world, often against its will, is going Ameri can, shopping in shiny super markets, wearing sweatshirts and jeans, eating hamburgers and ice cream, drinking Coca Cola.” The task Kennedy sets him self is immense and intriguing. He analyzes his subjects as “the new gentleman adven turers of the day, imperialists without an empire, colonialists without a colony, the self appointed, sometimes reluctant, often abused servants and mas ters of half the world. How were they making out? What were they doing? What did other people think of what they were doing?” On a series of excursions, he consorted with American A.I.D. representatives, mission aries, businessmen, propagan dists, diplomats, journalists and soldiers (as well as occasional tourists) in Latin America, Af rica, Europe and Asia. He made interesting discoveries. For example, he was impressed by the tiny proportion of Ameri can employes in many large U.S. enterprises overseas. He found in one South American country that because Ameri can investment was small and there was no dependence on Washington, “we do not dislike them.” He heard in Brazil that there was a “colossal influence of America on the young peo ple.” He took a wholesome if humorous view of the way the U.S. Sixth Fleet took over the policing of the Mediterranean from the Royal Navy. One time he deliberately got himself involved with a batch of tourists (in Jerusalem) and shrewdly drew this picture: “My fellow sightseers were a formidable lot. The men shuffled about in those old fashioned hats and string ties and the women had too much make‐up and elaborate hair styles. They had enough cam eras among them to put Life and Paris‐Match out of busi ness. Some chewed Chiclets. In a curious way they all looked alike; they had these sharp lit tle eyes and thin lips and prim, severe faces. They were a more opulent version of Grant Wood's ‘American Gothic’: solid, regular, taxpaying citi zens, earnest, worthy, thrifty, sober; churchgoers, community helpers, charity‐givers to a woman. On this rock was America founded.” Towards the end, he discerns, with sardonic sympathy, “a deep American need, the ach ing need to be accepted. Ac ceptance is to be had in the communion of blood and wine and water intermingling, in the sacramental sacrifice of beasts. It is to be had in a return to a state of innocence and grace, to the time before the Fall, be fore Bethlehem, the Industrial Revolution, Hiroshima, the color war, Vietnam; a return to a world where men were naked and simple and therefore brothers, where napalm and Kleenex, Musak and liquid oxygen, French letters and the fertility pill had not yet come to confuse the passing scenes.” I particularly enjoyed Ken nedy's descriptions of his visit to the Sixth Fleet, his stay in Saudi Arabia and his brief tour of South Vietnam. He writes with wit and takes pains to describe the unabashed good ness of many of his characters. Nevertheless, despite patches of lucidity, elegance and humor and despite frequently vivid dialogue, this book doesn't quite come off. I have a feeling the author was such a thorough reporter that he ended up with a mountain of material impossible to reduce in orderly arrangement. He must have traveled with a tape recorder—or he must be a shorthand expert—to take down in such detail so many interminable conversations and such needlessly long excerpts from broadcasts of the U.S. Armed Forces Network which are, as everyone (including Kennedy) knows, aimed at the L'il Abner I.Q. of the average G.I. I appreciated the effort by this author, so clearly a good friend of the United States, to explain what Americans are doing in the world. He has suc ceeded to a considerable de gree—if one has the patience to persist. But apart from the fact that it is much too drawn out, “Very Lovely People” lacks a summing up, even by inference. I particularly missed this because it is clear that the author has an engaging, bright mind and it would have been worth pondering his con clusions. ■

983-> American Enka Earnings Drop; Indian Head Profit Shows Gain
Textile markets continued to reflect weakness and caution in buying by trade outlets and consumers, the American Enka Corporation explained in re porting yesterday lower earn ings for the three and six months ended June 14. Meanwhile, Indian Head, Inc. reported a slight improvement in second‐quarter earnings but a dip in half‐year results. The glass container business offset the weaker textile division, the diversified producer noted. Net income of American Enka for the 12 weeks to June 14 was $4,274,800 or 53 cents a share, off 11 per cent from $4,777,576, or 59 cents a share, for the comparable 1969 pe riod. Sales, however, gained per cent to a record $61,092, 205 from $57,200,872, bringing the volume for the 24 weeks to a new high of $126,776,034 from $113,556,326 a year ear lier. Net income for the half year was $9,192,355, or $1.15 a share, against $9,977,009, or $1.24 a share, for the 24 weeks ended June 15, 1969. “Products related to home furnishings and a ?? were particularly depressed,” Claude Ramsey, president of American Enka said. “Evidence points to a somewhat greater than usual decline in shipments in June and July, as textile mills prepare for vacation shut downs. A further unfavorable influence has been the effect of heavy imports of fiber, yarns, fabrics and finished tex tile products,” Mr. Ramsey ex plained. Brand‐Rex division sales and order backlogs for wire and cable products were ahead of the previous year with gains recorded from telephone, com puter and control cable mar kets, the executive noted. Stockohlders of the company will vote on a proposed three‐ way merger of Enka, Interna tional Salt Company and Organon, Inc. on Sept. 9. Akzo N. V., Dutch chemical company, owns Organon and has a 55 per cent interest in Enka and 52 per cent in International Salt. Indian Head, Inc., producers of specialty textiles, glass con tainers and metal and automo tive equipment, had a net in come of $3,282,000 or 69 cents a common share in the quarter ended May 30, against $3,181, 000, or 68 cents a share in the like period last year. Sales fell to $108,750,000 from $111,868, 000, bringing the total for the six months ended with May to $206,811,000 down from $210, 522,000 a year ago. Net income was $5,480,000, or $1.13 a share, compared with $5,655, 000, or $1.19 a share. Continuing softness in the economy and the prolonged truck strike adversely affected earnings of the Sherwin‐Wil liams Company in the three and nine months ended May 31, it was reported yesterday. Net income for the three months period was $4,022,754, or 70 cents a share, compared with $5,668,306,. or $1.01 a share, for the May quarter last year. Sales increased to $137, 053,083 from $133,992,463 lift ing the total for the nine months ended with May to $367,061, 420 from $347,708,170 for the year earlier period. Net income for the nine months came to $6,876,144, or $1.13, a share, down from $10,642,454, or $1.85 a share, for the like 1969 period. R‐Record AMERON, INC. ?? CHOCK FULL O' NUTS CORP. ??

986-> Reader's Report
After 25 years in Parliament, Maurice Edelman must have a mental gallery of public fig ures as extensive as Madame Tussaud's. Some of them ma terialize in lively fashion in this completely fascinating mé lange of big business and poli tics—and even more interest ing than the recognizable fa cades are the unexpected per sonalities that the author un covers beneath them. Harry Levenson the upstart Jewish financier, Sir Geoffrey Orme Campbell the Old Boy indus trialist, Labor Cabinet Minister Alf Budd—such familiar types reveal hidden planes of indi viduality during one evening of intense crisis. The setting for this midsum mer nightmare is a traditional cockpit of the English novel: a country house, Orme‐Camp bell's 17th‐century manor. The raison d'être for the occasion is a topical gambit: a take over bid. As two managerial teams jostle in an increasingly sour climate, Mr. Edelman anatomizes marriages, parental relationships, social antago nisms, polite bigotry. Levenson is busy collecting proxies to vote the stock of Orme‐Camp bell's firm. Meanwhile, back at his country house, an apoca lyptic bacchanal is getting un der way that will alter its occupants' chemistry. Mr. Edelman manipulates these shifting scenes easily in a fluid style that can take a curiously Biblical lilt. (“And Levenson's head was heavy against her neck, and there was an intimacy between them, and a nothing.”) It's not Gene Autry, folks, or one of your buckskin‐fringed guitar‐twanging dudes. It's big Jim Kane, a modern cowpoke who does honor to the tradi tion recorded by Frederic Rem ington, one that, (according to the author) is still alive and kicking. Mr. Brown's episodic history records some of his hero's workaday experience chaperoning horses and cattle across Mexico and into Arizona. From Guadalajara, he trucks remuda into the U.S. From high in the mountains, he and a Mexican partner drive 500 head of rodeo‐bound cattle down to Chihuaha. Along the way he has to contend with veterinary problems, border highbinders, graft, the weather, stampedes and the imminence of losing his life and his money. And through all of these animal and human relationships there blows a fresh wind as vigorous as a wintry gust out of the Sierra Madre. Mr. Brown evidently knows his ‐ Mexican border terrain, loves it and writes of it with gusto. His hero is a happy anachronism who lives danger ously, and convinces the reader that he enjoys it. Here is the story on which was based the memorable Czech film of a few years back. Not withstanding a limping transla tion, and a format more suited to a juvenile, its poignancy seeps through with clarity enough to remind the reader of unspeakable horrors. The sewing “notions” shop on the main street of a small Slovak town in 1944 belongs to an old Jewish woman, deaf and in her dotage. Denuded of everything except a ragtag col lection of buttons and bows, the shop is expropriated by the local Nazi establishment and turned over to a carpenter. The old woman is captivating in her mad innocence. The carpenter is a decent, kindly man, hen pecked by his wife and chiv vied by his Quisling brother in‐law. The two arrive at fragile modus vivendi, which Mr. Grosman makes all the more pathetic by engulfing it in sea of human bestiality. The authors, one of them an inventor of children' games, have hatched a problem‐novel about an emerging African state and its bedeviled Prime Minis ter. It resembles one of those pamphlets of primary sources used to teach freshmen how to do research themes. It is also a bit like Candyland. We are provided with maps of the country, Lakoto, and its capital city. We are given the Lakotan constitution, its legal system, the conjugation of a verb or two and a pouchful of bureau cratic correspondence. Then the authors supply Prime Minister Toumi Oboko with a full bud get, and offer the reader a mul tiple choice of solutions. What should Oboko do about hydroelectric power? (“Reader: The choice is yours.... Are you ready to decide whether you support Scheme B or an alternative to Scheme B or would you like further infor mation before making your de cision? If you are ready to make a decision now, turn to page 70.”) What is the Prime Minister to do about a Moslem uprising? (“Which troops would you send to Benhallahi? The Fifth Rifles? If this is your choice, turn to page 126.”) We are even asked what to do about Mrs. Oboko. (“I. Ask her to remain in Lakoto for the time being. If you think this is the right decision, please turn to page 169.”) There are three other options for the Prime Minister's wife, but the reader is offered no participa tion at all when her husband is in camera with the nubile lady lawyer who has set her cap for him. Darn. What if the Lysistrata syn drome were to burgeon into an international epidemic? And what if a lady scientist came up with a capsule that makes man obsolete by inducing both parthenogenesis and pleasure? Hmm? John Boyd, who is able to keep a cool head in the face of such imminent horrors, squeezes all possible shades of gray and black humor from them. The U.S. Navy tries to head off the inevitability of the Women's Democratic Republic, by one elaborate stratagem aft er another, but it is continu ally defeated by the limitations of the military mind and the ruthlessness of women.. Mr. Boyd's tactics are better than his strategy, which tends to run downhill, unimpeded by ade quate conflict. But there is rich trove of wit in the novel, as well as a hopeful prognosis for Women's Liberation. ■

987-> Harvard Ph. D. Will Become Agnew's New Speech Writer
WASHINGTON, June 10—A Harvard student who has been severely critical of the “liberal” way student radicals have been treated by colleges will become Vice President Agnew's only full‐time speech writer. J. C. Helms, who will receive his Ph.D. degree in classics at Harvard's commencement to morrow, will assume his duties here next week, a source in the Vipe President's office said to night. The choke of Mr. Helms, the source said, was made by the Vice President after he inter viewed several prospects. The source said that Mr. Helms was the youngest of those inter viewed. Mr. Helms, from Santa Fe, N. M., is 29 years old. Mr. Helms's name was sug gested to the Vice President by “someone on the White House staff,” the source said. “The Vice President was very impressed by his back ground,” the source said. “He has read material that Helms has written.” The Vice President has not had a full‐time speech writer since Mrs. Cynthia Rosenwald, a Baltimore housewife, left his staff three months ago. Mr. Helms's title will be “staff assistant” and when not occupied in writing speeches, he will prepare statements and articles for the Vice President. Last summer, Mr. Helms ap peared before the Senate Perma nent Investigating Committee holding hearings on campus disorders. Senator John L. Mc Clellan, Democrat of Arkansas, the committee chairman, said that the testimony was a “wringing indictment of the Harvard administration.”

BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 17 —A Syrian military spokesman said today that two Syrian sol diers were killed and five slightly wounded in an attack by Israeli forces yesterday on the Syrian Army camp near Nebk. The town is 20 miles northeast of Damascus. The spokesman also said that an Israeli fighter aircraft had been hit in a clash with Syrian interceptors over the southern part of the country. But the spokesman did not confirm the Israeli report that Israeli commandos had also blown up a bridge on the road to Es Suweida about 25 miles south of Damascus. According to the Syrian broadcast, an Israeli helicopter “sneaked into the Nehk area via Lebanese air space” at 11:30 P.M. last night and landed in a valley about four miles from Nehk. The attackers “fired about 30 mortar shells at one of our camps in the area, then returned to where they had come from,” the spokesman said. CAIRO, June 17 (Reuters)— Fifteen Egyptian soldiers were killed and seven wounded dur ing sporadic Israeli air raids to day on the Suez Canal front, a military spokesman announced.

991-> Ambro Decries Racism in Campaign
Jerome A. Ambro, a white man running against a Negro for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor, said yesterday that it was “very dif ficult” for him to campaign be cause everything he says is in terpreted as racism or bigotry. “There is a major question in my mind whether a white man who is not a bigot can run against a black man without having race injected into every thing he does and says,” added Mr. Ambro, who is running against State Senator Basil A. Paterson in the June 23 Demo cratic primary. “I'm being forced to run with one arm tied behind my back,” he said, adding: “I'd like to attack Paterson in the same way I'd run against anyone else — I think he's been a mediocre Senator — but I have to worry about people and the media thinking it's a racial attack— Why are you attacking the poor man, he's black.” During an interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times, Mr. Ambro said he believed that the media, not the candidates, had made race a major issue in the cam paign. “When this began,” he said, “no one had ever heard of Paterson or me and no one knew what color we were.” But, he added, race was ob viously an Issue with vot ers and “I'm coming across some bigots who say they're going to vote for me.” “They used code words,” he continued,” they say things like ‘We can't let the suburbs deteriorate the way Harlem has.’” What did he say to people like that? “I say thank you and move along. I don't en courage them, I don't discour age them. Maybe the answer should be ‘Get the hell out of here, I don't want your vote.’ I don't know what to do.” The candidate, who de scribed himself as a “liberal leaning Democrat,” said there was not much difference be tween himself and Mr. Pater son on issues. “But I think there is a difference in background and displays of courage,” he said, emphasizing his exper ience as Supervisor of Hunting ton, a Suffolk county town of 209,000. “Paterson's merely mouthing the opinion of his constituents, He has no executive exper ience — I don't know that he's ever brought people in to solve problems. I can't hang my hat on anything he's done or any time he's displayed any cour age.” Mr. Ambro, whose Job in Huntington is equivalent ?? mayor, asserted that he had demonstrated political courage by “changing the direction of a Republican ‐ Conservative town . . . by beginning the first urban‐renewal program in Suffolk County . . . by initiat ing a ban on DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesti cides.” During the interview, Mr. Ambro also made these points: ¶While he supports Arthur J. Goldberg for Governor — “he has great credentials” — he thinks he is a “ho hum” candi date who will lose to Governor Rockefeller in November unless his campaign improves. He said he believes that Mr. Goldberg is moving too far to the left and may lose the middle of the Democratic party and that the Goldberg campaign is plagued by “kooky advice . . . gim mickry . . . a lack of substance . . no position papers.” ¶He believes that the war in Vietnam is an important state issue—“I think we should get out of there immediately”—but that the voters will make their decisions by “thinking little— about potholes, taxes, muggings, dirty subways and dirty streets.” ¶He refused to discuss his campaign financing except to say that he had “adequate” campaign funds and would use radio advertising in the final days of the campaign. ¶He originally supported Theodore C. Sorensen for the Democratic Senate nomination, but has been disappointed in his campaign and now he has no preference among the four Democrats running for the Sen ate. On the two‐man contest for the nomination for Attorney General, he said he was sup porting District Attorney Rob ert R. Meehan of Rockland County because Adam Walin sky “doesn't know anything about the office.”

992-> Books of The Times
One picked up “Bech: A Book,” or “Bech: A Buch,” or “Bekabook,” or however it's pronounced—and one groaned. One had never been a particular fan of Mr. Updike's. One had never quite been able to stomach the precociousness of his descriptive powers; the message, “Look, Ma, I'm writing,” that wafted off his pages; the ultrafine sensi bility that seemed to rob twigs and leaves and even pubic hairs of their rights to an unap prehended exist ence. The sensibil ity seemed so inquisitive and ob jectifying that it had had the ironic effect of casting an Updikean pall over everything it touched with its verbal necroman cy. And now, in “Bech: A Book” it was invading the kingdom of the Jews, inventing, in the writer Henry Bech, a fictional composite of N. Mailer, S. Bellow, A. Port noy, I. B. Singer, H. Roth, D. Fuchs, and J. Salinger. Bad show, J. Updike, poor sport, one thought. You, among the few who stand outside the renaissance of Jewish letters, you have the least right to schmoo zle your way in, to climb aboard the cara van. Bech? Fech! BECH: A Book. By John Updike. 206 pages. Knopf. $5.95. Well, I was wrong. Here's why. Do you remember the architectural descriptions near the beginning of Mr. Updike's last novel, “Couples”—the file of “walnut new els” and “mullions” and “lemony flecked rhomboids of sun” that marched through Piet Hanema's mind, demonstrating for the reader that Piet “was by profession a builder, in love with snug right‐angled things,” and impressing upon us uninten tionally and irrelevantly Mr. Updike's penchant for superfine writing? Well, three‐fourths of the way through “Bech,” one comes across a description of a young man “with a round head like a newel knob.” It's not an important phrase, just incidental. But the word “newel” in it hap pened to remind me of those overwritten passages in “Couples.” And the contrast of the word's use in “Bech”—its appearance in that phrase as a touch of lighthearted caricature: that symbolized to me the whole difference between Mr. Updike's new book and his earlier ones. For “Bech” succeeds marvelously. Like that incidental descriptive phrase, it con tains just the right number of words to serve its ends. One falls into the book and through it and out the other side of it as effortlessly as one might slide through a polished aluminum tube in a funhouse. Yet so much is accomplished. It kids what it sets out to kid, and gets away with it. It creates a character that works as a satiri cal figure and a good deal more. It is a deft poke at what it means to be a writer in America, what this country does to its artists. It is a writer's testament; John Up dike's testimony. So who is Henry Bech; what is he? He is, as I said, a Jewish writer — blocked, though he has written much in the past. (A bibliography of his books and articles appears in an appendix; they range from his famous first novel, “Travel Light,” through an article, “My Favorite Reading in 1953,” which he wrote for The New York Times Book Review, to “The Impor tance of Beginning With a B: Barth, Borges, and Others,” Commentary, 1962.) Much has been written about him, ranging all the way from an Orville Prescott review, “More Dirt,” in the daily Times, to Gloria Steinem's “What Ever Happened to Henry Bech?” in New York magazine. Bech has mellowed over the years, and, in a letter that serves as the foreword to Mr. Updike's “lectures,” has given reluc tant permission to be written about. He travels—to Russia in the first episode, to Rumania in the second, to Bulgaria in the third. He tries to stay “with it,” but vomits when he smokes pot. A lecture trip to a Southern women's college gives him an ex quisite case of existential angst. He swings in London, and is at last honored at home with admission into what sounds like the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. At his initiation rites, he finds himself sur rounded by the same old people he had seen some 40 years earlier as a boy in his ambitious mother's tow. He sounds like a cliché? Believe me he's not. His ideas on writing? In an interview with the young man “with a round head like a newel knob,” “Bech talked of fiction as an equivalent of reality, and described how the point of it, the justification, seemed to lie In those moments when a set of successive images locked and then one more image arrived and, as it were, super locked, creating a tightness perhaps equiva lent to the terribly tight knit of reality?” But that sounds like the old John Updike writing. Never mind. The man who be lieves all that is being gently kidded. And he has stopped writing; he is blocked, while Updike is going strong. A little later Updike goes on to say, again through Henry Bech, “that he was sustained, inso far as he was sustained, by the memory of laughter, the specifically Jewish, embattled, religious, sufficiently desperate, not quite belly laughter of his father and his father's brothers, his beloved Brooklyn uncles; that the American Jews had kept the secret of this laughter a generation longer than the Gentiles . . .” Mr. Updike may be kidding there, too, but he has successfully stolen a piece of the laughter.

Howard J. Samuels' cam paign manager contended yes terday that Mr. Samuels would carry upstate areas “over whelmingly” in his June 23 primary fight for the Democrat ic nomination for Governor. Kenneth J. Auletta, the 28 year‐old campaign chief, also cited telephone indications of increasing strength in New York City to argue that Mr. Samuels was “closing the gap fast” against Arthur J. Gold berg, the State Committee's choice. Interviewed at his headquar ters, 72 West 45th Street, Mr. Auletta forecast a statewide victory for Mr. Samuels, a for mer industrialist, whose voting residence is in Canandaigua, 30 miles from Rochester. Telephone soundings upstate in the last week, Mr. Auletta said, reported these results: Syracuse—Samuels 600, Gold berg 150, undecided 250; Roch ester — Samuels 212, Gold berg 70, undecided 18; Dutchess County — Samuels 340, Goldberg 60. Within New York City, he said, telephone calls to 250 Democrats in the 67th Assem bly District on Manhattan's West Side last week showed 40 per cent favoring Mr. Samuels, 18 per cent Mr. Goldberg and the rest undecided. This, he said, was a swing in the same area from last March's 50 per cent for Mr. Goldberg and only 8 per cent for Mr. Samuels. Calls to 226 voters in the four other boroughs a week and a half ago, Mr. Auletta said, showed Mr. Goldberg's lead over Mr. Samuels a narrow 52 to 48 per cent. New York City has 2,068, 116 enrolled Democrats, or 58 per cent of the 3,566.252 tallied by the New York Department of State as eligible to vote. The four nearby suburban counties —Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and Rockland—have 518,458. The rest of the state has 979, 678. Mr. Auletta pictured Mr. Samuels' upstate appeal as based on his background there, a record as a “maverick” will ing to tackle political leaders over the years, and on resent ment against New York City machines' dictating nomina tions of losing candidates in 1962 and 1966. In the city, Mr. Auletta said, he looks to vigorous activity from the New Democratic Coalition, which has endorsed Mr. Samuels. Mr. Auletta said Coalition members had done “tremendously well” for the Presidential bid of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Min nesota. He held Mr. Samuels had demonstrated actively for peace in the war in Vietnam. In the black community, Mr. Samuels has endorsements from Representative Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn, the state's Democratic national committeewoman, and Assem blyman Charles B. Rangel, seeking Harlem's Congressional nomination. Mr. Auletta counts on “middle ‐ of ‐ the ‐ road” vot ers' regard for Mr. Samuels as a businessman and young peo ple's impressions of his candi date as “dynamic and vibrant” with specific programs. During the day, Mr. Samuels issued a “position paper” promising, as Governor, to “seek qualified women” for key posts. He proposed a state wide system of day‐care cen ters, arguing that this would more than pay for itself by increased income taxes from working mothers. He pledged legislative and executive at tack on discriminations against women.

996-> FREEHOLD MAN SUES IN DISPUTE ON FLAG
NEWARK, Aug. 24 (AP)—A Freehold, N. J., man went into Federal Court here Monday seeking the right to speak at meetings of the Monmouth County Board of Freeholders despite his recent refusal to salute the flag at a Freeholder's meeting. Albert White was denied per mission to address the Free holders last week after he re fused to salute the American flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance along with the board and about 40 other people at tending a meeting. His suit, filed in United States District Court, asks for an injunction that would re quire the Freeholders to allow him to speak at their meetings. A hearing on the matter was set for Sept. 8 in Federal Court in Trenton. After the incident last week, Freeholder Director Joseph C. Irwin said, “Anyone who will not salute the flag of the United States of America has no right to ask anything of its Govern ment.” Mr. White said later, that he would refuse to salute the flag “until we live again in a free nation.”

997-> Two Multiple‐Alarm Fires Damage Bronx Apartments
Two multiple‐alarm fires in the Bronx early yesterday routed a number of families from their apartments and re sulted in an injury to a woman and a fireman. Three families were left ho'meless by a three‐alarm blaze that enveloped five three‐story homes at East 240th Street and Villa Avenue. Anna Forzoglia, 48 years old, of 1012 East 240th Street, was taken to Montefiore Hospital suffering from smoke inhalation and a possible heart attack, and a fireman, Peter Hoffman of Engine Company 48, was hospitalized with burns. Eleven persons, including seven children, were left home less when a two‐alarm blaze damaged a five‐story building at 833 East 162d Street. There were no injuries in the blaze, which began in stores on the ground floor and spread into dwellings above.

998-> SUKARNO'S KIN SAY HE IS GRAVELY ILL
JAKARTA, Indonesia, Thurs day, June 18 (AP)—The children of the former President Sukarno gathered today around their ail ing father, and a member of the family said: “It is only a matter of time now.” The 69‐year‐old hero of Indo nesia's independence struggle was taken to an army hospi tal in Jakarta Tuesday night af ter his health worsened. He has suffered for years from kidney stones, high blood pressure and a circulatory ailment. “It looks bad,” said the fam ily source. “The old man has, been ill for some time, and it gets worse every day.” No hospital report on Mr. Sukarno's condition was avail able, however. It is the second time Mr. Sukarno has been taken to a hospital this year. He responded satisfactorily to treatment during the previous stay. Mr. Sukarno, Indonesia's President from his proclama tion of independence in 1945 until conservative military lead ers deposed him in 1966, has been living under house arrest since he was overthrown.

999-> Q:
H. A. W. writes: “In Paul Claudel's play, ‘Le Soulier de Satin,’ Dona Prouheze plights her purity to the Virgin with her satin slipper. Claudel subsequently says that the general idea for this action came from an English novel he had read in the late 1890's or early 1900's, in the English library of a port in China. Can anyone identify the novel in question?” K. F. M. writes: “There is an epic poem recounting the last voyage of the ex plorer, Henry Hudson, in his search for the Northwest Passage. His crew mutinied, and put Hudson with a few faithful sailors in a small boat in the middle of Hudson Bay, while they turned Hudson's ship to England. The poet depicts Hudson in the small boat reminding his doomed companions of their mission as explorers and saying to them: We'll keep the honor of a certain aim/ Amid the peril of uncertain ways/ And sail ahead! And leave the rest to God? Can anyone tell me the author and title of this poem?” B. M. writes: “In F. Scott Fitzgerald's ‘The Beautiful and Damned,’ Gloria and her mother are disciples of ‘Bilphism’ (seemingly a philosophy‐religion). Does Bilphism exist or is it a product of the author's imagination? If the latter, what is the source of the appelation?” B. S.

1000-> Kenyan Bids U.S. Bar Skins of Two Animals
NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 9— The Attorney General of Kenya, Charles Njonjo has asked the United States Gov ernment to ban imports of the skins of leopards and cheetahs. In a letter to the United State's Secretary of the In terior, Walter J. Hickel, Mr. Njonjo, who is also president of the East African Wildlife Society, said that the society believed that the survival of all spotted cats in Africa was endangered. He warned that poaching gangs were turning their at tention towards national game parks because of the high re wards available. “If this trend is allowed to continue through overseas markets be ing readily available, it will bring about the extinction of the spotted cats in the near future, he said. Kenya banned all exports of cheetah skins last July and has cut the traffic in leopard skins.

1001-> Local School Boards and Central Administration Clash Over Funds
The new local school boards and the Board of Education will meet today in an attempt to resolve the first severe con troversy between them since decentralization began in earn ect in the city on July 1. The pivot of the dispute is a reduction of $23.1‐million in the Federal funds allotted to the 31 local boards for their own locally developed special programs for the 1970‐71 school year. The districts had $39.3‐million to spend for such programs in 1969‐70; the figure this year is $16.2‐million. If the cuts remain in force the effect on many districts would be calamitous, the local boards say. District 2 (formerly District 3) in Lower Manhattan had $539,670 to spend on locally designed programs in 1969‐70 with projects ranging from remedial reading with the use of special typewriters through a pre‐kindergarten program in Chinatown for children and parents recently arrived from Hong Kong. The district's al location this year is $50,000, which would mean the end of most of the programs.. District 13 in Brooklyn estimates that with its budget cuts it would have to dis charge 430 full‐time and 600 part‐time paraprofessionals from the community who are employed in its various pro grams. The situation is particularly bitter for the local boards be cause the programs that would have to be dropped had been developed with community par ticipation. The cuts, announced unilaterally by the central board, thus are reported to vitiate the credibility of the local boards with residents of their districts—an effect pre cisely the opposite of the one decentralization was supposed to produce. The revised allocations were announced by the central board on June 25, long after the local boards had prepared their 1970‐71 schedules on the as sumption that the money they would receive would be rough ly the same as in 1969‐70. The reaction of the local b6ards has been predictably sharp. Their members accuse the central board of pursuing an “insane program,” of trying to maintain control of the budget despite decentralization, and of addressing the local boards as if it were the teacher and they the pupils. “If I didn't ‘know the Board of Education wants decentral ization to work'—and you'll no tice I put quotation marks around that—I would think they're trying to destroy it before it gets off the ground,” said Martin W. Frey, superin tendent of District 4, at one angry meeting of the local boards. Through July there were also harsh confrontations with the central board. At one of them Murry Bergtraum, the new pres ident of the board, called crit ics of the new budget “candy store accountants” and sug gested that the problems were local, not central. Many school board members found his and his colleagues unresponsive to their concerns. “Bergtraum was extremely discourteous,” asserted Mrs. Marie Ford of the District 3 board. “He didn't want to hear anything from any community school people. I was shocked at his treatment of us.” At later meetings, however, some of the heat was dissipated as discussion narrowed to par ticular points in the budget. Participants in the discussion regard exchange of statistics by the local boards and the central board as the prime factor in cooling tempers. The meetings are scheduled to culminate in tonight's gath ering at 7 o'clock at 110 Liv ingston Street, the board's headquarters. It is believed that the cen tral board will attempt to re solve the conflict by making supplementary allocations to the districts on the assump tion additional funds will be forthcoming from Washington. “When it's over, the cuts are not going to be as steep as they seemed,” said Mr. Berg traum. There are several reasons for the cuts in the Federal funds. One is the reduction of the city's total allotment of Federal funds under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act from $117‐mil lion last year to $110‐million this year. The second reason is the mandatory addition of 10 new More Effective Schools at a cost of $9.5‐million. Such schools, which have smaller classes and more services than regular schools, are part of the central board's contract with the United Federation of Teachers. The third reason is an at tempt by the central board to equalize distribution of the Federal money, so that each district gets a percentage of the total funds equal to the percentage of poor children it contains. Previously such funds had been allocated on the basis of other criteria, includ ing the availability of space and political expediency. The net effect of the budget adjustments was to increase the proportion of the Federal money going for programs over which the local boards have no control—such as More Effective Schools—and to de crease the money available for use at their own discretion. Only one district—District 21 in Brooklyn—is allotted more money this year than last, but after deduction of fixed costs, even its discretionary budget was reduced from $325,878 Last year to $50.000 this year.

1002-> GREENBAUM LEAVES HIS VILLAGER POSTS
James L. Greenbaum is no longer associated with Villager Industries, Inc.; as president and chief operating officer of its Villager‐Ladybug division. A company press release said yesterday that Mr. Green baum's employment has been terminated, but gave no elabo ration. The division's manage ment and control has been as sumed by Richard J. Schwartz, president of Jonathan Logan, Inc., which had taken over management of Villager last November. Mr. Schwartz also declined to comment further on Mr. Greenbaum's leaving. Mr. Greenbaum could not be reached for comment. Mr. Schwartz said that he has been “actively working” at Villager for the past six weeks with William Paul, Charles Glueck and Willard Stotter, who are key Logan executives. “The fall line has been com pleted and much of it already put into production,” said Mr. Schwartz, adding that he was confident of the line's reception and that “it will be keenly competitive with the rest of the industry.” The line will open in New York the week of March 23.

1004-> Goodell Appoints Sweet As Campaign Manager
After a six‐month search, Senator Charles E. Goodell an nounced the establishment yes terday of an election campaign organization that has close ties with Mayor Lindsay and Sena tor Jacob K. Javits. Mr. Goodell, the Republican Liberal candidate seeking elec tion to a full term, named as his campaign manager Robert W. Sweet, a former Deputy Mayor in the Lindsay adminis tration and a former college roommate of Mr. Lindsay. John Trubin, a law partner of Mr. Javits who managed the Senator's re‐election campaign in 1968, was named chairman of the Goodell campaign. Mr. Sweet, a 47‐year‐old lawyer, will manage the day‐to‐day op eration of the campaign, while Mr. Trubin will help direct the over‐all campaign strategy. Assisting Mr. Sweet as deputy campaign manager will be Brian Conboy, the Senator's 31‐year‐ old administrative assistant. Eu gene S. Callender, president of the New York Urban Coalition and a former deputy adminis trator of the Housing and De velopment Administration in the Lindsay administration, was named vice chairman under Mr. Trubin. At a news conference at the Roosevelt Hotel, Mr. Sweet ap peared to be more concerned about opposition from the Con servative party's senatorial can didate, James L. Buckley, than from the four candidates seek ing the Democratic nomination. Without mentioning the Dem ocrats, Mr. Sweet said: “This year in the Senate race the Con servatives seek to destroy the role of the Republican party, and to end the liberal tradition of our state as exemplified by Senators [Herbert H.] Lehman, [Kenneth B.] Keating, [Robert F.] Kennedy, Javits and Goodell. We must defeat this attempt.” In answer to a question, he said that because of “the temper of the times” the Conservative party challenge this year was “a very real problem.” Mr. Sweet said his presence in the Goodell campaign did not indicate that Mr. Lindsay would endorse Mr. Goodell. “You'll have to ask my former roommate,” Mr. Sweet said. “That's something for him to decide.” Among those watching the, news conference was Sid Davidoff, an assistant to Mr Lindsay, who also said that his presence was not an indication that the Mayor would endorse the Senator. Mr. Lindsay has not yet said which candidates he will support in the statewide elections. Mr. Goodell, a former Rep resentative from Jamestown, was named to the Senate by Governor Rockefeller to fill the seat vacated by the death of Senator Kennedy in 1968. He first began trying to as semble the organization for his initial statewide campaign last January. There were indica tions that Mr. Trubin had been the Senator's first choice for campaign manager, but Mr. Tru bin reportedly did not want to devote full time to the cam paign. The Senator, according to aides, also discussed possible campaign roles with a number of persons, including Mr. Davidoff and Fioravante G. Perrotta, a former City Finance Administrator, who now is di recting city campaign opera tions for Governor Rockefeller. One aim of the Senator was to put together a campaign staff that could work with such diverse elements as the Liberal party leadership and the regu lar Republican state organiza tion of Mr. Rockefeller, with whom Mr. Goodell has dis agreed at times. Mr. Sweet said the Goodell and Rockefeller campaigns would be coordinated “as best they can be.” He also said it was “much too early” to say whether the Nixon Administra tion would be aiding the Good ell campaign. Mr. Goodell praised his cam paign staff as “honest, dexter ous and full of human re sources.” He said he hoped to attract a number of youthful volunteers to his campaign.

1005-> P.S.C. Staff Enters Fight on Phone Rise
The staff of the Public Serv ice Commission, acting for the first time in its new role as counsel for consumers, has joined the Federal Government, the city and several business and consumer groups in peti tioning the commission to rescind the $13G.7‐million in terim rate increase granted the New York Telephone Company as of last Feb. 26. In its unusual move, the P.S.C. staff filed a 57‐page brief itemizing its objections to the rate increase. The petition, sub mitted to the new chairman, Joseph C. Swidler, and the five commissioners, said: “The indicated rate of re turn is considerably more than a company rendering inferior service under conditions of offective competition could hope to earn. . . The commission should direct that the interim rate filing be canceled and that amounts collected thereunder be refunded with interest.” The brief was signed by Charles R. Gibson, as sistant counsel for the P.S.C. It was dated March 17 and Mr. Gibson explained in a telephone interview that interested par ties had not been able to re ceive their copies because of the mail strike. Mr. Gibson said the pro cedure was a new one insti tuted by Mr. Swidler. Mr. Swidler, in a telephone interview, said the procedure would be followed in future rate matters. He indicated it was patterned after standard operating procedures of the Federal Power Çommission, which he headed during the Administration of President John F. Kennedy. In effect, the staffs general counsel will act as outside counsel for the consuming pub lic, thus assuring full protec tion of the state in rate mat ters. Under the new procedures outlined by Mr. Swidler, utili ties would file as in the past for their rate increases. An ex aminer, who may or may not be a commissioner, would hear the rate application as would a staff member whose respon sibility would be to file his awn decision separately. This might be in disagree ment with the findings of the examiner, as is the present case with the telephone rate action. If there is a disagreement, the full P.S.C. would ask interested parties to submit their briefs for study by the five commis sioners who would then con duct hearings and hand down a final decision. In the past, the P.S.C. was not bound to hold hearings nor to have the staff present its own views whether in support or against the findings of the commission. Mr. Swidier said he had de cided to operate this way in the present matter since the bulk of the hearings had been held prior to his assumption of the chairmanship last Feb. 2. The full panel of five commis sioners will now be faced with reading the briefs submitted by opponents to the rate increase as well as the 72‐page brief of New York Telephone seeking additional rate increases. Oral hearings will then be convened before the final rate action is decided by the P.S.C. Mr. Gibson said the commis sion's staff based its opposition to the rate increase on the tele phone company's position on is allowable rate of return, its treatment of the surtax, con struction in progress, plant ac counts for future use, its han Hing 6f operations of the West ern Electric Company and claims for inflation allowances. The 16‐page General Services kdministration brief, signed by Viarvin H. Morse, assistant gen ral counsel, urges the P.S.C. to find the new rates “unjust Ind unreasonable and order them canceled.” The brief attacked many of the same points made by the P.S.C. staff and added that there was “no need for any provision for inflation in the rate of return.” The interim rate increase, meant, in general, an 8.5 per cent rise In the cost of basic residential home service, and an 8.1 per cent rise in the cost of direct‐dial long distance toll calls. The average residential bill in the city had been running at about $12 monthly. The commission said that if it determined that the interim rates had been excessive, it would order refunds.

1006-> Governors to Open Parley Amid Signs of Chilly Relations With White House
OSAGE BEACH, Mo., Aug. 9 — The nation's Governors nearly two‐thirds of them Re publicans, gathered today for their annual conference in this humid lake resort amid mount. ing complaints that their rela tions with the Nixon White House had sunk to a new low Despite long‐standing cus tom neither President Nixon nor Vice President Agnew is scheduled to attend the three day meeting of the National Governors Conference, which formally opens tomorrow. Both men participated in last year's session at Colorado Springs. But the concern expressed by some Governors over the White House attitude toward Federal‐state relations went beyond resentment at a pos sible social slight. It was di rected, openly by Democrats but more covertly by Republi cans, at the inability of the Governors to get the attention of the President. Gov. Warren E. Hearnes of Missouri told the news con ference that there was “a dif ferent way they're operating now than in the Johnson Ad ministration,” when men like Buford Ellington of Ten nessee and Ferris Bryant of Florida had ready access to the White House. As for Mr. Agnew, who had been responsible in the past for liaison between the President and the Governors, Mr. Hearnes, a Democrat, said: “I assume he has been given a different course to follow by the White House.” Rallying to defend the Ad ministration, Gov. John A. Love of Colorado, the Repub lican who heads the confer ence, said he did not “agree fully there is a serious prob lem” for the Governors in maintaining contact with the Nixon Administration. But he conceded that there was “a difference in working through the Vice President” and suggested that Governors with problems in Washington would do better to deal di rectly with individual Cabinet officers rather than attempt to work through the White House. Bilateral Chill “It's one thing to talk about our relations with the White House not being good,” Gov ernor. Love said. “They never have been good. But what about the fact that we never get any adequate liaison with Congress?” The chill in relations between the President and the Governors appeared to be bilateral. Re flecting the dissatisfaction of the Governors, the conference leaders only invited one Cabinet officer, Elliot L. Richardson, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to speak at this year's meeting. John A. Volpe, Secretary of Transportation, will be here tomorrow, and George Romney, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, may fly in later, but conference offi cials reported that both men had asked for an opportunity to be heard rather than been invited. Although the Democrats were able to praise the. Federal‐state relations that marked the last years of the Johnson Adminis tration, the Democratic Presi dent set up responsive liaison machinery only after Gover nors of his own party criticized him publicly after Democratic losses in the 1966 elections. Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie of Illinois, a Republican, said he was satisfied with the con tacts he had been able to achieve with the White House. He said he had attended 10 meetings with the President in the last 18 months and thought that was adequate. Governor Hearnes observed that President Johnson, once he had established contact with the Governors, sent them draft copies of proposed Administra tion legislation for comment be fore it was introduced in Con gress. President Nixon his not fol lowed this practice. On some occasions, Repulllican Congres sional leaders have complained that they only received per functory notice of the intro duction of Administration measures, much less the op portunity to consult. Governor Hearnes said his criticism of relations between the White House and the Gov ernors was not intended to re flect on Nils A. Boe, the former Republican Governor of South Dakota who is director of the Office of Inter‐Governmental Relations. “No one could work any harder than he has,” Mr. Eiearns said, “but he is not working from a position of strength.” The failure of Mr. Nixon or Mr. Agnew to schedule an ap pearance at the conference was underscored by elaborate secu rity precautions provided in this sparsely populated resort area southwest of St. Louis. More than 600 National Guardsmen and 80 Missouri highway patrolmen were on duty at Tan‐Tar‐A, the lakeside resort that is the conference headquarters, checking creden tials, keeping out private cars and providing substitute trans portation. Governor Hearnes said that the protection had been arranged because “we fully expected the President or Vice President to be here.”

1007-> No One Answer to Drugs
There are, by official estimate, about 100,000 hard core heroin addicts in New York City and, in addition, perhaps ten to fifteen times this number of persons with serious drug abuse or alcoholism problems. There are thousands of teen‐age heroin addicts and still more who are hooked on glue‐sniffing, LSD and a variety of other dangerous pills and chemicals. The problem of drug abuse among the young seems to be growing in alarming fashion as the average age of heroin addicts declines and the availability of drugs in school cor ridors increases. Children as young as twelve years of age are dying in this city from the use of drugs. It is against this background that Governor Rocke feller has unveiled his program for attacking the drug problem in New York State. He has proposed that the Legislature increase by $15 million the state's metha done program. This is an utterly inadequate attack on a tremendously complex problem. While its use as a substitute for heroin may well offer some degree of help to certain addicts, metha done has not proved successful with all heroin addicts and is, of course, itself addictive. It is not so much a cure for addiction as a far more benign form of it. To supply methadone free to heroin addicts may well relieve them of the need to rob and steal to sustain the drug habit, but it perpetuates the habit. It should be considered a last‐resort help for the hopelessly hooked. An undue emphasis on methadone, moreover, may divert attention from the basic need to attack the roots of the drug‐abuse problem, which are entwined with the roots of other social problems: housing, edu cation, health care, jobs, family instability, the whole ugly knot of problems which affect so many inner city residents adversely. It may undermine other responses to the drug problem, such as psychiatric and other forms of therapy which sometimes rescue addicts from the grip of drugs. * * * Methadone can be considered no answer to the problem of drug abuse among the young. Most drug experts consider a massive educational effort begin ning at the lowest age levels in school absolutely essential to prevent the spread of drug addiction. Neither Governor Rockefeller nor President Nixon nor the city of New York itself has given this sort program sufficient attention. New York City's Addiction Services Agency has held one—only one—seminar for a small group of schoolteachers. Spokesmen for the agency consider this seminar to have been highly successful and they hope to hold more. They need funds. Teachers and school officials must be made far more alert to drug problems and more knowledgeable in handling them. If the drug experts agree on anything, it is that there can be no one answer to the drug‐abuse prob lem and New York must not drift into a one‐answer response to it. Certainly, the drug problem cannot be solved by substituting one drug for another. It is an international problem that will take inter national cooperation in controlling the sources of supply, a social problem that will take some reforms across a broad range of domestic issues and, especially for the young, an educational problem where ignorance is the unscrupulous pusher's ally. To crack down on drugs must not be to neglect the prevention of addiction. The state, along with the city and Federal levels of government, must give educa tion about drugs a higher priority.

1008-> Register for School Voting
After all the planning and controversy, the success of the decentralization of the city's schools depends in large measure on the citizens' concern and partici pation. Only selection of able and conscientious candidates for the new community school boards can translate good intentions into sound policies. A vital element in that process is informed and intelligent balloting by parents. Registration of voters and circulation of nominating petitions begin today. Those already registered for general elections need not reregister for the school board elections. But others who are not registered— as well as many who are not eligible to vote in gen eral elections but are parents of children attending local public schools—are entitled to vote if they reg ister in any public elementary school during the ap pointed hours weekdays and Saturdays this week or next. Failure to make sure of the right to vote now means giving up a voice in the revitalization of the city's schools.

1010-> Food Rationing on List Of British Strike Powers
LONDON, July 17—The Gov ernment assumed powers today to impose food rationing as it published emergency regula tions to cope with problems that might arise from the na tional dock strike. Tonight, Robert Carr, Minis ter of Employment, named Lord Pearson, a 70‐year‐old senior judge, to head a court of inquiry to look into the dead locked wage dispute. Negotiations are at a stand still in the wage dispute be tween the 47,000 dockers and the officials of some 40 British ports. The ports have been closed officially since yester day. These ports handle almost half of Britain's food supply and vast quantities of raw ma terials as well as vital exports of manufactured goods. Little movement in the nego tiations is foreseen until after the court of inquiry reports, and this is not expected until the end of next week at the earliest. In the meantime, the first effects of the strike showed up today in some slight increases in food prices. However, the Agriculture Minister, James Prior, offered assurances that adequate supplies of food were available and he threatened a crackdown on anyone who took advantage of the present situation. The miles of docks and berths in the vast Port of Lon don were left to the seagulls as more than 100 ships stood idle. Dockers in Tower Hamlets and other riverside communities grumbled about canceled vaca tions in Spain, but their mood was not noticeably militant. Some supermarkets reported scarce buying. In South Wales, a 41‐store chain told its man agers to limit customers to six pounds of sugar each. Some had been buying 25 pounds at once. At London's Smithfield Mar ket, Irish beef went up by a penny a pound and there was no Argentine meat offered for sale. Imported lamb went up as much as a shilling (12 cents) a pound. “The test will come on Mon day, which is the big buying day for butchers,” a market spokesman said. In the Scilly Isles, 28 miles off the southwest tip of Ehg land, gasoline was rationed to two gallons a customers as im ports from the mainland were curtailed. In Southampton, the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth sailed for New York a few minutes ahead of schedule after office workers helped load passen gers' baggage and supplies. Hold baggage and passengers' cars were left behind. The emergency regulations, which cover almost any con tingency, go into effect at mid night. They will be debated in Parliament on Monday and will remain in force for 28 days. Parliament is to begin its summer recess next Friday, but It will be recalled on Aug. 12 if the strike continues and it becomes necessary to review the emergency powers. The regulations provide for the use of troops to unload essential supplies, and about 36, 000 men were reported standing by. But it appeared unlikely that they would be ordered to the docks before next week. Them is some political reluctance to use troops while the employers, refuse to negotiate. The major issue is the basic, rate of pay, which the dockers want increased by 80 per cent, to the equivalent of $48 a week. The employers, noting that the base rate also determines piece work rates and overtime pay,, say that the men can now make as much as $84 a week. The employers have offered to increase the minimum pay, level to $48 and add $7.20 in bonuses in ports where the pay system has not been modernized. The dockers, however, have made an increase in base pay a matter of principle. The ern ployers have flatly refused an increase and have refused to negotiate while the dockers are on strike.

1011-> Stolen Rifles Hunted
FORT ORD, Calif., Aug. 9 (UPI) — Military policemen searched today for seven M‐16 automatic rifles stolen outside A training classroom. While the theft, from a recruit training company, may have been a prank, the authorities were as suming it was carried out by someone who wanted the guns.

1012-> The People Vs. Yosemite: Can Our Parks Be Saved?
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif.—It is the season when the snows of winter melt in the back country, when swollen rivers send their waters boiling across the rim of the great granite cliffs of Yosemite Falls to plunge, in a roaring, sun‐span gled cascade, to the valley floor. It is the season when, 2,400 feet below the lip of the thundering Yosemite Falls, another torrent is gathering—the van guard of the nearly 2.5 million vaca tioners who will enter this national park in 1970. Already, in the course of a few dec ades, the flood of human visitors has marred the natural beauty that took millenia to fashion. Today, Park Service officials and rangers wonder how long it will be before Yosemite is ruined by man, his automobile and his careless ways. “A few things are obvious,” says the park's superintendent, Larry Hadley. “Travel is increasing, keeps on increas ing. We are plagued by our outmoded road system, our over‐used environment, our outdated physical plant. We haven't lost the ball game yet. “But the question keeps coming up: How can we accommodate the growing number of visitors and still keep the resource viable?” Hadley worries about the cutoff point, “when we must put the ‘Closed to Vehicles’ sign up.” And an aide, Ranger Larry Quist, feels that “people and vehicles may over whelm Yosemite and other major West ern parks as we know them today unless ee instigate radical shifts in the way people use them.” Some radical changes already have been undertaken at Yosemite, in re sponse to overcrowding and its effects. Visitors in 1970 will find the beginnings of a new master plan in operation. They include a one‐way road system, a sharp eduction in the number of campgrounds, ?? newly built lodge and the closing of the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias to private vehicles. Widespread littering and monumental traffic jams have contributed to the changes. But the major impetus stemmed from several memorable weekends dur ing recent years, times when the pres ence of huge crowds coincided with a temperature inversion. The air of Yosemite Valley, thickened by smoke from thousands of campfires, was further begrimed by the exhaust from as many as 10,000 cars. Hikers at Glacier Point, 7,200 feet above sea level, could not see the valley through a dome of trapped, smog‐ridden air. When photographs of the conditions appeared around the country, the public outcry brought action. As an insurance against a recurrence, rangers have ex cised whole campground units from the valley floor plan. Campers in Yosemite during the June 1‐Sept. 15 season are now limited to 14 days within the park's boundaries; in the valley itself, the limit is seven days. Superintendent Hadley reports “some success” in trimming the number of Yosemite campers, which dipped from 1.1 million in 1968 to 984,000 last year. Moreover, those camping in the park's back‐country areas—that is, outside the crowded, narrow valley — doubled last year, at least in part because of the urging of rangers. Changes in the Mariposa Grove, the stand of sequoias first placed under Federal protection by President Abra ham Lincoln, followed the loss last year of the Wawona Tunnel Tree, the giant through which a road was cut so as to permit stagecoach passage. “I hate to say it was fortunate,” Ranger Quist says, “but the tree was a real headache, a major traffic problem.” The tunnel could not be widened with out damaging the shallow roots of neigh boring sequoias, and virtually every tourist family passing through would stop to have their photograph taken inside. After the tree fell, the Park Service barred all private cars from the five‐mile loop threading the stately sequoias, and a fleet of five 50‐passenger trams was set to work hauling visitors on a 50‐ minute tour. The vehicles were used by 12,000 people before winter snows blocked the loop. Quist admits that a number of vaca tioners complain about the $1 tram fee (50 cents for children), while others wince at the taped narration that shat ters the forest silence. “But you can walk the trail in under an hour,” he says, “and the traffic noise and traffic tangle are gone.” The loading and unloading of the tour vehicles, along with the narration, may irritate some wilderness seekers this sea son and in years to come, Quist said. “We all have individual hangups. My own enjoyment of Yosemite can really be ruptured by motorcycle noise echoing from the cliffs. Almost everyone agrees with me, except the motorcyclists. “Some visitors don't mind standing shoulder to shoulder to view Yosemite Falls; others want to be alone. Some don't mind intermingling their tent pegs with others; some campers just hate the idea.” According to Superintendent Hadley, planners are moving forward with a one‐ way traffic pattern that will soon cover all roads in the vicinity of busy Yosemite Village, Yosemite Lodge, the Ahwahnee Hotel and Camp Curry, the chief man made traffic breeders in the park. “One way roads may just be a stopgap,” he says. “We may have to bar cars from the valley.” There are almost 1,200 square miles in the park, but newcomers almost uni formly head into the seven‐square‐mile gorge of Yosemite Valley, with its wa terfalls, the huge rock forms like El Capitan and Half Dome and the major ity of campgrounds, hotels and lodges. At the parking lot closest to Yosemite Falls, tourists spill out of buses, cars, trailers and truck‐campers. They swarm, cameras at the ready, up the quarter mile‐long asphalted path to the base of the falls. Most return in a matter of minutes, piling into vehicles that back and swerve from the parking lots just in time tothis one. make room for a new caravan of buses, cars and trailers. While the second batchthis one. of vacationers is scurrying toward the falls for a hasty look at one of the West's most notable natural wonders, the initial contingent of sightseers heads hurriedly for the nearest campground, Yosemite Lodge or Camp Curry. “Most of them couldn't think of going to a busy resort city without reserva tions,” says Henry Betty, manager of the Curry Company operations in Yosemite. “But, since this is a park, they just don't make reservations.” As the official concessionaire in the park, the Curry concern can provide a total of 5,148 sleeping spaces or “pil lows” at its hotels, lodges and tent camps. However, on holiday weekends in recent years, as many as 70,000 vis itors a day have come to Yosemite. To be sure, everyone does not spend the night within the parklands. Others carry bedrolls and sleep under the stars in the high country. Still others, travel ing with trailers, sleep in their own vehicles (by choice), while a sizable number spends the night in their sedans and station wagons (not by choice). Fully 5,000 people use Yosemite Val ley's campsites on a busy holiday or midseason day, and they have taken their toll. “The problem here is not cars, but the people who come in them,” says Jack White, who describes himself as “a long suffering Western camper‐outer.” He sums up the complaints of many: “I've had people move right in, take down my tent and set up where my family camped while we were off hiking. The way they litter is fantastic—they never carry stuff to containers. You can't begin to provide enough garbage cans for them, even if you paved the valley with containers.” Ginger Wilson, a tall, outdoorsy, Colo radoan now living in California, com plains about “those outdoor club people who go into the high country in pack trains, like huge cavalry troops. They wear down the trails and the foliage, not to mention the campgrounds. Large groups of campers should he locked out.” Park Service rangers Insist that or ganized campers or wilderness trail groups pack out their litter or bury their refuse with scrupulous care. The rangers “lean” on the worst offenders by impos ing fines or clean‐up chores. Some feel that an educational campaign, like the one that “Smokey the Bear” leveled against forest fires, “might teach pride in the parks and good manners.” Construction of the multimillion‐dollar Yosemite Lodge two years ago has helped the park handle the crowds. The lodge has an airy, glass‐fronted cafeteria and its wood‐faced units under tall pines provide hotel‐type accommodations at $8 to $15 a person a night. Modern cabins with baths and electric heat are $8.75. There are such amenities as a store and laundry. Yosemite Lodge also retains a mix of older structures, including cabins sans baths and a few housekeeping cabins, at lower prices. The long‐time visitor to Yosemite will find the Ahwahnee Hotel—it was built in the grand manner some four decades ago — still serving afternoon tea to tweedy guests in its mammoth lounge and providing meals of cordon bleu qual ity in a baronial dining hall. The prices, alas, show that inflation has reached the parks of the nation as well as its cities. One matter of growing concern to rangers and concession operators is the tremendous use of trailers, truck‐mount ed campers and similar sleep‐in vehicles. They hamper traffic movement on the park's heavy grades, have difficulties negotiating sharp turns and pose a worrisome facilities problem. Yosemite has no “plug‐in” power, water or sewer lines in many parts of the West, Superintendent Hadley cautions. He added: “Our sewage system was built in the late 1930's and needs complete rehabili tation. From the sanitation standpoint, policing 1,140 campsites in this valley is a big and worrisome problem.” Trucks, forklifts and similar devices shuttle around campgrounds, hauling refuse to a distant dump on the fringes of Yosemite. When I first visited the park 35 years ago, such refuse was removed in part by Yosemite's bears; under the glare of flood lights, they helped themselves, in semi‐formal style, at a modest garbage pit. The pit was covered with earth when they had fin ished. Far more grave, from the standpoint of the aging sentimentalist, is the elim ination of the nightly Firefall. Until three years ago, park employes pushed huge burning brands over the precipice of Glacier Point, giving spectators a well remembered view of a spectacular, fiery plunge. “It wasn't a natural feature, and it drew too big a traffic jam,” says one ranger. A short distance from Yosemite Falls, the visitor can seek out a rather melan choly monument to the man who insured the public presence in Yosemite National Park today. “John Muir built here a sugar‐pine cabin in 1869 and made it his home for two years,” reads a simple bronze plaque on a granite boulder. Quoting the pioneer conservationist, who fought long and hard to protect the Sierran for genera tions unborn, the inscription adds: “Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like the autumn leaves.” The tablet commemorating the “noble service which this friend and protector of nature rendered to the people of the United States” was placed by the Cali fornia Conference of Social Work in 1924. The Muir tablet remains legible 46 years after it was put in place, al though it has been marred by bullet marks, and scarred by rock and hammer blows. The park that Muir labored to bring about, also marred and scarred, remains a remarkable instance of the interplan of nature and man, But its future is uncertain as this year's flood tide of visitors prepares to descend.

1013-> ... and the End of a U.S. Boom
Tight money has brought the nation's economic growth to a halt. In the final quarter of 1969, Gross National Product increased by $10.3 billion—but the entire gain was due to inflation. If the current eco nomic stagnation continues, however, there can be no doubt that it will eventually reduce inflation and raise unemployment. The inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment, known to economists as the Phillips curve, poses a serious problem for policymakers in their search for stable economic growth. From 1958 to 1964, when unemployment consistently exceeded 5 per cent, price increases averaged less than 2 per cent a year. But as unemployment dropped below 4 per cent, inflation accelerated, reaching a peak rate of almost 6 per cent last year. But the Phillips curve is not a rigid, unchangeable relationship. It differs not only from country to coun try but from time period to time period, depending on the speed of economic expansion or contraction, degrees of monopoly power, Government restraints, and other factors. The job now facing the Nixon Administration is to supplement fiscal and monetary policy with measures for shifting the American Phillips curve—that is, for reducing the unemployment result ing from a slowing of inflation. What is needed now is a broad program that will bring wage demands back closer in line with reason able expectations of productivity growth; that will restrain the use of monopoly power by either labor or business; that will end Government anticompetitive policies that boost prices or wages, and misallocate resources. At the same time, the Administration should focus more attention on efforts to increase productivity, which is both a powerful anti‐inflation ary force and a source of real economic growth. And the Government should step up cooperative programs with business, labor and civic organizations to create jobs and move the unemployed to jobs they can fill. It is essential to check inflation; but it is every hit as essential to do all that is possible to reduce the hardships of unemployment that have always accom panied the end of boom.

1015-> West German Banks Set Interest‐Rate Rise to 5%
BONN, March 11—West Ger many's bank depositors, whose individual savings averaged $790 at the end of last month, can expect a record interest rate of. 5 per cent as a, result of last week's rise in the bank rate from 6 to 7½ per cent, it became known today. Representatives of Wet Ger many's credit institutes decided at an extraordinary session in Bonn to recommend the addi tion of half a. percentage point to the 4½‐per cent basic inter est rate, effective April 1. The credit institutes pro posed the measure despite the general expectation that the new 7½ per cent bank rate would not last a long time. However, the view prevailed that savers, too, should benefit from the higher interest level.

1016-> U.S. Denies Plan to Cut Vietnam Force by 50%
WASHINGTON, March 25 — The White House said to day that no decisions had been made by the Nixon Admini stration on the next reduction of United States combat forces in South Vietnam. Ronald L. Ziegler, the White House press secretary, made the statement in reply to in quiries about a report in The New York Times today. The report said the Department of Defense was preparing a budget for the fiscal year be ginning July 1 that assumed a total American force of 225, 000 men by mid‐1971, a re duction of more than 50 per cent from the present strength. “The Department of De fense is prepared to say and I'm prepared to say the fig ure is not correct,” said Mr. Ziegler. He did not confirm or deny, however, the report that Pentagon planners were budgeting for a sharp reduc tion from the current author iced strength of 454,000 men.

1017-> A Decorating Idea: Wall‐to ‐Wall Fish
GERDA CLARK certainly has a way with walls. Whether the problem be decorative or remedial, she appears to have solutions in abundance that she is sharing with the public in the six rooms now on view at Abraham & Straus, seventh floor. A wall of fish tanks is the most dra matic answer of fered on what to do with a bare floor ‐ to ‐ ceiling surface. Mrs. Clark arranged 15 glass tanks, framed in chromed metal on shelves, filled them with more than a dozen different species (one type and color to a tank) and lit the kinetic assemblage so that the entire wall appears to glow. The piscatorial decorating was conceived as part of the store's salute to what it calls the cultural, architectural and social renaissance now underway in Brooklyn. The New York Aquarium served as the inspiration for this solution. Although expensive ($3,700 for the tanks and lighting) to recreate in a home (most of the tanks on view had to be made‐to‐order to keep the sizes and shapes compatible) and time con suming to maintain, the idea is valid even without the civic theme. And so are the bows to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (a floor‐to‐ceiling arrange ment of fake hyacinths on shelves might be translated into greens or other real flowering plants) and to the Brooklyn Public Library. The home library shown utilizes hollow wood beams for shelving in an asymmetric arrangement. The beams are fitted over wood strips at tached to the wall, so that there are no visible supports to mar the effect. The wall harmonizes with the ceiling, which is striped with the same type of hollow wood beams. The beams cost $10 a running foot. Wallpaper also works for Mrs. Clark in two settings. In one sparsely furnished, all‐white room a curved wall measuring about 9½ feet high, 22 feet long is covered with a boldly colored and patterned paper ($1,100) Whether or not viewers im mediately think of the stag ing and backdrops used by dance companies at the Brooklyn Academy of Music is not important. Residents of old buildings, with lumpy plaster walls to contend with, will appreci ate the salute to brownstone remodeling in the borough. Renovators or not, tenants and owners might well bor row Mrs. Clark's suggestion of covering their walls with a stucco‐like yellow wall covering ($6.75 a yard). • THE old draftsman's lamp, recently popular on home desks in both full‐sized and mini‐high‐intensity ver sions, has been redesigned for use in the living room. The two‐boom‐type lamp now employs a 250‐watt tungsten halogen light bulb —a light source 3 inches long and a half‐inch wide that produces a highly effi cient, intense white light. Clive Entwistle, the Brit ish designer whose own company, the Tekno Lux Corporation, 44 East 67th Street, is producing the five variations of lamps, has re scaled this traditional design, giving it a more elegant, slender appearance. Instead of the usual springs supporting the pivot ing artn, he has used gravity balance. The lamp has a transparent acrylic plastic base, black and chrome metal booms and fine wires to pro tact the hand in adjusting the lamp shade, which be comes heated in use. The design innovation, be lieved to be the first use of this light bulb, developed about five years ago, in port able lamps, is offered in table, floor and wall lamps at from $75 to $115. Bloomingdale's is carrying four versions in its lamp de partment, fourth floor; the entire Counterpoise collec tion is offered at Lighting Associates, 351 East 61st Street, a wholesale Show room open to architects, de signers and their clients. The bulb, which burns 2,000 hours, is said to last two years in normal use and costs $7 or $8 to replace. It is sold in electrical or light ing supply sources.

1018-> LINDSAY OPTIMISTIC ON MAYORS’ PLAN
BUFFALO, March 5—As the Big Six Mayors’ campaign for more state aid for urban areas approaches the final stages, statewide support is growing rapidly, Mayor Lindsay said here today. Initially, the Mayor said, he was pessimistic about gaining statewide support. But as the Mayors’ tour around the state continues, Mayor Lindsay said, he is getting “cautiously opti mistic.” Mr. Lindsay assessed the pos sibility of getting more state aid for the cities after the Mayors from the six largest cities in the state presented their program here as the guests of Mayor Frank A. Sedita. More than 300 persons crowded the tiered, semicircu lar Council chambers here to hear the presentation by Mayors Lindsay and Sedita and the other Mayors, Lee F. Alex ander of Syracuse, Erastus B. Corning of Albany, Alfred B. Del Bello of Yonkers and Stephen May of Rochester.

No injuries were reported. Both bombs blew out glass in the front lobbies of the main offices. Both explosions are under investigation. The police said it was too early to say whether a link could he established be tween them. SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 3 (UPI) — A bomb thrown into an unoccupied patrol car ex ploded yesterday while police men were investigating a bur glary complaint in the predom inantly Negro Fillmore district.

1021-> U. S. CHALLENGES MINE UNION VOTE, ALLEGING FRAUD; Asks Court to Void Boyle's Election and Order New Supervised Balloting; NEW CHARGE IN SLAYING; President of Kentucky Local Is Accused of Perjury by Yablonski Grand Jury
WASHINGTON, March 5— The Government moved today to invalidate the re‐election of W. A. Boyle as president of the United Mine Workers of America and to require a new election under Federal super vision. Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz announced that the Justice Department had filed a charge of fraud in Federal District Court here under little used provision of the Landrum‐Griffin Act of 1959 that makes it possible for the Government to challenge an allegedly corrupt union elec tion. Mr. Shultz, after a 60‐day investigation by his department of Mr. ‐Boyle's defeat Dec. 9 of Joseph A. Yablonski, the leader of anti‐Boyle insurgents, produced massive documentary support for his charges of mis conduct. Official Is Indicted In Cleveland, the Federal grand jury investigating the murder of Mr. Yablonski in dicted the president of a Ken tucky local of the mine union on a charge of perjury. Mr. Yablonski and his wife and daughter were, slain Dec. 31 in their home in Clarksville, Pa., and the jury has been seeking the source of funds allegedly paid to the accused killers. Today's indictment charged Dillard Couch, 56 years old, of Bledsoe, Ky., president of Local 6645 of the union, with giving false testimony on the cashing of union checks. Answering the Labor Depart ment charge, a union spokesman asserted that the Government was seeking to “disfranchise the 81,000 coal miners” who had voted for Mr. Boyle. The union's general counsel, Edward Carey, charged that the department had moved against the union on “miniscule” charges and pledged to “fight this to the fullest ex tent” in the courts. Mr. Carey told newsmen that the Government move had been “engineered by lower echelon Government people who have been in there for 20 to 25 year of prior Democratic Administra tions.” “They may be trying to em barrass President Nixon by mak ing him seem antilabor,” the lawyer said. In announcing the election challenge, Secretary Shultz dis closed that the Labor and Jus. tice Departments would ask the courts for a separate injunc tion “to keep the United Mine Workers and its officers from spending union funds without reporting to the department as required by Title II of the Lan drum‐Griffin Act.” One of the items in the de partment's eight‐count charge against the union, he said, is that “the union has failed and is still failing to maintain rec ords and to require its subor dinate districts to maintain records” on financial transac tions required by law to be publicly disclosed. Campaign Charge This was one of Mr. Yablon ski's persistent campaign charges against Mr. Boyle dur ing the election campaign that began last June. Mr. Yablonski, a 27‐year member of the union's Inter national Executive Board, called Mr. Boyle a “dictator” and an “embezzler” and filed complaints with the Labor De partment alleging intimidation and threats against his parti sans and himself. The slayings took place three weeks after the election. Five persons, including a Tennessee official of the mine union, have been charged in the slayings. Secretary Shultz declared to day that the union had been cooperative “in almost every re spect in our evaluation of the election.” Allegations Listed He told reporters the depart ment's $500,000 post‐election investigation involving 200 Fed eral agents and 4,400 interviews here and in the coal fields had led to the following allegations: ¶The union failed to provide adequate safeguards for a fair election. ¶It denied candidates the right to post observers at local union polling places and at the site of the counting of ballots here. ¶It failed to conduct the elec tion in accordance with its own constitution by, among other things, failing to require local unions to hold a membership meeting to set the time and place of voting. ¶The union failed to elect its officers by secret ballot, as re quired by law, “in that many members were required or per mitted to cast ballots in such a manner that the member voting could be identified with the choice expressed.” ¶Members were denied the right to vote for the candidate of their choice “without being subject to penalty, discipline or improper interference or re prisal.” ¶Some members were denied the right to vote at all because elections were not held at some locals. ¶The union used dues mon ey “to promote the candidacy of its incumbent international officers,” and used the union magazine, The U.M.W. Journal, to support Mr. Boyle. ¶The union failed “and is still failing” to maintain records of financial expenditures re quired to be publicly reported under the Landrum‐Griffin Act. Representative Ken Hechler, Democrat of West Virginia, an active campaigner for Mr. Yab Ionski, said the Labor Depart ment evidence “confirms the truth of what the murdered Joseph A. Yablonski said over and over again in his cam paign.” He called for Mr. Boyle's resignation. ¶Neither the Labor Depart ment's decision nor a District Court order requiring a new election will have any effect on Mr. Boyle's incumbency. The union president, 65 years old, is scheduled to be formally in stalled for a new five‐year term in the $50,000‐a‐year post next month. Under the Landrum‐Griffin Act, if the Government can per suade the court that its allega tions are true, the court will be required to set the date and the terms of re‐election, super vised at each of some 1,300 locals and at regional, district and headquarters levels by La bor Department observers. This will probably not take place before next year. Mr. Yablonski's vice‐presi dential running mate last year, Elmer Brown, a disabled miner from Delbarton, W. Va., has said that since Mr. Yablonski never conceded his defeat in the December election he con siders himself “the legal presi dent of the union.” He apparently is preparing to make a new race for the presidency with two working, miners, Elijah Wolford of Mor gantown, W. Va., and Mike Trbovich of Clarksville. In a separate development today, the Senate Labor sub committee announced that it would hear testimony March 17 on charges that Mr. Boyle “en gineered last June a 30 per cent increase in the monthly U.M.W. pension stipend to re tired miners to further his re election campaign.” This was another Yablonski campaign charge. Cleveland Indictment The Cleveland indictment against Mr. Couch said he cashed U.M.W. checks for $573 and $360 last October paid by the Research and Information Committee of District 19. District 19 is in the Ken tucky‐Tennessee coal fields, where the Government search for evidence in the murder has been concentrated. Mr. Couch, who was arrested at his Kentucky home by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was identified in U.M.W. records as a long time loyalist to Mr. Boyle. The indictment said that Mr. Couch had lied in twice deny ing to the grand jury that he had been accompanied on check‐cashing trips to Middles boro, Ky., the District 19 head quarters, by Tast Price, another union member from Crummies, Ky. In the portion of his grand jury testimony included in the indictment, Mr. Couch swore that on Oct. 2 and again on Oct. 13 he made trips to Mid dlesboro to cash checks total ing $935 from the Research Committee in the company of Noah Doss, a field representa tive of District 19. He denied that Mr. Price, who has been one of 22 union witnesses be fore the grand jury in Cleve land but is otherwise unidenti fied, had been with them. The indictment was labeled Government “propaganda” by William J. Prater, a field rep resentative in District 19, who told newsmen that the research committee was an “absolutely legitimate” secret organizing group. Mr. Prater said the Govern ment was seeking to “pressure” witnesses by indicting Mr. Couch. He said that the pay ments to Mr. Couch were “probably” for expenses and the $5 per diem paid to union organizers. Sources close to the investi gation said they believed others had received identical $935 payments. Since there are re ported to be no records or ac counts covering any of the transactions, the individual payments could have been pooled to form a fund of more than $20,000 and used for any purpose, the sources said.

1022-> VAN CLIBURN SHINES IN LISZT CONCERTO
The Moscow Philharmonic closed out its concentrated, eight‐concert New York mini season last night at Carnegie Hall. Kiril Kondrashin, conduc tor, and Van Cliburn, pianist, who have been heard with each other, off and on, since Mr. Cli burn became famous by win ning the Tchaikovsky Prize in Moscow in 1958, were featured in the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1. The concerto is Mr. Cliburn's meat, and Mr. Kondrashin kept the orchestra out of the piano's way except when it was needed. The orchestra was so much out of Mr. Cliburn's way and Mr. Cliburn is such a grand‐style pianist that sometimes he out sounded the whole orchestra, even in tutti passages. He gave the noblest, grandest kind of performance in his own inim itable way. Mr. Kondrashin and the or chestra, without Mr. Cliburn, gave Mozart's Symphony No. 35 in D (“Haffner”) and Rich ard Strauss's“Ein Heldenleben.” THEODORE STRONGIN

1026-> 26 Hours of Tension: 4,000 Scouts and a Plague Scare in a New Mexico Camp
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Aug. 9—For 26 hours this weekend, Boy Scouts and their parents in all parts of the country knew that a 12‐year‐old boy had died of what New Mexico health officials called “a communi cable disease.” What most of these people did not know was that state health officials thought that the highly contagious form of plague, called pneumonic, was responsible for the boy's death. He died Thursday while on a hike at the Philmont Boy Scout Ranch at Cimarron, near the Colorado border. Because of their suspicion, health officials sealed off the ranch from contact with the outside world. The quarantine affected the 4,000 scouts and staff, including 244 boys and leaders from the metropolitan New York City area, camping at the Philmont Ranch. A spokesman at the ranch said there was no evidence of panic among the campers. There were perhaps a few more calls at sick bay for headaches, but leaders continued activities to maintain calm. Such was not the case out side the ranch. An emergency telephone desk was set up to handle the flood of calls that started coming in after the quarantine story appeared in news media around the country. The center, which was in operation from 6 P.M. mountain daylight time Friday until mid night Saturday, received about 400 calls an hour from as far away as Honolulu on the seven telephone lines in operation. About 20 doctors across the country called the ranch to offer their professional services. ‘Assumed the Worst’ “We assumed the worst,” Dr. Bruce Storrs of the State Health Department in Santa Fe said today in an interview. “We had no alternative but to quarantine because the Scouts were a camp of tran sients coming and going daily to all parts of the country,” he said. “We were concerned for the safety of a large part of the nation,” Dr. Storrs said. He added that, under the same set of circumstances, “I'd do it again.” Dr. Storrs knew that nine years ago a Harvard professor who acquired plague in New Mexico flew to Cambridge feeling well, but became ill with the bubonic form of the disease and died without the correct diagnosis having been made. Health officials still do not know the specific cause of death of the Scout, 12‐year‐old James Morris of Jackson, Mich., Dr. Storrs emphasized that it was not plague. Even so, the incident illus trates that plague is becoming increasingly important as more people turn to outdoor recrea tion, such as camping. Compatible Symptoms The possibility of pneumonic plague, Dr. Storrs said, was raised by the pathologist who performed an autopsy on the boy. His findings, he said, in cluded hemorrhages of the lung, heart, thymus gland and spleen, which these doctors considered compatible with pneumonic plague. These find ings are nonspecific and can be associated with many diseases. Plague, however, was in the back of the doctors’ minds. Four of the six cases reported to Public Health Service offi cials to date this year, plus all five of the cases last year, and 28, or 80 per cent of the cases reported in the country during the last 20 years, have occurred in New Mexico. Plague in endemic in the rodent popu lation of the Western third of the United States, which re ports a small number of cases almost every year. Plague is caused by the bac teria Yersinia (formerly Pas teurella) pestis. Humans usually contract plague from the bite of an infected rodent or rabbit flea or by contact with infected animal tissues, such as prairie dogs or squirrels. About four to six days later, the victim gets a sudden shaking chill, fever, generalized muscle sore ness and painful swollen lymph nodes, or bubos, in his armpit or groin. This form is called bubonic. The plague bacteria in any of the lymph nodes can enter the blood and settle in the lungs, and from such a secondary pneumonia an epidemic or pneumonic plague can develop. Such epidemics occurred in American cities in the first quarter of this century, killing 284 of the 432 persons who contracted it. As the 4,000 Scouts and staff from 31 states continued their normal activities on the 214 square‐mile ranch, Dr. Daniel E. Johnson and his assistants did the key laboratory experi ments in the State Health De partment's Adobe building on the New Mexico campus here. A rapid test, called fluorescein antibody, was negative for plague, Dr. Storrs said. A spe cific laboratory diagnosis de pends on results of cultures and animal experiments that will require several more days. Because plague is an interna tionally quarantinable disease, New Mexico health officials conferred yesterday with Dr. David J. Sencer and Dr. Philip Brachman at the Center for Dis ease Control in Atlanta. Dr. Sencer is director and Dr. Brachman chief epidemiologist for this Public Health Service center. Boy Arrived Tuesday After listening to reports of the boy's medical history and the laboratory studies, Dr. Sen cer and Dr. Brachman agreed that his death was not caused by plague. At 5:25 yesterday afternoon, New Mexico healtl officials lifted the quarantine that state policemen and rand hands had enforced since 3:30 Friday afternoon. Health officials could not re member a quarantine having been placed on so large a pub lic group since 1924. The boy whose death led tc last weekend's quarantine ar rived at the ranch last Tuesday with his father, who was par ticipating in a Cub Scout lead ership training program. With them also was Mrs. Morris and a 14‐year‐old daughter, Sue. The Morrises left Philmon sometime Friday before the quarantine was imposed. The Philmont public relations di rector, William H. Boyer, said that the group attending the training session collected money for the family's plane fare from Denver to Jackson, Mich. When the quarantine was imposed, ranch officials called adult leaders to an emergency conference and explained the situation, so that they could in turn inform the Scouts. Mr. Boyer said it would have been impossible for the ranch to get in touch with the parents of the 3,500 campers across the country. The ranch notified national Scout headquarters, he said, and had them relay the information to regional Scout executives. Mostly, Scout offi cials had to rely on parents to call in. Meanwhile, campers coming to Philmont had to be alerted, when possible, to the quaran tine. Most of the campers ar rived in a group with their leaders, Mr. Boyer said. Groups from the New York City area arrived chiefly by a charter air service to Colorado Springs, and then by bus to the ranch. Others arrived by chartered bus. Leaders on their way to the camp telephoned the ranch, and were advised to stay where they were for 24 hours, and to follow news re ports. Six huidred scouts were on their way to the ranch.

1029-> Theater: Prospect Company Pays Visit to Edinburgh Festival
EDINBURGH, Scotland, Sept. 1—Britain is fortunate in having many subsidized drama companies, some well knowc, some almost un known, but all of them have a home of their own, a base theater. All of them, that is, except one, for there is the Prospect Theater Company, which is a touring group moving from town to town. For the last few years the Prospect has found some kind of home, or at least a shelter, at the Edinburg Festival, where it mounts most of its new productions before mov ing on round the country. Last year, for example, the company had its most nota ble success so far with pro ductions of Shakespeare's “Richard II” and Marlowe's “Edward II,” both starring Ian McKellen. For this Edinburgh Festival the Prospect company is a little less ambitious, offering Shakespeare's “Much Ado About Nothing” and “Bos well's Life of Johnson,” an entertainment devised by the company's artistic director, Toby Robertson. The “Much Ado” has been staged by Mr. Robertson in rather strange way. A pro gram note assures us that “the play is set in a Spanish colony, sometime before the end of the 19th century.” With all respect, it is not, and it difficult to see what is gained by having almost everyone dressed as Mexican bandits (even though it gives the men the opportunity to wear handsome mustaches), languorous playing or guitars, a little vigorous gunplay, and Beatrice and Benedick making love to the rankly romantic strains of Villa Lobos. It appears that Mr. Robin son wanted to set the play somewhere where life was cheap and love was sud den. Unfortunately Shakes peare does not lend itself kindly to transposition to a Latin republic — the speeches sit oddly on gun‐toting cow boys — and the transparency of the device very soon be comes tedious. The cast is dominated by a most excellent Benedick, the lean graceful and fiery John Neville. Mr. Neville is one of those actors who im prove with keeping. As a young man his very virtues — a cool and handsome man ner, an air of actorly distinc tion and looks slightly too handsome to be readily cred ible — told against him. Now, approaching his maturity as an actor, his good looks de veloping into something in teresting and believable and his elegance taking on the weight and style of experi and more than fulfilling, his and more than fulfilling his early promise. He speaks Shakespeare with the tongue of a lark but, more important, the heart of a lion. He can bring total conviction to a single decla ration of love, and his acting is so unmannered, so clean, that it scarcely seems acting at all. And above all he is, that rare thing, graceful. Every movement, every word is presented with a modest flourish. This is great classic acting, all the more welcome perhaps for coming at a time when such a high Style is mildly unfashionable. This Benedick finds a spir ited Beatrice in Sylvia Syms, and an excellently brooding Don Pedro in Timothy West. But the production as a whole was no Mexican fiesta, and when Mr. Neville was ab sent from the scene the play and the heart flagged. “Boswell's Life of John son” was a strange, interest ing but ultimately unsatisfy ing entertainment. It was ba sicallyundramatic, gained but little from its staging, and could just have well been one of those earnest, scholarly and praiseworthy British Broadcasting Corpo ration radio programs that it so much resembled. The play has been based on Johnson's writings and life by Bill Dutton and Ian Thomas, but it gives us not too much insight into the noble lexicographer. An inter polated passage, burlesqued beyond reason, from the great man's tragedy “Irene,”. was a mistake as was the it relevant introduction of Shakespeare festival scene, a festival that. Johpson had no connection with. The evening deals more interestingly with. Boswell; than with Johnson—partly, suspect, because, the source for Boswell's life, chiefly his “London Journal,” is so much more frank and racy than the officially authorized Johnsonian material. John son himself emerges “ as a string of quotations held to, gether by a disorderly but uneventful life. The acting was excellent and Mr. Robertson's direction had pace, style and polish. Mr. West excelled as the shambling, dogmatic Johnson, but Julian Glover's impish and amusing Boswell made him a fair match. As David Garrick, Mr. Neville was per fect, Miss Syms eharrhed as Mrs. Thrale and Clifford Rose touched off Oliver Goldsmith to the life. Yet it was an evening full of talk—and most of the talk was familiar.

1030-> HOUSE UNIT VOTES WELFARE REFORM FAVORED BY NIXON
WASHINGTON, March 5— President Nixon's proposal to guarantee every American family a minimum income sup plied in whole or part by the Government was overwhelming ly approved today by the House Ways and Means Com mittee. Text of Nixon statement is printed on Page 35. The vote was 21 to 3, an auspicious beginning for a con troversial program that is now expected to win easy approval on the House floor later this month. All Republicans on the committee supported the bill; the three negative—were cast by Democrats—Representatives Al Ullman of Oregon, Phil M. Landrum of Georgia and Omar Burleson of Texas. It was probably d most significant Congressional vic tory the Nixon Administration has won in its 14 months in office. Last October, when the welfare bill was introduced, the measure was given only a small chance of ever emerging from committee. Mills May Manage Bill Today, it sailed out effort lessly, with the committee chairman, Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, once regarded as a stubborn opponent, announcing that he would co‐sponsor the measure and would probably serve as its floor manager. The Family Assistance Pro gram, which is the heart of the new welfare proposal, would guarantee a basic income to every family in the country, even if it included a wage earn er. The basic income for a couple with two children would be $1,600. The plan contains a require ment designed to encourage recipients to get off the welfare rolls. To receive benefits, the head of the aided household would be required to register for employment or job training. Benefits would decrease as a family's earnings increased and would be eliminated alto gether when earnings reached $3,920 a year. Committee approval, usually a preliminary event only mod estly observed, was celebrated today as though it were final passage. President Nixon issued a statement hailing the move. The White House held a brief ing on the bill. Administrations officials were openly jubilant. “Not every Congress,” Mr. Nixon declared, “has the op portunity to enact a fundamen tal reform of our basic institu tions. The 91st Congress now has that historic opportunity.” Senate prospects for the Nixon welfare program are re garded as generally good. The principal danger there, from the Administration's viewpoint, is that liberals may increase the cost of the plan so much that the cost‐conscious House will balk at any compromise. Under present estimates, the Nixon welfare program in its first year of operation would cost about $4.4‐billion more than current welfare spending. of $4‐billion. It would go into effect July 1, 1971. Administration officials esti mate that it will increase the number of those eligible for welfare assistance from the current figure of 1.7 million families, or 6.8 million persons to 4.6 million families, or 22 million to 23 million persons. The legislation also consoli dates into a single class the three adult welfare categories of aid to the aged, blind and disabled, and sets a new mini mum income of $110 a month for individuals and $185 for couples. These figures were in creased over the Nixon recom mendations at Mr. Mills’ request. Although the Ways and Means Committee made a dozen changes in the Adminis tration bill before reporting it today, the bill clearly remained the measure the President sub mitted four months ago, only rather gently adapted by Mr. Mills and his colleagues. The welfare bill will go to the House floor under a “closed rule,” an arrangement that pro hibits amendments there and limits the members to voting for or against the measure. The vote will probably come before the end of the month. The only adverse response to the Welfare legislation came from the United States Cham ber of Commerce, which issued a statement today contending that the Family Assistance Pro gram was a first step toward a guaranteed annual income. The Chamber's board of di rectors voted to oppose the leg islation on the ground that it would produce a tax, increase or an inflationary deficit, or both, without solving the basic problems of welfare families. Evolution of Mills's Stand A major provision of the welfare legislation would re quire the Federal Government to meet 30 per cent, of the cost if a state decided to raise the Family Assistance Program floor above the national minimum. Of the $4.4‐billion additional cost, about $3‐billion would be benefits to the poor, two‐thirds of it to families with some earnings. About $600‐million would finance day care centers for children, to encourage welfare mothers to work. The remaining $500‐million would reimburse states for welfare spending. California would realize the largest saving, about $173‐mil lion. Rough estimates indicate that New York would save $62.4‐million, Massachusetts $41.2‐million, Illinois $39.8 million and Pennsylvania $38 9‐rhillion. The evolution of the support demonstrated today for the Nixon welfare reforms is, in large part, the story of Repre sentative Mills and the slow, steady, campaign that was waged in closed sessions to Win his neutrality and ulti mately his active support. There was an unusual meas ure of cooperation between the Democratic chairman and the Republican Administration throughout. In executive ses sions of the committee, an of ficial of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was always present at Mr. Mills's invitation. Introduced last October, the welfare bill lay dormant as tax, reform dominated Congres sional concern for the rest of 1969. In January, Mr. Mills startled Administration officials by asking them what bill they would prefer to have the com mittee consider first. They chose welfare, and the chair man complied. Throughout open hearings on the bill, Mr. Mills had never demonstrated any enthusiasm for the underlying principle of helping to support the working poor. As 1970 opened, liberal Democrats had not rallied be hind the program and one of its authors said, “It looks bad.” Basic Team Starts Work Then the basic Administra tion team went to work. It consisted of Secretary of La bor George P. Shultz and an Assistant Secretary, Jerome M. Rosow; John G. Veneman, Un der Secretary of Health, Edu cation and Welfare, and an As sistant Secretary, Robert E. Patricelli. With the aid of the ranking Republican on Ways and Means, John W. Byrnes of Wisconsin, they patiently educated the minority committee members to what they consider the substan tive virtues of the program and the political desirability of sup porting it. In early February, the Secre tary of Health, Education and Welfare, Robert H. Finch, spent three days in the committee hearings, but the Administra tion's best judgment was that Mr. Mills was still undecided. Then, in the, third week of February, Mr. Mills called the welfare bill up for a formal reading. On the first day, while the Nixon men held their breath, the committee steamed through the first 10 of the bill's 90 pages, approving without change the family assistance program, its income figures and the concept of assistance for the working poor. When the committee finished its work, it appeared that Mr. Mills was neutral. He obviously would not obstruct committee approval of the measure, but he might vote against it on the floor. Then he did a little reshaping himself, raising the adult in come guarantees and inserting the requirement that recipients register for work. Ultimatey, it was disclosed that he would co‐sponsor the bill with Mr. Burns. Mr. Veneman, beaming, re marked, “The chairman has been most cooperative from the beginning.”

1031-> Lindsay Gives Blood In Appeal for Donors
Dramatizing an acute shortage of blood for transfu sions in local hospitals, Mayor Lindsay made a 15‐ minute stop at Bellevue Hos pital yesterday morning to donate a pint of his own. The Mayor issued a public appeal for volunteer donors after a statement by the chief of the city's hospital system, Dr. Joseph T. English, that “the shortage is so critical that we have less than one day's supply.” As Mr. Lindsay lay on a stretcher, a blood technician, Jacquelyn Rosa, smiled for news photographers and re cited the usual line about donors: “The Mayor has good veins.” According to Dr. Julian Schorr, director of clinical services for the Greater New York Blood Program, blood is in especially short supply during vacation months when volunteer donors at large corporations are away. Dr. Schorr reported a gratifying response to the appeal, but said 300 to 400 additional volunteers each day would be needed to maintain an adequate supply over the long Labor Day weekend. He asked New Yorkers to phone UN 1.7300 to make appointments for blood do nations.

1033-> Graffman Communicates Beauty Of Piano as Musical Instrument
To hear a recital such as the one played at Philharmonic Hall last night by Gary Graff man is to he reminded anew of the magnificence of the piano a: an instrument of musical communication and of the rarity of pianists who succeed in realizing its potential. Although Mr. Graffman is only 41, he has been perform ing in public for 23 years and could conceivably have begun In show signs of boredom with the business. But last night he played as though his love affair with the piano and its music had just begun. His energy seemed inexhaust ible, his technique had the pol ish of a newly honed precision tool, and his interpretations had the vitality and freshness of new life in spring. ?? Sonata in B minor was at the heart of a program that began with Schumann's Sonata in G minor (Op. 22) and had Haydn's Sonata in G major (1784) and Beethoven's “Appas sionata” Sonata in its second half. The Liszt proved to be the most extraordinary in inter pretation in that Mr. Graffman made it seem altogether reason able. His approach to the ram bling, rhetorical one‐movement behemoth did not depart nota Ny from traditional practices, but somehow he made every thing hang together more con vincingly than this listener had thought possible. He probably achieved this by careful control of tempos and dynamics, but he had to start with a concept of unity in the work that is not common to most people who play it. After this came the wonder ful little Haydn piece that he did as crisply and neatly and charmingly as if he had been born in the 18th century. No heroics, no grand manner, just pure delight. Then came the “Appassion ata,” and it was pure Beethoven, taut, intense, dramatic, but not overwrought. The Schumann was less compelling than the other works, but its last move ment may never have been played with greater clarity at such speed.

1035-> Postal Unions Open Pay Talks With U.S.
WASHINGTON, March 25— Officials of the Federal Govern ment and representatives of seven unions of Post Office De partment employes began nego tiations today on union de mands for a sizable, retroactive pay increase. The negotiations, even if they are successful, will produce no final settlement of the unions' demands, but only the terms of an Administration recommen dation to Congress. In two meetings of about two hours each today, in the after noon and in the evening, top Administration officials, includ ing two members of President Nixon's Cabinet, were pre sented with the detailed union demands for the first time. While no official announce ment was made, it was learned, that what the unions were ask Wing for was a 12 per cent pays increase, retroactive to last Oct. 1, and a minimum salary of $6,000 a year. While the pay scale of the union whose discontent has been the most widely publi cized — the letter carriers ranges from $6,176 to $8,442 a year — many other postal workers, such as the mail handlers, make less. In the 10‐grade postal pay system, the starting salary is $4,522. The starting salary is less than $6,000 in each of the first four grades of the pay system. In addition, the unions were said to be demanding that the Government pay the full cost of health insurance for the postal workers and that it guarantee amnesty for all postal employes who may have violated the laws forbidding strikes by em ployes of the Federal Govern ment. Representatives of the Gov ernment and the unions con firmed, however, that no agree ment whatever had yet been reached. The talks will resume tomorrow morning. The House and Senate have passed very different versions of a Federal pay increase bill, both of which, however, would increase the pay of postal workers by considerably less than the unions apparently are demanding. The Senate and House bills provide less retro activity as well as smaller in creases than the unions seem to want. Congress is under no legal obligation to accept whatever package is agreed to by the union and Administration ne gotiators. And some difference of opinion on whether Con gress ought to do so appeared to develop between the Senate and House members of a con ference committee that met today in an attempt to work out a compromise. Senators on the conference committee appeared willing to wait for the outcome of the negotiations taking place down town. House members, in the words of Representative Arnold Olsen, Democrat of Montana and a member of the commit tee, “want to pass a meaning ful pay increase bill.” The entire House of Repre sentatives agreed that all its members would hold them selves available to return to Washington on 24 hours' no tice to act on a postal pay bill, if necessary and possible, dur ing the Congressional Easter recess that begins tomorrow night. The Senate had never planned an extended Easter va cation. The House‐Senate conference did reach two basic, although imprecise, agreements‐in‐princi ple, according to members of the committee. The first was that whatever increase was enacted would be retroactive. But no date for the start of the retroactivity was determined. The second was that the fi nal version of the bill would provide pay increases for other civilian employes of the Fed eral Government and for mem bers of the armed forces. The conferees did not, however, agree on whether these in creases would be precisely the same as those accorded the postal workers. The negotiations are being carried out under what appears to be a threat of a renewal of the postal strike Monday after noon by the National Associa tion of Letter Carriens, one of the seven unions involved. The president of that union, James H. Rademacher, said at the outset of the afternoon ne gotiating session that he was “mandated” by his members to take action—he did not specify what, but he apparently meant another work stoppage—if an agreement were not reached in “five days from this minute.” That was at 2 P.M., when the negotiations were getting under way. Officially, the Government's chief negotiator is E. T. Klas sen, the Deputy Postmaster General. But Postmaster Gen eral Winton M. Blount stayed through the afternoon and eve ning sessions and Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz put in a brief appearance at the start of the afternoon meeting. The chairman of the negotiat ing team for the unions was James C. Gildea, executive as sistant to George Meany, the president of the A.F.L‐C.I.O. Mr. Meany personally designated Mr. Gildea as the chief negotia tor “acting at the unanimous request of the unions in the postal service,” he said. The presidents of the seven unions were all present for the sessions. At the evening session, Mor ris Biller, president of the Man hattan‐Bronx Postal Union, which represents a number of postal clerks in New York City, tried to be allowed to enter the bargaining session. But by the apparently unanimous agree ment of both the Government and the other unions, he was kept out. Spokesmen for the negotia tors said the union had no right to enter the bargaining because it is not legally recognized as the representative for any pos tal workers group on a na tional basis, and these are na tional talks. The near‐end of the work stoppages by postal employes today caused the Post Office Department to announce an end of the embargo on first class and air mail, providing parcels and letters carry zip‐code num bers. The Post Office Department also announced that private mail services, which are ordin arily illegal, would be declared illegal again at midnight to morrow. The statutory ban on such private services was sus pended during the worst of the strike. The unions involved in the negotiations, in addition to the National Association of Letter Carriers, are the National Rural Letter Carriers Association, Na tional Association of Post Of Ace and General Services Main tenance Employes, National Association of Special Delivery Messengers, United Federation of Postal Clerks, National Asso ciation of Post Office Mail Han dlers, Watchmen, Messengers and Group Leaders, and Na tional Federation of Post Office Motor Vehicle Employes.

1036-> MACY'S EARNINGS SLIP IN QUARTER
Rising costs adversely af fected profits of two of the three department store chains that reported results yesterday for recent periods. For instance, R. H. Macy & Co., Inc., had its first quarterly earnings decline in seven years in the three months ended Jan. 31, which included the nor mally heavy Christmas busi ness. The Dayton‐Hudson Cor poration showed lower annual earnings, reflecting the general decline in consumer confidence during the second half of last year and the impact of its expansion program. Alexander's, Inc., on the other hand, registered record sales and earnings for the 16 and 28 weeks periods ended Feb. 7. The second fiscal quarter was the best for any quarter in its 42‐year history. R. H. Macy & Co., Inc., had sales of $290,255,000 in the 13 weeks ended Jan. 31, up 4.6 per cent from the $277, 474,000 volume in the pre ceding year's period. Earnings were $12,202,000, or $1.26 a share, on 9,388,874 average number of shares outstanding down from $12,249,000, or $1.31 a share, on 9,151,413 shares a year earlier. For the semiannual period of 26 weeks, Macy's sales rose to a record $514,174,000 from $487,843,000 for the 26 weeks to Feb. 1, 1969, a gain of 5.4 per cent. Earnings were $17, 669,000, or $1.82 a share, com pared with $17,625,000, or $1.87 a share, on fewer shares in the preceding year's period. For the 52 weeks, Macy's sales rose 7.1 per cent to a record $904,811,000 from $844, 855,000 for the 52 weeks to Feb. 1, 1969. Earnings in the year rose to $24,409,000, or $2.48 a share, from $22,737, 000, or $2.37 a share. Macy's opened three stores during 1969 bringing the num ber as of Jan. 31 to 62. Two new stores are scheduled to open this fall. The company has said its capital expendi tures will be about $40‐million to $50‐million annually in fis cal 1970 and 1971, so there is no letup in its expansion program, according to a com pany official. The Dayton Hudson Corpora tion, formerly the Dayton Cor poration, which operates de partment, discount and special ty stores and owns and oper tes shopping centers, had a net income of $23,673,000 in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, equal to $1.49 a share. This was down from the $24,558,000, or $1,54 a share, earned in the preceding fiscal year which was restated to include results of J. L. Hudson Company, ac quired last June. Revenues rose to $888,357,000 from $811, 981,000. Alexander's, Inc., realized an 18 per cent increase in profits in the 16 weeks ended Feb. 7 on a sales gain of 4.6 per cent and a 16.8 per cent profit rise on a 4.5 per cent rise in sales in the 28 weeks ended Feb. 7, it was reported yesterday by the eight‐store chain. Net sales for the 16 weeks were $94,378,000 up from $90, 239,000 a year earlier. Net earnings were $2,986,000, or 67 cents a share, on 4,457,021 shares compared with $2,530, 000, or 58 cents a share, on 4,390,191 shares, bringing the half‐year net to $4,762,000, or $1.07 a share, from $4,076,000, or 93 cents a share, for the 28 weeks to Feb. 8, 1969. Sales for the semi‐annual period in creased to $153,025,000 from $146,469,000.

1040-> A Radioactive Generator To Fall in Pacific Today
HOUSTON, April 16 — SNAP 27, a nuclear generator with 8.6 pounds of radioactive plu tonium in it, will fall into the Pacific Ocean about 200 miles northeast of New Zealand about noon tomorrow, an Atomic Energy Commission official said today. The governments or New Zealand and other South Paci fic islands were being notified by the State Department that the device, a remnant of the aborted Apollo 13 flight, might fall in their vicinity. The generator was to have been left on the moon to pro vide electricity for experiment al equipment but had to be brought back to earth after the space emergency arose Monday night. The Atomic Energy Commis sion repeated today its asser tion that there was very lit tle chance that SNAP 27's ra dioactive plutonium would fall on land. SNAP stands for Sys tems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power. An Air Force plane has been assigned to try to track the 16‐inch‐long generator as it re enters the earth's atmosphere shortly before the Apollo 13 crew splashes down. Even if the nuclear genera tor, which is encased in shock resistant and heat‐resistant ma terials, should fall on land in stead of in the sea, the radia tion would not be harmful to humans, the commission said. The level of radiation will be only one‐tenth of a roentgen an hour, the agency said. The commission said that an ac cumulation of 75 roentgens of radiation could cause illness in humans, and that it has been estimated that an accumulation of 400 to 600 roentgens would cause the death of half the people so exposed. A spokesman for the Atomic Energy Commission said that the plutonium was in the form of small, solid balls of metal about one‐tenth of a millimeter in diameter, about the thick ness of a strand of hair. “If the capsule should rup ture during re‐entry and the plutonium fall out,” the spoke man said, “it would be too heavy for people to breathe.” A similar device exploded over the Indian Ocean about six years ago, and, although there was radioactive fallout over a large portion of the earth, there were no reports of any damage. All of the fallout from the accident had disap peared in two years, the spokes man said. “It was after this that the decision was made to build capsules for SNAP 27 that would withstand re‐entry into the atmosphere,” the A.E.C. of ficial said. In May, 1968, a SNAP gen erator similar to SNAP 27 fell in 300 feet of water off Santa Barbara, Calif., when a weath er satellite exploded during launching. “The generator was recov ered in October, 1968, and there was no evidence of radiation in the water or in fish near the generator,” the A.E.C. said. “The only possible danger to humans would be if in some way, some of the plutonium was ground into dust and breathed,” the commission said. A technician for the National Aeronautics and Space Admin istration said NASA believed that the only possible danger to humans was the chance that the generator, which weighs more than 40 pounds, might hit someone when it falls to earth.

1043-> Lovell Reports Astronauts Felt Death Was Near
WASHINGTON, April 24— Capt. James A. Lovell Jr. told Congress today that the Apollo 13 astronauts had felt close to death but that they had still wanted to get their crippled spacecraft as near to earth as possible, even if they perished. Eight members of the Sen ate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee and 300 spectators listened in rapt attention as Captain Lovell related that the astronauts con sidered the possibility of ex hausting their vital supplies after an explosion on the moon‐bound spacecraft cut off most of the electrical power. Faced with the bleak possi bility of running out of oxygen, water or the power needed to guide them home, Captain Lovell said, he and his two fellow crewmen still wanted to maneuver as close as possible to the earth, even though they realized they might not set foot on earth again. “It was now a case of sur vival,” Captain Lovell said in a profound, faraway voice after describing the explosion in an oxygen tank. “Had we not done anything, we would have been in a permanent orbit with an apogee of 230,000 miles and a perigee of 1,000 miles.” The testimony of Captain Lovell and a fellow astronaut, John L. Swigert Jr., aided by films and diagrams, described more vividly than before the danger to the lives of the astro nauts on the nearly disastrous flight. The investigation of the ex plosion's cause, according to senior officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Admin istration who testified before the committee, is focusing on the possibility that something was inside the oxygen tank that should not have been there. Dr. Rocco Petrone, director of the Apollo program, said that the substance or object could have been a piece of in sulation from a wire, an ex posed wire itself, a foreign piece of aluminum or a piece of a blade from the two fans inside the tank. Yet he and Dr. Thomas O. Paine, the space agency admin istrator, emphasized that no one had determined the cause of the blast, or even if some thing inside the tank had caused it. Dale Myers, the agency's associate administra tor for manned flight, said that the oxygen tank “and its associ ated hardware” were the focus of the attention of the investi gation board. The panel is headed by Edgar M. Cortright Jr., chief of the space agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The board is taking testi mony from Captain Lovell, Mr. Swigert and the third Apollo astronaut, Fred W. Haise Jr. Mr. Haise who developed a uri nary tract infection on the flight, was under doctor's orders not to come here from Houston. Mr. Swigert described the ex plosion as a “small shudder” that was felt rather than heard. He explained that there is no natural sound in the void of space. The audience listened intent ly as the witnesses described the ensuing events in testimony spiced with references to “un dervolts,” “transiatory events” and “depletion of O‐2 pres sure.” Interest in the hearing room sharpened when the astronauts described in more human terms how it felt to be cold, thirsty and anxious thousands of miles from the earth. When the temperature in the spacecraft was only a few de grees above freezing, “we rubbed our hands together and stamped our boots to keep our feet warm,” Captain Lovell said. “It got so cold we called [the lunar module lifeboat] the refrigerator,” Mr. Swigert said. He then told how, because the craft was low on water, the men chewed packages of hot dogs to gain extra moisture. Captain Lovell described how ground controllers at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston devised methods never before tried to ease the astro nauts nauts out of their emergencies. “The reason we're here to day,” Captain Lovell told the Senators, “is that the ground, had taken hold of an unusual, situation and got us home.” After ticking off the unusual and unplanned maneuverings by the astronauts and the ground team in the flight, Mr. Swigert summed them up as “good old Yankee ingenuity.” According to Captain Lovell, the main problem after the ex plosion “turned from whether, we would land on the moon to one of whether we would re turn home or not.” Had they remained on a path around the earth having a high point of 230,000 miles and a low point of 1,000 miles, it would have taken decades, or perhaps cen turies, for the spacecraft to re‐enter the earth's atmosphere and burn up. But, as Captain Lovell put it, they would have preferred that fate to having the spacecraft, marooned in the far reaches of space forever. “I felt it would be much better to get the spacecraft into the atmos phere, than not get back at all,” he said. Asked by Senator Margaret Chase Smith, Republican of Maine, if the Apollo 13 explor ers had taken unnecessary risks, Captain Lovell replied, “We are people who test equip ment.” Mr. Swigert said, “I never felt that I was being put to any unnecessary risks.” Dr. Paine said, “We should be able to proceed with Apollo 14 and subsequent flights” after the cause of the mishap is de termined. Apollo 14 is sched uled to be launched in October, but the site of the lunar landing has yet to he selected. The next flight could again attempt to land on Fra Mauro in the lunar highlands, where Apollo 13 was aimed. Dr. Petrone discounted the theory that the impact of a stray micrometeoroid caused the explosion. He said the chances against this were less than one in a million. Space officials, both in their testimony and in interviews after the Senate appearance, re peatedly expressed puzzlement over the cause of the explosion. Dr. Petrone listed more than a dozen possibilities, all of them events that could have taken place within the tank. As have other officials, he said that the tank had ruptured because an “energy increase” within it had caused the semi liquid oxygen to expand sud denly. This was “probably caused by oxidation in the tank, but we don't know why,” he added. Committee members, who voted two days ago to cut the space agency's funds, asked few technical questions, still thankful a dozen days after the accident that the astronauts had returned safely. Glynn S. Lunnev, one of the mission's flight directors, was testifying when a huge color slide of Apollo 13 splashing into the Pacific was flashed on a screen. “I guess for the people in our business,” he told the Senators, as he pointed at the picture, “that has got to be one of the most beautiful sights in the world.”

1044-> Advertisin Success in the Sunny South
If you are reading your morning paper and are doing it in Metropolitan New York as you are beginning a hec tic day, you may think of yourself as part of the “out” crowd. lf, however, you are doing the same while relaxed and warm in, say, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale or Naples. Fla. feel “in.” And what, pray tell, does all this have to do with ad vertising? Well, we certainly know by this time that ad vertisers like “in” people— especially if “in” means well. off. And magazines who reach them can testify to it. The venerable Palm Beach Life, for example, expects to double its already heavy ad schedule in the next two years. And Mrs. Yolanda Mau rer, a former society editor, who started Fort Lauderdale Pictorial Life four years ago, reported yesterday that she has been in the black since her second issue. The latest Magazine to find happiness in publishing what amounts to a glorified, slick society page is Gulfshore Life, which began to make money with its first issue in. January. But maybe there is more to the success of this Naples based publication than just its audience. It is run by a pair of pros. They should be well known around here. The publisher is Harry R. Denmead, 66 years old, who recently retired after 26 years with McGraw‐Hill where he was district mana ger for Purchasing Week magazine. The editor is his ‘wife, Jean Clarke Thompson. Denmead, 60, a former pub lic relations gal whose career included stints with Kenyon & Eckhardt, Hicks & Greist and the American Gas As sociation. “We really got a hot thing down here and, next year we're really going to boom,” the publisher said yesterday from the sunny South. “This is a fantastic success story.” He is a man, who planned for retirement. Having once worked in Florida and having decided that was where he wanted to settle down, he traveled the state with his wife a couple of years back looking for the place for his future publishing. Then, hav ing selected Naples, he spent a more recent vacation re searching the town. Unlike the other two maga zines, his has controlled cir culation—it is sent to only a certain audience, free. Mr. Denmead got up the list of 7,500 himself through mem bership lists of local clubs, tax rolls and the phone book. “It was quite a job,” he said. “A prestige magazine for just winter residents and their guests,” is the way he describes it. So it will be pub lished monthly only from November through ‘April. The editorial content, Mr. Denmead said, comprises cov erage of social groups and community leaders, feature stories about life at home and aboard a boat and articles on conservation and constructive retirement. His advertising director, slightly over 50, is already enjoying such a retirement. He is George M. Wallerich, former president of a Chicago surgical instrument manufac turing company. Mr. Denmead says he thinks his area contains a greater concentration of wealth than either‐of the two East Coast cities. And he must really believe it, be cause he charges more for a pige ($500) with less circula tion than either of the two other magazines. Why start a second career at 66? That was easy for him to answer. “I didn't want to be come idle rich,” he said. “I've seen too many guys cut it off sharp and go to seed. I de cided this wasn't for me. figured that working ‘only six months would give me plenty of free time, but as it turns out I'm working harder than I ever have in my life. But it's not the same pressure as New York. No one is leaning over my shoulder. I'm my own boss.” When is the next flight out? Quaker's House Agency The Quaker Oats Company is activating a house agency. That's the kind of news that gives regular‐agency men a chill. Incorporated a year ago as ADCOM but never used until now, the agency is starting right off with the children's cereal line — Cap'n Crunch, Quist and Quake—which pre viously had Compton as its agency of record. Victor Elting Jr., the com pany's vice president for ad vertising who also will be president of the agency, ex plained that ADCOM would work “short term” on certain new products or “long term”, in special circumstances. He said the children's line was just such a circumstance be cause Compton had never had the responsibility for creating the actual advertis ing, which was done by Jay Ward Productions. He also said that activat ing the house agency would not affect the company's re lations with J. Walter Thomp son, Doyle Dane Bernbach or any of the smaller agencies that have pieces of Quaker business. Radio‐TV Man Retires After. 3'5 years in the busi ness of radio and television, Charles C. (Bud) Barry, an executive vice president of Young & Rubicam, has re tired. He had been in charge of the agency's TV‐radio de partment, which developed programs or purchased pro grams or parts of programs. Warren A. Bahr, also an executive vice president, who had been in charge of the media relations and planning department,. has been given the additional responsibility for TV‐radio and a new title: director of media services. Media relations and plan ning will now be headed by Joseph Ostrow, a senior vice president. He will report to Mr Hahr, as will David Y. Bradshaw, a vice ‘president who will be acting director of TV‐radio. Mr. Barry moved into broadcasting’ in 1936 after a period in retail advertising. By 1941 he ‘was national pro gram manager for the Ytmer ican Broadcasting Company, then became vice president in charge of radio programs and vice president in charge of television. He later had these two titles at the Na tional Broadcasting Com pany, worked for the William Morris agency and was vice president in charge of M‐G‐M Television. He came to Y.&R. in 1959. According to the agency's chief executive, Edward L. Bond Jr., the retirement is for personal reasons. People Sylvester J. Cleary elected a senior vice president of SSC&B, Inc.

1045-> DOW LOSES 12.02, FALLS TO 750.99
The stock market plunged through the 760 support level in the opening half‐hour yes terday and kept moving down ward to close at 750.59. Despite an abortive attempt to rally at the noon hour, the market continued in the vein of the last two weeks by sink ing a whopping 12.02 points, as measured by the Dow‐Jones in dustrial average. This fallout was the largest in more than nine months and puts the market at the lowest level since Feb. 17. Since the beginning of 1970, moreover, the market has fallen 6.2 per cent; it dropped 15.2 per cent, in 1969. Thursday, April 23, 1970 ?? NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ?? ODD‐LOT TRANSACTIONS ?? Yesterday's slide was as broad as it was deep. Invest ment‐grade issues, glamour stocks and secondary securities all participated in the down turn as declines topped ad vances by almost six to one. Among the big losers for the day were Proctor & Gamble, off 2 to 102, National Cash Register, down 6 to 122, Motors ola, off 5⅞ to 92⅛, and Mar lennan, down 5¼ to 43⅜. Of the Issues traded yester day on the Big Board, 437 hit new lows for the year, while only three preferred stocks achieved new highs. Even the 15 most‐active stocks could show only one gainer: the No. 1 stock on the list, Parke Davis, which advanced ⅛ to 21⅜. The New York Times com bined average of 50 stocks dropped 4.05 points to 432.60. And the broader‐based New York Stock Exchange index sank 0.73 points to 45.74. Many analysts maintained that there appeared to be no letup in the pessimism of trad ers regarding the market's prospects for the future. Rising interest rates for bonds and short ‐ term instruments are other reflections of the general investor concern over present day economic conditions. Volume advanced to 11.05 million shares from the 10.78 million on Wednesday. Brokers pointed out that the selling im Ipetus came largely from in idividual accounts rather than from institutions. Drug and pharmaceutical stocks were still among the most hard‐pressed of the quality issues. Upjohn fell 3 to 47, Pfizer dropped 3⅞ to 91¾ and Merck declined 2⅞ to 92⅝. Although oil stocks were also down, many of the losses were limited to fractions. Standard Oil of California closed at 43, off ⅛; Texaco closed at 25¼, off ¼; and Union Oil closed at 29⅛, off ¾. Three leading petroleum companies — Jersey Standard, Indiana Standard and Atlantic Richfield—finished un changed. T.W.A., which announced first‐quarter loss of close to $40‐million, gave up 1¼ at 13¾ after hitting a 1970 low of 13⅝. Penn Central, which reported a $17.2 million loss on Wednesday, fell to a new low of 18⅞ and closed at 19, down a point. The American Credit Corpo ration gave up 4¼ at 23 after the Justice.Department revealed plans to file an antitrust suit to block its acquisition by the Wachovia Corporation. The ex change delayed trading in American Credit for part of the day to allow dissemination of this news. Another large drop was reg istered by Westinghouse Elec tric, which fell 3¾ to 6½ Here too a Justice Department action was the apparent reason, since a suit was instituted against the electrical giant for an alleged conspiracy with two Japanese companies to restrain trade in certain international markets. Included among the stocks that plummeted three or more points were Motorola, off 5⅞ to 92⅛; Avon Products, down 5½ to 148; Fairchild Camera, Dff 5 to 58⅞; Honeywell, down 5½, to 118¾; Telex, off 8⅝ to 36½; and Time Inc., down 3¼ to 32. Johnson & Johnson, a long time favorite of institutional investors, dropped 4¼ to 139⅞. This close came after an intra day low of 139½ for the big hospital and medical supply company. Just one stock managed to squeeze out an advance of points or more: Archer Daniels, which finished the day at 58, up 2⅜. A smaller gain was posted by Handy & Harman, precious metals dealer, which climbed ⅜ to 21½ despite its announcement on Wednesday of a downward estimate for 1970 earnings. A number of yesterday's earnings reports for the March quarter continued to be on the bearish side. For most of these companies, the result was lower stock prices. Thus, Curtiss‐Wright dropped 2 to 12⅞, Martin Marietta fell ⅝ to 15½, Latrobe Steel de clined 1¼ to 12¾, Texas Gulf Sulphur gave up 1½ at 15¼ and Goodyear eased ⅝ to 24⅜. However, Vorhado, which an nounced profits of $1.52 share against $1.76 in the year‐ ago period, eked out a gain of ¼ at 12½. Even favorable corporate news was not always able to overcome the downward pat tern of the market. For exam ple, Gulf and Western—which raised its quarterly dividend to 12½ cents a share from 10 cents—made a new low of 13⅞ before closing at 14⅜, down ⅜.

1046-> 2 Unions Give Auto Workers $35‐Million Credit
DETROIT, Sept. 3 — Two major unions, the Teamsters, and the Steelworkers, pledged today a total of $35‐million in credits to help build up the strike fund of the United Auto mobile Workers. Leonard Woodcock, the pres ident of the auto union, an nounced the pledges at a news conference after he had left bargaining sessions at the Chrysler Corporation. At the end of two hours of talks at Chrysler, Mr. Wood cock said that the session had only confirmed his impression that the first offer made by the three companies this week was a “non‐offer” and designed merely to put pressure on the union to come up with specific wage demands. He said that the union would not make known its wage de mands until near the deadline of Sept. 15, when the present contract runs out. In the past, he said, the companies have not taken union wage demands seriously when they were an nounced early in the bargain ing period. “We're going to keep it vague until the proper time,” he added. When he was asked if he thought that an increase of $1.25 an hour over the next three years, which was de manded by about 100 workers who demonstrated in front of the General Motors Building today, was realistic, he replied: “We think they're a little low. That's why we did not join them.” The industry's first offer in cluded a pay increase of 30 cents an hour for the first year for a typical auto worker earn ing $4 an hour, plus 24 cents over the next two years with up to 16 cents more to match inflation and grant higher pen sions. The union rejected the offer yesterday and said that General Motors or Chrysler or both would be struck at midnight Sept. 14 if the companies did not come up with a satisfactory offer. The offer of the credits of $25‐million by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and $10‐million by the United Steelworkers was welcome be cause the union's $120‐million strike fund would be depleted within eight weeks if all the 400,000 workers at General Mo tors went out on strike. Mr. Woodcock said that part of the union's strike fund was tied up in mortgages and bonds. Later, after a one‐hour meet ing at General Motors, Mr. Woodcock said that the com pany had made no new offer.

1047-> A Slump in Exports of Steel Is Feared
Exports or American steel, which have been helping hold'production in this country at surprisingly high levels 1970, are in immediate danger of slumping, according both of the nation's leading merchant exporters of steel. One of these concerns, the Philipp Brothers division Ithe Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation, sent top‐level executive to Wash ington yesterday. His mission was to tell the Commerce. Department that a shortage of export financing, soaring rates for ocean shipping and other problems would hurt axpere business unless they were remedied. Meanwhile, in interviews here, officials of Philipp Broth ars and its chief competitor, the Titan Industrial Corporation, 2ited somewhat different rea sons for expecting a slump in shipments to foreign steel mar kets, but they both insisted that apparent optimism about ex ports in Pittsburgh and other steel‐making centers was un realistic. V. S. Steel's View The United States Steel Cor poration, the world's biggest steel company and one—of the few American producers with Its own complete sales organi zation overseas, said it had not so far encountered the signs of trouble mentioned by the mer chant exporters. John P. Roche, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the chief trade asso ciation of the domestic industry, said the industry expected long‐term decline in European demand as steel‐making, capac ity increased on the Continent. However, Philipp Brothers. Titan and other merchant ex porters—the brokers who ne gotiate nearly all foreign sales except for shipments by two or three of the biggest Ameri can producers—said they feared a dramatic drop in orders with in 60 or 90 days. Edward Siegel, president of Titan, indicated that few do mestic steel companies had the ability to anticipate immediate swings in the overseas market. He said the current optimism was an instance of “Pitts burgh's controlled thinking.” Mr. Siegel emphasized that the underlying demand for steel continued relatively strong in most parts of the world, including Europe, and that an active market in Argen tina provided “a kind of safety valve,” at least for his com pany. But he listed several im mediate problems, including the fact that charter rates, the cost for ocean shipping, had risen “out of sight” in the last few months. “They've gone to per haps $12 a ton from about $8,” he said. In addition, shipping space is difficult to book because of competition from other export commodities leaving the United States. At the same time, Mr. Sie gel noted, a European Common Market tariff on certain grades of steel, which has been sus pended because of a steel shortage in the Common Mar ket nations, is scheduled to be imposed again, at the end of May. He said Titan had encoun tered no major problem with the financing. of exports, but a spokesman for Philipp Brothers said volume was being seriously reduced by “the inability of American exporters to obtain financing anywhere the Ex= port‐Import Bank, the commer cial banks—unless they pay the prime rate and plenty more.” The United States continues to import far more steel than it sells overseas, but the gap— the net inflow—was narrowed last year to nine million tons from about 16 million the pre vious year. Part of the reason was a doubling of exports to more than five million, tons in 1969.

1053-> BOND RATE DROP IS EVAPORATING
The decline in interest rates that occurred in February and early March is evaporating. The $75‐million or Pacific Gas & Electric Company bonds, first marketed on March 4 at a yield of 8.55 per cent, were permitted to trade in the free market yesterday and they dropped sharply. At one time, they traded almost three points ($30 per $1,000 bond) below their original. price — a drop that lifted the yield to 8.82 per cent. Just before the close of the corporate bond market, how ever, prices generally recovered and the Pacific G & E bonds closed a point above this low. Elsewhere in the credit mar kets, Government securities dropped sharply in price and new issues of tax‐exempt bonds were priced to yield more than similar securities sold a day or two earlier. Even with the higher yield, however, they continued to sell slowly to in vestors. This sluggish perforinance of the capital markets came as the Commerce Department and the Securities and Exthange Cornsion disclosed that business men plan AO increase capital spending this year 10.6 per cent. This rise is less than the 11.5 per cent increase in capital spending last year, but it's larger than the 9.7 per cent projected just three months ago. The implication of the new figure clearly was that all the talk of recession. this year has failed so far to persuade busi ness executives to cut back their expansion plans. Borrowing plans announced this week seem to show cor porations are in no mood to wait to get their hands on addi tional funds. On Tuesday, Pennzoil United scheduled a public offering of $120‐million of convertible debentures maturing in 1982 and 3.96‐million shares of class B common stock Of a subsidiary to finance oil and gas explora tion in the Gulf of Mexico. The Boise CasCade Credit Corpora tion filed with the S.E.C. a $75 million 5‐year debenture issue to be sold through a group co. managed by Blyth & Co., Inc., and A. G. Becker & Co., Inc. Yesterday, more financing plans moved ahead. The Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company filed $150 million of 35‐year debentures with the S.E.C. The securities are scheduled to be sold March 31 by a network of underwrit ers led by Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch. The International Harvester Credit Corporation filed $50million of 20‐year debentures and $50‐million of 5‐year notes to be offered April 1 by a Mor gan Stanley & Co. group. The Columbus & Southern Ohio Electric Company dis closed plans to sell $30‐million of bonds and $18‐million of $100‐par preferred stock. Dillon Read and the Ohio Company will head the group offering the securities May 14. The Portland General Electric Company, an Oregon utility, registered $20‐million of 7‐year bonds and 600,000 common shares to be offered by Blyth syndicates. Colonial Stores registered with the S.E.C. $11‐million of sinking fund debentures to be offered by Paine Webber and its associates. New‐Issue Market In the new‐issue market yes terday, the Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company sold $40 million of A‐rated bonds at competitive bidding, awarding them to a group headed by Halsey, Stuart & Co., Inc. The underwriters put a 9¼ per cent interest rate on the bonds and offered them to in vestors at a price of 100 per cent of their face value. They mature in 1990 and are non refundable for five years. Their 9.25 per cent yield was half a percentage point above the 8.75 per cent return on an A‐rated Northern Natural Gas Company issue marketed Feb. 25 in the preceding sale of gas company bonds. Even with this increase, the bonds didn't sell particularly fast. Late in the afternoon, Hal sey indicated $20‐million were still unsold. In another utility financing, the Texas Electric Service Com pany awarded 200,000 shares of $100‐par preferred stock to a five‐manager syndicae head ed by Eastman Dillon. The underwriters offered the stock to investors at a price of $101.363 a share. With their $8.92 dividend, this set a yield of 8.80 per cent. The Mack Financial Corpo ration sold $40‐million of 20 year debentures through a syn dicate led by Goldman, Sachs. The securities offered as 9 ⅝s at 100 and not redeema ble for 10 years, were de scribed as getting off to a good start in their sales to inves tors. The bonds, however, did not sell out completely. In the rail sector, the Sea. board Coast Line Railroad awarded $6.09‐million equip. ment certificates to a Salomon Brothers group, which then, offered them publicly at yields ranging from 8.25 per cent on those maturing in 1971 up to 8.625 per cent in 1981‐1985. There yields were slightly higher than those on an issue of Missouri Pacific certificates marketed Tuesday, and yet the Seaboard. securities, which are regarded as having a some what higher credit standing, sold slowly. Steel Concern Issue Set A First Boston group, mean while, readied for sale today $40‐million of Allegheny Lud lum Steel Corporation sinking fund debentures maturing in 1995. The A‐rated issue, nonrefund able for 10 years, is expected to be offered with a 9 per cent interest rate at a price of 100½ to yield 8.95 per cent. After a modest number of sales yesterday, the $75‐million of Chesapeake & Potomac Tele phone Company of Virginia de bentures, marketed Tuesday at a yield of 8.65 per cent, ap peared to be between 40 to 50 per cent sold. The $100‐million of Chrysler Corporation 25 year sinking fund debentures were described by underwriters as “75 per cent done.” The securities were priced to yield 8⅞ per cent. In the tax‐exempt bond mar ket, South Carolina's $30‐mil lion of Aaa‐rated securities sold slowly. The bonds, offered Tuesday at yields generally quarter of a point lower than top‐grade local government bonds sold last week, were down to an unsold balance late yesterday afternoon of $22.89 million. Municipal Sector This sales pace caused mu nicipal bond dealers to con clude that New Jersey's $75 million of triple‐A bonds would be priced to yield somewhat more than the South Carolina's. Indianapolis sold $10‐million of triple‐A airport bonds to Merrill Lynch‐Chemical Bank group, and the securities were priced to yield 10/100ths more than the South Carolina bonds. The Indianapolis bonds also sold slowly, declining to an un sold balance of $8,135,000. Minnesota sold $6‐million more bonds from a $30‐million issue put up for sale several weeks ago. A Chase Manhattan Bank syndicate purchased $3 million maturing in 1978 and $3‐million coming due in 1970, and it offered them publicly at yields of 4.90 and 4.95 per cent. The state still has $9‐mil lion maturing in 1980‐82 to be sold. In a negotiated financing to day, the New York State Hous ing Finance Agency is expected to sell $80‐million of bonds priced to yield from 4.90 per cent in 1974 up to 6.60 per cent from 2006 to 2013. In the Eurobond market, U.S. Financial Overseas, N.V. subsidiary of U.S. Financial, announced plans to sell $12.5 million of 12‐year guaranteed debentures through a consor tium led by Goldman. Sachs. U.S. Financial, based in Cali fornia, is a real estate de N. clop ment company.

1059-> ORIOLES TRIUMPH OVER YANKEES, 2‐1
BALTIMORE, Sept. 10— Beaten by the Yankees a lit tle more than a week ago in his effort to achieve a 10‐game winning streak, Dave McNally got some measure of revenge tonight. The Last‐balling southpaw limited the New York club to six hits as he pitched the pace setting Orioles to a 2‐1 tri umph. McNally's victory provided the home forces with their sec ond 22‐game winner for the season at the Yankee's ex pense in two nights. Mike Cuellar, ‘also a left‐hander, irang up No. 22 last night with 1‐to‐0 triumph. Stan Bahnsen started for New York. He pitched well before being lifted for a pinch hitter in the seventh, allowing only four hits. However, brief lapses in the second and fifth innings proved costly. In the second, he allowed a double to Brooks Robinson that caromed off the left‐field wall with one out. Then, after fan ning Dave Johnson, he yielded la line single to Chico Salmon that sent Robinson racing home. Baltimore's second run came with even greater ease. With one out, Andy Etchebarren, the Orioles’ well‐built catcher, stroked one of Balinsen's fast balls deep into the left‐field seats. The clout, which proved to be the winning one, was only Etchebarren's third homer of the season. Held to only one infield sin gle for six innings, the Yankees produced two more in the sev enth for their only run. The tally resulted from straight hits, to open the inning. John Ellis started the brief uprising by singling over sec ond. Ron Hansen then followed with a line double to left‐center scoring Ellis. Although Mc Nally walked the next man, Ron Woods, the Yankees were un able to sustain the attack. Earlier in the day, the Yan kees announced they had re: called 13 players from their minor league affiliates. Two of the men at Syracuse will not report until the Triple A league team completes its playoffs. Among those reporting from Syracuse will be Frank Tepedi no and Bob Mitchell, both of whom were with the Yankees earlier this season. Others re called from the Chiefs are Ron Blomberg and Bill Robinson, outfielders: Tolia Solaita, a first baseman, and Bill Burbach and Doug Hansen, pitchers. ???

1062-> Liberalized Depreciation Rule Being Considered by Treasury
A high Treasury official dis closed yesterday that the Treasury Department has un der consideration an entirely new approach to the tax treat ment of depreciation, one that would allow many companies much larger depreciation de ductions than the present sys tem. John S. Nolan, Deputy As sistant Secretary for Tax Pol icy, made the disclosure in a speech here before the Practic ing Law Institute. He also dis cussed some of the Treasury's other tax ideas for the future. Regarding depreciation, he said the Treasury was studying the possibility of changing the length of time over which ma chinery and equipment could he depreciated to an arbitrary “cost recovery period,” instead of tying it to the actual useful life of such equipment, as at present. Mr. Nolan noted that a Pres idential task force on business taxation was studying the issue of depreciation, along with others, and indicated that its recommendations would have to be considered before any de cisions were made on the tax treatment of depreciation. Although the ask force has not yet submitted its report, it is known to favor a deprecia tion system such as the one Mr. Nolan described. The cost to the government in lost tax revenue would he high, however—$9‐billion is a figure that has been mentioned —and for that reason it had previously been thought that the Administration could not even give serious consideration to the task force proposal. The task force is headed by John H. Alexander, a New York lawyer and former law partner of President Nixon. Under the “cost‐recovery period” concept of depreciation, the Treasury would set the time periods over which equipment could be depreciated, industry by‐industry, for different classes of equipment. All mem bers of the industry would then be entitled to take depreci ation deductions at that rate, whether or not they actually replaced the equipment at the end of “cost‐recovery period.” Concerns that actually re placed the equipment faster than the arbitrary cost‐recovery period presumably would be permitted to prove that they were entitled to faster deprecia tion, as they are under the present system. Mr. Nolan did not indicate whether the Treasury, if it decided it wanted to shift to the new system, would attempt to do it by administrative ac tion or would ask for legis lation. The Treasury has the author ity to change the method by which depreciation is treated, within broad statutory limits. The last major change in de preciation rules, in 1962, was made by administrative action. Other items that Mr. Nolan said the Treasury has under consideration included legisla tion dealing with the tax as pects of employe benefits, es tate and gift taxation and the tax treatment of what are known as “advance payments.” The Treasury had originally hoped that some of these might come before Congress this year, but in view of the crowded cal endar of the House Ways and Means Committee, they will probably not come up until 1971, Mr. Nolan indicated.

1064-> Egypt Assails U.S. on Aid to Israelis
CAIRO, March 25—The Unit ed Arab Republic accused the United States today of assuring Israel of permanent air superi ority over the Arab countries and thereby, in effect, chal lenging Arab endeavors to build up their armed forces for a war of liberation. Speaking at a news confer ence, the chief Cairo spokes man gave the first official reac tion here to the announcement Monday by Secretary of State William P. Rogers that the United States was denying, for the time being, the delivery of the additional military aircraft sought by Israel but would ex tend substantial economic as sistance to that country. The spokesman, Dr, Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, charged that the decision, implying that aircraft would be sent to Is rael if needed, and the Ameri can pledge of economic aid rep resented a reward to Israel for “intransigence and aggression.” Dr. Meguid reiterated a warn ing that American interests in the Arab world were being jeopardized by Washington's policies. The spokesman was harsh in his criticism of the United States position on the Arab Israeli conflict, and underlined Cairo' disappointment that President Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rogers had emphasized a com mitment to maintain a balance of power in the Middle East. At the same time, however, Dr. Meguid stressed that Cairo was equally disappointed, if not more so, by what he termed the silence of Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rogers, in their news confer ence remarks, on the 1967 res olution of the United Nations Security Council outlining a pattern for settlement of the conflict. For the Arabs, the major fea ture of the resolution is its call for an Israeli withdrawal from the territory of Egypt, Jordan and Syria occuped in 1967. It also proposes secure and guar anteed borders, a settlement for the Palestinian refugees and freedom of navigation in inter national waterways. Commenting on this issue, Dr. Meguid stressed that the major issue at this time was not the delivery or nondeliv ery of aircraft to Israel but rather the position of the Unit ed States on the imple mentation of the Security Council resolution. It was disclosed, meanwhile, that President Gamal Abdel Nasser had reiterated that Egypt and the other Arab coun tries would accept nothing less than a total withdrawal of enemy forces from all occupied! Arab lands. There will be no concession on territory, he told the National Assembly in a four‐hour closed session last night. He said that the Soviet Union and Egypt were in full accord on the necessity for a total Israeli withdrawal from the oc cupied areas and on the rejec tion of direct negotiations be tween the Arabs and Israelis. Details of Mr. Nasser's speech and replies to more than a hun dred questions were made pub lic tonight. The President con demned the United States for its decision to supply economic aid to Israel, asserting that this was equivalent to military as sistance since it covered Israeli financial problems arising from the conflict with the Arabs.

The Notre Dame hack courtman, who has all the flash of a Harlem Globetrot ter, has reached the stage where college coaches and pro scouts are comparing his shooting and moves with those of Elgin Baylor, the Los Angeles Laker superstar, in his prime. As the Notre Dame basket ball road company travels across the nation in quest of recognition, Carr's circus‐like performances have become a show within a show. Saturday night the 6‐foot‐ 3‐inch Notre Dame junior col lected 35 points in an 82‐66 victory over Duquesne. At one stage Carr had the spec tators at the Chicago Stadium standing and applauding him wildly when he scored 13 of Notre Dame's 17 points. Three nights before Carr scored his collegiate varsity high of 51 points against De‐ Paul. The nation's No. 2 scorer, behind Pete Maravich of Louisiana State, has 518 points for a 34.5 average. Notre Dame's 11th triumph in 15 games came after the University of California, Los Angeles, the No. 1‐ranked team, remained one of the nation's four undefeated ma jor teams by routing Loyola of Chicago, 94‐72, for its 12th success. The U.C.L.A. scorers had a field day as all five straters hit in double‐figures. The night before against Bradley the Bruins were subjected to a stall as they won, 61‐56. Undefeated St. Bonaven ture and Jacksonville were idle, but Kentucky shrugged off Tennessee's slowdown tactics, 68‐52, and breezed to its 13th victory. Dan Issel, the all‐America center and nation's third leading scorer, hit for 28 points in the Wild cats' fifth Southeastern Con ference victory. Davidson and Louisville, both ranked in the writers top 20 poll, were upset. Dan Kelly and Mike Hauer com bined for 60 points to lead St. Joseph's to a 90‐81 vic tory over Davidson before once‐beaten Penn defeated Massachusetts, 75‐65, in a double‐header at the Palestra in Philadelphia. It was the second loss in 13 games for eighth‐ranked Davidson. Stetson of Florida, boast ing a 10‐game winning streak, gained national rec ognition as it surprised Louisville, 87‐80. It was the Cardinals' third loss in 11 starts. Elsewhere nationally, Rich Yunkus of Georgia Tech scored 36 points and grabbed 18 rebounds as the Yellow Jackets routed Auburn, 86‐ 74, and Drake, bolstered by Jeff Halliburton, one of its prime junior‐college trans fers, won its sixth straight game in the Missouri Valley Conference by defeating Cin cinnati, 63‐57. Halliburton scored 6 points with less than three minutes of play to insure the victory. In the Big Ten, Illinois kept its undefeated status as it survived a last‐minute surge by Michigan, 75‐73, for its fifth triumph. The Illini ac complished the feat after three starters had fouled out. Larry Mikan, the Minneso ta co‐captain and son of George Mikan, the former pro standout, tallied 26 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in an 85‐68 triumph over Michi gan State. Jim McDaniels, Western Kentucky's 7‐footer, broke the school scoring record with his 1,000th point in a 102‐80 triumph over LaSalle. McDaniels scored 25 points. Fifth ‐ ranked New Mexico State won its 15th game in 16 starts at the expense of Hardin Simmons, 53–75. Jim my Collins gunned 23 of his 30 points in the second half for the Aggies. John Canie scored 34 points including 21 in the first half, as Ohio Univer sity, the Mid‐American Con ference pacesetter, defeated Toledo, 88‐79. Dean Meminger scored 19 points In leading Marquette to a 67‐57 triumph over South ern Illinois. It was the War riors' 12th victory in 13 games. Locally, Jack Powers, the Manhattan College coach, had some trying moments that could have affected his ulcers before the Jaspers beat Army, the nation's top defensive team, 60‐57. Columbia suffered its sec ond loss in 15 games, bow ing to Georgetown, 72‐68. It was the Hoyas' seventh straight victory.

1067-> Saigon Offers to Repatriate Vietnamese in Cambodia
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Fri day, April 17 (AP)—South Viet nam has offered to repatriate all Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia, Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam said today. He said at a news conference that the effort to repatriate the Vietnamese was being made be cause of what he termed “a situation of panic” among the Vietnamese in Cambodia. He said the Saigon Govern ment had asked the new Cam bodian Government to receive a South Vietnamese mission to arrange the repatriation, which he said might involve as many as 50,000 Vietnamese. The repatriation offer came after reports of mass killings of Vietnamese in Cambodia.

1068-> Peking Bars Geneva Talks And Sees Soviet Betrayal
HONG KONG, April 25 (Reu ters)—Communist China op posed today any reconvening of the Geneva conference and ac cused the Soviet Union of be traying the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Hsinhua, the official press agency, made the accusation in an article attacking a recent in dication by the Soviet delegate to the United Nations, Yakov A. Malik, that such a conference should he called to deal with Indochina. Mr. Malik later said a con ference was “unrealistic” at the present time. “Despite Malik's attempts to hide and recant”, Hsinhua said, “the filthy soul of the Soviet revisionists in betraying the people of the three Indochinese countries has been completely exposed.”

1069-> Graft Paid to Police Here Said to Run Into Millions
Narcotics dealers, gamblers and businessmen make illicit payments of millions of dollars a year to the policemen of New York, according to policemen, law‐enforcement experts and New Yorkers who make such payments themselves. Despite such widespread cor ruption, officials in both the Lindsay administration and the Police Department have failed to investigate a number of cases of corruption brought to their attention, sources within the department say. This picture has emerged from a six‐month survey of po lice corruption by The New York Times. The survey in cluded an examination of po lice and court records and inter views with scores of police commanders, policemen, former policemen, law‐enforcement ex perts and private citizens. The picture also is drawn from interviews with a group of policemen — including sev eral commanding officers — who decided to talk to The Times about the problem of cor ruption because, they charged, city officials had been remiss in investigating corruption. The names of the policemen who discussed corruption with The Times are being withheld to protect them from possible reprisals. On Thursday, Mayor Lindsay announced the formation of a special five‐man committee to review the city procedures for investigating police corruption. Corporation Counsel J. Lee Rankin was named chairman and Police Commissioner How ard R. Leary is a member of the panel. The announcement followed a series of meetings held at City Hall and Police Headquar ters during the last few weeks after the Lindsay administra tion learned The Times was conducting a survey of police corruption. The policemen and private citizens who talked to The Times describe a situation in which payoffs by gamblers to policemen are almost common place, in which some police men accept bribes from nar cotics dealers, in which businessmen throughout the city are subjected to extortion to cover up infractions of law and in which internal payoffs among policemen seem to have become institutionalized. “Police officials always talk about the occasional rotten apple in the barrel when cor ruption comes up,” said Ralph Salerno, a recently retired New York police sergeant and na tionally respected expert on or ganized crime. “They'd be al lot more honest if they talked about the rotten barrel.” Only a relatively few cases of corruption are successfully investigated by the Police De partment. In a recent letter to State Senator John Hughes, chairman of the Joint Legisla tive Committee on Crime, Com missioner Leary said that in the 137 cases of police mis conduct referred to the depart ment in the last three years, seven policemen were dis missed. During a recently tape‐re corded conversation with a po liceman that was made avail able to The Times, the top uniformed police official re sponsible for stamping out cor ruption in his department — Supervising Assistant Chief In spector Joseph McGovern — was asked what he had ac complished. “What have we ac complished?” he replied. “I think I have done a damn good job protecting the Commission er against the onslaughts of outside agencies.” An example of the depart ment's reluctance to openly ac knowledge corruption as problem is its response to an order issued by Mayor Lindsay to all city agencies last May 12. The order required that “all allegations or indications of possible corruption or wrong doing” be reported immediate ly to the Investigation Depart ment before any action was taken by the agency involved. According to a source in the Investigation Department, the Police Department has refused to comply with Mayor Lind say's order. One of the nolicemen who came to The Times discussed the effect of the department at titude toward corruption on the individual policeman. “I believe that 90 per cent of the cops would prefer to be honest.” he said. “But they see so much corruption around them that many feel it is point less not to go along.” In addition to tarnishing the policeman's attitude toward himself and his job, students of law enforcement say, corrup tion also imposes a massive se cret tax on the citizens of New York, dilutes the enforcement of many laws and undermines the public faith in justice. Some of the assertions made by policemen in The Times sur vey follow: ¶Arnold G. Fraiman, now a State Supreme Court justice, and until January, 1969, head of the city's Investigation Depart ment, refused to look into charges that Bronx gamblers were paying policemen between $800 and $1,000 a month. Mr. Fraiman learned about the case during a three‐hour conversation with two police men in his Park Avenue apart ment on May 30, 1968. Just about a year later, with no known assistance from the Investigation Department, eight of the plainclothes men whom Mr. Fraiman had been told about were indicted as a result of an independent investigation by a Bronx grand jury. Justice Fraiman said yester day that there was a meeting with a plainclothes man who provided him with information, but he denied that he had ever discontinued an investigation of police corruption. He added that the information provided, was extremely general and that “no specifics were ever given.” ¶Jay Kriegel, Mayor Lind say's staff assistant for law en forcement, told a policeman early in 1968 that the admin istration could not act on charges of police corruption be cause it did not want to upset the police during the possibly turbulent summer ahead. About a year before making this statement, Mr. Kriegel ar ranged for Mayor Lindsay to meet a group of policemen so he could get a realistic under standing of the problem of cor ruption. The meeting was called off at the last moment with urgent instructions from Mr. Kriegel to the policeman assist ing him to forget that it had ever been scheduled. Mr. Kriegel had no comment yesterday. ¶A detective with many years of experience in the nar cotics division said one of his colleagues had arranged pay offs to the police from major heroin dealers of Up to $50, 000, in return for such favors as the destruction of evidence gathered on secret wiretaps. Because the detective arrang ing the payoffs was shot under mysterious circumstances a few months ago, he now is under investigation. Some aspects or police cor ruption in New York and the related costs were discussed recently in a report by the Joint Legislative Committee on Crime. The committee charged that gambling in the slums, of New York “could not function without official tolerance in duced by corruption.” “Testimony before this com mittee clearly reveals,” it said, “that the ghetto residents are perfectly aware of the corrupt relationship between police racketeers and certain elements in the Police Department, and, for this reason, have a deep cynicism concerning the integ rity of the police in maintain ing law and order in the com munity.” Another aspect emerged in the anger of a Brooklyn book maker who complained that the plainclothes men he regularly bribed continued to demand payments even after they had been transferred out of gambl ing enforcement to the narco tics division. He said his pay ment was $1,200 a month, divid ed by four levels of the depart ment including one unit at headquarters. The bookmaker said in an in terview that some of his busi er colleagues paid the police as much as $2,400 a month and that the police imposed an ex tra payment if a bookmaker took bets on both the flat races and the trotters. Putting an exact price tag on corruption is impossible. The Joint Legislative Commit tee on Crime recently report ed, however, that the city's 10,000 small Puerto Rican gro cery stores were estimated to give the police $6.2‐million year in small weekly payments and free food to avoid sum monses on minor charges. Numbers operator, accord ing to Federal and state agen cies and private researchers' estimates, make payoffs be tween $7‐million and $15‐mil lion a year. Builders in Man hattan report they sometimes pay local patrolmen between $40 and $400 a month for each building site or renovated building. One West Side liquor dealer said he paid the police about $2.000 a year in cash tips and free and cut‐rate liquor. Beyond the financial cost of corruption is its corroding ef fect on the self‐esteem of the pot iceman. “One plainclothes man got a bit philosophical about tak ing it,” a policeman recalled, recently. “He stated he was a poor boy and one of the mi nority groups and he never had any money and now was his big chance. He said, ‘I don't care what they offer me, a thousand, a hundred, two dol lars. I'll take it.’ “And I said, ‘Oh, my God, think about it.’ And he said, ‘If I did, I'd blow my brains out.’ “ This sort of corruption, ac cording to many on the force is woven into the very fabric of the policemen's professional life. The men assigned to en forcing the gambling laws, for example are expected to give the precinct desk officer a $5 tip for each gambler that the plainclothes man arrests and the desk officer must process. “Of course a gambling arrest is a lot of extra work for the desk officer,” a senior police official explained. “But the real reason for the tip is that the desk officer knows the plain clothes man is making a lot of money—that the arrest usually is in some way phony—and he wants his share of the pie.” Some desk officers do not ac cept the tips to expedite the paperwork. “When I had a precinct,” one unit commander said, “I had a desk officer that was not going along with this practice. I'd be in my office and I would hear him shouting: ‘You put that back in your pocket! I get paid for this.’” A plainclothes man agreed, in recalling an encounter with a desk officer, that the $5 tip was not mandatory. “I don't have a pad,” he told the of ficer. “I'm not on the payoff. I'm not taking anything and there's nothing going out.” “And I was really surprised that this time I hit someone who was really impressed,” the policeman added. “And he said, fine, that's O.K. with me.'” In some precincts, policemen say, even to get a “good scat” in a radio car they must pay. “I was recently a patrolman,” a sergeant said. “In my pre cinct you were supposed to pay for getting a good sector on Sunday, for getting a good post. It's so systematized that the roll‐call man actually would know in a dollar figure how many pickups were on your post, and you were supposed to kick in accordingly.” By “pickups,” he said, he meant small weekly payments made by many businesses so they could operate on Sunday in violation of the state's sab bath law. According to the Joint Legis lative Committee on Crime and most law‐enforcement experts, the numbers racket, or policy game, is the single most regu lar source of police corruption in New York. The numbers racket — a six‐day‐a‐week lot tery in which players can put down small amounts of money —is an enormous business. One estimate by United States Treasury agents several years ago figured that the five major number operations, or hanks, in New York were re ceiving $1.5‐billion a year in bets. If this estimate is correct, the numbers operation's annual gross is bigger than that re ported by one of New York's major industries — dressmak ing. Some experts estimate that 1 per cent of the gross of the numbers operation, of $15‐mil lion a year, is spent on payoffs at all levels of government. Assigned to stamping out this popular, carefully organ ized and well‐financed indus try are 600 plainclothes men — patrolmen assigned to the uniformed force but who wear civilian clothes. The result, ac cording to many knowledgeable sources, is corruption and the transformation of many of these units from law‐enforce ment agencies trying to sup press gambling to regulatory agencies licensing it. Some policemen recalled that when they went to plain clothes school some of their classmates complained that go ing to the school was delay ing them from getting out into the street and collecting graft. Others asserted that the rela tionship between gamblers and policemen was so well organ ized that a special mark was put on the envelopes‐ contain ing the number slips. The mark, they said, indicated to knowl edgeable policemen that the “work” had been paid for and should be returned if possible. “These merkings are put on by the controller (a top man in the numbers racket).” one policeman said. “If there's an ro‐de in the meantimed and the plainclothes men are on this work is supposed to go back because these people are paying for protection.” During the recent trial of a numbers operator who con ducted his business in a hall way in the garment district, a policeman testified that he had stood in line and let 18 gam blers do business with the op erator before he arrested him. After the arrest, the special headquarters ‐ level policeman testified, he told the gambler, “You act as if you have a li cense.” “I do,” the gambler was quoted by the policeman as saying. “You don't think I'd op erate in the open like this without a license.” The police man testified that the gambler then showed him two old lot tery tickets that apparently had been given the gambler by a lower‐level policeman as a sign that would guarantee free dom from arrest. A plainclothes man working in Brooklyn said his Manhattan colleagues harassed him be caused he arrested every gam bler he could, rather than the ones who failed to pay off. “There were some who paid and seldom got arrested,” he said. “It seemed like our real purpose was to beat down the competiton of the gamblers who paid, to help them main tain their monopoly.” Shortly after this policeman was assigned to a plainclothes squad, another policeman handed him an envelope with $300 in it. “This is from Jew ish Max,” the policeman was told. The policeman, disturbed by the corruption, took his com plaint to Capt. Philip J. Foran, then commander of the police unit assigned to Commissioner Fraiman's Investigation Depart ment. “Well, we do one of two things,” the policeman and a colleague quoted Captain Foran as saying. “I'll take you into the Commissioner and he'll drag you in front of a grand jury and by the time this thing is through you'll be found floating in the East River, face down. Or you can just forget the whole thing.” After a discussion about what he should do with the money, the plainclothes man said, he “gave the envelope to my supervisor, who was a ser geant of plainclothes, and he was very grateful for it — he snapped it out of my hand like he was an elephant and I had a peanut.” In another instance, this time in the Bronx, a young plain clothes man was taken to a bar by another policeman and introduced to a gambler. “This guy reached into his pocket and took out some bills and he peeled them off and he gave some to the other officer and peeled off some more and offered it to me,” the police man recalled. “And I said to him, What's that for?” He says, ‘Get your self a hat.’ And I said, ‘Well, I have enough hats.’ So he said, Go on, take it.” I said If you have anything for me, give it to him, and turned around and walked out.” The policeman explained that to have taken any action against the gambler would have violated all the “rules” of plainclothes men and possibly put his life in danger. He went on: “I know the payoff was around—it would fluctuate from from $800 to $1.000 a month per man. I would go around with them and at times I've even helped them count it. They would put it into neat little bundles for everybody. “They would have meeting places and some of the guys would maintain private apart ments. And they would allot double or a share and a half for lieutenants.” The plainclothes man refused to keep any money for himself. “Well, it seemed that my part ner told them that I was O.K. but he probably was keeping a double share for himself,” he said. He recalled one policeman who was “nice enough to say: just keep it for you. Whenever you want it, I got it. And if you ever change your mind, I'll have it for you.” A lieutenant who did not know that the plainclothes man was not “on the pad” offered “to store my money — my share of the money — in his attic — he said he had a quite adequate amount of room in his attic.” The plainclothes man, ap palled by what he saw, said he took the information about corruption in the Bronx to Cornelius J. Behan, now an insnector in charge of the Police Department's prestigious planning division, and to Mr. Kriegel, the mayoral assistant. Both meetings took place in the fall of 1967 he said — one in a parked car and the other in Mr. Kriegel's basement office in City Hall. Inspector Behan, according to the plainclothes man, said he would inform First Deputy Commissioner John F. Walsh. Mr. Kriegel said he would look into the matter, the plain clothes man said. The plainclothes man said he went to Inspector Behan because he was a man of widely recognized integrity. Six months later, with no sign of activity from Police headquarters or City Hall, the plainclothes man and a policeman friend who knew Mr. Fraiman said they met in the then Commissioner's apart ment. “That night, his reaction you know, really, he was sitting on the edge of his chair,” the friend recalled. “Then we started discussing technical things of how we were really going to handle it. And the decision was made that I was going to get a bug and I we were going to meet and was going to bug the surveil lance truck.” The surveillance truck was used by Bronx policemen to se cretly observe gambling opera tions. According to the policeman's account, two days after the meeting in the Fraiman apart ment, Captain Foran, the com mander of the unit assigned to the Investigation Department, called the policeman inform ant's friend. He said he was told to “bring the hug back to the office forthwith.” A few days later, according to the account, Commissioner Fraiman was asked by the plainclothes man's friend why the investigation was called off. “He literally would not dis cuss it.” the friend asserted. “lie wouldn't discuss it for months. Ultimately, after nonths, the only answer Frai man would make was that he the plaintclothes informant was a psycho and that they couldn't get involved and that le wasn't willing to cooperate. And that just absolutely was lot the case.” After many months of no vis ible action from Headquarters police investigators, the Police Department learned that the investigation Department had also been informed about the regular payoffs to policemen in the Bronx. Information about the case then was sent to po lice officials in the Bronx and to District Attorney Burton B. Roberts. In February, 1969, a Bronx grand jury indicted eight po licemen on perjury charges and numerous gamblers for con tempt charges, including one who was revealed to be an agent of Joseph (Bayonne Joe) Zicarelli. The case against one of the policemen now is being tried and the jury is expected to hand up its decision Mon day. The cases against the sev en other policemen are pend ing. Police corruption in nar cotics enforcement, according to all policemen interviewed, is nowhere near as carefully organized as corruption in gambling enforcement. But because the potential profits are much larger, indi vidual narcotics detectives are constantly tempted. In recent years, for example, three New York narcotics detectives, two Tassau County investigators and a Federal agent were ar rested on charges of selling drugs. Last year two detectives were arrested and accused of trying ?? bribe an assistant district attorney in the Bronx to go casy on a heroin wholesaler. Only last month three detec tives were charged with ex corting $1,200 in cash, 105 “decks” of heroin and a va riety of personal possessions From five New Yorkers. But there is some evidence that a more regular kind of corruption is not entirely un known. One policeman, with six years of experience in the narcotics division and its elite special investigating unit, said one of his fellow detectives ar ranged payoffs to policemen from the largest heroin dealer. These payoffs, he said, ranged from $5,000 for chang ing testimony just enough so a drug‐seller would not be con victed to $50,000 for the sale of a “wire” — the recorded conversation made by a police wiretap or bug. The detective who allegedly arranged the payoffs recently was shot and seriously wounded in a gun battle near a Bronx hangout of major heroin im porters. The case now is under investigation. The detective who described the alleged incident to The Times said that, in at least one case he knew, several of his colleagues collected a great deal of damaging evidence about major heroin dealer, let the al leged payoff arranger know they had the evidence and then waited for a bid from the crim inals. The bid came and the money was collected, he said. Several high‐ranking police officials said in interviews that many narcotic detectives — be cause they are encouraged to meet a quota of four felony arrests a month and because so little money is available to pay informers—resort to steal ing drugs from one addict and giving it to another to buy in formation. In addition to the graft po tential in the narcotics traffic itself, corrupt policemen are in a position to exert considerable pressure on the owners of bars and restaurants. This is because a narcotics arrest in such an establishment means the owner can lose his liquor license. A detective with several years of experience in narcotics enforcement said he heard a top commander in the nar cotics division chastising an other official for not demand ing and receiving regular pay offs from the bars in his juris diction. But the payments to police men by an unknown number of New York's 4,434 licensed taverns is only one of a variety of payments made by legiti mate businesses and institu tions in New York. Some of the 2,232 licensed liquor stores, for example, also make various kinds of pay ments to the police. One busy West Side liquor dealer said: “At Christmas time, the eight men working in the patrol car get $5 apiece, the five ser geants net $10 each and the two lieutenants get $50 each. Then there are the Christmas bottles—they usually want the most expensive brand of Scotch—for the traffic police men, the mounted policemen and eight or nine precinct pa trolmen who come in with their hands out. “Then over a year, the guys will come in and say, Well, I'm going on vacation, how about a bottle? or give some other excuse why they should get something for nothing. Fi nally, I'm expected to sell at cost—no profit at all—to all the copsin the area. I estimate that all of this costs me be tween $2,000 and $3,000 a year.” The businessman knew he was acting in violation of state law, but said he got something for his money. “First, I want my customers and suppliers to be able to double‐park for a few minutes without getting a summons,” he explained. “Second, I know that when I call for help the precinct will come pretty fast.” Construction companies are another vineyard for the police, although the amount paid seems to vary from borough to borough and even from pre cinct to precinct. A Manhattan architect said that it was his experience that the standard fee for the police was $400 a month and that the money usually was picked up by the sergeant. A Greenwich Village contrac tor said in an interview that he recently paid the police $500 while he was renovating a brownstone. “This guy came around and said, I've come to see you for the boys.” the contractor de clared. “I was amazed because he was so open. There were five laborers standing around watching. The job was pretty messy so I decided I better, pay. I reached in my pocket and gave him $20. He said that's not enough; it's $40 a month for the sergeant and $5 month — $40 altogether — for the eight guys in the patrol car.” What annoyed me was that this payment didn't even stop the parking tickets.” Another contractor new to the city and on hit, first job —a Lower East Side renovation —said a policeman came around and told him he wanted to make “some financial arrange ments.” “The sergeant told me the fee for his services would be $40 a month,” the contractor said. “I asked him what the $40 would give me and he said something about there being 13 sergeants in the precinct and they would leave me alone. “After I gave him the money he was very congenial and kept asking me whether all the financial conditions were sat isfactory. He was very pleasant. Prior to that he was sort of demanding.” According to another contrac tor, the extortion of money from construction companies is so regular that members of the force in one precinct did not even hesitate when the con tractor started building a new precinct house for them. “I was amazed, they came around and nut the arm on me for $40 a week” be said. Another source of illegal money is said to be the “reward” some insurance companies and other concerns pay detectives for the return of stolen goods. A few months ago a lieuten ant and detective on the Lower West Side were indicted on charges of extorting $5,000 from Montgomery Ward with the promise that with the money they would be able to find two trucks filled with radio equipment that had been hijacked. Because such arrangements usually remain secret, it is not easy to estimate how frequently they take place. But one knowledgable agent or the Federal Buerau of Investi gation said he felt the pay ments of rewards was not un usual. “It's a lot cheaper to pay a $5,000 bribe,” he said,” than to lose $100,000 worth of mink coats.” The $25 finder's fee nor mally given by car‐rental agencies for the recovery of one of their stolen cars was described as another source of illegal income for policemen, “I don't see anything wrong with it — even though taking the dough is against regula tions,” a detective said. Many policemen become lonely, despairing and frus trated because they feel there is nothing they can do about the continuing corruption they witness every working day. “I remember one time we went on a call,” a Brooklyn policeman said. “A girl had tried to commit suicide by tak ing an overdose of pills. Three patrol cars responded and there were six of us standing around this little one‐room apartment, the girl lying there, just breath ing. “One of the guys walked over to her dresser and scooped up a large handful of subway tokens and dropped them in his pocket. No one said a word. It killed me, but there was noth ing to do. There was no sense telling the sergeant because he was part of the club.”

1071-> June Havoc Named A Director in South
“Havoc,” said the voice on the telephone. But it wasn't someone reporting a disaster. It was a businesslike June Havoc, taking a call from New York. Miss Havoc doesn't have much time for unnecessary words these days. She re cently succeeded Stuart Vaughan as artistic director of the New Orleans Repertory Theater, one of the country's newer nonprofit resident act ing organizations. In addi tion, she's directing as well as appearing in the revival of “The Threepenny Opera,” with which she opens her season tonight. “I go halfway around the clock.” Miss Havoc said, mak ing herself comfortable for the long‐distance interview. “I'm at the office at 10. Re hearsals start at 11 and go till 2. Then from 3 to 8. After that I get a chance to work on my own part. I'm playing Jenny. But I'm terribly happy. I'm in a mind‐expanded state. I have a clear vision of what I'm doing and I'm not tied up in knots, so I'm capable of enjoying every minute of it.” Miss Havoc's appointment to the artistic directorship of a theater may startle those who know her mostly as an erstwhile vaudeville perform er; participant in seven marathon dance contests dur ing the Great Depression or, as a stage, screen and tele vision star. But, as she could quickly point out—and does—per forming isn't her only forte. She also is the author of “Early Havoc,” an autobiog raphy, as well as of “Mara thon '33,” the play she wrote and directed for the Actors Studio at the ANTA Theater a few years ago, for which she won a Tony nomination. To doubters she could simply say, “I've directed 23 productions around the coun try, including Edward Albee's ‘A Delicate Balance.’” For the New Orleans com pany's fourth season, short ened as a result of Mr. Vaughan's departure along with the acquisition of a new base for the troupe—an 180‐ year‐old former synagogue— Miss Havoc is preparing three productions in addition to “Threepenny.” Following at four‐week in tervals will come Murray Schisgal's “Luv.” for which she has persuaded Richard Mulligan to take the role created by Alan Arkin; Clare Boothe's “The Women,” which she has edited some what and which will see Julie Harris in one of the major parts: Tennessee Williams's “A Streetcar Named Desire” and Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's “The Fantasticks.” “I inherited these shows,” Miss Havoc says. But there isn't a trace of defensiveness in her voice. “Actually, I'm very pleased with them. Next season we'll do 10. What I want mainly from this first year is for it to be one of pleasure, of investigation. “I'm not a specialist. I don't think theater is for a limited few. Our intention is not to shock or terrify and, I know these are dirty words these days, but I want this theater to amuse and to charm.” The suggestion to head the repertory company, Miss Ha voc said, came as a total sur prise. At the invitation of Mr. Vaughan, she visited New Orleans following her appear ance on Broadway in the all star revival of “Dinner at Eight.” She played in “The Rivals.” It was the first time she had been in the city in 20 years. “I loved the place then and I fell in love with it all over again,” she recalled. “To a lot of people I'm a woman with a kind of fluf fy background—musical com edy, vaudeville. And so few wish to examine closely that actually it's a good backdrop —20 years of study with Studio, everything from Stan islaysky to Grotowski, mem bership in the New Drama tists. I had to overcome that false image of June Havoc.” She thinks she got the di recting bug from Elia Kazan, not only in the early days at the Studio but also in his stage production of “Dunni gan's Daughter” and the mov ie “Gentleman's Agreement.” Her own working procedure with actors; she said, “is much like Kazan's, who knew how to draw you out.” Which, she went on is how she likes to work with actors. “I am not a director who foists my opinions on others. The people in my company are miles away from me. They couldn't translate me. I want them to be creative, daring actors, people who are willing to make asses of themselves on their way to finding what they're looking for. I want them to discover themselves.”

1072-> Computer Spurring Research
In the last third of the 20th century, mathematics has be come the key tool in almost all of the physical and so cial sciences. A high degree of mathematical knowledge is now expected routinely not only of physicists and chem ists but also of biologists, economists, sociologists and even some historians and po litical scientists. Theories and working hy potheses in the most diverse fields are now expressed in terms of equations using not only the language of ordi nary algebra, but also deriva tives, matrices and even more advanced concepts. And more and more the crucial test of a theory's worth is its ability to predict correctly the be havior of its subject, whether it is an atomic nucleus or the American economy. It is the stress on numer ical results and quantitative, not qualitative, predictions that gives the computer its present central and increas ing role in scientific research. Without the computer's abil ity to perform millions and even billions of calculations in relatively short time pe iods, large areas of contem porary research would be im possible. The arithmetic involved in testing or studying many theories would require un counted man‐years of work if done manually, or even with the help of an old‐fash ioned electric calculator. Typically, in many fields, a scientist summarizes his knowledge of his hypothesis about a given phenomenon by preparing a mathematical model. In meteorology, it may be a series of equations sum ming up the interactions of different layers of the atmos phere and the forces working on them. In sociology, the model's equations may por tray the different socio‐eco nomic groups in a typical city and the factors determining their migration into or out of that community. Computers permit sci entists to use these models for simulation purposes. If the model describes the American economy, for ex ample, the economist may as sume certain basic values of the fundamental parameters, say a given rate of interest, a given volume of govern ment spending and the like. By inserting these numeri cal values into the model and employing the computer, the economist can study the be havior of production or em ployment under the assumed conditions. If the assumed parameters are taken from past historical records, the economist can compare the computer's predictions with the actual experience for the period from which parame ters were chosen. The corres pondence or lack of corres pondence of the predictions, with the actuality is a meas urement of the usefulness of the model. A simulation study may permit the examination of the long‐term behavior of some phenomena. Thus a model of the city's population may be manipulated with the use of computers to trace the growth, and perhaps the decline, of a community over 50 or 100 years under some reasonable assumption as to the factors involved. The more powerful the com puters available, the more complex the models that can, be employed and the wider the range of data that re searchers can incorporate in to their simulations. There is nothing strange, therefore, about the rapid growth of computer facilities on university campuses in re cent years and the ceaseless demand for even greater availability of these powerful research tools for all branch es of science.

1073-> THREE‐YEAR EXILE IS ENDED BY BOSCH
SANTO DOMINGO, Domini can Republic, April 16 — Juan Bosch, leader of the Domini can leftist opposition, returned from three years of exile to day and received a tumultuous welcome despite police efforts to restrain his supporters. Mr. Bosch, who flew in a chartered airliner from Cura cao, 500 miles south of here, was allowed to return for the campaign for the presidential election May 16. He was met at Las Americas Airport by a huge crowd of well‐wishers, shouting “Revolution now!” and waving flags. The highway leading into the capital from the airport was lined with welcoming crowds and a throng congre gated at the bridge where an I8‐year‐old mother of two was killed yesterday by the police during a pro‐Bosch rally. Troops were at strategic places on the highway and in the entrances to the city, as they have been for more than a week, when President Joa quin Balaguer ordered virtual military occupation of poorer districts, closed the University of Santo Domingo with tanks and suspended all public‐school classes until June 1 because of growing agitation. The police fired on the fu neral procession for the young woman slain yesterday, critical ly wounding a boy in the group, which was shouting anti‐Gov ernment slogans. The political tension over Mr. Bosch's return was offset some what by the announcement that Mr. Balaguer, who assumed office in 1966, had agreed to take leave from the presidency for the period through the elec tion, in which he is a candi date for re‐election. The temporary withdrawal will place Manuel Ramón Ruiz Tejada, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in the presidency for the campaign period. Such a step was a demand of some of the opposition pres idential candidates as a con dition for running against Mr. Balaguer. They had argued that his continuation in office would make the election un fair because of his control of the police and of public funds. The seven non‐Communist opposition parties, including the Dominican Revolutionary party of Mr. Bosch, had agreed to abstain unless Mr. Balaguer re signed. Mr. Balaguer, whose term ends in August, rejected that view and has succeeded in splitting the opposition front, since at least four of the op position parties have accepted his offer to take a leave. The Dominican Revolutionary party is one of those that have not agreed to Mr. Balaguer's formula and will abstain.

1074-> SOVIET SAID TO JAIL A JEWISH PETITIONER
LONDON, April 16—A So viet Jewish woman, who had tried repeatedly to obtain per mission to join her father in Israel, was reported today to have been sentenced to two and a half years in prison on charges of having slandered the Soviet Union and insulted the authorities. Mrs. Lilia Abramovna Ont man was said to have been sentenced on Jan. 8 after trial in Chernovtsy, a city in the western. Ukraine inhabited by many Jews. The account of the trial came from Emanual Litvinoff, a writer and editor and publisher of the magazine he founded 12 years ago, “Jews in Eastern Europe,” which is published quarterly in English, French and Italian. He said he had received the information from “reliable sources” in the Soviet Union. According to Mr. Litvinoff, Mrs. Ontman had submitted several petitions to the Soviet authorities requesting permis sion for herself, her husband, her adopted child and her sister to join her father in Israel. After the rejection of her petitions, Mrs. Ontman was re ported to have said that she no longer considered herself a Soviet citizen. According to the reports, she then ignored a summons instructing her to re trieve her documents and was arrested in October, 1969. Peter Sprague, a 31‐year‐old businessman, was designated yesterday as the candidate of the New York County Republi can executive committee to op pose Representative Edward 1. Koch, Democrat of Manhattan's 17th Congressional District. If he wins the June 23 primary election Mr. Sprague, will seek to win back the House seat the Republicans lost to Mr. Koch after Theodore R. Kupferman resigned to become a State Supreme Court justice.

1075-> ‘Sesame’ Opens Door to Knowledge
There is a young and impressionable mind out there that is very hungry for information, and very capable of receiv ing and storing it, in large doses, begin ning noticeably soon after birth. It has latched on to an electronic tube as its main source of nourishment. Children, along with their elders, were front‐row spectators when a man took his first hesitant steps on the surface of the moon. Riots, confrontations, songs and dances—all those images, bearing all kinds of messages, commercial and otherwise are seen by the child almost from the day he is born. The result is providing a most intense —and at times frightening—challenge to traditional means of education. That television his created an infor mation revolution in our society is be yond doubt. That education has not begun to come to grips with either the import or the potential of television is becoming increasingly disturbing. Within the last two years alone, tele vision has brought into the home, in full view of young children, two brutal and tragic assassinations of American leaders. It has shown, day by day in all its horror, a war being fought. Educators today too often look upon television as a competitor—as an act too difficult to follow. The clear challenge for education in the 1970's is to make it an ally, by adapting to its uses this versatile medium. The Children's Television Workshop's “Sesame Street” experiment, both in concept and practice, is helping to lay some of the groundwork for such a step in education. “Sesame Street” is an hour‐long, daily television show that utilizes contemporary television tech niques to help preschoolers start to acquire some, of the skills they will need when they begin formal education. While Sesame Street” certainly did not create the television revolution, it represents the first major national effort to understand it, to cope with it, and to utilize it in education. • In 1966, at the request of the Carnegie Corporation, I undertook to study the feasibility of such a project. In the proc ess we were able to identify three major phenomena surrounding the preschooler to which, although obvious now in retro spect, no one had really given much thought. The first was that 96 per cent of all families in the nation owned televisiofi sets. The second was that in homes with youngsters the set was on as many as 60 hours a week, and before they reached school they may have had the opportunity to spend more hours before the television set than they would spend in the classroom for the first five years of schooling. The third was the growing consensus among researchers and educators in the early childhood field that there was a critical need to begin education earlier than the traditional age of 5 or 6. This was particularly true for the so‐called disadvantaged child, who enters primary school as much as a year or more behind his middle‐class counterparts in terms of intellectual development, and never does catch up. There certainly was no doubt that youngsters were learning from television. Everywhere, children manifested recognition of the names of cereals on grocery shelves. It was difficult to find a child who couldn't recite the latest television commercials and sing the jingles. The phenomenon gave promise of something with potentially a greater benefit for the children, not to mention the parents and the country itself. The project was given further impetus when Carnegie joined with the Ford Foundation and the United States Office of Education, and several other private and government groups, including Proj ect Head Start, to provide the $8‐million necessary for a two‐year experiment. In forming the curriculum, we were able to make the first major departure from the past. We felt it imperative to set a curriculum that took into account how the medium functioned. And so, as we sought out the experts in early child hood education and psychology, we also invited media specialists to join with us in this new venture. In a series of seminars, we posed the problems to, among others, the men and women who were creating and pro ducing the advertising commercials that had so captivated the imaginations of our youngsters. Researchers, psychia trists, writers and teachers worked side by side with cartoonists, filmmakers, musicians, and television producers as we hammered out the curriculum for “Sesame Street.” Together, we decided on several major curriculum goals: recognition of the let ters of the alphabet, recognition of numbers 1 through 10 and simple counting ability; beginning reasoning skills, vocabulary and an increased awareness of self and the world. Then, before we actually produced anything, we set up the means for a “dialogue” with members of our tar get audience—the 3‐, 4‐ and 5‐year‐olds for whom “Sesame Street” was being created. This past summer we produced five pilot shows and, in an out‐of‐town tryout, tested them in 100 homes in Philadelphia over a UHF channel unused during the daytime hours. We later tested the shows in day‐care centers in New York City. The results of the tests played a crucial role in the forma tion of the program, which is now being broadcast by nearly 190 stations throughout the country. • The cost of such educational pro grams will not be small. The worst of television is expensive. But nonetheless it is worth noting that with the show reaching about six million children a day, the $8‐million budget for “Sesame Street” amounts quite literally to a little more than a penny a child. The over‐all educational impact of “Sesame Street” will not be known until next summer. An independent re search agency, Educational Testing Serv ice, tested more than 1,200 preschool children in Carolina, Massachu setts, Pennsylvania, and Arizona to de termine their educational achievement level before they began viewing “Sesa me Street.” They will be tested again at the end of the series and the results evaluated. We remain hopeful that “Sesame Street” will be pronounced as much success after the research results are in as it has been initially. Every indica tion thus far encourages us in the belief that television has a significant role to play in the education of young people in the nineteen‐seventies. Regardless of outcome, “Sesame Street” was not designed to replace the classroom. The most sanguine among us do not believe it can provide a com prehensive preschool experience for young children. We argue only that pre school educators and those involved in the teaching of older children have with in their reach a powerful weapon that they can either employ to their own ends of education or allow it to continue to undermine their best efforts.

1076-> Social Theories Awaiting Resolution
Theoretical knowledge is a central and crucial feature in the post ‐ industrial society, Whose lineaments are now be ginning to emerge in the United States. It is the source of innovation and policy making. In looking ahead to the 1970's, I would single out three areas in which some major theoretical problem will have to be resolved. The first, in sociology, is the possibility of the develop ment of “macrosociology.” The second, in economics and public policy, is the develop ment of a means of determin ing how social choices should be made. The third, in the area of education and psychology, is the argument over behavi oral conditioning versus in tuitive development of lan guage patterns. Macrosociology—which in volves dealing with total so cial pictures instead of with small parts of the pictures— is a cumbersome word. Per haps its meaning is best ex plained by the analogy of macro‐economics. Until about 40 years ago, most economics was “micro economics,” that is, it was concerned with the economic behavior of the person or the company within the frame work of supply and demand. But none of the behavior was seen in totality. We did not know how the economy, as an economy, was faring. The development of macro economics — principally the idea of gross national product (the total sum of goods and services) and national income analysis—allowed us to see, on balance, whether the econ omy was advancing or declin ing, and for what reasons. Sociology today is at the stage of economics 40 years ago. We write about social mo bility, occupational changes, levels of education, degrees of health, rates of crime, but we have no over‐all measures of society's performance. Nor do we have any clear notion of the relation of the phenome na to one another. The development of an ade quate macrosociology depends upon our ability to solve three problems—the creation of a set of social indicators, the setting up of a system of social accounts, and the for mulation of a working model of the social system. Social Indicators: We have indicators of economic activ ity —levels of investment, rates of personal consump tion, rates of unemployment, inventories of firms, amount of debt, arid so on—and these become combined into over all indices of performance. But we do not have any gen eral indices of social per formance. We know how much money is being spent on doctors, nurses, hospitals, research, but we do not know whether the nation is healthier or not. There is no over‐all index of health. We know how much money is being spent on schools, teachers, materials, but we do not know whether the students know more or not. We know there is great apprehension about crime, but we do not actually know whether the amount of crime is going up or not. The analysis of crime is a useful starting point. There is a Federal Bureau of Investi gation “crime index,” but this index jumbles together all “major crimes,” whether they be murder or theft, or rapes, into one gross figure. But how does one “weigh” murder (whose rate has been reasonably constant over 30 years) in relation to theft (which has been rising)? Social Accounts: The social indicators alone provide only a limited part of the story. If we are looking ultimately to policy, we have to get a picture of the costs of our not having the benefits as well as the costs and antici pated benefits of fulfilling goals. In short, we need ledgers that give us measures of over‐all performance—in the environment, in housing, in health, and so on. What this calls for is a full‐fledged sys tem of social accounts, just as a business has a set of fi nancial accounts or the gov ernment a set of economic ac counts. With such a system of so cial accounts, we would be able to measure how well we are doing in meeting goals, just as we have measures now of economic growth, full employment, or how far we fall short of realizing poten tial gross national product. Social Models: Economists have both analytical and mathematical models of the economic system. The Brook ings Econometric Model for economic forecasting identi fies 36 sectors (agriculture, Federal Government, durable and nondurable goods indus tries, and so on) and sets up 150 interacting equations to map the economy. With such a model, one can identify causal relations and also determine policy “trade offs” of the positives and neg atives — for example, growth versus price stability, infla tion versus employment. But we have no models for the social system. The grand masters of social science did propose certain broad models. Thus, a Marxi an model specifies that the stratification or class system of a society will be organized around property relations, and that a change in property re lations will affect such things as political power, law and ideology. The trouble with such models, at best, is that they are broad metaphors. At worst, they are oversimplified or even untrue. One of the difficulties in dealing with class and power in the United States is that there is not one, but several overlapping bases of strati fication. Skill rather than property becomes the basis of power and education becomes more important than direct inherit ance. And cutting across the two, a political base looms even more important as a means of getting ahead in the society, such as the ethnic groups have demonstrated. But even when such broad relationships can be estab lished, they do not tell us much about the subsystems or sectors of the society in the way economists can deal with their refined variables. We have to specify the rela tionship of the educational system to the occupational system, of family structure to social mobility, and so on. The work on these relation ships, in a systematic way, has only begun in the last dozen years or so. It remains a major intellectual task ahead. Another problem is in find ing agreement within a so ciety on the choices to be made by that society in the purchases of goods and services. When three or more per sons want three or more dif ferent things, there is a logi cal problem in getting a clear majority choice. When a whole society is involved and the choices are multiplied, the problem of agreement be comes infinitely more com plicated. How can you solve such a difficult problem in a demo cratic society? Individuals who want dif ferent things, based on their scale of values, can order them in a set of preferences that can be “rationally” scaled. But when one turns from individual decision to that of groups, when we come to the problem of how to amalgamate conflicting pref erences into a compromise preference for the society as a whole, we seem to be at an impasse. A whole set of “solutions” has been suggested and a whole new field of political economy centered on choice has developed. Yet we seem unable, on the level of theory, to formulate a “group theory” of economic choice. Man seems to differ from other animals primarily by his ability to use language. Language frees us from spe cific signs and allows us to store up, in abstract patterns, the accumulated knowledge of the species. But how do we learn, specifically, language. Is lan guage knowledge a stored set of patterns acquired by con stant repetition and detailed training, or are there innate properties of the mind that allow us intuitively to grasp rules and transform symbols into hitherto completely nov el areas? The issue has been dramatized as one between B. F. Skinner of Harvard and Noam Chomsky of the Massa chusetts Institute of Tech nology. Skinner, a behaviorist, bases his psychology on stimulus‐response that be comes learned or stored, by operant conditioning through selective reinforcement. Chomsky believes in a “men talistic” approach, that the mind has certain invariant structures that can generate new sentences in accordance with simpler rules that it has first grasped. Arcane and abstruse, in these shorthand terms, the issue has great meaning for all education and learning. Skinner's theories are ap plied in programmed learning and other devices that pro vide operant conditioning and reinforcement. Chomsky's theories are expressed in the work of various psychologists who believe that one teaches, even children, to look for the “structure” or patterns of thought, and thus emphasize the conceptual or rule‐ascer taining mode of teaching. It is difficult to say whether there is any experimental de sign that can “medicate” these conflicting claims. But in the next decade, psycholog fists and educators will be searching for a decision on these contradictory theories. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, as Warren Weaver has pointed out, science learned, to analyze two‐vari able problems—the way in which, for example, gas pres sure depended on the volume of the gas. Up to 1900, most of the solutions of science were of this order of logic. In the 20th century, how ever, statistical methods were developed to deal with problems of a thousand vari ables or more by the applica tion of probability theory, which brought some order into random processes. If one wants to determine the factors that combine to influence a voter's choice, or a buying decision, or the in teraction of factors that ac count for industry location, traffic flows, residential seg regation and the like, we have to juggle factors (assum ing we can identify them cor rectly) in the range between three and a hundred. Most of the problems of social science are in that realm. Now that we have the corn putor, now that the art of computer simulation allows us to duplicate and project real‐life situations, it may be possible, for the first time, to have an experimental social science. That is one of the great intellectual adventures that lies ahead.

1077-> Mental Ability Linked to Childhood Diet
Evidence has mounted that a child receiving the wrong food or not enough food during the critical first three years of life will in all likelihood suffer some degree of permanent physical and men tal impairment. The damage is thought to be irrever sible. The cost in human suffering and lost potential is incalculable. The task ahead in the 1970's, and perhaps beyond, will be to discover the precise mechanisms by which the dam age is done. There are two primary areas of re search: biochemical research in the lab oratory and environmental research in the cities and towns where malnour ished children are commonly found. In the laboratory, biochemists have uncovered some startling facts. The brains of malnourished rats, pigs and even humans have fewer cells than the brains of properly nourished animals. Brain size is measurably different. Body size varies according to quality and quantity of feeding. The formation of critical nervous tissue is impaired in malnourished animals. And the rate of brain growth seems to be seriously affected. At Rockefeller University over the last five years, virologists have been conducting some interesting experi ments with rats. First, intestinal tissue is removed from adult rats who have been raised in a “ghettoized” environ ment. The tissue is then spread on the lips of newborn rats within a critical two‐day period after birth. The “infected” infant rats do not exhibit any signs of illness after this treatment, but they nevertheless suffer permanent physical and mental retarda tion. Growing up in the best physical, environment, they never reach the nor mal size of rats and their brain size is reduced by about 10 per cent. Scientists suspect that something in the intestinal tissue interferes with the ability of the newborn rat to metabolize food at a critical stage of brain devel opment. The whole phenomenon, they say, is similar to a viral infection, but they do not yet know the nature of the virus. The question many biochemists will be asking in coming years is, What causes such cellular changes in the brain? They must find out exactly how cells divide and what makes them di vide. Then they must ask, What part does nutrition play on this cellular level? How does the rate of RNA, DNA and protein synthesis relate to nutri tion? What are the chemical controls of learning? These are the unanswered questions. Other scientists are looking to psy chological and environmental factors to learn how nutrition affects behavior. In animal studies they have found that well fed rats learn better and more quickly than poorly fed rats: They con clude, tentatively, that good environ mental stimulation and adequate diet are essential for normal development. A crucial, unresolved issue remains, however. That is, whether one can draw a cause‐effect relationship be tween the cellular chemical effect of malnutrition on the one hand and the psychological and environmental ef fects on the other hand, as explained by one nutrition expert, Dr. Myron Winick of the Cornell University Medical School in New York. What produced the learning impedi ments in malnourished children might not be the same thing as what produced the chemical changes in the brain. Or it may be the same thing. The problem and challenge ahead, Dr. Winick said, will be to elucidate the broader mechanisms of learning, both in biochemical and psychological terms.

1078-> Honors in Racing Go to Personality And Fanfreluche
Mrs. Ethel D. Jacobs's Per sonality and Jean‐Louis Leves que's Fanfreluche were named yesterday the top 3‐year‐olds of 1970 by the Thoroughbred Racing Associations. Personality was the leading money‐winner of 1970 with earnings of $444,049. He won eight of 18 races. Among them were the Wood Memorial, the Preakness, the Jersey Derby, the Jim Dandy and the Wood ward. Fanfreluche, who took filly honors, was the winner of seven stakes. Earlier the T.R.A. had named Shuvee the top older mare and Nodouble the champion male older than 3. LONDON, Dec. 2 (UPI)—Ni jinsky, the first English triple crown winner since Bahram in 1935, was voted “racehorse of the year” by Britain's racing press today. Thirty‐eight of the 40 voting newsmen picked Nijinsky, with the remaining two votes going to Raffingora and My Swallow. Nijinsky, owned by the New Jersey platinum millionaire, Charles Englehard, was trained by Vincent O'Brien of Ireland. Unbeaten as a 2‐year‐old, Ni jinsky won the classic 2,000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Doncaster St. Leger among other races this year, but closed with two second‐place finishes before being retired to stud in the United States.

1079-> Israel Plans To Seal Off Hebron Site
JERUSALEM, April 24 — Is raeli defense officials have an nounced that “for military pur poses” they intend to close off a 750‐acre site in the town of Hebron, in the occupied area on the west bank of the Jordan. This type of action has previ ously been used to prepare for Jewish settlement in occupied Arab areas. The land is in the northwest ern sector of the town of about 40,000 Arabs, outside the thick ly settled areas. An undisclosed number of Arab families that live in the site will probably be told to leave, although pre sumably with compensation. A statement by the Defense Ministry outlining major points of the arrangement was issued today in response to what it said were inaccurate accounts appearing this morning in sev eral Israeli newspapers. These reports said that the mayor of Hebron, Sheik Mo hammed Ali Jabari, had been informed by a military‐govern ment spokesman that certain lands would be taken over and that some of the area was in habited by Arab citizens. Today's statement by the ministry confirmed that an area would be closed off for military purposes, but said that no men tion was made of sequestra tion, or seizure of land. A spokesman for the west bank military government would not comment on the reasons for the closure. He did confirm the size of the plot and that Arab families were living there. The closure of an area for “military purposes” has had several meanings in occupied areas since the 1967 Arab Israeli war. It can mean the construction of a permanent military structure, the tempor ary use of an area for maneuv ers or the construction of para military or civilian settlements. Expansion of the Israeli civi lian settlement at Kfar Etzion, between Hebron and Jerusalem in the west‐bank area, began with the closure of the area for “military purposes.” Arab land owners had been told to move and had been given compensa tion. This pattern prompted some observers here to expect a similar move in Hebron, where the plan to settle Jewish fami lies was announced last month by the Israeli Government. Deputy Premier Yigal Allon announced in the Knesset, par liament, on March 25 that Israel dare not let Hebron remain “judenrein” [free of Jews]. Replying to demands by right‐wing members that Israel begin urban settlement in Hebron, Mr. Allon said that the Israeli Cabinet “had decided not to decide the political future of this area.” He added, however, that 250 Jewish families would be al lowed to settle there, expand ing the small colony of a few dozen families presently living within the military‐government compound. These settlers had originally sought to establish a Jewish community by renting rooms two years ago in the Park Hotel to celebrate the Passover holi I day and then refusing to leave. The Cabinet finally decided not to force them out, but to en close them in the Israeli mili tary compound. In announcing the proposed 250‐family compound, Mr. Allon said that the action “had no political significance.” However, some Israelis here and many abroad thought it had enor mous political significance.

1080-> Letters to the Editor of The Times
To the Editor: Recently rail service for the commuters from the six coun ties north of New York was a complete nightmare. Penn Cen tral's generally poor service went into a complete nose dive, scrapping schedules, canceling trains without notice. There were fires, derailments, in juries, and one death. Thousands of passengers were made to wait for hours on sub freezing station platforms for trains that did not appear, or if they did come, broke down or were stalled on their way in. Add to this agony the cor porate man‐hours of work lost and the time and money lost by the self‐employed, and you have millions of dollars of Theft‐of‐Service for which no body ever arrests the Penn Cen tral. The railroad, however, is quick to arrest a passenger who refuses to show a ticket when service is poor. Last week's disaster was the result of Penn Central's delib erate and greedy policy of un der‐maintenance of coaches, lo comotives, roadbed and signal equipment. The cold weather was merely the last straw. As chairman of the Trans portation Action Committee, the commuters' organization which rallied the support of thousands of commuters on the Harlem, Hudson & New Haven divisions, and succeeded in get ting the Public Service Com mission to issue a corrective order to the railroad for the first time in eighteen years, have met with Penn Central's management. I can testify that their disdainful attitude toward passengers, their incorrigible lack of public responsibility, and their arrogant flouting of public service standards and government orders are not only anachronistic but most fright ening. Governor Rockefeller should declare a state of emergency and the Penn Central should he listed as a disaster area. The Governor should use his emer gency powers to call a confer ence of the Penn Central man agement, rail labor leaders, committer leaders, and the Public Service commissioners to draw up plans for dealing with this disaster. Also, the Governor should order an in vestigation into the accidents and death to determine if there was criminal negligence. Meanwhile, T.A.C., together with the Greater Long Island Commuters Association, Central Island Commuters Association. ciation and the South Shore Commuters Association, have formed the Council of Com muters Organizations for joint action on behalf of one million voters comprising commuters and their families in the New York area. Perhaps these actions can close the transportation gap. MILTON A. HARTH Scarborough‐on‐Hudson, N. Y. Jan. 12, 1970 • To the Editor: Harry Mintzer proposes de duction of commuting expenses from gross income on income taxes. It seems unbelievable that there is no spontaneous outcry in favor of such a correction. The cost of getting to and from work is a foremost cost of earning a living. It is not net income, yet the taxpayer pays a tax on it as if it were. Often his net tax is raised to a higher bracket because of this. Although getting to and from work is an absolute un escapable cost of earning a living, entertainment of cus tomers is not, and it has no proper place in tax relief; yet the former is denied as a cost and the latter readily allowed. ARTHUR W. JONES Philadelphia, Jan. 9, 1970 • To the Editor: The news account I jam 71 by Robert B. Semple Jr. of the cost to taxpayers of President Nixon's “Western White House” shocked and maddened me, Mr. Nixon, I believe, divides his time at present between four official dwellings, only one of which is traditionally supported by the taxpayer for purposes of providing adequate and proper living accommodations for the President. Whether or not Mr. Nixon owns personally the real estate in question, he does not under write personally the cost of security precautions, furnish ings, transportation of himself, his family, and staff, the large expenditure to provide ade quate communication to Wash ington, etc. Urban renewal programs are being cut.. People are going hungry in our land. There is a strong feeling everywhere of unrest about and animosity toward unnecessary spending. I would hope that our Presi dent would have had a greater consciousness of the present day climate, let alone of need, than to commit the taxpayer's money to expenditures which cannot contribute toward the solution of America's ills and which might well contribute toward increased toward the Establishment for which Mr. Nixon stands. Katonah, N. Y., Jan. 13, 1970 • To the Editor: The capacity of Americans to marshal arguments for our righteousness in Vietnam is infinite. Leo Levitt, in his let ter of Jan. 4, insists that the Russians are the real aggres sors. How odd, in that event, that it is we who maintain half a million men in Vietnam, and we who proceed implacably to devastate the country. It may not he U.S. policy to round up civilians and shoot them, and it is compassionate of Mr. Levitt to deplore the Songmy episode. The fact. is, though, that we have killed and are killing untold thousands of civilians through tactics that are U.S. policy: our designation of free‐fire zones and the satu ra lion bombing by B‐52's, not to mention our resourcefulness in crop destruction and syste matic political assassination. Mr. Levitt's notion that vic tory for our antagonists in a civil war 10,000 miles from home would ultimately mean either Communist domination of the United States or all‐out war is a matter of opinion. The Munich analogy, equating an anticolonial revolution in Southeast Asia with Hitler's racist drive to conquer Europe and dominate the world,. is a paranoid fancy whose absurdity would perhaps be more appar ent if it were not for years of cold‐war sloganeering. LORRIN S. ANDERSON New York, Jan. 7, 1970 • To the Editor: In the light of your disclosure (news story Jan. 12) that the United States is paying all costs incurred in connection with Korea's military opera tions in South Vietnam, at a rate in excess of $135‐million per year, it is to say the least disingenuous on the part of Secretary Laird to state that the actions of the South Ko rean troops are not the respon sibility of the U.S. command. George Ill's Government, for all its faults, was not so men dacious as to disclaim respon sibility for the acts of its Hes sian mercenaries. Our Govern ment's mercenaries are likewise its responsibility, and that re sponsibility cannot be evaded. JOSEPH B. RUSSELL New York, Jan. 12, 1970 • To the Editor: Perhaps the Long Island housewife who faces jail for displaying the flag upside down. as an antiwar protest should he joined by those who display the flag in “patriotic support” of this war. After all, a desecra tion is a desecration. JEFF RAINER Eastchester, NI. Y., Jan. 13, 1970

1081-> Southern Teams Still Dominate Selections to Postseason Bowls
What is the dominant fac tor in selecting a college football team for a bowl, its won‐lost record or ability to sell tickets? College Sports Notes This problem faces the National Collegiate. Athletic Association when it reas sesses bowl games at its winter meetings. The jum bled and unattrac tive bowl scene points up the con tinuing fact that “there is a ques tion about the equity of selection,” accord ing to an N.C.A.A. staff member. This spokesman em phasized that there might be too many bowl games. The bowls are again filled with a number of Southeast ern Conference teams. Four are assured berths and a fifth, Louisiana State, will go to the Orange if the Tigers beat Mississippi Saturday. Mississippi is in the Gator in a match against Auburn, another Southeastern team. Alabama, which never fails to make a bowl trip, is going to the Bluebonnet against Oklahoma despite its record of six victories and five de feats. Tennessee is the other S.E.C. team slated for a bowl; the Volunteers meet Air Force in the Sugar. • The N.C.A.A. official said, “Bowls are geographically dominated by Southern teams.” The Southeastern has sent four or five of its 10 teams to bowl games for a number of years. According to the official, the fan potential from schools located near bowl sites is a prime factor in selecting teams. Except for Dartmouth the Northeast did not have a team truly qualified for a bowl, though it had teams with better records than Ala bama. The Midwest had a strong team in Michigan, but under Big 10 rules it could not go to a bowl even if it had beaten Ohio State. Dart mouth came under the same restriction in the Ivy League. The loser of the Texas‐Arkan sas game Saturday will be shut out of a bowl if Louisi ana State beats Mississippi that day. Thus strong teams will sit at home while lesser teams compete during the holidays. This season did not pro duce too many others worthy of bowl bids. As a result there talk in the N.C.A.A. about reducing the number of bowls. The association reviews the bowl situation every year. This may be the time to re consider a proposal to hold a college football playoff for the national championship, such as in basketball, hockey, soccer, baseball and other sports. A playoff would elim inate the meaningless bowl games. “Proponents of the playoff system might just perk up their ears this winter,” said the N.C.A.A. official. The major college bowls are: Rose—Stanford vs. Ohio State. Cotton—Texas or Arkan sas vs. Notre Dame. Sugar —Tennessee vs. Air Force. Orange — Nebraska vs. L.S.U., Texas or Arkansas. Gator—Auburn vs. Missis sippi. Bluebonnet —Alabama vs. Oklahoma. Liberty—Colorado vs. Tu lane. Peach—North Carolina vs. Arizona State. Sun—Texas Tech vs. Geor gia Tech.

1084-> They Take Time Out to Help Others
Sheila Davis recently spent three months working with children in a leper village near Katmandu, Nepal, She hated to leave but she was due back at her job. Miss Davis is a stewardess on the Dallas‐New York route of Braniff International. “Im happier with life now; I've had time to stop and think and look at my values,” said the 26‐year‐old graduate of the University of Nevada who has been flying for four years. Miss Davis, who held daily preschool classes, supervised cleanliness (“We bathed 30 children a day”) and did other “very basic work,” re arranged the Pucci scarf on her pink Pucci uniform and prepared to rush out to the airport. “It's hard .to believe that in three months one can be come so immersed, but it was just beautiful,” she said. “I'm going back in April on my vacation and work there for a few weeks on my own. It gave me a new awareness of life in so many ways.” Miss Davis is one of more than 170 stewardesses from 26 domestic and foreign air lines who have taken a mini mum of three months’ leave of absence without pay to work in educational and health projects in Southeast Asia. Their living costs are sup ported by the Thomas A. Dooley Foundation, estab lished in the name of the late doctor who dedicated his life to medical work in that area of the world. The steward esses, either singly or in groups of two or three, work with foundation personnel stationed in the countries. Most Unselfish Thing’ “I think it's the most un selfish thing I've ever seen girls do,” said Samuel F. Pry or, one of the program found ers who recently retired as vice president and assistant to the president of Pan Amer ican. “There isn't a business that couldn't share along these lines,” he said. “This is the answer to the war against disease and poverty and it helps bring a little happiness.” The volunteers, known as the “Dooley Girls,” will be honored tonight at a dinner dance being given by the foundation at the Americana Hotel. Their award will be accepted by Christrose von Schoening, a German‐born stewardess with Eastern Air Lines who is now in the proc ess of becoming .an American citizen. Her two tours with the program took her to Ne pal and, more recently, to Khong Island in the Mekong River of Laos. Originally, I was curious to see that part of the world and learn, in some way, to understand these people,” Miss von Schoening said, ex plaining why she had signed on as a volunteer. “Now, especially after Laos, I feel that I have accomplished something. I came back as a more complete person.” Miss von Schoening, who studied plant breeding and agriculture at the University of Giessen, north of Frank furt, and worked as a baby sitter and governess after her arrival in the United States in 1963, recalled her sojourn in the village of 900 people near the Cambodian border. “We had a problem get ting fresh vegetables so started a garden and trained two boys to care for it,” she said. “I bought seeds in Bangkok and we planted corn, cucumbers and to matoes and some flowers and trees. They grew very well.” She also taught English (“How do you explain ‘plugs’ when they have no electricity, ‘gas’ when they don't have it and ‘overcoats’ when they don't wear them?”) and, to gether with a Canadian stew ardess from Eastern and an Italian stewardess with Air Canada, did some painting. “Wp redecorated our class room,’ she said. “We mixed our own paint and did one side in pink and the other in yellow. I don't think they had ever seen that color combination before but they, liked it Miss von Sohoening recalled that when she first arrived “people were curious to see someone white.” “They would stare and would think maybe my slip was showing and then the children would laugh and you learn to laugh along. I never laughed as much in my whole life as I did there. The Lao people have a great sense of humor.” ‘Adopted’ by Family Midway through her stay, she was “adopted” by a Lao family and would occasionally spend an evening with them “singing and eating the'best they had—raw fish, rice, veg etables and coconut milk. Language was rarely a prob lem. Some of the stewardesses spoke French, the second lan guage in Laos, and all of them learned .enough Lao to carry on conversations. “It's a tonal language,” said Tanis Janes, a 27‐ year ‐ old Pan American stewardess who flies the Pacific route. Miss Janes returned in October after three months in Chem? passak, Laos. Miss Janes, who learned the language quickly‐ (“It was a shock when they un derstood me!”) smiled in recollection. “One word can mean many different things,” she said. “You had to be careful about the tone you used or you would find yourself saying, ‘How is your horse?’ when you wanted to say, ‘How is your Mother?’’ Taught English Miss Janes taught English to adults, including the gov ernor and officials of the province and a member of the royal family, and worked on a boat that served both as a health center and show boat in its visits to small villages. “I built a puppet stage and wrote skits for puppets I had bought in San Fran cisco,” she said. “We gave out kits of toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs and toys and the puppets would ex plain what to do with them.” Miss Janes plans to return to Laos during her February, vacation. “It was a lovely way of life and a lovely experience,” she said. “You come back with feelings that are deep and hard to articulate. You don't want to spoil it with words that have no meaning for other people. “We were full of peace and contentment.” One change she has noted in herself since her return is a decline in her former “be low‐normal interest in fash ion” to “no interest at all . . . except to fight the midi.” “If you are happy with yourself, you don't need these external things,” she con tinued. “Here I'm completely over whelmed by the opulence .. I'd been aware of it before but not of the waste. There you guard every grain of rice . . . on the plane people eat half their dinner. It's a way of life here. What can you do?”

1087-> WHEAT FUTURES DECLINE IN PRICE
With soybeans and wheat leading the downtrend, futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade were generally lower yesterday in mixed trading. Some rye futures contracts were a fraction of a point higher, but oats and corn futures were lower. Soybean oil, meal, iced broilers and choice steer futures gained some ground. The selling of soybean futures early in the session appeared to be a carryover from the activity on Tuesday when prices declined up to 3 cents a bushel. More profit taking was the principal reason for the selling of these futures but some in the trade felt that a short position was now practical. Prior to the sell‐off in the last two sessions, soybean futures had advanced about 17 points (hundredths of a cent bushel) and for this reason the activity yesterday was not entirely unexpected. Soybean oil and meal opened on a fairly weak tone but im proved on trade reports that the cash prices of those end products were strong. In the wheat pit, selling was of a commercial nature but some local professionals also were noted on the short side. There also was some hedging against purchases of the new crop. Generally favorable weather appeared to be the principal factor in the selling of the main commodities. At the close of trading, soy beans futures prices were off ½ to 1¾ cent a bushel; wheat off 2⅞ to 3¼ cents; corn, off 1⅛ to 1¾; oats, off ⅛ to ½ cent and rye, off ¼ to up ¾ cent. SILVER Silver futures rose on the New York Commodity Exchange after declining the day before. The September contract, the busiest, with 414 sales, rose to $1.6540 an ounce from $1.6340. The December contract, with 277 sales, increased to $1.70 from $1.6840 an ounce. The nearby July, with 130 sales, rose to $1.6280 from $1.6120 an ounce on Tuesday.

1089-> Screen: 'The Liberation of L.B. Jones':Wyler Directs a Vivid Post-Poitier Drama Bleak Picture Painted of Racial Situation
LORD BYRON JONES is the richest black man in Somerset, Tenn. He drives an air-conditioned Cadillac and has a wife, Emma, who, at 22, is young enough to be his daughter. His undertaking establishment, which offers the popular priced, Ellipsed in Christ service, and his deferential attitude toward the white community, have provided L. B. Jones with something resembling the Good (black) Life.That is, it's a good life until Emma, who lolls around her all-white bedroom all day reading Movieland, takes up with a young redneck Somerset policeman. Lord Byron Jones's subsequent suit for divorce wins him irrevocable liberation—and it marks the beginning of what looks very much like revolution.When William Wyler ("Roman Holiday." "The Collector," "Funny Girl") makes such a vivid, melodramatic rationale for the collapse of race relations that the movie comes close to celebrating it, You had better believe that something is happening in this land. Political polarization has, at last, become the kind of reality in which Hollywood can invest several million dollars as a source for popular entertainment.Wyler's "The Liberation of L. B. Jones," which opened yesterday at the Loew's State II and Pacific East theaters, is a post-Potier, post-"In the Heat of the Night" sort of movie. Gone is the essentially cheerful, separate-but-equal, we'll-work-this-out-together camaraderie that has always looked a little too easy in Sidney Poitier movies, because Poitier, after all, is a huge movie star (and thus a man of reason). "The Liberation of L. B. Jones" seems some more valid but only becase it is more bleak.I'm sure that Wyler and his screenwriters, Stirling Silliphant (who adapted "In the Heat of the Night") and Jesse Ford Hill, were out to make a suspense movie that would also work as contemporary social commentary. In the interests of melodrama, they have simplified the characters from Hill's novel to such a degree that they seem more stereotyped than may have been absolutely necessary—a problem that is aggravated by some of the casting.Lee J. Cobb is ponderously predictable in what should be the film's most complex character, the Southern white lawyer of compromised sensibility who, without letting himself be aware of it, is responsible for the manner of L. B. Jones's eventual liberation. The juvenile leads, Lee Majors and Barbara Hershey, who could be the prototypes of all young studio contract players, are the film's mouth-pieces for moderation and liberalism, and they are so bland that those causes are doomed from the movie's start.The film, however, is not without interesting performances. Anthony Zerbe, a young man who parts his long hair in the middle and looks as if he drank too much beer, is excellent as the dull-witted redneck; Roscoe Lee Browne is properly prissy as the unfortunate L. B. Jones, and Lola Falana, who acts like an all-black Jean Harlow, is an admirable, not entirely conventional slut. More or less supervising them all is the impacable presence of Yaphet Kotto, who plays a young black man whose final act of violence seems to sanctify all violence. Wyler concludes this latter scene, in which Kotto pushes a farmer into his own baler with a long, impassive closeup of Kotto as he watches the man being transformed into fodder. It may be one of the coldest moments ever put on film.Mostly, in fact, Wyler's direction is notable only for the coldness and for an impatience to get on with the story at the expense of any feeling of real involvment. With "The Liberation of L. B. Jones," Wyler, who is 68 this year, seems to be trying to keep up with the times. (On a technical level, he now uses the zoom lens instead of his old deep-focus technique.) I must say I wasn't bored by it, just depressed.

1091-> Photo Show at Modern Surveys 20's
The art of photography, which most of us tend to take for granted as a work aday medium of visual in formation, has, like other branches of the fine arts, an esthetid as well as a techni cal and social history. In the annals of this esthetic his tory, the 1920's constituted a crucial decade. This was a period In which some of the greatest expo nents of the medium were clarifying and refining the purity of the photographic image, bringing to the photo graphic print a new standard of pictorial precision. At the same time, the 20's witnessed some of the most radical ex periments ever undertaken in the photographic medium. On the one hand, “old masters” such as Alfred Stieglitz, Ed ward Steichen and Paul Strand were carrying tradi tional photography to new levels of artistic achievement, and on the other, an avant garde consistinc, of Laszlo Moholy‐Nagy, Man Ray, Paul Outerbridge and others were effecting a wide range of ar tistic audacities. The achievements of the 20's are the subject of a bril liant and beguiling exhibition —“Photo Eye of the 20's”— which opens today at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street. Organized by Beaumont Newhall, di rector of the George East man Howe in Rochester, the show consists of more than 150 photographs from mu seum and private collections. Many great and familiar names are represented—fig ures such as Edward West on, Eugene Atget, Walker Evans, Andre Kertesz and Charles Sheeler—as well as photographers whose work is known only to specialists. • The result is a survey that rivals, both in audacity of conception and in the beauty of execution, the great visual achievements of painting and sculpture in this period. The sheer breadth of expression is dazzling. Here is Edward Steichen's romantic evoca tion of “Isadora Duncan at the Parthenon” (1921), Ed ward Weston's poetic and erotic “Pepper No. 30” (1930), Tina Modotti's rigorously cu bist “Staircase” together with the same artist's pow erfully realistic “Worker's Hands” (both works circa 1923–26), and Paul Outer bridge's essays in pure geo metric design. There are some marvelous surprises, too. Perhaps the most outstanding are the photographs of the Russian constructivist sculptor Alex ander Rodchenko (1891–1956), whose photographic work is very little known. These photographs are highly charged with feeling. The portrait of the poet Mayakov sky is one of the most power ful photographic portraits know, and the image that is realized in “Assembling for a Demonstration” (1928) is a scene of great social drama. Yet to each of his subjects Rodchenko brought the rigor and precision of a first‐class pictorial intelligence. His work is indeed a revelation, both of the resources of pho tographic art and of the Rus sian milieu that formed his matter. Less surprising but no less amazing are the photographs of Moholy‐Nagy, who virtual ly converted the medium into several new forms of expres sion, drawing upon the whole range of cubist, construct ivist and expressionist inno vations for his photographic experiments. But Moholy was certainly not alone in regard ing photography as a medium in which purely abstract or semi‐abstract images could be realized with real distinction. Indeed, there are a number of important photographic prints in this exhibition that remind us of the extent to which the history of abstract art remains woefully incom plete without an account of this relatively unfamiliar ac complishment. From the most romantic realism, with its effects of atmosphere and chiaroscuro, to the purest two‐dimensional abstraction, the photographic achievements of the 20's set a high standard. In many ways, this was the period in which many of the central themes and procedures of serious photography were defined. Looking at pictures of this quality and complex ity, one has the sense of a great many gifted artists of very different esthetic per suasions working in the mainstream of cultural en deavor, and working with complete confidence in the esthetic efficacy of their en terprise. It simply isn't pos sible to turn away from this survey with the facile notion that photography was—or is —one of the minor or lesser arts. There is genius enough here to equal the competi tion of any medium. • “Photo Eye of the 20's” remains on view at the Museum of Modern Art through Sept. 8, and will later be shown at the George Eastman House before tour ing the country. During its showing at the Museum of Modern Art, the exhibition will be accompanied by a showing of 43 films from the 20's selected from the film archives of both the museum and the George Eastman House.

1093-> Market Place:
If you have a feeling that business is keeping secrets in this bear market, you'll be interested to know that busi ness doesn't think as you do. An extended survey of 112 companies—many in the bil lion‐dollar class and half of them in the Fortune maga zine 500—shows that 70 per cent are maintaining the same level of push in finan cial public relations as at the height of the bull market two years ago. The survey by Hill & Knowlton, Inc., a financial public relations concern, was of nonclients—as of the date of the survey, anyway. The company presidents and top financial officers polled said, by and large, that they believed it was just as important to attempt to keep Wall Street and share holders informed even though stock prices have been slid ing. Indeed, 20 per cent of the companies answering the poll have increased the scope of their financial public re lations. • Does this mean that the companies arc trying to con the stockholder, making him believe things are better than they are? As you might ex pect, no official polled said that. They stressed that the principle of adequate disclo sure should apply in both ris ing and declining markets. One official—Hill & Knowl ton promised anonymity commented: “Basically, the market should not affect one's activity; however, visibility is more desirable in a declining market—in a speculative en vironment, public relations often is disregarded or used to start rumors.” If a company does not con tinue its public relations in a declining market, the com pany loses “credibility.” Con sistency develops confidence and “eliminates the risk of appearing to bull the stock.” Another official said that good financial public rela tions was even more impor tant in a declining market. “Analysts and investors gen erally start getting nervous and need frequent reassur ance. One must report the bad as well as the good and usually things are better than the outside world imagines anyway.” One official commented: “J would tend to he skeptical of a company [as an investment] which promoted its stock during rising markets, or when earnings were expand ing sharply; but was unavail able when either were re versed.” Summing up sentiment rather well, another official said: “Financial public relations should be undertaken for long‐term or institutional goals and not to ride an up or down cycle in market in terest. More important than the current price of a com pany's stock is its enduring image as a financially re sponsible corporation. “Too much of what has been called financial public relations in the past few years has been a form of hustling calculated to fatten up stock prices but lacking in the depth and thoughtful ness needed to do the com panies involved any substan tial good.” • Meanwhile, Hill & Knowl ton polled 57 security ana lysts who said that company presidents generally made themselves available for ques tions. Several made pleas for more information. For ex ample: “Companies should be con vinced that it is in their own interest to disclose sources of revenues and earnings by product line and to discuss progress or problems in each product line fully.” And again: “There is a greater need for current information on order backlogs, new orders, inventories, final sales, divi sional costs in order thatmar gins can be better monitored.” Still another analyst corn mented: “The objective should be adequacy, investors aren't panic stricken about price de clines. They view them as opportunities to buy at a bar gain level if the long term outlook is good!”

WASHINGTON, July 10—The tax‐exempt status of private schools that continue to practice racial discrimination in admissions will be revoked under a new policy announced today by the Internal Revenue Service. The policy will be applied nationwide, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Randolph W. Thrower, said. Its greatest impact, however, is expected to be felt by the racially segregated private academies that have been established in many Southern states in recent years as the public schools have been ordered integrated. Such schools are heavily dependent on contributions, which have heretofore been regarded as tax‐exempt. The loss of exemption would apply to any income or property of the schools, but the major effect would.be the loss of deductibility for contributions. Tax‐exempt status permits contributors to deduct their contributions from their taxable income in their returns. Cleared by President The policy statement brought an end to more than a year Of debate within the Nixon Administration over the issue of tax exemption for segregated private schools. The debate produced a deep split within the White House staff as well As among different Government agencies. The White House press secretary, Ronald L. Ziegler, said that President Nixon had seen and cleared the Internal Revenue announcement. Schools that practice racial discrimination will be given “a reasonable opportunity” to change those practices before having their exempt status revoked, the Internal Revenue announcement said. Answer to Be Required Commissioner Thrower said at a news conference that the opportunity would extend over “the next few months” but then added that he did not think the cutoff point would be so early as next September. All tax ‐exempt private schools will be required to answer a written inquiry from the Revenue Service and explain their admissions policies so far as race is concerned. The Revenue Service said it “anticipated that, in most instances, evidence of a nondiscriminatory policy can be supplied by reference to published statements of policy or to the racial constituency of the student body.” Question of Manpower Mr. Thrower refused to give specific answers to questions concerning how the service would verify statements by schools that they were not racially discriminating. He said that he could not state when the verification process would start because “we have quite a large undertaking of processing the initial determinations” of whether schools are still entitled to their tax exemptions. Any school's assertion that it is following a nondiscriminatory policy will be initially accepted by the Revenue Service “subject to verification through the usual process,” Mr. Thrower said. He would not indicate how much manpower the service would commit to the task of verifying claims of nondiscriminatory policies. However, another Administration official said that the commitment would be “major.” Mr. Thrower did note that it was standard Internal Revenue practice to follow up on complaints from citizens, thereby indicating that revenue agents would probably act fairly swiftly to verify the practices of a school where there had been a complaint that it was discriminating. Mr. Thrower also declined specific comment on how the Revenue Service would handle situations of token integration, where a very small number of black students might be admitted to a generally segregated school; what it would do about segregated classrooms within an integrated school, or about admissions policies that, in fact, kept black students out, though for reasons that were not essentially racial. He said that any policies covering such matters would “have to be developed from experience in the field” and that, in general, he expected “good faith conformity” by schools with statements that they were not discriminating or would not do so. New Problems Arising “We are at the threshold of a new series of problems,” he said. “We need to learn much ourselves.” Mr. Thrower said that he thought the Internal Revenue announcement would render moot, or no longer at issue, some cases that are pending in the courts attacking the continued tax‐exempt status of private schools in the South. In one of these cases, the Justice Department filed in May a brief supporting the continued tax‐exemption. Subsequently, Attorney General John N. Mitchell reportedly repudiated that position and joined the Treasury Department, the Revenue Service and some officials of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in pushing for the position that was adopted today. Among the chief opponents of the policy change, officials said, was Harry S. Dent, special counsel to the President. Other White House staff members, ineluding Bryce N. Harlow, a counselor to the President, and Leopard Garment, special consultant, reportedly pushed for a tougher policy. Under the new policy, any school that claims not to be discriminating but is subsequently found to be discriminating would have its exempt status revoked retroactively. Contributors who were aware of the deception would have their deductions disallowed, but those who were not aware of it would not. Mr. Thrower said that the revenue ruling would not affect parochial schools that confined their students to members of one religion, nor would it apply to other types of tax‐exempt organizations, such as fraternal clubs. 6 New Florida Suits WASHINGTON, July 10 (UPI) —The Justice Department sued six more Florida school districts today to complete action in that state against districts refusing to desegregate. The six new suits, plus the 46 districts sued yesterday, will mean that virtually all school districts in Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina and Florida will have complied with the law voluntarily or will be involved in litigation to force them to unitary systems by September, Attorney General Mitchell said. The department filed suit in Federal District Court in Jacksonville against six districts with 79 public schools attended by 36,655 white and 9,993 black students. They were Baker, Bradford, Flagler, Pasco, St Johns’ and Seminole Counties. Bomb Found in Montreal MONTREAL, July 10 (AP)—A garbage collector discovered 40‐pound dynamite bomb in lane beside a bank in the city's financial district today.

1095-> Two Men Beaten in Saigon For Raising Vietcong Flag
SAIGON, South Vietnam, July 25 — Two young Frenchmen held aloft the Vietcong flag from a war statue in down town Saigon today until it was torn down and they were driven from their perch by crowd that pelted the air with stones and then beat them. The young men, both identi fied as teachers in French‐Viet namese high schools, climbed to the top of the statue—de picting South Vietnamese ma rines in combat—which is in Lamson Square, and unfurled the flag shortly before 1 P.M. As the red and blue flag with a gold star in the center drooped from a slender bam boo pole, a crowd of Saturday afternoon strollers began to gather. The crowd grew to about 200, while more than 1,000 watched from across the streets and an adjoining park. One of the young men threw down mimeographed leaflets calling on Vietnamese for “an immediate withdrawal of the American assassins from our country.” The Vietnamese Government later identified the two young men as Jean Pierre Depris and Andre Marcel Menras. Both were understood to be in their mid‐20's. After 15 minutes, the crowd began to get angry. Several per sons began pelting the two young men with stones. The mood of the crowd took on an antiforeigner aspect when a young American tried to hold the arm of a Vietnamese man about to throw a stone. Several Vietnamese turned on the American and began to beat him. He tried to escape but was pursued and knocked down. He was kicked and pummeled until he managed to run into a near by office building. About eight Vietnamese then turned on a second American and began to beat him. He was rescued after a short time by the police and was allowed to leave after he showed he had a correspondent's accreditation. When the two Frenchmen had been on the monument for about 20 minutes a plainclothes policeman tore the flag from its staff. About 10 minutes later two other plainclothes men persuaded the pair to climb down. As the two young men were descending they were pulled down by the crowd and beaten. The police, who had been watching, then dispersed the crowd and rescued the pair, who were taken to a hospital. A Government spokesman said the pair would be charged as Vietcong for violating Arti cle 4 of the Vietnamese Consti tution. The article prohibits “all activities aimed at promot ing Communist activities or propaganda favorable to the Communists.”

1096-> Bridge:
Sometimes the defenders can make an accurate guess about the declarer's distribu tion. At other times they have no chance, as on the diagramed deal. It was played Sunday in the Mixed Pair Championship at the Fun City Regionals here, and the bidding needs some interpretation. An opening bid of one dia mond would seem automatic with South's hand, but he selected one club. This would be comprehensible if he had been playing a “canape” sys tem in which the longer suit is kept in reserve, but his choice was nonsystemic. However, the next two ac lions by North‐South were based on partnership under standings that were explained to the opponents. The redou ble did not necessarily show high‐card strength—a subse quent raise in clubs, which was made on the next round. would show a redouble based on distributional support. This redouble was no doubt a surprise to East, for few players have the felicity to hold 11 high‐card points when partner's take‐out double has been redoubled. Instead of one heart, East would have been wiser to by one spade, with the intention of jumping to four hearts at the next opportunity. The cue‐bid of two hearts was explained as a heart void, not necessarily showing extra strength, and from that point both sides bid vigor ously, perhaps too vigorously. When North‐South reached five clubs it was certainly hard for East to know that his best action was to pass. He might have considered doubling instead of bidding five hearts, and would have been hurt to discover that five clubs could not be defeated. East‐West could have been in trouble in five hearts, and at other tables some pairs in this contract were doubled and set 500 points. But South came to his opponents' rescue with a bid of six clubs: He felt that the vulnerability was in his favor for a sacri fice, a slight misjudgment. West naturally doubled, for he had no wish to hear his partner bid any more hearts, and led the diamond ace. The declarer was Frank Schuld of Glen Head, L. I., and he ruffed the opening lead in dummy and led a spade. When East put up the spade ace and unwisely returned a heart, South happily ruffed, cashed his spade winners and crossruffed the remaining tricks to make the doubled slam. A lively post‐mortem fol lowed. “I'd have beaten it if I'd led a trump,” stated West. “But you should surely have led a trump when you took the spade ace,” he told his partner. “They'd have been a trick short.” “I'm sorry,” said East. “But I could not tell his distribu tion from the bidding. Could I?” Meanwhile, Diane Schuld, the dummy, had been inspect ing her husband's hand. “You opened one club with that” she demanded incredu lously. “Well, what would you bid with 3‐3‐3‐4 distribution?” retorted Frank Schuld. It was only on the second round I found both my red suits were diamonds,” he added sheep ishly.

1097-> BROKER FAVORS RISE IN CHARGES
WASHINGTON, July 24— Charles H. Brunie, a partner in Oppenheimer & Co., said to day that the future of the entire capitalistic system in this country could be threat ened if the sales commissions charged by brokers were not increased by an adequate amount. Mr. Brunie stated at a hear ing before a Securities and Exchange Commission ex aminer that the total increase in sales charges should come closer to $900‐million than to the $550‐million that the New York Stock Exchange has asked. The S.E.C.'s objective in establishing a new schedule of sales commissions should be “to create a viable securities industry,” he added. “I'm afraid a viable securi ties industry is much more im portant to me than the reason ableness of the rate,” Mr. Brunie continued. The Oppenheimer partner asserted that the S.E.C. would be “taking a terrible chance” if it set the sales commissions too low on the mistaken as sumption that the volume of stock trading—and, with it, the profits of the brokerage indus try—was about to rise. “You're taking a grave chance with the capitalistic system,” he said. “I don't see that it's worth it.” On the other hand, Mr. Brunie said, if the S.E.C. does grant a, large increase in sales com missions “and if that turns out to be a get‐rich‐quick scheme, then you can change it [the new schedule of commissions] very rapidly.” He urged the S.E.C. not to try “to win a battle against the stock exchange at the ex pense of the system.” Mr. Brunie expressed par ticular concern about the “tal ent that is leaving the indus try” during the current period of low or nonexistent profits. The American Stock Ex change, meanwhile, formally requested the commission to continue in effect the special surcharge of $15 or a maxi mum of half the normal com mission on securities transac tions involving 1,000 shares or Less, whichever is less. In a letter to the chairman Df the commission, James W. Walker Jr., senior vice president of the Amex, said that a new survey of the costs and earnings of its 12 highest‐vol ume members showed that nine had losses in the first five months of this year and that two others would have had, but for the surcharge. Eight of the firms were re ported to have said that they would be forced to abandon their retail business with the public if the present rates of loss continued for another 12 months.

1098-> NEW SOVIET ENVOY LIKELY FOR CHINA
MOSCOW, July 2 — Diplo matic sources said today that Communist China had agreed to accept a new Soviet Am bassador in Peking. Soviet and Western sources said the Ambassador would be Vladimir I. Stepakov, a 58‐year‐old Communist party ideologist. The reports of his acceptance could not be confirmed with Chinese officials here. Western diplomats said Chi nese acceptance of a Soviet Ambassador would indicate that Peking and Moscow had agreed, implicitly at least, to stabilize their relations. Some Western diplomats said the relations now appeared bet ter than at any time since last October, when the Chinese and the Russians began to discuss I their border disputes in Peking. The two countries have not had Ambassadors in each oth er's capitals since 1966, when Moscow withdrew Sergei G. Lapin and the Chinese recalled Pan Tzu‐li. Mr. Stepakov, who was chief of the party's propaganda sec tion until several months ago, would presumably replace the First Deputy Foreign Minister, Vasily V. Kuznetsov, at the ne gotiations in Peking on the bor der disputes. Mr. Kuznetsov reportedly re turned to Moscow three days ago for treatment of a serious disorder of the urinary tract Diplomats here said there had been no agreement that a Chi nese Ambassador would be sent to Moscow, although such a development was expected. Nor was it clear when Mr. Stepakov might go to Peking. They said that while there had been no confirmation of the acceptance by Chinese officials here or in Peking, the Russians apparently received at least verbal commitment “at a sig nificant level” from Peking. The diplomats noted that last year Soviet sources had spread word before the Chinese did that there would be talks on the border disputes. They also noted that Soviet sources first said last April that Mr. Step akov had been nominated for the ambassadorial post. The diplomats said that by telling of Mr. Stepakov's ac ceptance, the Soviet apparently was seeking “to get the Chi nese on the record very quickly.” Since 1966, the two countries have maintained formal diplo matic relations, but have re peatedly and vehemently at tacked each other on ideological matters. In March, 1969, Soviet and Chinese troops fired on each other and armed clashes followed during the summer along their border, which is 4,500 miles long. The Western diplomats cited several signs of improvement in Chinese‐Soviet relations. They noted that while Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin said in speech on June 10 that no progress had been made at the Peking talks, the hostile propa ganda exchanges between the two countries had subsided in recent weeks. The last major Soviet polem ic against China came in an editorial in Pravda, the party newspaper, on May 18. The last significant anti‐Soviet at tack from Peking came a month later, the diplomats said. Since then, they added, the Chinese have directed much of their propaganda against the United States. In addition, the diplomats pointed out, Peking postponed indefinitely a meet ing scheduled for June 20 in Warsaw between Chinese and American liaison officers.

1099-> China Frees U.S. Bishop
HONG KONG, July 10—The Most Rev. James Edward Walsh, a 79‐year‐old Roman Catholic bishop from Maryland, arrived in Hong Kong today after 12 years of imprisonment in Communist China. Simultaneously the Chinese Communists announced from Shanghai that Hugh F. Redmond Jr., 50, a Yonkers, N. Y., businessman serving a life sentence in a prison there on espionage charges, committed suicide last April 13 by slashing himself with a razor blade. Bishop Walsh, unshaven and dressed in faded khaki trousers, crossed a river bridge from Communist China into Hong Kong at 3 P.M. today. Reporting to Hong Kong authorities at the border station of Lowu, he said, “I have been in China a very long time and I am glad to be out.” In announcing his imprisonment in 1958, the Chinese Communists alleged that he had “organized and directed imperialist spies and counter‐revolutionaries hidden in the Catholic church of China in carrying out subversive criminal activities in a systematic way.” The Rev. John Sullivan, a priest who serves in Hong Kong, said Bishop Walsh told him today that he did not know why he was released at this time. Father Sullivan reported that the bishop said his 12 years of imprisonment had all been in a room of the hospital section of his jail and that he had not been badly treated. No advance notice had beer received here of Bishop Walsh's arrival. The Hong Kong authorities quickly notified the United States consulate general. Rich and Nethercut, consulate political officer, flew by helicopter to meet him. The bishop was brought by ambulance to the Roman Catholic Maryknoll hospital in Kowloon for a physical examinetion, recuperative treatment and a rest. At his request, no newsmen were permitted to sec him, but he said that he would talk to newsmen when he fell better. A member of the Maryknoll order, Bishop Walsh talked at the hospital with Father Sullivan, who is regional superior of the Maryknoll order here, and others. Father Sullivan said that Bishop Walsh was mentally alert, in good spirits and had been pronounced in reasonably good health by doctors. Notified on Wednesday Father Sullivan reported that Bishop Walsh had said that news he was to be released from his detention quarters in the hospital of the Ward Road jail in Shanghai had been conveyed to him suddenly at 8 A.M. Wednesday morning. “He was told to pack his bags,” Father Sullivan stated, “and a doctor came to check his physical condition. By 10 A.M. he was aboard a train bound for Canton accompanied by a doctor, two interpreters, a photographer and two or three policemen.” Father Sullivan said that Bishop Walsh repeated he had been treated with great consideration on the trip to Canton and that the doctor took his pulse every hour. The train was air‐conditioned. After spending the night in Canton, Bishop Walsh and his guardians proceeded to Hong Kong, arriving at the border at 2 P.M. Bishop Walsh had always had an English‐speaking Chinese prisoner — two different men over the span of his incarceration—in his room with him, Father Sullivan reported. Father Sullivan said the bishop was not asked and had said nothing about claims in Chinese announcement from Peking of his release that he had “confessed his crimes.” Greetings From Pope Through the Papal Nuncio for China, whose headquarters are in Taipei, Pope Paul VI tonight sent a message of greetings and best wishes to Bishop Walsh. Four other non‐Communist Americans are known to be still in prison in Communist China, together with a small but unknown number of Communists or Communist sympathizers who are American‐born but now have uncertain American citizenship status. Aside from the fact that Bishop Walsh was old and had been ill from time to time, and his captors may not have wished him to die in prison, his release at this time is in keeping with a Peking policy of releasing certain foreign prisoners. The police was begun last fall with the freeing of Anthony Grey, a Reuters correspondent. Since then a number of Europeans and Japanese have been freed. Hsinhua, the Chinese press agency, announced Bishop Walsh's release and Mr. Redmond's suicide in a single dispatch received here from Shanghai. Redmond Termed a Spy The announcement described Mr. Redmond as a “United States imperialist spy” who had been dispatched to China by the Office of Strategic Services — predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency — and said he had “carried out espionage sabotage in Shanghai, Peking and Shenyang and thus committed grave crimes.” Hsinhua reported that Mr. Redmond had used a United States made razor blade “to cut the artery of the medial aspect of his left elbow and he arteries of his wrists and mortally wounded himself.” The announcement said Mr. Redmond “was immediately sent to a hospital for emergency treatment, but ming to excessive loss of blood he died the same evening.” The agency stated the body had been cremated and hat the Red Cross Society of China “has already informed he culprit Redmond's relatives of his death through the American Red Cross.” There was no indication why no public report of the death was made until three months after it had occurred. Born in Maryland Bishop Walsh was born in Cumberland, Md. He attended St. Patrick's School in Cumberland and graduated from St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md., before preparing for the missionary priesthood at a Maryknoll seminary. He came to China in 1918 as a member of the first Maryknoll mission band from the United States to go there and from that time on was on duty in either China or Hong Kong. He became a bishop in 1927, and in 1948 he became the executive secretary of the Central Catholic Bureau of Religious Organization in Shanghai and as such was coordinator of all missionary, cultural, welfare and educational activities of the Roman Catholic Church in China. Bishop Walsh held this position when the Communists took over Shanghai in 1949 and immediately began to be subjected to harassment. The Bishop was not formally sentenced until 1960, but his 20‐year term began retroactively from the time of his arrest in 1958. Redmond Lawyer Skeptical YONKERS, July 10 (UPI) —The American lawyer for Hugh Redmond today called the release of Bishop Walsh a “coverup for the classic example of man's inhumanity to man,” referring to the reported suicide death of Mr. Redmond. Sol Friedman, who has represented the Redmond family's plea for his release, said this morning, “I don't buy it. I just don't believe that story.” Mr. Friedman added: “Just about three months ago, at the time Redmond supposedly committed suicide, the International Red Cross notified us that he was all right Why would a man who had stood up to 20 years in jail kill himself? And couldn't it be more than a coincidence that a 79‐year‐old priest, is suddenly released?” Mr. Friedman said that Mr. Redmond's mother, Mrs. Ruth Redmond, has been hospitalized for about three months at the Hudson View Nursing Home in Yonkers after suffering her third stroke. She is 72.

1100-> FOES OF BIENNALE OPEN SHOW HERE
After a series of tribulations that included several postpone ments and what might be called an artnapping, the promised show of prints withdrawn by United States artists from the Venice Biennale has finally opened at Museum, second‐floor exhibition loft at 729 Broadway. The abortive show was orig inally conceived as a kind of anti‐Biennale, to protest govern ment involvement in “war, rac ism, sexism and repression.” But in a change prompted part ly by pressure from black art ists, it was declared open to all exhibitors by its sponsors, the Emergency Cultural Govern ment Committee, a subdivision of the New York Art Strike. The resulting potpourri, its professionalism hopelessly di luted by a plethora of propa ganda posters, political rhetoric, slapdash invective and some raw amateur work, is one of the most unrewarding art ex hibitions of this—or any—sea son. Its interest lies not in its contents, but in its history. The original intention of the Emergency Cultural Govern ment Committee, steered by the artists Irving Petlin, Frank Stel la and Robert Morris and the critic Max Kozloff, was to show the withdrawn work at the Jewish Museum. But negotia tions broke down, and the show was rescheduled for a July 6 opening at the School of Visual Arts, whose students and facul ty had been active in the Art Strike. Meanwhile, the committee, concerned over the lack of black and other “third world” representation in the show, had voted to open it to all corners (the two black artists repre sented in the United States Pa vilion at the actual Biennale had refused to withdraw). Then an organization known as Women, Students and Artists for Black Art Liberation repre sented by two artists, Tom Lloyd and Faith Ringgold, threatened to picket the show at Visual Arts. They demanded that the show's representation comprise these overlapping categories: 50 per cent black, 50 per cent] I women and 25 per cent stu dents. They also charged the School of Visual Arts with “rac ist” policies, a contention vehe mently denied by the school's director, Sites Rhodes. In rebut tal, he points to a faculty repre sentation of over 20 blacks, an Afro ‐ Arts study program and the fact that the school's nearly 100 black students (out of a student body of 1,800) hold 17 per cent of the scholarships. In sympathy with demands of the black liberation group, how ever, a faction of the Art Strike group voted to remove the show to Museum. But a dissenting faction felt that before the show opened, the original 26 partici pants who were to have shown these works they withdrew from the Biennale should be no tified of the changes in it. They also insisted that the Museum exhibition include the work of other “third world” invitees. When these suggestions were vetoed by the other faction, led by Mr. Morris and Poppy John son, co‐chairman of the Art Strike, a group of the dissent ers decided to “kidnap” the show. They removed the prints from their storage place and be gan to return them to dealers, meanwhile notifying artists con cerned of the show's changes. A number of the artists no tified decided—intelligently—to withdraw, among them Claes Oldenburg, Richard Anuszkie wicz, Ernest Trova, Nicholas Khrushenick and Adja Yunkers. After a week of agitation by Mr. Morris and his supporters, however, the kidnappers re leased the prints they still held on condition that the exhibi tors notify the rest of the artists concerned of the show's changes. The catchall exhibition that opened at the Museum this week completely vitiates the sponsors' original intentions. Though it does include work by the remaining Biennale nay sayers — Andy Warhol, Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Vincent Lon go, Leonard Baskin, Robert Bir melin, Jim Dine, Sam Francis, Michael Mazur, Deen Meeker and Mr. Morris— most of it can't help looking listless in this lackluster company. While the other entries in clude a few of genuine interest —a very adept nude drawing by Ann Tankesley, a foursome of minilandscapes by one M. Portnon, and an amusing erotic dissertation by Poppy Johnson, “On the Phenomenology of Thunderstorms,” the show is scarcely worth the trip to the Village. Except, of course, for those skeptics who'd like con firmation of their worst fears about the mixing of art and politics.

1101-> A STATEWIDE ISSUE
TALLAHASSEE, Fla.—Beaches are for the people. Or are they? The Florida State Cabinet has de cided to ask the courts to determine to what degree the public is entitled to use the state's oceanfront. Of the 1,000 or more miles of beach in Florida many miles are closed to the public. Don Paul, a Miami law yer, recently urked the Cabinet to ask for a declaratory judgment defining unequivocally where the public's rights begin on the increasingly commercialized beach frontage, such as in Miami Beach. The situation there was described as one of the worst in the state. Some Miami Beach hotels, Paul said, are flagrant violators of the public's right to use the beach foreshore, which is owned by the state. “The Fountainbleau and Eden Roc Hotels are vio lators, and the Deauville is the biggest violator,” Paul said. He maintains that the foundations of the hotels extend out so far that at high tide a beachcomber would have to wade in deep water to get around them. State Controller Fred Dickinson, who presided the Cabinet meeting, said that the crux of the issue was the definition of mean high‐water mark. It generally is considered to be the average high‐water mark; thus, the land to seaward is state owned and property land ward can be privately owned. But there have been various determinations in Florida. Paul argued that the standard was vague and was applied varyingly across the state. It was also asserted that other states were far ahead of Florida in preserving beach frontage. Oregon has set at the line of vegetation the demarcation between what is public and what can be privately owned. The Cabinet asked Attorney General Earl Faircloth to prepare a petition for a declaratory decree. Not all Florida resorts have the same problem as Miami Beach. At Daytona Beach, automobiles are per mitted on the beach, and it has become, in effect, a public highway. At Fort Lauderdale, buildings are restricted to the west side of State Route AlA, leaving the entire beach for public use. Conditions vary accord ing to the resort, but riparian rights are not guaranteed to landowners in many oceanside areas.—C.E.W.

1102-> Saigon Is Investigating ‘Tiger Cage’ Cells at a Prison
SAIGON, South Vietnam, July 10 (Reuters) — The South Vietnamese Government promised today to abolish the ‘'tiger cage” punishment cells in Con Son Prison if an investigation confirmed the criticism of two United States Representatives and press reports of the mistreatment of prisoners. Representatives Augustus F. Hawkins, Democrat of California. and Representative William R. Anderson, Democrat of Tennessee, toured the prison last week. Last Monday they described conditions in the prison's punishment block as atrocious. Today a South Vietnamese Government spokesman said 10‐man team from the Interior Ministry had flown to Con Son. an island 60 miles off the South Vietnamese coast. The Government has already confirmed that the small. crowded “tiger cage” cells exist and that they contain about 400 prisoners who refuse to obey the prison authorities. At issue is the treatment and health of the prisoners, whether they get enough food and water, take exercise periods outside their cells, are shackled, beaten or otherwise mistreated. The Government yesterday defended the use of the cells to force prisoners it considers hardened Communists to reform and cooperate. The “tiger cages” — 3 feet by 9 feet, according to Don Luce, a writer, who accompanied the two Represen tatives last week, and about 10 by 15 feet, according to United States officials — are reserved for special cases. A South Vietnamese spokesman said yesterday that these might include prisoners who refused to salute the national flag. Three or more prisoners occupy each cell, and the Representatives said in Washington that many had lost the use of their legs. But the South Vietnamese Government said yesterday that no prisoners had been paralyzed and that they received exercise periods and the same food and medical attention as other prisoners on the island. 3 Students Describe Prison SAIGON, July 10 (AP)— Three Saigon University students recently released from Con Son Prison accused the South Vietnamese Government today of “not telling the truth” about conditions there. At a news conference called to reply to Government statements about Con Son, the three students said that they had been held in the “tiger cages.” They charged that more than 11,200 prisoners were kept in the cages, three times the number given by Government officials. Speaking for the students in their news conference was Cao Nguyen Loi, who said he had spent 13 months in the “tiger cages” after he was arrested in July 1968 for having taken part in a peace demonstration.

1103-> Police Wade to Islet And Raid Drug Party
CROTON, N.Y., Aug. 16 —A band of New York State troopers waded into the shal low waters of the New Cro ton Reservoir last night to ar rest 57 young persons on as sorted drug charges as the youths were gathered around campfire on a small pine‐wood ed island under a full moon. The raiders, 12 uniformed troopers and 14 men assigned to the State Bureau of Criminal Investigation, were led by Maj. C. Richard Sampson of Troop K Hawthorne Barracks. They had a rowboat but the shallow ness of the water—only about a foot deep—allowed them to wade out to the island, about 20 yards offshore. There they arrested the 57 young persons, described by a police spokesman as “docile,” some playing their guitars as they were escorted off the is land. The group included an 11‐year‐old girl her sister 15 and five other juveniles who were taken home and released in their parents custody. “We completely surprised them,” said John R. Tengstrom a State Police investigator. —They were sitting around fire on bedrolls on the high side of the island. The moon was full, so we didn't have to use lights.” The state police had been watching the island for several weekends. The island is about 25 yards off the shore on which the party participants had parked their cars. Most of those arrested in the 11:45 P.M. raid the police said ranged in age from 18 to 27 and were residents of West chester County. Eight persons were charged with the posses sion of drugs such as LSD hashish, amphetamines and ma rijuana of which quantities were seized by the police. The 49 others, including the sev en juveniles, were charged with loitering for the purpose of us ing narcotics. At their arraignment this morning, bail for the eight was ?? at $250 each and for the others, $25 apiece. A hearing was scheduled for Thursday.

1105-> 3 L.I.R. POLICEMEN CLEARED OF ASSAULT
Three Long Island Rail Road policemen who had been ac cused of beating a commuter who later died were acquitted yesterday by the unanimous vote of a three‐judge Criminal Court panel. The policemen were cnargea with the third‐degree assault of Raymond McGale of Roosevelt, L. I., last Jan. 22. During the four‐day trial, the Manhattan District Attorney's office tried to prove that the defendants beat Mr. McGale after removing him from a brawl in the bar of the Savarin restaurant in Pennsylvania Station. No defense witnesses were called. As soon as Assistant District Attorney Allen Sulli van finished presenting his case, the defense lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, asked for dismissal on the ground that the prose cutor had not proved his case beyond a reasonable doubt. Late in the afternoon, the judges—Jack Rosenberg, Shir ley Levitan and Bernard Mol dow—granted the defense re quest. The three defendants were Patrolman John Romanevicz, 24 years old, of 2 Eastgate Street, Plainview; Patrolman Wilonovsky, 23, of 99 East Shore Road, Lindenhurst, and Capt. Harry Cook. 43. of 17 Oakdale Avenue, Merrick.

1106-> U.S.C. WILL ALLOW NO‐PENALTY PROTEST
LOS ANGELES, May 10 (UPI) —The University of Southern California has approved a plan for students to drop out of classes and protest United States policies in Indochina without being penalized aca demically. The action was disclosed yes terday by the privately endowed university, which is seldom trou bled by student dissent. It has been closed since Thursday and was scheduled to reopen tomor row. The university's president, Norman Topping, said the plan was approved to “recognize the right of conscience of every member of the student body and faculty.” Students not at tending classes will be allowed to take a final grade based on completed course work, receive an incomplete and not be charged the usual extra fee to make it up, or substitute an out‐of‐class project with the agreement of the teacher to sat isfy course requirements. President Topping said, “This recommendation provides for the rights of those who believe their education goals are best achieved within the classroom and, at the same time, provides for the interests of those who believe the crisis of our times requires that they translate their concern into meaningful social action.”

1107-> Packing for a Trip?
UR timetables now read daylight saving time, and the lemming instinct of the great American tourist is rising like the sap in the flowering spring shrubbery, which makes this the appropriate time for a final word of advice to those travelers not so set in their ways that they cannot reorganize their luggage and their travel habits for their own and the general good. Having read the travel guidebooks all winter long, the anticipatory tour ist now knows how quaint, unique, rustic, sophisticated, friendly and anti American, deep souled and highly musi cal the natives are everywhere else in the world. They laugh all the time, they sing the rest of the time and they dance in whatever time is left over be cause they live in sunny Italy or sunny France or sunny Scandinavia or sunny Algeria or sunny Russia. It never rains in the travel literature, but just as sure as a tourist spends two weeks or more away from home — in his own country or plodding the by ways abroad — some day it is going to rain. But the question before us is what you can do before you leave home to insure your trip abroad against some of those horrendous fears and frights re ported so ghoulishly, and often in equal parts of fact, fiction and ignorance on the part of the victim, by travelers who did not think twice before setting forth. The most important thing to remem ber is two things: First, we are all creatures of habit, and we are happiest when we can go through the day according to our own rituals and habits — the daily, highly personalized and stylized routine each of us has for getting up in the morning, washing and shaving, brushing the teeth, combing the hair and getting dressed, and then, long hours later, reversing the process and so to bed weary of mind, eyeball and legs. Second, once you leave home, you are a stranger in a strange land (even if the journey is Only into the heart land of America) and, once you abandon hotel or motel room for the streets, you must adapt all day long to the strange customs and habits of these foreigners, who act as if they are per fectly at ease and at home in their own country. So the question is how to reduce the “simple, nervous tension” that this strangeness creates deep inside the traveler and which leads to so many misunderstandings between him and his host country and him and his hotelier — misunderstandings that can, if not checked, ruin his good time. The answer is to take with you all the portable appurtenances you can that will help you maintain “over there” the private rituals with which you start and end the day at home. This is so elemental that it sounds simple‐minded at first, but just reverse the theorem: why should you suddenly abandon all your little creature com forts and habits for three weeks? At least in the privacy of your hotel room you can do things your way, not theirs. How often are you awaken ed at home by the rough ring of a telephone and a strange, over‐cheerful, clarion‐type voice announcing the crack of dawn? At home, I am roused at a more reasonable hour by the dulcet ring of a small, soft ‐ spoken travel alarm clock; abroad, that same sweet ring rouses me because I never leave home without my alarm clock, and thus always start the day just as if I were back in my habit‐ridden home. Are you addicted to a long handled shoehorn? Then why leave it home and grunt, doubled‐over, over a tiny shoehorn or a hotel envelope every morning for three weeks or more? Dis regard the guiders who insist that you travel weightless and thus comfortless. Put the giant shoehorn in your suitcase; it is a bit of pampering that will be worth the extra couple of ounces of weight. Unpack the minute you hit your hotel room, whether it is for only overnight or for several days. There is nothing worse than living out of suitcase, and the only way to erase the impersonality of a hotel room and make it temporarily your room is to set your alarm clock on the night table beside your books and/or other reading matter, scatter your toi let articles around the bathroom, toss a bathrobe across the foot of the bed and spread your personality around quick. The male traveler addicted to electric razors should be sure, before he leaves home, that his razor and transformer really work. I burned out a couple of razors and as many fancy transformers, and bled endlessly from a badly administered portable safety razor, until I latched on to a razor whose built‐in transformer can cope with anything from 100 to 250 volts. These incidents pointed to another emergency measure that proved in valuable in electrical emergencies: an old‐fashioned styptic pencil. Concealed in the toilet kit, it will save the day and stanch the bleeding if and when inexperienced hands must again wield a safety razor. Practice packing the suitcase until you find a methodology that works for you and all your belongings; then follow that pattern religiously. That way, you will not waste valuable time trying to decide, under pressure of a taxi waiting to take you to the airport, where the socks go and how to keep the hairbrush from snagging the nylons. The answer, by the way, is the plastic bags used to encase leftovers before stowing them in the refrigera tor. Weightless and transparent, they pack easy and keep no secrets from the unpacker. The arguments go pro and con over tissue paper to keep dresses from wrinkling. Cosmetics, lotions and all the female and male beautifiers can be found in the big cities all over the world, so don't stock up on liter bot tles of such. But aspirins and things people take to stabilize an indecisive stomach may pass under different names abroad, and besides, just when do you get a headache or an upset stomach? About 1 A.M. or later, and where can you get a headache remedy at that hour of the morning? So car ry a basic medical kit of such necessi ties and any other drugs that your physician prescribes to keep you go ing until the concierge and the ethical pharmacy come on duty next morning. Some of my friends poke fun at this practice, but I have had them stumble down the hall to my room after room service had shut down for the night. So slip a small, well‐card boarded packet of cookies or biscuits in a corner of a suitcase. If your ho tel maintains 24‐hour room service, you won't need them; but if you sud denly wake up at 2 A.M. hungry, ill at ease and 3,500 miles from your own kitchen refrigerator, and the switchboard can offer only sympathy, you won't starve before you can get back to sleep. Or practice your lan guages and have fun shopping for a small tin of biscuits in your first overseas city. The small, prepackaged plas tic bags of detergegt are the answer for drip‐drying your way around the world. Hotel soap is too small and doesn't suds enough to do the mid night laundry. This is a luxury, but if you insist on drip‐dry shirts and blouses, carry inflatable plastic clothes hang ers: They shape up round, firm and fully packed and make it easier to smooth the wrinkles out of a drip ping collar, male or female. This is a necessity because, even if you do not go the drip‐dry way (and I do not, except for sport shirts), your stockings, socks and underwear sometimes cannot wait for the hotel laundry, and so the way to hang them up to dry is on your own portable doubled, twisted elastic clothesline. It comes coiled in a small, plastic box, and has hooks at both ends so that it can be slipped around the shower head and fastened onto it self or onto any kind of hook or pro jection across the bathroom. Tuck an inch or so of the wet clothes between the tightly twisted elastic, and they will dry happily overnight without clothespins. You cannot travel abroad without a passport; you should n't leave home without this miniature clothesline. Some good hotels, but only a very few, still set out on the dresser a small pincushion containing a cou ple of needles, some pins, a few lengths of thread and a button or two. In case your itinerary includes some not so‐good hotels, pack along your own sewing kit with shirt and suspender buttons, which always arrange to dis appear when their threads give way. Having used some valuable space and weight for these essentials, don't waste space and weight on large bottles of your favorite mouthwash. The Europeans do a fine job with pocket‐size bottles of various‐flavored concentrates; a couple of drops con vert tap water into a glassful. Cleansing tissue, toilet paper and other toilet goods are available all over the world, so don't waste luggage space on them. But take big tube of your favorite toothpaste; you can buy it, or a reasonable fac simile of it, over there, but in other lands the peppermint flavoring is more pepper than mint. Don't forget to pack the ex tra glasses, sun and otherwise, and copies of your prescriptions in your passport case. Failure to do so once cost me $23 just to wireless our neigh borhood optician from a ship in mid Atlantic, asking him to mail one pre scription glass for the left eye to our hotel in Stockholm. The Stockholm op tician charged 2½ kroner (50 cents) to fit the glass into the frame. If you disregard all of the above good (though unsolicited) ad vice, do not disregard this item on sore and hobbling feet. No matter what an army marches on, it is the tourist's feet that carry him onward and upward. No matter what else has to be left home for space and weight, take enough changes of comfortable, well‐broken‐in shoes so that, having klomped around all day on cobble stones, you can come home to your room, ease off those now overheated klompen and, after a long hot soak in a steaming tub, put on a fresh pair of shoes with which to face the night's activities. No greater comfort abroad than this! Of course, you can buy plasters and moleskins abroad for spot treatment of corns and callouses, but take your own along because you will need them, if at all, in your room, not on the Grand Place. If the United Nations ever creates a flag behind which the tourists of the world may unite, its ensign ar morial surely will be emblazoned, “Take care of your feet and they will lead you safely home.”

1109-> US. MAKES OFFER TO GIVE UP ABM'S IF SOVIET DOES SO
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 —The United States has offered to give up its antiballistic mis sile defense system entirely if the Soviet Union would agree to limit the number of its huge SS‐9 offensive missiles and abandon its own missile de fenses, a Nixon Administration source reports. The official said that, at the conclusion of four months of negotiations with the Soviet Un ion in Vienna last week, the United States was extremely optimistic about the progress made and fairly hopeful about reaching an agreement on lim iting missile systems. His comments were made at a background briefing organ ized by the White House for news editors at New Orleans last Friday and made avail able for publication tonight. New Orleans newspapers have reported that the editors met with President Nixon and were briefed by Henry A. Kissinger, his special assistant for nation al security affairs, and other administration officials. Compromise Sought At the briefing the editors were told by one official that the United States would try to encourage Israel and the Arab states to reach some ter ritorial compromise in their expected negotiations through Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, the United Nations representative. An Administration official said that no political solution to the Arab‐Israeli dispute could be achieved if the Arabs continued to insist that Israel must withdraw completely to her borders before the six‐day war of June 1967, or if Israel insisted on “substantial acquisi tion” of territory. This official explained that Israel, Egypt and Jordan had accepted the American proposal for a standstill cease‐fire and resumption a negotiations on a political settlement with the understanding that one of the principal items for negotiation would be Israel's final borders. Arabs Firm on Withdrawal Nonetheless, Egyptian and Jordanian officials have already said that they would stand firm on demands that Israel should withdraw to her 1967 lines and that what remained to be ne gotiated was the timetable and mechanics of the withdrawal. The news editors were also told that the Administration saw no chance for a settlement if the Arab states maintained their demand for the return of 1.3 million Palestinian refugees to their lands, without giv ing Israel assurance that she was not expected to take then all back at the risk of altering the fundamental Jewish charac ter of the state of Israel. In the coming weeks and months an Administration source aid the United States will have the task of encourag ing both sides to move away from their stated positions on territories and refugees, to strike a compromise. An official said that the United States should reach judgment by tomorrow on Is raeli complaints that the United Arab Republic had violated the cease‐fire by moving new mis siles into forward positions near the Suez Canal. In discussing the negotia tions with the Soviet Union on limiting strategic arms now in recess until the next round begins in Helsinki on Nov. 2, Administration officials de fended the White House con tention that the continuation of construction of the Safe guard missile defense system provides the United States with the best leverage for achieving an ultimate agree ment. One Administration official said that during the negotia tions thus far the one Ameri can development in the missile field that the Russians seemed most interested in stopping was the antiballistic missile or ABM. program. This official said that it would be very easy for Mos cow to stop this program by agreeing to limits on deploying of Soviet SS‐9 missiles which worry Washington. In a pack age proposal submitted to the Soviet negotiators on July 24, the United States suggested numerical limitations on nucle ar delivery systems of all types with a special quota on huge missiles such as the SS‐9. The Russians now have about 300 SS‐9's in operation or in some stage of deployment The Nixon Administration fearful of the potential threat to American missiles from these weapons if their numbers are increased, wants to limit the Russians to no more than their present inventory of SS‐9's. Arsenals Compared The Soviet Union currently Is known to have about 1,650 offensive missile launchers and bombers — about 1,250 land based intercontinental missiles such as the SS‐9's and the smaller SS‐11's and SS‐13's, 200 submarine‐based missiles and 200 strategic bombers and refueling planes. The United States arsenal in cludes 2,260 missile launchers — 1,054 intercontinental mis siles 656 submarine‐based mis siles and about 550 B‐52 stra tegic bombers. An Administration official repeated earlier White House assertions that the American antiballistic missile program provided the one real induce ment for the Russians to agree to a limit on SS‐9's. After an intensive debate, the Administration won a major legislative victory last Wednes day when the Senate by a vote of 52 to 47 rejected an amend ment that would have blocked expansion of the Safeguard antiballistic missile system to include two new bases. This week the Senate will vote on an amendment offered by Senator Edward W. Brooke Republican of Massachusetts that also would prevent geo graphical expansion of the Safe guard system but would allow the full $1.3‐billion authoriza tion to permit expansion of the two original antiballistic mis sile sites. U.S. Would Scrap ABM's American negotiators, an Administration source said have indicated Washington's willingness to reduce the American antiballistic mis sile system to very small pro portions; indeed, to abandon it if the Russians were willing to abandon their 64‐site antimis sile system now installed around Moscow and to limit their inventory of SS‐9's. The basic American proposal had already been reported but last week's briefing with news men was the first time it had been stated for publication by such high officials. There has been no conclusive response from the Russians on whether they considered the July 24 proposal as an accept able offer. But for three weeks until the arms talks adjourned last Friday, Soviet negotiators intensively questioned the Amer icans about all facets of the proposal. Their active interest has been interpreted by some American officials as an indication that the Russians consider the American offer a reasonable possibility, although American officials expect months of hard bargaining — and possibly a Soviet counter offer — when the talks resume in Helsinki. Russian Questions U.S. Strategy MOSCOW, Aug. 16 (Reuters) Soviet commentator sug gested today that President Nixon regarded negotiations with Russia on limiting strate gic arms as “some kind of mar ket dealing.” Writing in Pravda, the Com munist party daily, Georgi Ra tiani hinted that it was mislead ing to believe that the United States would retain a bargain ing advantage by continuing its Safeguard antiballistic missile system.

1110-> Staff and Course Cuts Ordered By Columbia in 28 Departments
Columbia University has or dered a reduction in teaching staff and the elimination of “signficant” number of courses in its 28 academic departments of arts and sciences. The set of guidelines, issued Wednesday by the deans of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of General Studies and Columbia College, followed a warning by Presi dent William McGill on Sept. 11 that academic and admin. istiative cuts would be nec essary to meet the university's expected 1970‐71 deficit of $15 million. The three deans, who make up the university's budget sub committee on arts and sciences, urged the department chairmen to “eliminate all expenditures that are not for the most essen tial purposes.” “It is clear that we must ;rake cuts,” remarked Dean George K. Fraenkel, chairman of the committee, “but we want to do it in such a way as to cause the least amount of dam age.” Need for ‘Excellence’ Noted The guidelines say that al though cuts will be necessary in nearly every department, the objective is to “maintain with out compromise the excellence of the teaching, scholarship and research carried on at Colum bia.” Although Dean Fraenkel em phasized that the deans were not calling for a job freeze in the department, the guidelines bar appointments of visiting professors, adjunct professors ar part‐time instructors, “except in cases of compelling need.” Dean Fraenkel also explained that appointments of senior fac ulty professors would be much more difficult next year than in the past The suggestion was made that course offerings could be reduced by eliminating duplica tion in Columbia College and the School of General Studies, the two undergraduate divi sions of the university. The deans further suggested that graduate and undergrad uate courses with small enroll ments be given on an alternate‐year basis rather than each year, as in the past. The elimination of visiting and part‐time instructors will necessitate a reallocation in teaching assignments that may make it necessary for tenured faculty to teach more under graduate courses. Several departmental chair men who were interviewed said they would take steps to com ply with the deans’ guidelines. Prof. Julian Miller, chairman of the chemistry department, said that although his depar,t ment had plans to expand its teaching staff to about 27 from the present 20 members, he would postpone the expansion. The chairman of the psychology department, Rebut Bush, also said that although he had been given permission last spring to hire three new assistant professors for next year, “it's unlikely that we'll do that.” “Maybe we'll just hire one; maybe we'll do without all three,” he said. A Look at Divisions Urged Some departmental chairmen suggested that another way to cut costs would be to eliminate entire divisions in the university. “We must find out which divisions are not paying for themselves,” said Prof. Wayne Wilcox, chairman of the politi cal science department, “Per haps the School of the Arts and the School of Dentistry are two which must be closely examined. They are traditional ly costly divisions!! Aaron W. Warner, dean of the School of General, Studies, commented: “My assumption is that there is no other alterna tive but for every school to take these or similar measures, I cannot believe that the central administration will overlook the other divisions.”

1111-> PRICES DIP AGAIN IN AMEX TRADING
Growing worry over the ramifications of the move by the Penn Central Transporta tion Company for reorganiza tion under the bankruptcy laws probably was the cause of the decline yesterday in prices on the American Stock Exchange. Declines, outnumbering ad vances by five to one, pushed the index down to 20.63, oompared with 20.89 the previous day. Stocks declining totaled 683, compared with 132 that advanced, while 169 were un changed. Volurie totaled 3;140, 760, compared with 3,075,000 on Monday. One of the big losers was Teleprompter, down 6 points to 62½. Sharp criticism by a mem ber of Congress about a gift of a low‐calorie cyclamate sweet ened product apparently did not dampen Carnation stock, which declined only ½ point. Solitron Devices lost 1¾ in active trading, and, with 249, 500 shares traded it led the most active list, closing at 16. Trading remained suspended in Canadian Javelin, which had been subject to rumors about a major iron project in Labrador and Quebec. The company did not disclose any information yesterday. Before trading was suspended, the stock, sold at 10⅜ last Friday. In the over‐the‐counter mar ket stock prices tended to move downward in line with the trend on the Big Board. Brokers described the activity as mod erate. Among the sharp decliners was National Semiconductor, down 2½. Drops of two points were registered by Recognition Equipment, Fannie Mae, Taylor Wine and Michael Baker. Seven Up was marked down 1½ points, while Eli Lilly, Tampax, Alcoa Laboratories and Mal linckrodt Chemical Works lost 1 point each.

AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 16, (Reuters)—Yasir Arafat, lead er of Al Fatah commando or ganization, pledged today that any Middle East peace settle ment would be foiled by guer rilla force. Speaking at a graduation ceremony for guerrillas who had completed mili tary training Mr. Arafat said “We are confident that the peaceful solution will not suc ceed, thanks to our guns.” The organization's news paper, Al Fatah said in an ar ticle that a new confrontation loomed between the comman dos and the Jordanian Army and accused Jordanian authori ties of planning to liquidate the guerrilla movement. It said the Jordanian Govern ment “was taking a series of military measures aimed at en circling the commandos, in pre paration for stabbing them in the back.” The newspaper, published in Amman, said Jordanian ruthor Ries pulled back artillery and tanks from the front with Isrpel and deployed them around Am man about two weeks ago.

1115-> Teacher Dismissal Over War Protests Upheld by the State
ALBANY, Sept. 24—The State Education Commissioner ruled today that a local school board had acted properly in dismissing a teacher for wear ing a black armband to class in support of last year's Viet nam moratorium activities. Such actions in a classroom, Commissioner Ewald B. Nyquist said, were “contrary to sound, educational principles,” be cause they presented “only one point of view on an important public issue on which a wide range of deeply held opinion and conviction exists.” The teacher, Charles James, was dismissed last Jan. 13 from his probationary appointment as an English instructor at Ad dison Central High School in Steuben County. According to the Commis sioner's ruling, Mr. James was first suspended by the local school board on Nov. 14, 1969, but was told that he could go back to school if he would “en gage in no political activity while in the school.” Mr. James argued that wear ing an armband was not politi cal but simply an exercise of his constitutional right of free speech. He wore one again last Dec. 12, was again suspended and then discharged. Commissioner Nyquist's rul ing said: “Symbolic speech in the classroom is a form of teaching, and is subject to the strictures of sound pedagogy. As the Supreme Court stated. Free public education, if faith ful to the ideal of secular in struction and political neutral ity, will not be partisan or enemy of any class, creed, party or faction.'” In Cortland, Mr. James, now a part‐time teacher at the Cort land Community College, said he would appeal the decision to United States District Court.

1117-> Bridge:
The Reisinger Knockout Team Championship will con tinue tonight at the New York Hilton with 16 teams in contention in the fourth round. This is the premier event in the Eastern Region als, which will end Sunday. The diagramed deal was played Monday in the first round of the event in which Tod Thorgersen of Ridgefield Park, N. J., Ed Ashare of East Orange, N. J., John Grader of Montclair, N. J., and Jerry Spero of New York, upset more experienced opponents. East opened with one spade, and Thorgersen as South ventured an overcall of two hearts. West raised the spades, and Spero made a good bid of four hearts, knowing that his partner must have a long, strong suit to overcall vulnerable at the two‐level. A diamond lead would have been best for the defense, but West naturally led the spade queen and South won with the ace in dummy. He cashed the king and ace of hearts, finding that West held trump trick. As East was sure to have the diamond ace, there was a considerable danger of losing a club trick, a heart and at least two dia monds. A heart trick was surren dered to West, who played the spade jack. South ruffed, and could have made the contract by playing West for the club queen. But it seemed to him likely that East, the opening bidder, held that card, so he made the cunning lead of the club three. His plan was to play the jack from dummy, hoping that East would win with the queen. South would not have been surprised if East had risen to the occasion by refusing to win with a holding of the club queen and two others. But he was shaken when West put up the club queen. This spectacular second‐hand high play, made by Tom Grif fin of New York, was aimed at guarding against the pos sibility that South held small doubleton club and East the doubleton king, but it did the defense no harm. If South had taken the club queen with the ace he would have shut off from the dum my. He ducked, in the hope that another spade would be led, but West had had enough of that suit and defeated the contract by shifting to dia monds. In the post‐mortem, South realized that his imaginative club play was right, but wrongly timed. If he had played a low club to dummy's jack, at the third trick, after entering his hand with a spade ruff, he would have been safe against most nor mal distributions. The heart king would have remained in dummy as the entry to the club suit at the appropriate moment.

1118-> The Governor Listeth
William F. Buckley Jr. lost something when Eleanor Roosevelt died: his favorite target. And “The Governor Listeth,” his latest collection of essays, columns, revelations, forgettabilia, etc. is the poorer for it. For instance, only once does he tell us the story about how Mrs. Roosevelt said that she would not cross picket line “under any circumstances,” a proclamation which gave rise to “the most ineluctably rationalist reply” Mr. Buckley has ever known, namely, “the call—it having been ascertained that she was in residence—for volunteers to picket round the clock all the exits from Hyde Park.” Mr. Navasky, of The Times Magazine staff, is at work on a book on Robert Kennedy as Attorney General. I haven't checked, but I would wager my back file of National Reviews that until now no collection of Mr. Buckley's has appeared that doesn't tell this story at least twice. I first heard him tell it to a receptive audience of silent generation Yale Law students in 1958. And of course it appears again (only once) as part of another story in “Quotations From Chairman Bill,” in a segment dated August 11, 1956, which is worth quoting if only as a tribute to Mr. Buckley's method, which involves a good deal of quotation, not to mention repetition and what is known in the trade elaboration theme: “Mrs. Roosevelt's statement several years ago that she would ‘never cross any picket line’ stood for years as the highest monument to contemporary anti‐rationalism. But now she has come through with rival. ‘I was shocked,’ she writes, ‘to hear not long ago that in one of our schools some older boys beat up their teacher.’ The explanation? ‘When this happens you can be sure that the blame does not lie with the young. Somehow or other such teacher failed to build up the respect and interest of her pupils and did not arouse a feeling in the children that she could be trusted and could understand things which perhaps the youngsters would not even talk about at home.’ Whatever happened to the suggestion that, her residence having been ascertained beyond peradventure, patriotic citizens institute a 24hour picket line around Hyde Park?” Well, Mr. Buckley doesn't have Mrs. Roosevelt to kick around any more and so it was with some curiosity that I approached “The Governor Listeth” to see how he has been managing in her absence. Quite well, thank you. A brief target analysis follows: First, he has replaced Mrs. Roosevelt, a moving target in her own right, but a square one, with three relative swingers: John Kenneth Galbraith (“who always looks like he is on leave from Mt. Olympus”), Arthur Schlesinger Jr. (whose assertion that he never signed any statement he didn't write prompted Buckley to speculate, “Suppose everyone adopted that position? Who would be left to sign Mr. Schlesinger's future statements? Nobody? Well, there's a point to be made in favor of that”) and Gore Vidal, with whom Mr. Buckley is on the verge of litigation over who said about whom. Second, we may observe that the informed Mr. Schlesinger, the cutting Mr. Galbraith and the imaginative and bitchy Mr. Vidal are each capable of defending themselves in ways of which Mrs. R. was either oblivious or incapable; but that the badinage, rebuttal and counter‐rebuttal are all calculated to bring out the best in Mr. Buckley, which is very good indeed. And indeed—aside from some hilarious bad taste excursions in the Buckley‐Vidal corner—much of The Governor is graceful, civilized, witty, perceptive and, to use the adjective which follows Mr. Buckley with more frequency than any other contemporary entity save The New Yorker Magazine, urbane. Third, a note on perspectives from the firing line. Mrs. R. was the far left of her day and Buckley was attacking from the far right. Galbraith, Vidal and Schlesinger were the enlightened center and what we have here is an inside job. It is not that Mr. Buckley has mellowed or muted his message—that the acid thrower of yesteryear has given way to court jester. Buckley can still salivate cyanide and spritz it with a tongue‐flick at the mention of Alger Hiss or Judith Coplin or the Rosenbergs or Brezhnev and Kosygin, or such new lefties as Tom A Book of Inspired Political Revelations.

Hayden, although Mr. B. is as bothered by Mr. Hayden's manners as much as by his philosophy. Rather it is that in the age of Agnew, the milieu of Mitchell, Buckley politics are quasi‐establishment politics. This is not to deny that there are respects in which Chairman Bill, borrowing a tactic from Chairman Mao, has chosen to swim in the mainstream; he is in favor of a Negro for President by 1980, he was/is an attacker of the attackers of Democratic President Lyndon Johnson's foreign policy, and he is even a selective civil libertarian. One result of this centrist geography: Not only is he en gaged in civilized discourse with mainly friendly enemies but he has left President Nixon virtually alone. When one recalls his helpful perspective on the Eisenhower era (“My guess is the Communists moved with whatever caution it can be said they did between 1953 and 1960 because they hadn't the least idea what Eisenhower was talking about, and thought a little prudence might be in order”) one can only join in that old folksong for conservatives: “Won't you come home, Bill Buckley/Won't you come home/ From the Establishment?.” Finally, it is clear that although his self‐image is amateur logician and sometimes metaphysician, his ultimate talent is as syntactician. Whether he is adumbrating Aquinas or decimating a contemporary cliché, his sentences can raise their eyebrows, he can punctuate his way out of a paper bag, he can set up a victim in parentheses and dispose of him in italics! This mix—the new syntax and the old politics—in addition to exuding literary charm, seems suited to Buckley's specialty: the essaylet. Only Benjamin DeMott, Murray Kempton, David Cort come to mind as equally effective and dedicated short form cliché‐busters. Which is, by the way, why “Quotations” from the witty Mr. Buckley doesn't work. It is not that the bits aren't as funny as the pieces. It is simply that Mr. Buckley's syntax is his context. And the punchlines without the context are like Chambers without Hiss, Schine without Cohn, Mr. Buckley without Mrs. Roosevelt.

1120-> Yiddish Theater Moves to Broadway
Mat staple Ot Second Ave nue, the Yiddish theater, will be denied to that region this season for the first time in many years. Instead, it will be on view on Broadway uptown, for the most part, and on East Broad way downtown. There are conflicting reasons given for its move, ranging from the explanation that the hippies have taken over the area to the unavailability of play houses there. But all inter ested parties in the Yiddish theater world agree that it will be missing from Second Avenue this season. Sleeping on Streets Sol Dickstein, who will put on “Light, Lively and Yid dish,” a Yiddish‐American musical based on the history of Jewish jesters and singers from 1870 through 1970, at the Bealsco Theater on Oct. 27 said that he “ran away from Second Avenue like from a fire.” “We had the finest neigh borhood there; we used to call it the Jewish Broadway, but you cannot walk in the streets there for the people sleeping ‘on them,” Mr. Dick stein said. “I don't believe you can have any theater there—whether it's Yiddish or American. I lived there for 45 years, but I don't think the Yiddish theater will ever come back,” he said. Ben Bonus, star of the forthcoming musical, ex pressed similar views. “The downtown Yiddish theater is no more,” he said. “The Yid dish‐Anderson theater is now showing rock ‘n’ roll shows and audiences don't want to go down there because of the East Village environment. The neighborhood would haEre to be reborn and the dilapidated houses ‘would have to be refurbished.” But the Yiddish theater, in the mind of Mr. Bonus, is far from being dead. “The Yid dish theater,” Mr. BonuS re marked, “has always been like a wandering star. It goes from country to coun try, from town to town, which we are still doing. It's a question of moving from shtetl to Broadway.” Plays in Waco, Tex. Last season, Mr. Bonus said he and a group of seven performers traveled to 60 cities from coast to coast and to Canada. “We even played a place like Waco, Tex., which has 500 Jews living; there and I got 250 of them to attend our show,” he said. Jacob Jacobs, the Yiddish actor‐producer, said that he decided to book his latest at traction, “President's Daugh ter,” at the Billy Rose The ater, opening Oct. 27, “be cause Second Avenue is played out.” Mr. Jacobs said that he could have rented a play house on Second Avenue for his Yiddish‐American musical comedy, but he decided against it because he “could not make any money with a hit show last season.” “I got all good notices for ‘Oh, What a Wedding’ but no one came,” he said. A new American‐Israeli “topical revue,” “To Be Or Not To Be... What Kind of Question Is That?,” will have its premiere at the Barbizon. Plaza Theater, 106 Central Park South, a far call from Second Avenue. In the cast are Moti Giladi, Sarah Rubine, Evelyn Kingsley, Shmulik Goldstein and Mark Stuart. And, on East Broadway, Joseph Buloff, who is equally at home on Broadway and in the Yiddish theater, will star in “The Brothers Ashkenazi,” the I. J. Singer drama, open ing Oct. 31 at the Folksbiene Playhouse. But Herman Yablokoff, president of the Hebrew Ac tors Union, and a Yiddish performer for many decades, disagrees with the view that Second Avenue is “played out” as a Yiddish showcase. “I would not say that the Jews don not want to go there anymore,” Mr. Yablo koff said. “I'd say that if there is a good show there, they'll go.” During the 1930's, Second Avenue had four Yiddish playhouses. Eight other Yid dish houses—including one in Harlem—also operated in the city's other boroughs. The decline in their number be gan in the 1940's.

1121-> Truancy Overwhelms the Truant Officers Here
For tens of thousands of the city's teen‐agers, going to school has become a some time thing. Some are so poor they have no time for anything but the struggle to stay alive; some are frustrated by their inabil ity to do high school work; some are rebelling against parental and teacher authori ty; some are sapped of energy by asthma and other chronic ??ments, some are living the half lives of drug addicts; some are turned off by studies in which they see no sense. And there are some who stay home to avoid the gant let of muggers, rapists and drug‐starved predators they must pass on the way to school; some have been tru ants so long they think they cannot return; some play hooky simply because they know they will not be caught. Taken as a group, these sometime students have dropped attendance rates for the 275,024 youths enrolled in the city high schools to the lowest levels since 1900 and have so overwhelmed the Board of Education's 522‐ man Attendance Bureau that it can no longer enforce the state's compulsory education law here. “It's easy to stay out of school; no one bothers you,” said Allen Harrell, president of the Student Council at Boys High School “I know because I was one of the main hooky players here. But after a while I realized there was nothing for me on the streets and I came back.” Allen, who has raised his grades from failing to a 77 per cent average and hopes to go to college next fall, said: “I've made it, or at least I think I have, but how many other kids are out there on the streets still looking for something they're never going to find? Who cares? Who helps them?” According to Bureau of At tendance figures, as many as 65,000 high school pupils are absent on an average day. Last November, at Eastern District High School, 44 per cent of the students enrolled were out each day; at DeWitt Clinton, an average of 33 per cent were out; at Julia Richman, 39 per cent. At Boys High (46 per cent out), teachers report that hun dreds of students are now on a self‐declared Tuesday‐to‐Thurs day school week, taking regular Friday‐to‐Monday weekend hol idays. At Thomas Jefferson (40 per cent absent), teachers talk about “phantom classes,” cit ing as an extreme example one official class of 50 habitual tru ants to which only two pupils reported during a 30‐day period this term, one for one day and the other for two. At Morris High School (35 per cent absent), irregular at tenders fall so far behind in their work that in their senior year they must be coached up to eighth‐grade reading level so they may qualify for high school diplomas. At Benjamin Franklin (45 per cent out), more than 400 of the students sent to the school by the junior highs each year never show up. These “no shows” just disappear, some to other schools and neighborhoods, oth ers to the streets of Harlem and the South Bronx where vet eran attendance teachers are afraid to follow, even in pairs, and where school mail seems never to reach its destination. School districts upstate re port year after year to the State Education Department that 90 to 95 per cent of their high school students go to school each day. In the city, where records are available back to 1900, the average daily attendance had been running in the high 80's, but has been fall ing steadily for seven years. It has dropped from 87.1 per cent for the 1962–63 school year—a high point for the past two decades—to 75.1 per cent for 1967–68, to an even lower percentage (not yet fully tabu lated by the board's computer) for 1968–69, and with no indi cations of a significant turn around this year. Attendance also has been falling—but not so far—in the 27 vocational high schools and in the elementary and junior high schools. The growth of absenteeism is causing frustration and demor alization among teachers who find their courses and lesson plans disrupted; deep disap pointment among parents who hope the schools will lead their children out of poverty, and cynicism among students who see others breaking the law with impunity and are tempted to do the same. It is adding millions of dol lars to the cost of running the schools and, at the same time, making it harder for the city to bear the burden by reducing the amount of state aid to edu cation, which is doled out ac cording to the attendance figures. It also is causing widespread fear that yet another lost gen eration of youths with no edu cation, no work or study habits and no prospects is passing through the high schools on the way to an empty, unfulfilled adulthood. “Our boys need educatior, more than they need anything else,” said Noel A. Louis, the black assistant principal of Boys High School. “But if they don't come to school, how can we teach them?” A school‐by‐school study by the Bureau of Attendance o?? the average number of absences per pupils during the last five school years shows that almost every high school in the city has been affected by the growth of absenteeism. While the prob lem is most acute in schools drawing students from the poorest neighborhoods, it also is affecting schools with pre dominantly middle‐class enroll ments and even the elite high schools. Among the slum‐area schools, for example, the average num ber of absences has risen from 33 a year to 59 a year at Thomas Jefferson; among the middle class schools, from 25 to 36 a year at Lincoln; among the elite schools, from 12 to 23 a year at Stuyvesant. These figures record only the number of students who do not answer to their names when attendance is taken in official class periods. They do not re cord the large number of other students who report to official classes so that absence notices will not be sent to their homes, but who cut other classes. According to Martin Miller, attendance coordinator at Mor ris, it is not uncommon for such students to come to school for their free lunch and to see their friends, but to skip all subject classes. Parents, teachers, principals, pupils, guidance counselors and attendance officers interviewed offered a wide variety of ex planations for the rise in ab senteeism. Among the reasons they gave were these: ¶The frustration felt by thou sands of pupils who come out of the junior high schools read ing at third‐ fourth‐ and fifth‐ grade levels and who find it im possible to keep up with high school work. ¶Skip zoning, an attempt by the board to establish better ra cial balance in the schools, which forces some students to travel up to an hour and a half to get to their out‐of‐neighbor hood schools. ¶Overcrowding, which in some schools forces pupils to at tend classes in auditoriums, cafeterias, gyms and other makeshift rooms; to wait as long as 45 minutes on lunch lines; to rise before dawn to attend a morning session or stay in school beyond dusk to complete an afternoon session. ¶Attacks on the relevance of the traditional curriculum of reading, writing, mathematics, science and history, which has lessened the value of these studies in the eyes of some students. ¶A decline in adult author ity, which signalled itself to one attendance teacher by the de fiance she meets now compared with the nervousness she used to find in truants she chased. ¶Drug addiction, which most teachers and students think is a growing and menacing prob lem. ¶The cumulative effects of five years of school boycotts, teacher strikes, welfare pro tests, peace moratoriums and other demonstrations, all of which has shown some stu dents that it is acceptable—and even proper — to put others causes and interests ahead of a day in school. ¶The failure of many par ents to recognize the impor tance of regular attendance at school, even though they may urgently want education for their children and may make enormous sacrifices for it. ¶The feeling among many poor blacks and Puerto Ricans that no amount of schooling is going to improve their chances in life. ¶The fear of parents in shim neighborhoods that their chil dren are not safe on the streets alone, even in broad daylight. Almost all those interviewed agreed that migration from the South and from Puerto Rico has brought to the city a large body of poor children, perhaps a larger body of the poor than the city's schools ever were asked to educate before. There are no figures on in come levels for previous gen erations of public school pupils, but one indication of the size of today's enrollment of the poor comes from the Depart ment of Social Services, which administers the welfare pro gram. Its records show that last year some 600,000 children up to the age of 18 were being given support in the Aid to Families with Dependent Chil dren category. Of these, about 450,000 were of school age, a group equal to 40 per cent of the 1,123,165 children enrolled in the city's schools. While the schools always have had large numbers of im poverished children, the chil dren in this welfare category have the additional problem of coming from broken, chaotic and unstable homes. Most live without fathers, with mothers overwhelmed by the struggle to keep food on the table, or with aunts, grand mothers or other relatives, often in three or four different homes in a single school year. “Most of our absentees aren't living in what you and I would call a normal home,” said Gerald Barron, attendance coordinator at Benjamin Franklin High. “When I look at a referral card and see one name for the student and an other name for the guardian, and I also see no telephone number, those are pretty good signs we're not going to be able to find that kid.” “Some of the homes these nonattenders come from are un helievable,” Arthur Clinton, di rector of the Attendance Bu reau, said. “For such a child, just getting to school in a white shirt is something of a miracle.” And an attendance teacher in the South Bronx who never en ters one of the neighborhood's festering slums without check ing under the stairs for a lurk ing mugger agreed. “If I'm afraid to go into some of these buildings, think what it must be like for the kids who have to live here,” he said. In all schools with predom inantly poor enrollments, teach ers report large numbers of children suffering from asthma, emphysema, epilepsy, almost chronic colds and other ills. When these children need treat ment, they cannot call a doctor to make an appointment the way a middle‐class child can, but must skip school to go to a clinic and wait their turn. Often, the high‐school‐age child is the eldest in the fam ily and must stay home to take care of an ailing parent or a sibling when illness strikes. Guidance counselors at sev eral schools say that among the pupils they advise are some who live absolutely alone by scrounging what they can from friends and relatives and by doing odd jobs in their neigh borhoods. Arnold Marcus, a counselor at Boys High, said after discussing one such boy: “No real change is going to take place in the schools until there are fundamental changes in the society outside the schools. Adding new programs each year will not help. The situation will continue as long as the underlying social condi tions remain the same.” Some of the high schools have tried to meet the special needs of their pupils with spe cial programs. At Morris High School, for example, there are 18 different classes in remedial English for poor readers and a “core” program featuring a double period in speech and English for children of Spanish background. At Benjamin Franklin, a “cluster” program was organ ized three years ago for ninth graders to see if a joint teach ing effort and intensive coun seling could start these pupils off on successful high school work. Groups of 120 children were assigned five teachers and a guidance counselor and, in addition, a psychologist was asked to help children with acute problems. Neither program has had a significant effect on attendance rates, although both have pro vided other benefits for some pupils. Often, the argument centers on the chicken‐and‐egg ques tion of whether children fail because they are truants or are truants because they are failing. Morton Selub, principal of Franklin K. Lane High School, taking note of the failure oft many remedial efforts, said that perhaps an entirely new kind of education was needed for the nonattenders. “Some of these kids may need a social worker or a street worker more than they need a teacher,” he said. “Perhaps street academies may be the answer for some, or smaller schools where everyone a pupil meets says, ‘How are you, Charlie, how are you getting along? and means it.” Herbert Von King, a black building contractor and presi ient of the Parent‐Teacher As sociation at Boys High, believes this kind of intensive interest and guidance can be provided by alumni volunteers. “Seventy‐five per cent of our students have no fathers at ??ome,” Mr. Von King said. “These boys get no supervision because most mothers can't ??ope with a teen‐age boy.” To answer this need, Mr. Von King is organizing a “man be ??ind the boy” program with the goal of providing an alumni counselor for every fatherless student who wants one. At Benjamin Franklin, Leon ard F. Littwin, the principal, also is skeptical of the efficacy of remedial programs. “The core of the problem is what a kid sees school for,” he said. “When a boy has college as his goal, he has no problem here. But how do you motivate the couple of hundred pupils we get each year who read at third‐grade level and have never had any success in school?” The answer being planned at Franklin is a new kind of pro gram that would combine part time work and full‐time study leading directly to a career in health or electronics or some other field with wide‐open op portunities. The children would be paid from the moment they started work in the ninth year, with regular raises as they ac quired proficiency. The program is being planned by the school's Improvement Committee, a parent‐commu nity‐teacher group, with the help of a grant from the Urban Coalition. It is roughly similar to the STEP and CO‐OP Work programs already in operation in many schools for pupils 16 years old and older, but would be more comprehensive and would take in younger children. For Mr. Littwin, the impor tance of a recognizable goal for a student is proved by the ex cellent attendance record achieved by students in the school's College Bound pro gram. While the attendance rate for the school as a whole was only 55 per cent in Novem ber, it was 90 per cent for the College Bound classes. Traditionally in the city, it was considered normal and tol erable for one of 10 pupils to be absent on an average day. Most of those absences were caused by illness, severe weath er or unusual home problems. This left the attendance bureau with a managable work load of delinquents, truants and dis turbed children. Now, however, with an ab sence ratio higher than one in four in the high schools, and with as many as 65,000 high school students absent each day, plus thousands more in the elementary and junior high divisions, the bureau's 522 offi cers are swamped and cannot meet their responsibility of en forcing the compulsory school law, according to Mr. Clinton, the director. Adding to the bureau's prob lems, and swelling the absentee rate, are many youths who are registered in school for non educational reasons. Some keep themselves on the registers to avoid the draft. Some stay on to maintain their welfare grants, which continue through the 18th year if a child is going to school. Still others move away with out telling their school or take jobs without formally resigning from school. The law requires children to attend school until their 17th birthday, unless they resign with parental consent to take a job after their 16th birthday. Tracking down such children takes a large part of the work ing day of the attendance teachers and prevents them from doing the intimate coun seling they are trained for. Until such children can be found, or until an attendance teacher can conscientiously say they cannot be found after ex tensive efforts, they must re main on the school registers and must be programmed for and assigned teachers, class rooms and advisers. Restoring the schools to nor mal compliance with the edu cation law will require, as a first step, almost a doubling of the attendance staff, Mr. Clinton said. He has proposed adding 116 new attendance teachers plus 346 community liaison aides. “Quite frankly, we have a mess on our hands,” Mr. Clin ton said. “For the past 10 years the size of our staff has remained constant, despite our annual pleas for increases. Now, the superintendent has put our request into the budget, and if we get the people we need, it will be a magnificent step forward.” The Board of Education, underlining the seriousness of the problem, has requested $10.4‐million for a program to reverse the rising rate of drop outs and lower the rate of truancy. Mr. Clinton and other mem bers of the bureau have been encouraged by the work of an experimental task force led by Thomas P. McNearney, a vet eran supervisor. With four at tendance teachers and 12 com munity aides, Mr. McNearney's task force last year sought out in their homes 526 chronically absent 16‐ and 17‐year‐olds at John Adams High School. Ninety‐three of them could not be found or failed to come to conferences. Ninety‐eight were discharged because they were over age, because they preferred to work or because they had medical disabilities. The others were given counsel ing and put under close super vision. For the 325 youths in the last group, attendance rates improved, for a two‐month pe riod, from 59.1 to 73.9 per cent, and 30 per cent of them kept up their good attendance habits without any further counseling this year. It is Mr. Clinton's hope that similar work will bring thou sands of other pupils back into the schools.

1122-> Nelson Play Marks Return of Rattigan To London Theater
LONDON, Sept. 24 — Absent from the theater for seven years, Terence Rattigan returns with a piece that joins the growing list of middle‐brow his tory plays with which the Westi End is rallying its old public.) “A Bequest to the Nation” at the Haymarket Theater is about’ Nelson and Lady Hamilton, and, apart from Zoe Caldwell's loose language as the hero's disrep utable consort, it could have been written at any time since Pinero. Rattigan has a serious inter est in the characters. His play sets out to examine the be havior of a man who discovers sexual passion for the first time in middle‐age: and to ask whether Emma Hamilton was as unworthy a figure as she appeared to the cartoonists and the jeering London crowds. However, such matters cannot be properly debated in a form that contains its own inbuilt moral certainties: and Rattigan, for most of the time, is stuck with the inflexible fable of the man in high public office and the woman with a past. He tries to do justice to Emma, but he bestows full ap proval on her only when she kisses her hero good‐by and gives him permission to go out and get killed. Nelson himself, as Ian Holm plays him, is laden with the dignity of a board room portrait; and one's main interest is in wondering how he will tear himself from Emma's vulgar clutches and get out there to beat the French. There remains, however, Miss Caldwell, first seen swigging porter in bed and deciding to “toy with a piece of cold mut ton in me bath.” This is a gor geous piece of defiant clowning, seen at its most irresistible in the raucously pathetic mock classical monologue she deliv ers to a sniggering company (“great Hector's dead, and the mind boggles!”). If only for this, Peter Glenville's staid produc‐ tion is worth a visit. IRVING WARDLE.

1123-> Pueblo Aim: Deed to Shrine
TAOS, N. M., July 16— The Council of Elders, old men with light flannel blan kets, some covering their heads from the blazing mid day sun, came out of an adobe meeting room into the largely deserted street. Their moccasined feet moved slowly across the hard‐packed weedless ground. They talked in Tiwa, a lan guage that sounds odd‐syl labled and hesitant. They walked toward the two five‐storied mud brick buildings that have been the living place for the Taos Pueblo Tribe since the 14th century — practical antiques that are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. De spite the dogs and tourists that move about most of the day, the buildings have a still ness to them, a sense of per manence beyond mud and straw and wood. Juan de Jesus Romero, the small, 90‐year‐old cacique, or chief, was polite, accommo dating and brief. “We are very much pleased,” he said of Presi dent Nixon's support last week of the bill that would return to the 1,450 Taos Pueblo Indians 48,000 acres of land, including their sa cred Blue Lake. It left a good deal unsaid. The lake itself sits in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, 25 miles east of the Pueblos, which stand in the sun in a flat valley three miles north east of Taos in northern New Mexico. In 1906, Theodore Roose velt took the Blue Lake lands from the reservation and included them in the Carson National Forest to preserve them. The Indians have been struggling ever since to get them back. It is the source of the Rio Pueblo de Taos, a sparkling stream that runs through the reservation lands. Members of a delegation of tribal elders who went to Washington a week ago were deeply impressed with Presi dent Nixon's reception of them and the dignity with which they were treated. They took with them the cere monial canes presented to the tribe by an early Spanish governor and by Abraham Lincoln. “President Nixon is the first President to take a stand that does us justice,” said Paul J. Bernal, the tribal sec retary and interpreter. The next day the Indians met with the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the Sen ate Interior Committee and came away with bitterness. Mr. Bernal said that Sen ator Lee Metcalf, Democrat of Montana, was “under the influence of firewater” after lunch and was hostile. “It was shameful behavior, an insult, a mockery to the hearing audience,” Mr. Ber nal said. They also felt rejected by Senator Clinton P. Anderson, Democrat of New Mexico. “We felt these people are not qualified to bring jus tice,” Mr. Bernal said. In a telephone interview, Senator Metcalf said of Mr. Bernal's charge: “That is a completely false, dishonest and unfair statement.” Mr. Metcalf said that, fol lowing the morning session of the subcommittee, he had attended a luncheon for Sec retary General Thant of the United Nations at which no cocktails were served. The luncheon was interrupted by a roll‐call vote, Mr. Metcalf said. After voting, he said, he went back to the committee room where he took the chair in the absence of the sub committee's chairman, Sen ator George S. McGovern. As a practical matter, the Indians already have control of Blue Lake, but they want full title as a matter of prin ciple and feel that the 48,000 acres of land are sacred and cannot be compensated for by money. Mr. Metcalf and Senator Anderson contend that, un der the Indian Claims Act, tribes have always been rec ompensed in money and not in land, and that a dangerous precedent would be created to grant the Taos Pueblo In dians so much land on the ground that it was sacred to them. Every August, the whole tribe makes a pilgrimage to Blue Lake for religious cere monies that white men have never been invited to attend. Neither are outsiders in vited into the kivas, the un derground rooms marked off by two long poles where sa cred rites are practiced. But despite their devotion to their own religion, most of the Indians are devout Roman Catholics, converted and given Spanish surnames by the priests who opened mission here in 1627. The first whites to visit the Pueblos came in 1540. More than 300 years after their conversion, the Indians still speak of Catholicism as being “imposed” on them. The Rev. Michael O'Brien, a newly ordained priest who offers mass at the adobe and concrete church that faces the dusty plaza, said the old Indian religion was looked on as a “natural religion of brotherhood” and a “pre revelation” body of belief that is not condemned or discouraged. There is no con tradiction between the two religions in the Indians' minds, he said. “They are very, very deep ly religious,” Father O'Brien said. “They have a great de votion to the Blessed Virgin.” Tony Reyna, who runs two Indian arts and crafts shops and is a member of the tribe, said the Taos Pueblo Indians had always irrigated and farmed the valley upriver from the old mud buildings. Because of the heavy tourist traffic in the summer, many families move out in the sum mer to preserve their privacy. “We are a simple people,” he said.

1124-> PHILS TURN BACK GIANTS BY 6‐5, 6‐1
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 1 (UPI)—Successive homers by Don Money and Deron Johnson in the third inning propelled Philadelphia to a 6‐1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and a sweep of a double‐header tonight. The Phillies won the opener, 6‐5, in 11 innings on a throwing error by the left ‘fielder, Ken Henderson. Kim wise hurled the first seven innings of the second game to gain his ninth victory against eight defeats. Barry Lersch hurled the last two innings and picked up his third save after Wise left with a blister on his pitching hand. The Phillies spoiled the big league debut of Don Carrithers, who had a 9‐1 won‐lost record this season at Phoenix. Carrithers allowed two runs in the first inning and then left after Money and Johnson hit homers in the third inning. The Giants, who exhibited shaky defense in the opener, committed four errors in the second game, three of which led to runs. Denny Doyle walked to open the game for the Phillies and scored when the left fielder, Frank Johnson, misplayed Oscar Gamble's single. Gamble took second on the play and scored on Johnny Briggs’ single. A reliever, Rich Robertson, gave unearned runs in the fourth and fifth innings. Doyle singled in the fourth, took? second on a balk and scored when Jim Hart threw Money's grounder into right field. Briggs walked to open the fifth, took second on Willie McCovey's error and, after Mike Ryan walked to load the bases, secored on Wise's groundout. San Francisco's run came in the seventh on Hart's double, Tito Fuentes's single and Johnson's groundout. Dick Selma hurled the last four innings to get credit for the victory in the opener. He went in after Philadelphia scored twice in the seventh to lead, 5‐4, but served up a twoout homer to McCovey that tied the game in the ninth. ??

1125-> Isaac Bashevis Singer Takes Success in Stride
“I tell you, the only dif ferences that success has made for me are that I work more and that I don't have this fear, which I had for many years, that I will starve.” In this remark, uttered in his gentle tenor, Isaac Ba shevis Singer summed up the effects of money and fame on a 65‐year‐old novel ist and short‐story writer who until several years ago was spinning his narratives chiefly for Yiddish readers. Now his English readers far outnumber his Yiddish audi ence; and he has been trans lated, too, into the world's principal languages. His income, what with the Book ‐ of ‐ the ‐ Month Club's purchase of his two recent novels, “The Manor” and “The Estate,” and with three film contracts, now comfort ably exceeds $100,000 a year. This figure, according to friends, is four or five times the level of nine years ago. And yet Mr. Singer's life style has scarcely changed since he came to New York from Poland in 1935 with “the ideal that somebody should secure for me a sal ary of $15 a week—$4 for rent and $11 for food.” As he always has, the author lives on the upper West Side and eats his vegetarian luncheon in neighborhood cafeterias. For a recent interview in his six‐room apartment, the birdlike, almost bald writer appeared in a rather shiny black suit and an obviously inexpensive shirt and tie. His gray socks had runs in them and his shoes were scuffed. “I'd never change my suit, except my wife insists,” he confided with a laugh. Alma Haimann Singer (the couple were married in 1940; she is his second wife) works, as she has for a number of years, as a saleswoman in Lord & Taylor's Fifth Avenue store. “My wife works for the love of it,” Mr. Singer explained. “If you ask her, though, she says she has to work because she needs the money to buy all kinds of gadgets; but this, of course, is not true.” But most of his income, Mr. Singer lamented, “I spend by paying taxes because a writer has very few deduc tions.” He added, “If I can save, I save.” Apart from the increased workload and the absence of fear of starvation, Mr. Singer has discovered that money will permit him to fulfill one lifelong dream—to travel. “I was three‐and‐a‐half months abroad last summer, and stayed in good hotels,” he said. “That is something was never able to do.” The freedom that money brings has been astonishing. “I will tell you,” Mr. Singer said, “when a Yiddish writer begins to write, he is re signed from the very begin ning. I said to myself, I will write for my audience and never be known among other readers. But about 15 years ago they began to translate me, and now I have readers in all languages. It is a good surprise and a welcome sur prise naturally.” Even so, Mr. Singer sees himself as still a Yiddish writer. “My stories are print ed first in The Jewish Daily Forward,” he said, “and then reprinted in Yiddish papers in other countries. And if make a mistake about the Jewish law or a street in Warsaw, I get hundreds of letters upbraiding me.” Success, in terms of a wid er readership, has also given Mr. Singer “the feeling that my work is important.” “The fact that people are inter ested makes me want to do more, to satisfy their expec tations,” he said. That is why fame has fas tened him ever more closely to his desk. Having succeed ed, he is now afraid to let go. “But I never forget,” he said, “that I am only a story teller.”

1126-> TENANTS SETTLE
Space Already. Is Occupied in Unfinished Structure At 11 o'clock yesterday morning, Margaret Siss, a sec retary, was busy hanging plc tures in the 11th‐floor offices of Irving R. Boody & Co. ex porters and importers of raw materials. In an adjoining room, Frank Ramirez was hunched over hit.; desk checking out in voices; In the background were the sounds of riveting, the clang of metal, the shouts of men still working ‘to complete the build ing into which Boody had moved Tuesday night — One World Trade Center. There was activity, too, in the 10th‐floor offices of the Export‐Import Services, Inc., freight forwarders and custom house brokers. Monte .Chirlot, a clerk, was mimeographing form letters while, other office personnel were preparing bills. James Far rell Jr., head of the; company, was on the telephone getting the good news from his wife that they had just become the grandparents of James Farrell Makeshift Entry To get to their offices, em ployes and executives of Boody and Export‐Import have to go through a makeshift covered walkway. The building has no finished lobby, and the upper floors are still without walls. The ‐10th‐ and 11th‐floor oc cupants were the first tenants of One World Trade Center, the 110‐story North Tower build ing of the $650‐million, six building project on the Lower West Side being constructed by the Port of New York Au thority. They had moved in well in advance of the completion of the building, which is not ex pected to be finished and opened formally until 1972. Their occupancy was made public in a press announce ment by James C. Kellogg 3d, chairman of the authority. But neither Austin J. Tobin, the ex ecutive director of the agency, nor any other officer was pres ent to herald the event—only Myron Hurwitz, a member of the public relations staff. “We expect another tenant to move in later in the week, and then, beginning in Janu ary, perhaps two a week,” Mr. Hurwitz explained. “A bank of elevators in the main lobby will serve the 10th, 11th and 12th floors, the only floors now ready for occupancy. . The North Tower Building is on Dey Street west of Church Street, overlooking the West Side Highway.

1128-> NEW FACES APPEAR IN PEKING REGIME
HONG KONG, May 25—Two public ceremonies this month in Peking attended by Mao Tse tung and the hierarchy around him have provided an unusual opportunity to study the ranks of the Chinese Communist lead ership. No changes were apparent in the ranking at the very top during the two ceremonies— the first on May Day, the sec ond last Thursday, when a mass rally was suddenly called to greet Chairman Mao's declara tion of the day before hailing the development of world revo lutionary struggles against “United Stites imperialism.” However, strikingly evident from the livings of secondary figures published in Communist newspapers as among those present were the large number of individuals quite new to prominence on the national scene. Also noteworthy were the large proportion of military men among the new as well as the old faces, the diminished number of old leaders and the evidence that the ruling struc ture was still far from having been fully reconstructed after the purges of the Cultural Rev olution. Foreign envoys present at the two ceremonies report that Mr. Mao looks well and reason ably vigorous despite his 76 years. One ambassador who shook Mr. Mao's hand said on a visit to Hong Kong that the Communist leader's only marked failing appeared to be eye trouble, manifested by fre quent squinting and obvious dimness of vision. Mr. Mao's deputy, Lin Piao, and the No. 3 man in the hier archy, Premier Chou En‐lai were reported to have appeared haggard and tired, particularly Mr. Lin. Notably absent from both ceremonies was the acting chief of state, 84‐year‐old Tung Pi‐wu, and the six “old mar shals,” or senior military men Chu Teh, Liu Po‐cheng, Yeh Chien‐ying, Chen Yi,.Nieh Jung chen and Hsu Hsiang‐chien who survived the. Cultural Rev olution. As far as is known, all the men—except Mr. Chu—are still vice chairmen of the party's powerful military af fairs commission, which is un der Mr. Lin, the Defense Min ister. Another significant absentee on both occasions was Hsieh Fu‐chih, the Minister of Public Security, who has not been re ported as having appeared in public since March 19, when he and Premier Chou greeted the former Cambodian Chief of State, Prince Norodom Sihan ouk, on the Prince's arrival in Peking from Moscow. Mr. Hsieh's absence is espe cially notable because he is not only a member of the Polit buro but has been identified with Chairman Mao's revolu tionary line and is head of the Revolutionary Committee that governs the Peking municipal ity. Political analysts here sug gest Mr. Hsieh may have dropped from favor or may have been sent on a special mission to southwest China, where he was once a high official, to support the Com munist struggle in Indochina. One indication of the toll taken by the purges is that, of the 15 deputy premiers who held posts before the Cultural Rev olution began in 1966, only Mr. Lin and Li Hsien‐nien were present. Premier Chou had 40 minis ters before the Cultural Rev olution but only five Govern ment ministers were present at the ceremonies this month. Several more, it is believed, still hold portfolios, but the small number on hand was in dicative of greatly thinned ranks. However, the number of dep uty ministers present totaled 31, indicating, observers here feel, that in many cases min istries are being run by deputy ministers. The large number of new comers is indicated by the fact that, of 398 persons present on May Day—identified as mil itary representatives, leading cadres and representatives of mass organizations—biographi cal data is available here on only about 60, and most of these are comparatively new arrivals on the national pic ture and comparatively young. Quite a number of those iden tifiable have been transferred recently from important pro vincial posts. Observers here believe the extraordinary number of new faces is an indication that Mr. Mao has, in fact, succeeded in bringing forward “revolution ary successors,” as he sought to do through the Cultural Rev olution, with a large propor tion recruited from the mili tary. It is assumed that the newcomers are individuals who distinguished themselves during the Cultural Revolution and are loyal and malleable followers of Chairman Mao.

1129-> STANDARDIZATION IS AIM OF SYSTEM
There's a cloud no bigger than a space capsule over the boating horizon. It serves as advance notice of an approach ing front in marine technology when most boats, at least in the larger sizes, will have elec tronic equipment built in as standard equipment. Following more than a year of intensive research and de velopment, Chris‐Craft Corpo ration is introducing its inte grated marine electronics sys tem in its 1970 models. Com pany officials claim the system is a breakthrough. Until now, boat dealers or buyers of large cruisers save usually added electronic equip ment as best they could. Units made by different manufactur ers rarely resemble each other. Adequate space for installation at the control station was not always available. The result was a number of units added here and there, sometimes re sembling the back‐of‐the‐store workbench of a neighborhood television repair store. The system, in simple terms, consists of standardized navi gation and communication equipment designed for the boat. Equally important, the boat is designed for that equip ment. Chris‐Craft has taken the most popular units, redesigned them to achieve a standardized appearance and fitted them neatly into consoles. The ap pearance is that of a jetliner flight deck. In larger cruisers, the system consists of an impressive list of equipment: depth sounder, automatic pilot, automatic di rection finder, loud hailer, 150 watt AM radio‐telephone, and VHF‐FM radio‐telephone. Pro vision is made for optional radar. For medium‐sized cruisers, those from 35 feet to 45 feet, the system consists of a depth sounder, loud hailer, and 100‐ watt AM radio‐telephone. Pro vision is made for optional au tomatic pilot and VHF‐FM radio‐telephone. The VHF‐FM radio‐telephone, whether standard or optional, is in anticipation of the day when VHF‐FM will become the universal means of marine com munication. Since new control panels were required, human ‐ factors engineers with background in aerospace worked side by side with electronic experts. An im portant by‐product was that controls were snore convenient ly placed and instruments were easier to read. As an example, steering wheels on the flying bridges tilt out for either stand‐up or sit‐down operation, and awk ward stretching to throttles and gear shifts were eliminated. Other by‐products are less obvious. The various antennae are “tuned” so that they do not interfere with each other, either electronically or phys ically—a frequent problem in boat with many electronic units. Aviation ‐ type gold ‐ plated connectors were incorporated for better protection against corrosion and vibration. Units detach easily and slide out of receptacles for service. “With the advent of solid state circuitry and its high re liability, electronics have be come commonplace aboard cruisers,” said J. J. Rochlis, president of the corporation. They provide added safety and greatly increase the scope and enjoyment of cruising.” In the boating industry, one company watches another, and eventually other companies in troduce their own versions of major advances. The boat buy er is the beneficiary of this competition. The day may not be far off when electronic equipment that comes as standard equipment with a boat will be as common as built‐in radios and tape play ers are in today's automobiles, and Sea Scouts will operate an automatic direction finder as casually as they tie a bowline.

1130-> BEJART'S DANCERS TO BOW IN JANUARY
Maurice Bejart's company from Brussels, the Ballet of the 20th Century (Ballet du XXe Siecle), will make its United States debut as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's 1970–71 Festival of Dance. The subscription series for the festi val will be announced this month. The Bejart company, which is particularly popular with youth ful, audiences in France and other countries on the conti nent, will appear from Jan. 25 through Feb. 14. The repertory, made up of Mr. Mart's chore ography, will include his Sacre du Printemps (Stravinsky), “Messe pour le Temps Presenti” “Bhakti” (Indian folk music), “Nomos Alpha” (Xenakis), “Ac tus Tragicus (Bach) and “Les Vainqueurs” (Wagner and Hindu‐Tibetan music). Mr. Mart, a Frenchman, and Maurice Huisman, director of the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels, formed the theater's resident ballet company in 1960. It has since performed in Latin America, Israel, Canada and Japan.

1131-> TOKYO
A HODGEPODGE of the brash and the fastidious. All the 20th‐century neon and westernization that you notice first glance becomes, at a closer look, a counterpoint to the old and picturesque sights and sounds of every avenue and alley. Sandwiched between two steel‐and‐glass skyscrapers stands an ancient Shinto shrine. The honking of automobile horns alternates with the tinkling of a bicycle bell that the noodle man rings as he peddles his wares. Atter living. here for two years, I've found only two problems insurmountable: the foul acid air, and the pushing ?? of people. Just disregard both, as all Tokyoites do. The rest—an unbelievably rich culture mixed with an eastern western. way of life—is unadulterated pleasure. Tokyo is not one big uniform city, but a cluster of neigh borhoods, each with its own special flavor and surprises. My favorite pastime here is to walk at random—almost any where—for an hour or two. The Ginza—Behind the cold canyon of department stores, in the section betiveen Ginza 4‐chome and 8‐chome, lies'a maze of small streets crisscrossed by smaller alleys, the heart Tokyo's sophistication. By day, the boutiques are filled with chic girls in miniskirts, enlarging their wardrobe& At 5 or 6 P.M., geisha in exquisite kimonos walk by, swiftly but seduc tively on their way to'parties. Asakusa—Among the bustling streets. the ornate. Asa kusa Kannon Temple, where devout worshipers rub them selves with incense from an enormous brazier in the inner courtyard. The avenue of shops that runs between the en trance gateway and the temple, is a good place to buy unusual gifts. Shinjuku—Mobs of people, hippies, and, here and there, transvestites dressed in wigs and kimonos. Tsukiji Fish Market—Furious and photogenic at dawn. Kanda—Converted Japanese‐Victorian mansions overflow ing with books, scrolls and manuscripts, some in English; a paradise for university students and browsers. Akasaka—The glittering jumble of nightclubs. Manos (telephone 584‐3666) and Bibelos (584‐4484) are the current “in” discotheques. Ask the taxi driver to take you to Azabu Juban. From the open‐front shops of this street spill tables of clothing, bar rels of fish, pyramids of vegetables, bins of sticky sweets and crunchy crackers. Walk south off the Juban and you'll come upon narrow lanes where one tiled‐roofed, wooden house crowds upon the next, each with tiny gardens containing a few well tended plants, rocks and goldfish, and bamboo poles hung with the day's laundry. During the summer, festivals held in residential neigh borhoods like Azabu turn the streets into open‐air markets (ennichi). Paper lanterns, sidewalk stalls, costumed parades and swarms of people dressed in colorful cotton kimonos with babies strapped to their backs abound. Elaborate festivals, focusing on religious rites, sacred music and dance, with a lavish procession or quiet Noh drama or tea ceremony, are presented at Tokyo's shrines and Temples. The Tourist Information Center (Kotani Building, 4 Yuraku‐cho 1‐chome, Chiyoda ‐ku, telephone 502‐1461) will tell you the dates and addresses for each month's festivals. The curators of Japan's museums ro tate their treasures sparingly, as if pained them to let their precious works of art outside the basement vaults. But Tokyo's museums are nonetheless excel lent; and, in addition, you may come upon an old couple gazing in solemn rapture at one perfect laquer calligraphy box set out on a velvet cushion. Their admiration is catching. The Tokyo National Museum (Kok uritsu Hakubutsukan) in Ueno Park houses in its cavernous halls the world's finest collection of Japanese art. Next door is the new Gallery of Eastern Antiquities (Toyo Kan Kaikan). The best small museums are: the Okura Shuko‐kan, in front of the Okura Hotel; the Nezu Bijutsukan, in Minato ku; and two museums that also include indoor tea ceremony houses, the Suntory Bijutsukan, adjacent to the Palace Hotel, and the Idemitsu Bijutsukan, on the ninth floor of the Teikoku Gekijo Build ing in Marunouchi. Stately Slow Motion Try to see Gagaku — ancient court music and dance. The dancers, dressed with magnificent elaboration, move a finger or a foot in stately slow motion, while music sounding like breaking matchsticks, muted harpsichords and oriental bagpipes plays on. Ask at the Tourist Information Center about per formances. The plushest Tokyo hotels are the Okura, New Otani, Imperial Palace and Hilton. But my favorites are the mod erately priced Azabu Prince and the Akasaka Prince (about $16 a day for a‐twin room with bath), both cozy and old‐fashioned, with large garden's and outdoor swimming pools. Good inexpensive western accommo dations (which you have to book far in advance) can be found at International House (11‐16 Roppingi 5‐chome, Mina to‐ku), a cultural center with only 40 rooms, none air‐conditioned (single with out shower, $4.85f twin with shower, $9.44); and Asia Center (10‐32’ Akasaka 8‐chome, Mina to‐ku), large but friendly, and not air‐conditioned (single without shower, $3.61; twin with shower, $7.78). A Japanese inn (ryokart) that offers every traditional perfection is Fukuda ya (6 Kioi‐cho, Chiyoda:ku), which costs $20.83 a day for two persons without meals. The Nippon Seinenkan (11 Kasu miga‐Oka, Shinjuku‐ku) has old ‐wordly western and Japanese rooms; none have private baths or air‐conditioning, but are inexpensive ($4.44 a person). The information center will send on request a mimeographed list of reason able western‐and Japanese‐style accom modations in Tokyo, including hotels, ryohans, Y's and youth hostels. Western food is usually disappointing in Japan, so concentrate on Japanese cuisine, served almost invariably with beautiful. simplicity (shibui is the word) by pleasant, courteous people. If it came to a choice between kosher pickles and sushi (raw’ fish dishes), I might have to renounce my New York heritage. In a sushi restaurant, one should traditionally start with tuna (ask for magum, then toro, another variety), proceed, let's say, to Japanese caviar (uni), and then a smooth white fish (calla). Next, Katsuo, red fish that does not exist in the United States, and, again by tradition, finish either with eel (uwagi) or cucumber surrounded by rice wrapped in crisp seaweed (kyurimaki). Your fellow customers may be eating the same fish straight, which then qual ifies as sashimi; and if they are very merry, they've brought their own bottle of whisky with them. Sushi comes dear, for the above meal perhaps $3. The Okura Hotel has some of Tokyo's best Tonkatsu entails slices of excellent pork, breaded and deep‐fried lake all Japanese fried food, it is never greaiy), accompanied by fresh cabbage julienne, rice and miso shiru (soybean paste soup, better than it sounds). Try it at Tama han Tonkatsu (1‐chome, Moto Akasaka, telephone 408‐2628), which has tatami rooms and a patio of polished bamboo trees. Cost: $2.78 a person. Yakitori is skewers of chicken, leeks, mushrooms, chicken livers and/or meatballs, grilled with a thick soy‐based sauce. Tori‐gin Restaurant (5‐chrome Nishi Gina, telephone 571‐3333) is Tokyo's most popular. Each skewer costs 25 cents. Shabu‐shabu is that incomparable beef sliced paper thin, cooked along with vegetables, bean curd and noodles in a soup stock boiling in a pot on your table. The beef is dipped into a spicy sesame oil sauce. (Drink the stock afterward as a soup). At any of the five Zakuro restaurants, the bill will be $4.17 a person. Soba consists of Japanese noodles, green or white, hot or cold, in soup or in, sauce, topped with shrimp tempura if you wish. Try any likely looking soba shoP, or our favorite, which was once an art gallery: Mamiana Sobs, Azabu likurakatamachi 1‐chome, Minato‐ku, telephone 583‐0545. It costs less than $1 there. Tokyo's department stores are intrigu ing, sociologically as well as acquis itively. Try browsing. and buying in the purely Japanese sections—where tea ceremony utensils, kimonos and fans are sold—and in the basement food sections. Department store restaurants provide fine food at low prices and an interesting array of people. Tokyo's most pres tigious stores are Takashimaya and Mit sukoshi, both in Nihombashi. Beware of visiting department stores on Sundays; they are aboslutely chaotic then. Arcades for Shopping For the pure pleasure of spending money, shopping arcades are best. Along with the arcades situated in Tokyo's big hotels, I recommend both branches of the International Arcade, behind the Im perial HOtel, where everything up to thousand‐dollar pearl necklaces are offered. One antique store after another lines the street called 5‐chome, Minami Aoyama. A few blocks away, on Omotes ando Street, is another‐row of tempta tions. The finest shop for folk crafts is Takumi (one block south of Hotel Nik ko); for paper and related itenis, visit Haibara Opposite the Tokyo Department Store). Taxi drivers sometimes panic when they see, a foreigner, becauSe our accents are inscrutable to them. The solution is to have some kind person at Your hotel Write on a piece of paper in Japanese characters the name and address of the place you're going to. Also carry some thing with You that, shows your hotel name in, Japanese, for your return trip. Taxi driVers dO not expect. a tip.

The “station names are written in English and'every thing is well‐organized, clean, quick and fun, except in jam‐packed rush hours.’ Caution: subways discontinue service at about midnight.

1132-> Penn Routs Brown For 10th Victory In Ivy League, 90‐75
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 14 (AP) —Penn scored 12 points mid way through the second half to break open a close game against Brown tonight and cap tured its 10th straight Ivy League basketball game, 90‐75. La Salle turned back Niagara, 101‐90, in the second game. Brown, with a 5–14 won‐lost mark, was in contention through most of the first half as Rusty Tyler had a hot hand from the outside. A long jumper by Tyler brought the Bruins to within 33‐30 with 3:20 left. But the Quakers, 21‐1, ran off 10 straight points and took a 45‐32 half‐time edge. Brown battled back and trailed, 62‐52, with 10 minutes left. Then John Koller and Carl Robbins each scored two field goals as Penn ran off 12 straight points to keep its league record spotless. Bob Morse was high for Penn with 18 points while Arnie Ber man had 24 for Brown followed by Tyler with 20. ??

HOUSTON, Feb. 14 (AP)— With Leonard Hilton anchoring with a 3:59.7 mile, the Univer sity of Houston bettered the world distance medley relay record with a time of 9 min utes 34 seconds tonight in the Astrodome‐Federation national indoor track and field cham pionships. Houston's time erased the mark of 9:44.6 set by Kansas State in Detroit in 1967. Hilton's blazing five trips around the one‐fifth mile track enabled Houston to finish 1.7 seconds ahead of a Villanova team that had led after the opening 880, and 2 seconds in front of a Wisconsin team that had started the final mile with a narrow lead. Hilton took the lead with one‐tenth of a mile to go and was never seriously threatened. Leon Vicenik opened for Houston with a 1:52.2 for the 880.

1135-> L.I.U. to Arm Some Security Guards
The dean of students at Long Island University's main campus in downtown Brooklyn has ordered some security guards to carry guns following the shootings of a student and a neighborhood resident near the university residence hall at 190 Willoughby Street on Fri day night. Dean Eugene Arden said yes terday that he had established “special security measures in the dormitory building,” in cluding a request to the city for additional police attention. “This is an emergency measure in response to an un fortunate situation,” Dean Ar den said. “It is not necessarily permanent.” Campus guards previously had been forbidden by the ad ministration to carry guns, a policy generally supported by the students. 24‐Hour Guard on Campus Dean Arden said that only the two guards assigned to the dormitory would be armed. The campus is guarded 24 hours a day by three shifts, varying between six and nine men a shift. On Friday night William Baumann, a 22‐year‐old grad uate student and dormitory counselor, was attacked by gang of youths as he worked behind the reception desk in the dormitory lobby. When the young man tried to escape by leaping over the desk and running out the door, he was shot in the right hip. While some of the youths held a gun on the unarmed se curity guard, James Askew, others chased Mr. Baumann as he fled toward the west gate of the campus. The student managed to evade his assailants and found safety at Solowey's Restaurant at the corner of DeKalb and Flatbush Avenues near the campus. He was taken to Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn and later transferred to General Hospital in Binghamton, N. Y., where his family lives, He was re ported in good condition last night. A bystander, Pompilo Giovan netti, 49, of 175 Willoughby Street was shot in the fore head by the intruders. He was taken to Long Island College Hospital, where he was re ported to be in good condition. The shots fired at both men were from a.22‐caliber gun, ac cording to the security guards. Neighborhood Tension Policemen and guards gave no reason for the shootings, but some students and a guard said that the incident might have been brought on by ten sions between the school and some members of the predomi nantly black Fort Greene com munity. Mr. Baumann said that he did not know his attackers, nor could he explain their motive. “Unfortunately there's no rap port between the community and school,” he said, adding that there had been incidents on both sides that created bad feelings. Another student., John Hardy, a political science major, said that “racial tension” might have precipitated the incident. “Fellows hanging around Myrtle Avenue see the campus as an appearance of affluency,” he said. “The campus is not part of the community and does not, function in the community,” Mr. Hardy added. Dean Arden denied there was tension between the campus and the community. “We have a number of pro grams,” he said. “There's reading clinic, a speech and hearing clinic which are com munity‐oriented, and three sep arate programs on campus for educational and recreational purposes. “No, I think some hoodlums were at work.”

1136-> Soviet‐Bloc Diplomats, Still in Pnompenh, Are Uneasy
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, May 25—The feeling of instability in this city, which makes air line schedules the foreigner's primary reading matter, is most pronounced among the citizens of the Communist countries. Prince Norodom Sihanouk's neutralist Cambodia was a showcage of the Communist countries, which sent consider able numbers of teachers, tech nicians and advisers in various fields, as well as sizable em bassies. The number of visitors has been sharply reduced since the ouster of Prince Sihanouk in March and Cambodia became more deeply involved in the Indochina war, as dependents and, later, many of the non diplomatic and technical assist ance experts left. Then, after the formation of Prince Si hanouk's exile government in Peking, the Communist coun tries not wholly linked to the Soviet Union broke relations with Pnompenh. For the diplomats and other citizens of the Soviet camp this was the first shoe. They began to look for prospective cus tomers for their stocks of vodka—Polish and Russian— and inquired into the avail ability of seats on the one flight by a Communist airline to stop in Cambodia, a Czecho slovak plane that flies through Pnompenh only on Sundays. That was three weeks ago, however, and to the mounting surprise of the Soviet‐bloc citizens here the other shoe has not fallen. The Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria have kept their embassies open and are making believe that they are doing business as usual although Cambodians hardly ever call anymore. One of the principal subjects of diplomatic conversation dried up today when the doors Of the fortresslike modern structure of the Chinese Em bassy opened to release its Staff. They had been held as hostages for the release of Cambodian diplomats in Com munist China and North Korea. Swiss diplomats worked out the arrangements and the Chi nese, accompanied by the North Korean, North Vietna mese and Vietcong diplomats, left aboard a Swiss charter flight. The plane is expected aback from Peking tomorrow with Cambodian diplomats and stu dents from China and North Korea. Citizens of Soviet‐bloc coun tries are a little embarrassed when Western friends question the firmness of their support of national liberation move ments and point out that not only Communist China, North Korea, North Vietnam, the Vietcong and Albania have broken with Pnompenh and rec ognized the Sihanouk regime but also such mavericks as Cuba and Yugoslavia and such countries as the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Libya, the Su dan, Syria, the Congo (Brazza ville) and Algeria. The premiers of the eight Members of Comecon, the So viet bloc's trade group, led by Aleksei N.

1137-> Bernstein Recalls Joy Of Kennedy Gatherings
Leonard Bernstein saw the Kennedy White House as a place of casualness and maj esty, creativity and joyful lust for life “Utter informality, great readiness to laughter, very quick perception,” were the words the New York con ductor used in recalling so cial evenings with the Ken nedys. In an interview he gave July 21, 1965 for the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library's oral ‐history project, Mr. Bernstein contrasted this mood with the stark formal ity at the White House when be conducted and played the piano at a state dinner given by President Eisenhower. Mr. Bernstein, a heavy smoker, complained that there was no smoking allowed be fore or after the Eisenhower dinner, and that ordinary food and inferior wines were served during the meal. “By the time I got to play, I was a wreck,” he said.

1138-> Hussein Says U.S. Causes Movement Toward Conflict
WASHINGTON, May 3 (AP) —King Hussein of Jordan said today that the Middle East is moving toward a big‐powers conflict because of what he termed United States indiffer ence and a one‐sided policy fa voring Israel. The King appeared in an in terview recorded in Amman last week for the American Broadcasting Company's radio and television program “Issues and Answers.” The young monarch, often described as the most Western oriented Arab leader, said that the United States had let him down in the “present crisis.” He said Jordan had received no Soviet arms as yet but had been considering accepting such aid only as “an alterna tive” in case we are not able to obtain some of the equip ment that we need rather badly now.”

1143-> When You Want Chinese Food at Home
**Jolly Chan's Chinese Kitchen, 1069 First Avenue (at 58th Street), 486–1182. This is the latest in a long line of Chinese kitchens with take‐home foods. It is in the Sutton Place area, and it may very well have the most extensive and best menu of them all. It is the enterprise of Robert Tsang, who owns the well‐regarded Mon Sing restaurant on Mott Street in Chinatown. There are nearly 200 dish es on the carry‐home menu, including such usual things as wonton and egg drop soup and lo mein dishes as well as such unusual fare as clams in black bean sauce, spicy dishes like pepper chicken ding and crabs Cantonese style. The crabs are especially rich with eggs now, and the Jolly Chan chef does admi rable things with them. At times the Jolly Chan offers Chinese buns filled with pork, and they are first rate. By most restaurant stand ards the food is not inexpen sive. Prices range from about $1.50 for a pint of chop suey to $6 for mushroom lobster kow. Representative dishes are in the $3 category. The foods may be ordered and picked up in person, or the food will be delivered (within a 10‐block area) for a 50‐cent service charge. By the way, fortune cookies are available at 30 cents the package. There Is a small counter where no more than three or four customers may dine on the premises. No alcoholic beverages, naturally. Sunday through Thursday the restau ant is open from 11:30 A.M. until midnight; Friday and Saturday, 11:30 A.M. to 2 A.M. *Ida de France, 1540 Sec ond Avenue, (at 80th Street), TR 9–9870. It was late and we were hungry. It was dur ing the taxi strike and it was cold outside and the restau rant was half empty. It was the second time we'd visited Ida de France since it has been linked with the now defunct Hapsburg House. We followed the captain's recommendations on that second visit, and the food came off admirably well. There was a delicate first course of sea food wrapped in a crepe and covered with a light Mornay sauce; an ex ceptionally good and hot water cress soup; a very good venison stew (available only in game season, of course); and tender, well seasoned chicken in a pa prika and cream sauce. The wine, a Gevrey Chambertin, 1964, was good, too, and rea sonably priced. It was a far more aus picious meal than an earlier luncheon that had included a somewhat overcooked quiche Lorraine, shrimp proven??ale, a bit on the tough side, and indifferent veal kidneys sau téed. It must be said that there is a wide gulf between the luncheon and dinner prices. The lunches are inexpensive and a la carte with main courses from about $1.95 to $3. Dinners, considering the fact that Ida de France is not a luxury restaurant, are a bit elevated, with complete meals from about $6.50 to $9. The atmosphere is strictly bistro with its raspberry walls and a clutch of etch ings, paintings, posters and plaster busts. It needs the warmth of flowers and can dlelight. The wine glasses are filled repeatedly, to a too‐full and vulgar level, and the noodles for the venison were served in a small side dish. Cocktails, wines. Closed Christmas Day, Monday and New Year's Day. Most ma jor credit cards are honored.

1144-> GRADUATION HELD FOR COAST GUARD
NEW LONDON, Conn., June 3 — Under Secretary of Trans portation James M. Beggs told the 135 graduating cadets at the Coast Guard Academy to day he saw an expanded role for the Coast Guard in protect ing the environment and de veloping oceanography tech niques. Mr. Beggs told the new en signs and nearly 5,000 guests and underclassmen at the com mencement exercises that the Coast Guard belongs in the De partment of Transportation, un der whose jurisdiction it was placed several years ago. Mr. Beggs, a 1938 graduate of the Naval Academy, noted curriculum at the Coast Guard Academy has been updated in time to meet an expanded role for the service. The curriculum change and a new empha sis was needed, he said, because the country is in “an era of cataclysmic change and this is a change that has come all to suddenly in many sectors of our society . . . the goals and objectives on the last four or five decades are being swept away.” He said he believed the academy and the Coast Guard are changing fast enough to meet the environmental chal lenges to the American coast lines. As an example of how he sees the service moving into larger sphere he noted that two weeks ago President Nixon said the Coast Guard would play major role preventing oil spills along the coastlines such as the one off Santa Barbara, Calif. Only recently, he said, has there been a growing realization about the importance of the oceans in the total environment picture. “There is a wealth to be derived from the sea beds he said but this wealth should be harvested in an orderly man ner.” He admitted that transporta tion represents the chief of fender in the over‐all pollution picture. However, he contended it was also a challenge to the environment which might be defeated if everyone works together to do it. He said there is a growing feeling that “we must back away from our tech nology — that we must simply stop.” He added “this is not my view.” Touching more on the seri ous era of change he said the academy's 84th graduating class was facing a challenge. In the future, he said, Academy graduates will play an increas ing part in new vessel tech nology and developing policy. Also on hand for the cere monies was Adm. Chester R. Bender, who was appointed commandant of the Coast Guard this week. He was par ticipating in one of his first official functions as Coast Guard chief. All but one of the new ensigns will report for duty aboard Coast Guard cutters sta tioned throughout the world.

1145-> Dissidents at Child Conference Rebuffed by White House Aide
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 — Stephen Hess, chairman of the. Seventh White House Confer ence on children, finally said “No” today to increasingly noisy demands from caucuses that there be a full session of all 4,000 delegates to give President Nixon a “mandate” for action. Special to The New York Times This will be the first time since 1909, when Theodore Roosevelt called the first such once‐a‐decade meeting, with out a plenary session. The 1970 conference has been split into 24 forums whose recommendations will be voted on by all delegates Fri day, the closing day. Today, Mr. Hess presented a plan whereby caucuses would be sure to get their proposals of “overriding concern” on those official ballots. His plan was promptly re jected by the dissenting group, who announced rump sessions of their own later tonight in the ballroom of the Sheraton Park’ Hotel, headquarters of the conference. A broader, more unorthodox coalition lumping together old.. line child‐care agencies, new line feminists, blacks, Chicanos, youth and labor said they would hold their rump session tomorrow. In rejecting a plenary meet ing that would allow “only minute or ‘less per speaker” if everybody wanted to comment, Mr. Hess said: “So many other conferences come out of here endorsing motherhood I want something that can be dropped into a hopper on the Hill [Capi tol Hill] and in state legisla tures and brought back into the homes, families and schools. We want victories now.” It Appeared, that the dis agreement was not about ma jor issues, such as the need for universal, quality child day care, but rather about how to voice these issues in the most forceful way. Today at a news conference, Mr. Hess tried to placate the dissenters with a plan proposed by forum chairmen and vice chairmen. “any caucus of dele gates that presents to the con ference headquarters a petition signed by 200 delegates shall be able also to present one rec ommendation of overriding con cern to be placed on the official conference ballot,” he said. He also said that the recommenda tions of all the caucuses would be given directly to President Nixon. “How will ypu present the black caucus paper to the Pres ident?” he was asked, with an intimation might be edited. “As they present it to me, will present it to him,” Mr. Hess replied. But even though mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service were called by the conference staff —in perhaps their first involve ment in a nonlabor controversy —the dissidents rejected the plan.

1146-> Challenge to Election of Rochester's Mayor Depends on 1 Councilman's Vote
ROCHESTER, Jan. 5—Ste phen May finally moved, into the Mayor's third‐floor suite in City Hall today, but the political atmosphere in the city was as chilly as the weather. Mr. May, a 38‐year‐old lawyer and second‐term Coun cilman, had been elected Mayor by his own vote and those of his four fellow Re publicans on the nine‐mem ber City Council at a meeting Friday. But the Democrats, who had had a majority on the Council and therefore the as surance of a Democratic May or since 1962, challenged the legality of Republican Coun cilman Michael W. Roche's election—and thus the right of the new, G.O.P.‐dominated Council to act at all. The raised voices and in dignant words culminated in a brief struggle between Mayor May, as the Republi cans considered him, and Frank T. Lamb, the outgoing Democratic Mayor, who final ly yielded gavel and chair and, this morning, the keys to the Mayor's car and office. Mr. May, a tall, lean man with silver‐flecked dark hair and the shirtsleeves casual ness of politicians of the Kennedy or Lindsay school, was blandly amused in recol lecting the incident as he sat behind a congratulatory flower arrangement in his law office just across Broad Street from City Hall. “He gave me a shove,” he said, referring to Mr. Lamb and smiling. As a Councilman, Mr. May earned $7,500 a year; as Mayor his salary would be double this amount but he could undoubtedly earn more than this as a lawyer. The city is actually run largely by a Coimcil‐appointed city man ager; both parties have agreed on a Republican re placement for the incumbent. Rochester, the state's third largest city, is in many ways an urban prototype. Since 1950 its total population has declined from 320,000 to 290,000, while its black popu lation has increased from about 7,000 to more than 45,000. The city and its suburbs are the center of Monroe County, a bastion of upstate Republican power, and the city itself, despite the shift ing population pattern, is still Republican in terms of voter enrollment. Only twice in re cent history has Rochester been Democratic‐controlled; the first time was during the early New Deal years of the thirties, the second, in 1962 when the time‐for‐a‐change attitude was apparently the Influential factor. That same factor—“the peo ple wanted a change”—was the single outstanding issue in the 1969 campaign, accord ing to Mr. May. But he also ran on a party platform that called for consolidation of city and county services, promised to do something about the city's “terrible housing shortage,” and touched on what Mr. Mays called “the deep concern about safety on the streets” with pledges to strengthen the police force. The hostility between the parties can be heard in the cool dismissal in Mr. May's tone as he comments on the last Council meeting—“I don't think it contributed anything to the dignity of the City Council” — and Mr. May's characterization of the dis pute over Mr. Roche's resi dency as a “phony issue.” Mr. Roche, a 32‐year‐old general science teacher at a junior high, school hi suburban Churchville, is listed in the telephone book and, ac cording to him and his fellow Republicans, on voting rolls, tax returns, Selective Service records and other official documents, as living with his parents at 882 Genesee Park Boulevard in the city. But there is also a house on Ar cher Road in the suburb of Gates‐Chili — “just a place that I had shared with some friends” in Mr. Roche's words. “I've used it irregularly,” Mr. Roche said. “Legally they haven't got a leg to stand on.” Mr. Roche served a term on the city's school board for which the same residence requirements are set as for Council eligibility. The dispute has had its ad vantages for him: “I'm be coming the Spiro Agnew” of Rochester, he said. “A house hold word.” Late today, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled against the Dem ocrats. The Democrats say they intend to carry the legal proceedings further, but even if a higher court ultimately decides against Mr. Roche, Mr. Lamb said today he ex pected the Council to re main under Republican con trol, since the City Charter provides that a vacant seat shall be filled by a member of the same party. This assertion is used by Mr. Lamb to bolster his conten tion that the actions of the Democrats derive from their concern for principle, not power. Mr. Lamb, a stocky, white haired man of 47, with a Shriner's emblem in his lapel and a tie clip with the Vice President's seal — “Hubert gave it to me”—was mild and subdued in tone today. For many years membership director of he Rochester Y. M. C. A., he is now vice president and secretary of an oil‐prospecting concern. Mr. Lamb, a Councilman for 12 years and Mayor since 1964, said the hot tempers and gavel grappling of the last Council session were now “yesterday's mashed po tatoes.” Of Mr. May, he said, “I don't intend to interfere with Mr. May if he wishes to conduct himself as Mayor. I intend to cooperate.” Mr. Lamb and Mr. May were in agreement that a crucial, possibly deciding factor in the November elec tion was a low voter turnout. At the beadquarters of FIGHT, the predominantly black community organiza tion established by Saul Alin sky following the 1964 riots, this voter apathy was seen as a good thing. For the city's blacks and Puerto Ricans, according to Bernard Gifford, the presi dent of FIGHT, both major parties were the same, just “ the white party.” From this vantage point, if was a “great show of sophistication” by blacks to refrain from voting, he said. FIGHT is an acronym for Freedom, Independence, God, Honor, Today. Snow, already piled high on Rochester's streets and frosting its icicle ‐ fringed roofs, began to fall again late this afternoon. That was just about the time Mr. May moved into the office with a chrome‐and‐glass door that still said, “Office of the Mayor Frank T. Lamb.” Just down the hall of the grimy fieldstone building is the Council chamber where pictures of past Mayors hang crookedly on walls whose dusty‐rose paint is peeling in patches. The brass plaque in front of the carved and orna mented mayor's chair now read “May” and the “Lamb” plaque had been shifted to a councilman's seat.

1147-> HULL GETS 500TH AS RANGERS LOSE
reer with the Montreal Canad iens. Hull, who is 31, has produced his 500 goals in less than 13 seasons, but his opportunity to surpass Howe's eventual total will depend on his desire to extend his career. He often has threatened to retire. The most remarkable aspect of Hull's goal output this sea son is that he missed the first 14 games of the schedule be cause of a contract dispute. But with 28 goals, he trails the league leader, Stan Mikita, his teammate, by only five. Ironically, the Rangers' two early goals were scored by the right wings for whom Hull was responsible for checking at the time—Stewart and Nevin. Stewart shoved in his ninth goal of the Season, and the 500th point of his N.H.L. ca reer, midway in the first pe riod. Early, in the second pe riod, Nevin drilled a low angled 30‐foot shot past Tony Esposito, the Black Hawks goaltender, on a breakaway pass from Don Marshall. But following a holding penalty to Allan Hamilton, the Rangers' young defenseman, the Hulls revived the Hawks. Bobby registered his first goal on a tip‐in of Doug Mohns's long shot on a power play. Less than two minutes later, Dennis Hull flicked a short shot past Eddie Giacomin, the Ranger goaltender, after clever pass from Mikita. Not long after that, Bobby Hull swatted a rebound past Giacomin for his historic goal, prompting a two‐minute ova tion from his 18,000 idolators in the Chicago stadium. In the final period, Martin provided the Hawks with their clinching goal. Meanwhile, the Rangers were unable to reorganize the attack that had strafed Esposito with 15 shots in the opening period as Giacomin's lead on the Black Hawk rookie for the Vezina Trophy was narrowed to only 2 goals. Brad Park, who incurred a fractured right ankle during Thursday night's game in De troit, will be lost to the Rang ers for the remainder of the N.H.L. season and perhaps for their Stanley Cup playoff games. “He'll be out six to eight weeks,” Emile Francis, the gen eral manager‐coach of the Rangers, said after a telephone conversation today with Dr. Kazuo Yanigasawa, the team orthopedic specialist. “But at least it's a clean break. No operation will be necessary. Six weeks remain in the N.H.L. schedule. After that Park's return would depend on how long the Rangers remain in contention during the post‐sea son playoffs. X‐rays of Park's injury, which the 21‐year‐old defenseman took to New York with him yes terday, were examined at St. Clare's Hospital by Dr. Yani gasawa. “The fracture is in the back of the ankle above the heel,” Francis said. “Brad was com plaining that the cast was too tight, so the doctor shortened it from the mid‐calf to nearer the ankle. But there is also liga ment and tendon damage in there, and that will take time to heal.” Park was discharged from the hospital and returned to the apartment he shares with a teammate, Bill Fairbairn, in Long Beach, L. I. The injury occurred early in the 3‐3 tie with the Red Wings when Park's right skate blade caught in the white wooden boards behind the Red Wing net as he scrambled for the puck along with Carl Brewer, a Detroit defenseman. Francis, meanwhile, filled Park's spot on the Ranger ros ter by recalling Mike Robi taille, a 22‐year‐old defense man from the Omaha Knights, a Central Hockey League farm team. Robitaille, the leading point scorer among defensemen in the C.H.L. with 10 goals and 40 assists, was inspected by Francis last night as the Knights widened their first‐ place lead to 6 points with a 3‐1 victory over Waterloo, Iowa. Tomorrow night, the Rangers return to Madison Square Gar den against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Bruins come to ehi cago for an afternoon game that will be televised in the New York area on Channel 2 at 2 P.M. (New York time). ??

1152-> Reasons for Panther Wiretap Challenged in Pre‐Trial Hearing
A Brooklyn assistant District Attorney and a Brooklyn de tective were sharply questioned yesterday by lawyers for 13 Black Panthers accused of plot ting to bomb public places. The two officials had been called by the lawyers to testify at a pre‐trial motion of the de fendants seeking dismissal of their indictment on the ground that it is based on information gathered illegally through wire taps by the police in Brooklyn. Affidavits sworn to by the detective and prepared by the assistant District Attorney were submitted in support of applica tions for court orders granting permission to tap the telephone of Fred Richardson, a co‐de fendant with the 13 and others. Richardson is not a participant in the current hearings, having disappeared while out on bail. In the pre‐trial hearings be fore State Supreme Court Jus tice John M. Murtagh, lawyers for the defense sought to show that information given in the affidavits had been obtained from an unreliable informant and had been based‐on mis interpretation of innocent con versations. The witnesses, Detective An gelo Viola and Assistant Dis trict Attorney John A. Cianci, conceded that their informant, Sean Dubonnet, had a long his tory of mental illness and an extensive arrest record, and used numerous aliases. They also conceded that some of the information Du bonnet gave them turned out to be false. Both officials, however, clung to their interpretation of a conversation between Rich ardson and Stokely Carmi chael, former prime minister of the Black Panther party, as be ing evidence of a conspiracy. A transcript of the conver sation was introduced yester day at the request of the de fendants. During the conversation, monitored Dec. 1, 1968, Rich ardson, then deputy minister of information for the New York branch of the party was asked by Mr. Carmichael what the New York Panthers were doing. Richardson replied, “Noth ing,” and Mr. Carmichael said, “That's cool.” Richardson continued, “We have a retreat going,” to which Mr. Carmichael respond ed, “It's time to do a little freezing for a while,” and Richardson said, “Yeah, up un til Dec. 21,” to which Carmi chael replied, “That's good.” “In your Opinion,” asked Gerald Lefcourt, defense law yer, of Detective Viola, “Is that a conversation about ar son, murder, killing?” “In my opinion, yes,” Mr. Viola replied. He made no fur ther expatriation of this opin ion, nor did he explain the sig nificance of the Dec. 21 date.

1153-> White House Asks Rise of $65‐Million For Veterans' Care
WASHINGTON, April 2— President Nixon asked Congress today for a $65‐million increase in the Veterans Administra tion's budget for health care to expand medical programs for the increasing number of Vietnam veterans. Both the President's message and various Administration spokesmen placed heavy em phasis on the need for improved services in two major areas: dental care, to which all vet erans of the Vietnam war pe riod are entitled in the year after separation from the mili tary, and care for the growing number of veterans with mul tiple amputations and injuries to the spinal cord. According to a separate statement from the Veterans Administration, however, very little of the initial funds under the program would be spent on staffing for spinal cord in juries. The bulk would be re served for dental fees and drugs. The $65‐million would con sist of an additional appropria tion of $15‐million for the rest of the current fiscal year, and an additional $50‐million ap propriation beyond the Presi dent's original budget request for the fiscal year 1971, which begins July 1. “These requests,” the Presi dent said, “will enable the V.A. to improve medical care for all eligible veterans, particularly for those suffering from battle injuries. The Veterans Administration statement dealt only with the first $15‐million, but it seemed clear that what Mr. Nixon had described as “battle injuries” also included an enormous amount of dental care. Of the 50 states that will receive addi tional grants in the fiscal year 1970, 45 will receive no funds for “spinal cord” injuries but all will receive money for drugs and dental care. Mr. Nixon's statement point ed out, however, that the cost of drugs had ris:m greatly and that an “exccsssive beatlog” in dental claims had developed. Other ?? ?? ?? a larger percentage of the funds to be appropriated next year would‐ be used to operate and improve centers for treatment of amputations and spinal cord injury. The 1971 Veterans Adminis tration budget request, already submitted to Congress to which the $50‐million would be added, totals $1.7‐billion. The President credited Don ald E. Johnson, Administrator of Veterans Affairs, with un dertaking a nine‐month review and discovering deficiencies in the capacity of the agency's medical program to meet pres ent and future needs. Mr. Nixon's message noted that the annual rate of dis charge from the service rose from 531,000 in 1965 to 958, fl00 in 1969. In 1970 and 1971, he said the rate will climb well above a million.

1154-> From the Sports Editor's Mailbox
TO THE EDITOR: The refusal of the South Afri can Government to grant a visa to Arthur Ashe is a violation of one of the basic tenets of sports and should not be passed over. What is more disconcerting than the action itself is the lack of action on the part of Ashe's colleagues in the tennis world. South Africa must be taught that its policy of apartheid is unacceptable to the rest of the world. Perhaps the South Afri cans were afraid to let their people see that a black man is not necessarily inferior to white man. This cannot be tol erated. Gary Player comes to the United States and makes $100, 000 on the golf tour. Yet Amer ica's top tennis player is not even allowed to enter South Africa. Action to counter this situation is imperative. The other players on the tennis tour should wash the green color of money from their eyes and boy cott the South African tourna ments. The American players owe it to Ashe to take some action; words are not enough. If they do decide to partici pate, perhaps a symbolic pro test during the awards cere monies, can be effective. This action by South Africa should lead to its exclusion as a nation from international sports events. MICHAEL YOUNG Plainview, N. Y. TO THE EDITOR: I would like your readers to consider the hypocritical situation into which the admin istrators of world sport get themselves once they accede to political pressures. Rhodesia is a small country which has for many years been a member in good standing of the world's sporting bodies. In selecting our international teams merit is the only criterion and especially in athletics and football (in which black Rho desians excel) our teams tend to be composed of black sports men. For the last four years be cause of our dispute with Brit ain, some countries refused to accept our teams' Rhodesian travel documents, other coun tries have refused to play us through sheer political spite or because they confuse us with South Africa. Some examples might be of Interest: (a) Our Olympic team (pre dominantly black) was advised at the last moment by the Gov ernment of Mexico that they would not be permitted entry on Rhodesian passports. The irony was that the whites in the team could get other travel documents but the black Rho desian could not; quite correctly our Olympic Committee refused to let a “whites only” team travel to Mexico. (b) In the World Cup foot ball competition, Rhodesia was drawn to play against Japan, Australia and South Korea at Seoul. The South Korean Gov ernment and subsequently the Japanese and Australian Gov ernments refused to admit our multi‐racial team. Fortunately the world body (F.I.F.A) took a firm stand and the series was held in neutral Mozambique, where our,Rhodesian team was narrowly defeated by Australia, which went through to the next round. Israel, due to play the win ner, priggishly announced in advance that she would not play against Rhodesia's multi‐racial team. Ironically, Israel subse quently complained to F.I.F.A. because Morocco announced it would not play against Israel if Israel defeated Australia! (c) Now I read of an Ameri can proposal to ban Rhodesia from Davis Cup competitons apparently on the sole grounds that South Africa is our neigh bor. (I'm sure Arthur Ashe would be welcomed here but to the politically minded his visit would be very dull and of inter est only to tennis enthusiasts.) (d) On Jan. 29, 1970, Rhode sia had to resign from the Inter national Weight‐Lifting Federa tion because it had competed against the South African Amateur Weight‐Lifting Union, which was under suspension. As our team is not accepted (be cause of passports) in other countries, if it wants any inter national competition it must compete with South Africa. At the moment South African teams are allowed by their Gov ernment to visit Rhodesia and play against our racially mixed teams although the converse is not true. If Rhodesia is excluded from world competition for ill‐con sidered reasons, inevitably and reluctantly it will have to intro duce apartheid into sport so as to play its only international competitor, South Africa. Is this the intention of the American proposal to the Davis Cup Committee? It will cer tainly have that result. H. L. RYAN P.O. Box 235 Salisbury, South Rhodesia TO THE EDITOR: In the Jan. 20 Times, in an article on the Clay ‐ Marciano staged fight, you referred to them as “the fight game's only two undefeated heavyweight champions.” Gene Tunney re tired undefeated.

1155-> GRAND PRIX GETS I.L. T. F. BACKING
Amid much pomp in London, the International Lawn Tennis Federation authorized yester day an experimental Grand Prix circuit of 18 men's tourna ments this year, including the Wimbledon and United States Open championships. Minutes after the announce ment two potential contribu tors, World Championship Tennis and the National Tennis League, said their 24 profes sional players would not par ticipate in the series. Another group figuring heavily in the plans, the United States Lawn Tennis Associa tion, remained noncommital and said it would not jeopardize the success of its open tourna ments for the sake of the Grand Prix. Ben Barnett of Australia, president of the I. L. T. F., said the Grand Prix would offer about $120,000 in prize money through a bonus pool. The turnaments will contribute at least 10 per cent of their total adverised prize money to the pool, with points awarded to players for performances at each event. At the end of the series the player with the most points wins 16 per cent of the pool, the runner up 12 and the third player 10. Barnett said the series was open to all players. Apart from expenses to amateurs, he said, no payments will be made to competitors or corporations, a rule that probably will elimi nate the two promoter groups. “Our players are already scheduled for 1970, and 90 per cent of the tournaments in which they are entered are not on the Grand Prix circuit,” Mike Davies, executive director of World Championship Tennis, said from Dallas. World Championship Tennis has 18 players under contract, led by John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Tom Okker and Earl (Butch) Buchholz. Fred Podesta, president of the N.T.L., said his group had “no commitments” for any Grand Prix events. Six men are under contract to the N.T.L., including Rod Laver, Richard (Pancho) Gonzales and Roy Emerson. If the two pro groups bypass the Grand Prix, the talent for the series must come from the independent pros, among whom are Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe, Ilie Nastase and other Ameri can and European players. Alastair B. Martin, president of the U.S.L.T.A., said the Unit ed States Open would join the Grand Prix “if it does not jeopardize having the promoter groups in our events.” “The primary responsibility for the U.S.L.T.A., he added, “is to provide the best possible players for the public.” The U.S.L.T.A. is attempting to negotiate a contract with the promoter groups to avoid a pro boycott of the Open at Forest Hills, Queens. ??

1156-> U.S. Says 201 G.I.'s Have Died In 25 Days of Cambodia Drive
SAIGON, South Vietnam, May 25 (AP) — The United States command reported to day that American battlefield deaths had reached 201 in 25 days of operations in Cam bodia. The command said that 756 Americans had been wounded. South Vietnamese losses have been put at more than 600 killed and more than 2000 wounded. The allies report 9000 enemy soldiers dead. Scattered action was report ed from Cambodia today. South Vietnamese paratroopers were said to be engaged in sharp fighting 10 miles inside Cam bodia and a United States in fantry company was reported ambushed by the enemy far ther south along the border. The South Vietnamese were fighting near Route 7, east of the rubber plantation town of Memot, which is 20 miles east of the Chup plantation, seized Saturday by a South Viet namese task force. Enemy gunfire prevented American helicopters from evacuating wounded paratroopers from the area for several hours. South Vietnamese casualties were described as light to mod erate. There was no immediate count of enemy losses. The American company was ambushed, according to field reports, during a reconnais sance mission on a jungle trial half a mile inside Cambodia and 35 miles northwest of the South Vietnamese city of Tay ninh. Two Americans were reported killed and 10 wounded. Fighter bombers, artillery and rocket firing helicopters pounded enemy positions on two sides of the company, but enemy losses were not known. United States forces sweep ing Cambodian jungles reported finding more big enemy stock piles of munitions, food and medical supplies in areas 80 to 100 miles north of Saigon. One cache, discovered by the United States 25th Infantry Di vision, was said to have yielded 24 tons of rice and nearly a ton of medical supplies, in cluding medicines, bandages; surgical instruments and sheets. The equipment was stored in 100‐pound packs in under ground bunkers, the officers said. U.S. soldiers, searching an enemy storage area spotted from the air, reported finding a 2½‐ton truck, 15 mortar tubes, 4 recoilless rifles, 15 heavy and light machine guns and large quantities of rockets and mortar and small arms ammunition. Special to The New York Times SAIGON, May 25 — Offi cial sources said today that there had been a marked decline in enemy firepower in South Vietnam since the seizure of substantial Com munist supply caches in Cam bodia. They said that the average enemy shell attack now con sisted of five, or six artillery or mortar shells instead of 10 or 12, showing, they said, that the enemy was being forced to conserve munitions. The sources, knowledgeable officials who refused to be identified, also said that the al lied drive had forced the Ninth and Seventh North Vietnamese Vietcong Divisions out of their traditional strongholds in Tay ninh Province and over the bor der into Cambodia. PNOMPENH, Cambodia, May 25 (Agence France‐Presse) Reliable reports here today said that 2,000 North Vietnam ese soldiers had seized control of Cambodia's third largest rubber plantation, Prekkak, killing dozens of militiamen who tried to stop them.

1157-> MARAVICH SCORES 69 POINTS IN LOSS
before fouling out in the final, minutes. Maravich sank 26 baskets and connected on 17 of 21 free throws to break his own record of 66 points for an S.E.C. player set against Tulane, a nonconference rival, last sea son. He was charged with a tech nical foul in the first half, as was his father, Coach Press Maravich, late in the game. Danny Hester, L.S.U.'s second loading scorer, was thrown out of the game in the first half for striking an Alabama player. Alabama overcame an early 21‐16 deficit to take a 44‐40 half‐time lead. The lead changed hands several times in the second half before Holion led the Crimson Tide's surge. Coach Maravich would not let reporters talk to his son after the game, but said the younger Maravich had been hit on the hack by the fan he was pursuing before being ‐ re strained.

1158-> Johnson Saga in Sea Racing
The late Robert F. Johnson, Oregon lumber and housing development millionaire, pre ferred to talk about racing his two 73‐foot ketches in long‐distance ocean races than about business. He was the first to concede he had little chance of win ning arrace on corrected time with either Ticonderoga or Wiridtvard Passage. What he was after, he reiterated, was the elapsed‐time record or, failing that, to be first to fin ish in the races he entered. The record books prove he accomplished these desires many times after acquiring Big Ti in 1963 and launching Windward Passage in No vember, 1968. On the sunny, warm mom ink: of last Nov. 15 at the Mexican resort town of La Paz, Mark Johnson, 31 years‐ old and skippering the big ketch for the first time with out his father on board, brought the Alan Gurney designed Passage across the line as first yacht to finish the 960‐mile race from Long Beach, Calif. His arch racing rival, Ken De Meuse's 73‐foot ketch Blackfin, was 1 hour 9 min utes behind. This was a repeat of the actual finishing order at Honolulu in last July's trans Pacific race, though De Meuse was declared the elapsed‐time winner and record‐setter following a pro test over a starting‐line inci dent that lopped two hours off Passage's elapsed time. The Long Beach‐to‐La Paz biennial was to have inaugu rated a four‐year worldwide racing schedule for Wind ward Passage, which Bob Johnson had completed sev eral days before he died of a heart attack on Sept. 19. Toasts were being drunk at a family gathering in Ross, Calif., to the famed racing skipper as godfather of a friend's new baby when he collapsed. He was 57 years old. A heart attack two years previously had caused John son‐ to start quietly putting his affairs in order. The owner of record of the new John son plywood racer was his older son Mark. He and his brother, Fritz, 22, shared their father's enthusiasm for ocean racing, crewing as often as possible. Mark and his father had worked together on that four‐year racing schedule. The 1971 and 1973 Transpacs and the 1970 Tahiti race, all sponsored by the Transpa cific Yacht Club, were not included. The big, quiet‐voiced rac ing skipper enjoyed being part of the biennial race from San Pedro to Honolulu. “I love Hawaii and the people,” he ‐declared. On the West Coast, he raced under the J..ahaina, (Maui) Yacht Club burgee, though he flew the New York Yacht Club burgee when rac ing on the East Coast. Alan Gurney had designed the new broad‐beamed racer with the Transpac in mind. II was Bob's great desire to lower his own elapsed‐time record, set with Big Ti in '65. He said he had no quarrel with the race committee rul ing, which deprived him, offi cially, of the record. It was based on Transpac rules. His ire was directed at a special rule that stated: “In case of a sustained pro test, the guilty yacht may... be penalized by having her elapsed time lengthened by not less than two hours or by disqualification.” Declared Johnson: “An elapsed time is a fact which cannot be altered, whereas corrected time is an arbi trary, man‐made figure sub ject to man‐made decisions.” In all, the lumber executive had raced in eight events sponsored by the Transpacific Yacht Club, seven Transpacs and the 1964 Tahiti. It all started when, as a lark, he entered his newly acquired yacht, the Groote Beer, Nazi Hermann Goering's former toy, in the '57 Transpac. “We were so slow, nobody realized we were in that race,” he recalled with a grin as he sat on the Ilikai Hotel terrace last July. The Groote Beer was next to last in a fleet of 40. The next boat was Zia, a 73‐ footer of Bill Garden design that he had had built by Ditmar‐Donaldson In Sah Pedro. He raced her in the '59 and '61 dashes to Hono lulu, doing better than the first time, but nothing spec tacular. After cruising the South Pacific, he started looking for a boat for the '63 race. Ticon deroga, skippered by William Brittain, had finished second behind Howard Ahmanson's 83‐foot Sirius II two years before. “When I saw her,” Bob said, “I fell in love with her.” He chartered the Herre shoff‐designed wood‐hulled ketch for the race. In mid Pacific, he radioed Brittain an offer to buy the boat for $50,000 “as is, where is.” As the graceful yacht swept across the Diamond Head line first to finish, Johnson was owner‐skipper. It was the start of a short but spectacular racing ca reer. During the next six years, according to Chip Cleary of Newport Beach, Calif., who had raced with Johnson as watch captain since 1964, “he established more records for long ocean races in the shortest period of time of any other man in United States yachting his tory.” A hundred thousand dol Jars went into refurbishing Big Ti, “bringing her up to her racing lines,” in John son's words.

1161-> EAGLES USE ZONE TO OVERTAKE RAMS
When you can win, you don't need a lot of fans in the audi ence, and Boston College had few rooters among the father and‐son day crowd of 3,016 at Fordham yesterday, but they defeated the Rams. 71‐68. Even the Rev. Michael P. Walsh, S.J., formerly president of Boston College, turned against the visitors and roused the home forces of Fordham, where he is now president, to “Pluck the Eagles” in his pre game speech. However, Jim O'Brien, a for mer all‐city selection at St. Francis Prep in Brooklyn, feel ing perfectly at home with seven members of his family rooting for him from the stands scored a career high 29 points to lead Boston College to its eighth victory in 18 games. “Only my married sister Kathleen couldn't make it to the game, and I also had a lot of friends in the audience,” said O'Brien, a junior at Boston College and the second oldest of seven children. O'Brien's father, Jim Sr., mother, Katherine, brothers Matt and Jeff, 17‐yearild twins, Michael 15, and sisters Eileen 18, and Colleen 11, saw him score 19 of his points in the first half, and also contrib ute a game‐high 11 assists to the Eagles winning effort. Fordham, which suffered its 11th defeat in 20 games, was led in scoring by Charlie Yelver ton with 22 points, one short of his career high. John Zanzalari was second high scorer for the Rams with 14 points, 8 of them in the second half when he was 4‐for‐4 from the field. Boston College now leads the series between the schools, 7 games to 6, and the Eagles have won the last two. ??

1162-> Court Abuse of Migrants Charged in South Jersey
BRIDGETON, N. J., Aug 16 —Antipoverty lawyers have charged that hundreds of mi gratory farm workers have been jailed in southern New Jersey this summer without ever seeing a judge. They also have charged that Gloucester County jail officials refused to let them counsel migrants jailed there. Max Rothman, the director of the farm worker division of the Camden Regional Legal Services, a federally funded antipoverty agency that is pro viding free legal services to mi gratory farm workers here charged last week that many black and Puerto Rican mi grants were being arrested and jailed without ever formally ap pearing before a judge and without benefit of legal counsel. In some arrests Mr. Roth man contended either munici pal clerks or local policemen fixed the amount of bail at fig ures that migrants rarely can afford. Migrant workers say they often do not know why they were arrested. For example Aldino Jesus, 42‐year‐old Puerto Rican work ing at the Alfred deBela Farm in Swedesboro said he was picked up on trespassing charg es on a highway here two months ‘ago and spent eight days in jail. “I still do not know why they arrest me—they never tell me,” Mr. Jesus said. Asusicion Mendoza a 17‐year‐old migrant said Puerto Ricans were constantly living in fear of arrest and jailing. “It's very bad,” he said “If you don't do what the farmer says, if you cause any trouble, he call the police and you get arrested. Don't tell me about justice here There is no justice for Puerto Ricans.” State Attorney General George F. Kugler Jr. said that he would conduct an inquiry into the lawyers’ charges once they are presented formally to him. “I'm not saying there are no abuses,” Mr. Kugler said but added that the problem of ob taining justice for poor persons was a problem everywhere in the United States. Mr. Kugler also said that the law did not require that poor persons arrested for minor crimes be given counsel or ad vised of their rights. Mr. Rothman and his staff lawyers charged that a number of farmers were intimidating their migrant workers by threatening them with arrest and jailing on the slightest pre text such as in cases where migrants dispute their wages or criticize the conditions in the camps where they live. Farmers here in Cumberland County and in nearby Salem and Gloucester Counties gener ally control the municipal gov erning bodies where they live, Mr. Rothman asserted. This control gives them correspond ing control over the local police and sympathetic treatment from the state police that pa trol South Jersey's rural high ways he added. The charges followed reports by antipoverty officials that farmers were using threats and intimidation to prevent them from going into the hundreds of migrant labor camps in South Jersey to assist the thou sands of migrants who come from Puerto Rico or follow the harvest up the Atlantic sea board every summer. Conditions in Dispute The State Migrant Labor Bu reau in Trenton has reported that conditions in New Jersey's 1,200 migrant camps are good. However, some local health church civil rights and anti poverty officials contend that squalor and deprivation in some places rival the conditions that former Gov. Richard J. Hughes described three years ago as “inhuman.” Mrs. Irene Smith, the presi dent of the New Jersey Confer ence of the National Associa tion for the Advancement of Colored People described the reported arrests and jailings of migrants as the “same tactic used by Southern plantation owners to keep their slaves in line.” The contending versions of migrant conditions has prompt ed Charles Serraino the State Commissioner of Labor and In dustry to open an investiga tion. In an interview at his divi gional offices here in a convert ed frame house near the Cum berland County Courthouse Mr. Rothman and his aides outlined their work with migrants and released files of their cases in which they charged the consti tutional rights of migrants were violated by local police and court practices. In a written protest to Stan ley Van Nes the state public defender Mr. Rothman charged that large numbers of migrant workers were being systemati cally deprived of their civil rights and thrown into various local jails on the most minor charges. He said that the num ber of people deprived of their rights and jailed was in the hundreds but added that he had no precise statistics. In reply Richard A Walsh the deputy state public defend er acknowledged widespread local practices that were de priving migrants of due process of law. “It's not right it's unjust and we know it but that's the way the system works down there,” he said. Mr. Walsh said that Edward B. McConnell, the administra tive head of the New Jersey court system and Superior Court Judge Herbert Horn, the presiding justice here had is sued orders after a series of conferences with local munici pal officials that every person charged with a serious crime rust be advised of his right to remain silent and his right to free legal counsel when he first appears before a magistrate or judge. Help in Serious Cases Under state law the state public defenders are required to provide free legal counsel to any indigent accused of any se rious crime. However the law foes not require that anyone acing a less serious charge such as drunkenness disorderly conduct or a motor vehicle vio lation, be advised of his rights or be given free counsel. In fact Mr. Kugler noted that the United States Supreme Court had ruled that a person must be facing at least six months in jail before he quali fies for all the constitutional protections relating to criminal cases. Federal court decisions have required that a person cannot be kept in jail for more than 48 hours without appearing before a magistrate or a judge. Ac cording to Mr. Rothman and his aides, these requirements are rarely met for migrants here. Mr. Rothman's division is re quired to restrict its services to civil matters and to lesser crim inal cases that do not qualify for public defender attention. This requirement thus has in terjected his division into the jailing and hearings of the ma jority of migrants arrested here. Many cases involve com plaints by farmers against the migrants and police arrests of migrants on disorderly conduct charges and in motor vehicle incidents. The problems of the Puerto Ricans are compounded Mr. Rothman said, because they rarely can speak English and thus never actually know for what they are arrested. Other Causes for Action Camden Regional Legal Serv ices is also permitted to involve itself whenever a “significant community interest” is apparent and whenever indigent defend ants are allegedly being denied their constitutional guarantees, regardless of the seriousness of the crime involved. “You just simply wouldn't believe some of the things that have happened here,” said Christian B. Peper Jr., who was a Peace Corps worker in Latin America, as was Mr. Rothman. He said that county jail offi cials here and in nearby Salem were cooperating in allowing them to interview migrant workers to determine whether they require counsel but that when he went on Monday to see a specific prisoner at the Gloucester County Jail the “guard there said 1 could not go in ‘because of orders up front and slammed the door in my face.” Warden Theodore Damask of the Gloucester County Jail said legal service attorneys would still not be allowed in unless the court permitted it and un less a specific prisoner request ed them. In practice however few migrants are aware that such counsel is available to them. As examples of the jailings and court practices, Mr. Roth man and Mr. Peper recalled sev eral cases. In one, Enrique Rod riguez Casser, a 17‐year‐old Puerto Rican migrant went back one day to a migrant camp to pick up some back wages, which he said were owed him The youth was arrested on a complaint by he farmer who charged him with stealing. The youth was incarcerated in Paulsboro Jail for three weeks before his case came to light through friends. He was sexually assaulted in jail, Mr. Rothman said. When the youth finally appeared before East Greenwich Magistrate Edward R. Claisz, the judge dismissed the case because the farmer lever issued a formal com plaint. Risk of Arguing But according to antipoverty lawyers the lesson was not lost on the Casser youth or other Puerto Rican migrants. To dis pute a farmer they feel is to risk his phoning the polce and to face arrest on charges they can rarely dispute. According to Mr. Rothman arrested migrants are usually taken to a municipal hall or a police barracks where the clerk or a police officer shows him the complaint against him and in some cases fixes the bail in the absence of a magistrate. Because local courts meet in frequently and most migrants rarely can post even the most modest bail they are jailed un til the court meets next, which may be for as long as two weeks. When arrested on similar charges, the local residents gen erally are released without bail, Mr. Rothman said. Held for 3 Months In one case involving a rob bery charge, Mr. Rothman said two black migrants were ar rested last Sept. 8 and were not allowed to request legal counsel from the public defender until Sept. 19. The two then did not see a public defender until Oct. 15 and they were released by a county judge here Dec. 8 only because he was clearing out some of the jails for Christmas. At no time said Mr. Roth man were the two given a pre liminary hearing, as required by law. Another Puerto Rican, Miguel Pacheco, 21, was arrested and jailed on July 4 last year on charges of drunkenness and driving someone else's car His case was not heard until Dec. 19. He was given a six‐month sentence, but received credit for the time he had been in jail awaiting trial. Last April 19, he was again in a car that was stopped by state policeman and arrested because the driver had a 6‐inch knife. According to Mr. Rothman Mr. Pacheco was jailed for an other 12 days without seeing lawyer or being advised of hie rights. The case was dismissed.

1164-> A ‘Terrified’ June A llyson Wins Plaudits as Star of ‘Forty Carats’
“I was terrified. From the first curtain to the last, I was terrified.” June Allyson had reason to be frightened last night. For the first time in 27 years the movie star was back on a Broadway stage before a live audience. Moreover, she was replac ing one of the theater's favorite stars, Julie Harris, in the lead of the comedy hit, “Forty Carats.” As she accepted congratula tions in a flower‐littered dress ing room at the Morosco Thea ter, after listening to loud ap plause and some “Bravos” from the audience, Abe Burrows, the director, who had sat through the performance, remarked: “I never worry. What could happen? So the curtain comes down.” In a purple outfit, one of several she wears during the play, Miss Allyson talked around a hairdresser, who was trying to arrange her appear ance for photographers. Until three weeks ago, she said, she had no idea she would be approached for the role of the middle‐aged divorcée who falls in love with a man about half her age. She was visiting friends in Oregon when David Merrick, the producer, phoned her to offer the part. She ac cept it and received the script by air mail. Until 7 P.M. yesterday, an hour and a half before curtain time, she was still rehearsing. And there was considerable nervousness all around. Miss Allyson is a bit plumper than she was during the forties and fifties, when her portrayals of the girl‐next‐door type made her one of the major attrac tions at movie houses. She chuckled about the prob lem of learning to swear for this show: “In all my years in movies never had to swear.” She turned on the wide smile and candid blue eyes that made her the natural heroine for Van Johnson. “So when I had to use some bad language in this I was whispering during rehearsals. They finally made me speak up on those words. I guess I've entered a new career.” Mr. Merrick embraced her, I while Mr. Burrows extolled her performance. Mr. Merrick, asked for com ment, said: “I don't speak to New York Times writers.”

1165-> CORNELL SIX GAINS 17TH VICTORY IN ROW
ITHACA, N. Y., Feb. 7—Un defeated Cornell scored three times in the second period, to rout Brown, 5‐1, tonight for its 17th victory, while Brown now has an 8‐7‐1 won‐lost‐tied record. The triumph also was Cornell's 29th in a row in Ivy play, a league record: Kevin ?? scored the only goal of the first period, tipping a rebound past the Brown goalie, Don McGinnis. Larry Fullan made it 2‐0 going the length of the ice for an unas sisted tally. Cornell's all‐star defense man, Dan Lodboa, got his 14th goal of the season and then Dick Bertrand made it 4‐0 on a pass from Lodboa. Curt Bennett, All‐Ivy de fenseman, ruined Brian Crop per's shutout bid at 7:31 of the final period while the Bruins were a man short. Steve Giuli ani scored the last goal 33 seconds later. McGinnis had 56 saves to Cropper's 21. NEW HAVEN, Feb. 7—Dart mouth handed Yale its eighth straight hockey loss tonight, 10‐6. The Big Green led, 6.1, after one period and 9‐2 after two. A four‐goal Yale rally helped close the gap toward the end. A capacity crowd of 2,200 witnessed the game in which 19 penalties were called.

1166-> For $1,440, a Two‐Seat Sub
PARIS — Jean‐Claude Mayas drew a big circle on the back of a brown envelope and then three smaller circles scattered inside the larger one. The skindiver pointed to the three small circles and said: “Let's say that these repre sent the only interesting areas for a diver and that in between them there is nothing especially interesting. The problem then becomes getting from one to another before I have to sur face for air.” The engineer said he had the solution — a 13‐foot, 2‐seat open, or “wet,” submarine with a speed of 3 knots and a range of 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles). The submarine, which Havas originally designed because he had become bored with seeing the same underwater areas in his twice‐weekly dips in the Mediterranean, has more com mercial uses. Of the 30 models sold, most have been to archeologists, oceanographers and the French coast guard for use in underwater searches after boat or plane accidents. Havas said it could also be used for offshore oil exploration. Santa Claus also found a use for it in Port Grimaud, a canal town on the French Riviera. He showed up last Christmas in a submarine instead of a reindeer‐drawn sleigh. Havas, a 30‐year‐old electri cal engineer from Ste. Maxime on the French Riviera, does not like to be called an inventor. “I hate that term,” he said at the recent Paris Boat Show, where his submarine was ex hibited. “I am an engineer. All do is solve problems. “The submarine itself was invented around 800 B.C. by escaping Egyptian slaves who used goat skins and straws. Fulton built one and Da Vinci designed one. “All I have done is find the solution to a particular prob lem.” The problem had two aspects —weight and economics. Havas found the solution to both in a fiberglass body. He said his submarine weighed about 350 pounds and cost $1,440 (before taxes), about one‐third that of American models. The lightness also enables it to be trans ported over land on a car trail er and over water aboard a small yacht. Havas said it had another advantage over American types. “All American submarines rise to the surface if you leave them alone, which means the diver must always hold on to them,” he said. “My submarine has perfect equilibrium, which means it will stay where you leave it. And its ballast permits 100 pounds of equipment to be aboard.” The battery‐charged, 1.7‐ horsepower submarine has room for the pilot and less room for a passenger, who must sit half out of the craft. “I could have made a more comfortable seat for the pas senger,” Havas said, “but my main concern was keeping the length, and therefore the weight and cost, down. It is more practical this way.” The pilot, who sits in front, directs the submarine, much like the pilot of a plane. The control stick is pushed forward to dive, back to rise and from left to right for horizontal di rections. The sub has an unlimited div ing range, Havas said, but at present the average diver can only submerge about 100 meters before the pressure be comes unsafe. The propeller is designed so as not to become entangled with vegetation on the ocean floor. One other feature: The sub marine is orange‐colored. Or ange and red are the two colors most clearly visible underwater.

1167-> POLICE SHIFT STUDY PLANNED IN NEWARK
NEWARK, Aug. 16 (UPI)—A committee of Newark City Councilmen has been formed to investigate last week's police department transfer of 170 men by Police Director John L. Redden. Council President Louis M. Turco appointed Councilman at large Michael A. Bontempo as chairman of the committee yesterday, after Mr. Bontempo called for the investigation. Others on the panel will be Councilmen at large Anthony Giuliano and Earl Harris. The investigation is seen as a confrontation between the City Council and Mayor Ken neth A. Gibson, who ordered the transfers. Even more sig nificantly, it is viewed as a confrontation between support ers of former Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio and the present ad ministration. Councilman Bontempo said he had received complaints about the transfers, and ques tion “whether or not these transfers are for the good of the department or whether they were made as a retaliatory action for political reasons...”

1169-> Addonizio Deputy Begins Effort To ‘Draft’ Mayor for Re‐Election
NEWARK, Jan. 5—Newark's deputy mayor began what he called a “grass roots” move ment today to draft Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio as a candi date for re‐election this spring. The deputy, Paul H. Reilly, insisted that the Mayor's in dictment last month on charges of extortion and tax evasion would have no adverse effect on the election. “I have great faith in the people of Newark,” he said, adding that Mr. Addonizio was “Newark's best hope for a sound future.” Mr. Addonizio, who pleaded not guilty to the Federal charges and who has refused to step down from his job des pite strong opposition from lo cal civic groups, declined to say whether or not he would accept the draft. Mr. Reilly, though, said that the Mayor had been aware of the draft movement. He added that in “a city of extremes,” Mr. Addonizio “remains the only moderate candidate and the only one who really cares about the people.” The first tentative soundings‐ out in the Draft Addonizio campaign actually started about eight weeks ago, Mr. Reilly said, “prior to all these in dictments.” But Mr. Reilly and his associates continued their efforts after the Federal charges were brought, and now, he said, “there is a great deal of support in the community.” Today he picked up from the City Clerk's office the petitions needed to have Mr. Addoni zio's name placed on the bal lot. Only 1,300 signatures are required and Mr. Reilly plans to begin circulating the peti tions immediately. City elections in Newark are conducted on a nonpartisan basis, and Mr. Addonizio, though an enrolled Democrat, would run as an independent. Among his opponents, if he chooses to run, are expected to be three Negroes: Kenneth A. Gibson, an engineer; Assemblyman George C. Richardson of Essex, and Harry Wheeler, a former Newark schoolteacher. Councilman at Large Antho ny Imperiale, head of a white militant group, is also expect ed to run for Mayor. More than half of Newark's residents are Negroes. Mr. Reilly was asked what would happen if Mr. Addoni zio were convicted — would he then run from the jailhouse, as did James Curley of Boston? Mr. Reilly considered a mo ment, then said: “That remains to be seen. At that point we would have to rearrange our thinking.” In another development to day, it was learned that two of the 55 persons arrested on gam bling charges here two weeks ago were carrying honorary badges issued by the office of Sheriff Ralph D'Ambola of Es sex County. The two men, Thomas La Manna, who was one of sev eral suspects held in $10,000 bail, and Estaban Cruz, who is free on a $1,500 bond, were taken into custody on indict ments handed down by a Fed eral grand jury. Sheriff D'Ambola said he did not personally know either man, although he said he might recognize Mr. LaManna as a bail bondsman who is some times seen in Newark courts. Mr. D'Ambola added that there were 3,200 honorary deputy sheriff badges now in circula tion, most of which, he said, were given out by his prede cessor.

1170-> Pangs of Prosperity
IN SPITE of new television contracts with guarantees of $167‐million through 1973, football teams continue to raise ticket prices because of increases in costs. Perhaps the club owners are anticipat ing the outcome of the con tract negotiations with the Players Association, scheduled to start tills spring. The latest club to raise prices was the Washington Red skins. The choice 1,724 mezzanine seats in Robert F. Kennedy Stadium went from $10 to $12, thus tying a record top set by the Eagles for certain seats in the new Philadelphia stadium. The 7,933 box seats in the upper deck at Washington went from $6 to $8 and all the rest from $6 to $7. Man agement pointed out this was the first raise since the team moved into the stadium in 1961 and it came because of a new city tax of 4 per cent, plus “a sharp escalation in operational costs.” In Washington, 12,563 sea son‐ticket holders buy up all 50,000 seats and there have been complaints that the general public thus is shut out. A few of the tickets wind up in the hands of scalpers, too. Because of the season ticket system, young people and poor people in places like Washington as well as New York are all but pre vented from ever seeing game, except on television. There also has been angry public reaction this winter in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Detroit to plans requiring season‐ticket buyers to pur chase seats for one or two preseason games in addition to the regular‐season con tests. In this the price of unparalleled prosperity for pro football? • George Halas was 75 last Monday. He recently had gall bladder operation and lost 15 pounds . . . Red Cochran, for 13 years an offensive backfield coach for such teams as the Packers, Lions and Cardinals, has joined the San Diego Charger staff. Calvin Hill, the Dallas Cow boy rookie who might have won the National League rushing title last season ex cept for an injured right foot, has been receiving many trophies as the N.F.L. rookie of the year. One arrived in Dallas with, the right foot broken off. The domed stadium planned for New Orleans will seat 84,777 for football. Its name is the Louisiana Superdome and Dave Dixon, the execu tive director, predicts it will open in 1973. Punting averages based on yards a kick are going to continue to decline, accord ing to Pat Studstill of the Rams. Since working for George Allen, the Los An geles coach, Studstill has changed his style. “Allen wants more height than distance,” says Stud still. “You have fewer run backs and more fair catches that way. I would say average about a yard lets per kick than I did in Detroit. George would like me to make each punt 40 yards.” What about the center who passes the ball to the punter? Larry Kaminski of Denver describes his job this way: “You look back there 15 yards. The fans in the stands are watching and waiting and you feel this guy breath ing heavily right over you.. You have to deliver the ball precisely so it hits the punter chest high. This is a 15‐yard pass. And you have to do it with your head upside down between your legs and that guy waiting there to hit you the instant your hands start to move.” • John Zook of the Atlanta Falcons, a promising defen sive end, has given up his hobby of parachute jumping. “I had 56 jumps,” he said. “But I sold all my equipment. I guess I did every stunt there is.” The largest television au dience ever to watch a sports event was for the first Super Bowl game Jan. 15, 1967. from Los Angeles. The con test was seen in 22,500,000 homes and drew a Nielsen rating of 40.8.

1174-> Enemy Attacks in Vietnam Are Heaviest in a Month
SAIGON, South Vietnam, May 3—Enemy forces staged widespread attacks, the heaviest in a month, in South Vietnam this weekend. The United States command reported 77 enemy rocket and mortar attacks and a half dozen ground assaults. The command also reported the loss of six American air craft, five of them supporting operations inside Cambodia plus, one Air Force F‐4 fighter‐horn ber shot down yesterday over North Vietnam. United States reports said that the upsurge in enemy activity and the aircraft losses had killed 15 Americans and wounded 79. Allied forces said 102 enemy soldiers had been killed in fighting inside South Vietnam. Incomplete reports said three, South Vietnamese soldiers and, two pacification workers had been killed and South Viet namese wounded. Seven civil ians were reported killed and 18 wounded in enemy attacks on provincial and district Towns. Elsewhere, the United Slates command reported hundreds of air strikes by lighters and B 52 bombers ranging from ?? ***?? two miles of the demilitarized zone. The strikes were aimed al curbing infiltration of North Vietnamese troops and supplies into South Vietnam. LANDING ZONE WEST, South Vietnam, May 3 (AP) — Risking higher casualties among their own men, allied commanders baried an strikes and artilery support today during a ?? to ?? North Vietnamese troops out of the newly resettled town of Hiep duc. “We've forbidden air and artillery strikes because we don't want to tear the town up and destroy the work we've done,” said Lieut. Col. M. G. Stafford of Eagles Pass, Tex., senior United States adviser in Quangtin Province. A North Vietnamese regi ment has occupied parts of Hiepduc, since Thursday. The town 35 miles south west of Danang was resetled by the Government last year after having been abandoned to enemy troops in 1965. Fighting was heavy on the town's northeastern edges. Despite the ban on heavy support fire, about 10 per cent of Hiepduc's houses are in ruin, Colonel Stafford said. Some houses were deliberately burned by North Vietnamese, he said. Others were destroyed during house‐to‐house fighting. Officers said that since Thursday 7 Americans had been killed and 63 wounded and about a dozen Government troops and 219 North Vietnam ese had been killed. SAIGON, May 3 (Reuters)— Five Americans were killed and 25 wounded in a guerrilla shelling and ground attack on at Landing Zone Betty 100 miles northeast of Saigon, the United States command re ported today.

1176-> Personality to Seek New Glory In Jersey Derby and Belmont
BALTIMORE, May 17‐Per sonality, the star of the show, left this morning for his home grounds at Aqueduct. Mrs. Ethel D Jacobs's colt, who won the $203,800 Preakness Stakes yesterday by a neck over Ray mond Curtis's My Dad George, was vanned northward to gether with his stablemate, High Echelon, who finished fourth in the 1–3/16‐mile event. John Jacobs, the son of the owner and the trainer of the Jacobs stock, is pointing for the Jersey Derby on Memorial Day and the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park on June 6. The trainer, conceding the close schedule, explained that he could get best results from his horses, especially from High Echelon, by running them rather than by merely drilling them. Robert Lehmann's Dust Com mander, the winner of the Ken tucky Derby, was a disappoint ing ninth in the Preakness. Don Combs, who trains Dust Com mander, was uncertain this morning about his plans for the colt, saying that his horse showed signs of a filled ankle. Dust Commander is a bar gain‐basement Illinois‐bred son of Bold Commander and was bought at the Keeneland sales for $6,500. Pensonality, on the other hand, is an ideally bred colt, born in Kentucky, a son of Hail to Reason and Affection ately. His success in the Preak ness can be considered a post humous triumph for Hirsch Jacobs, who died last February at the age of 67. Jacobs, the husband of the present owner and father of John, had saddled more winners (3,596) than any other trainer. He outlined the breeding of Personality, and he predicted the colt, in time, would live up to his bloodlines, each of the parents having been a cham pion. High Echelon, a Florida bred son of Native Charger and Luquillo, is considered a good partner for Personality in stakes performances. Indeed, there are some ob servers who are of the opinion that High Echelon's proved dur ability may enable him to finish ahead of his stablemate in the Belmont Stakes, which is at the taxing distance of a mile and one‐half. Frank (Buddy) McManus, the trainer of My Dad George, shipped his horse out to Bel mont Park this morning. “I said I am shipping him to Bel mont Park, not particularly to the Belmont Stakes,” said Mc Manus. Silent Screen, the Elberon Farm's colt who finished third, shipped out to Garden State, where he may prepare for the Jersey Derby, at 11/8 miles.

1179-> JACKSON NEGROES CALL OFF STRIKE
JACKSON, Miss., July 17— Black municipal workers here voted late last night to end their strike against the city and to return to their jobs on Mon day. Although they agreed to go back to work, they failed to win either union recognition or a wage increase, their prime reasons for walking off their jobs last June 29. They agreed to go back hold ing only the promise that the city would now sit down and negotiate in good faith the dif ferences that led to the walk out. The unexpected end to the strike came late in the night near the end of a long meeting and at the urging of Thomas Adams, a national field repre sentative of the union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employes. The blacks who went on strike here, some 750 in number and representing a third of the city's work force, are members of Local 1888 of the union. “Nobody in the labor move ment considers this a strike,” Mr. Adams told some 150 of the workers who sat stunned in the union hall. “You ain't got no strike; you got a bunch of people who aren't going to work.” Some of the angry strikers, now two weeks without pay checks, shouted back: “Well, if this ain't a strike, what the hell is it?” “People are laughing at you,” Mr. Adams responded. “There is no way you can win like you're going. There is no way the city will capitulate simply by your not showing up down at the yard.” Since barely a fifth of the union's membership was on hand for the meeting, Lushes Walker, president of the local, asked that any decision to end the walkout be delayed until the entire membership could be called together. Mr. Adams disagreed. “If you expect me to believe that you're going to leave here tonight without a decision, without any more unity than you have now, then you're ridiculous,” he said. The city's decision to bar gain with the strikers did rep resent a mild shift in its posi tion. Previously, it had said flatly that the strike was il legal and that it would not enter into any negotiations. But in meetings with union officials that lasted most of yesterday, city officials said that they would bargain in good faith but still refused to give any formal recognition to the union. After the terms of the pro posed bargaining sessions with the city were outlined to the membership, Mr. Adams said, “Unless you're prepared to go through unmitigated suffering, I'm going to recommend that you go through collective bar gaining.” Mr. Adams sharply criticized the approach the strikers used to force the city to meet their demands. “You got together because of your blackness and some adverse working conditions,” he said, “and that is not unionism. If you joined the union to have a civil rights movement, that's something else. I thought you joined to have collective bargaining and that's what you got.” Mr. Adams told the workers: “I cannot lie to you, I've got to tell you that up to this point you haven't done a damn thing. All you are doing is withhold ing your services and you ex pect the city to capitulate. That, is not going to happen.” Told that they could not win, most of the workers stood and voted to return to their jobs. But others stormed out of the union hall, slamming doors as they went and shout ing that they had been “sold out.” Mr. Adams accused the local of not having prepared itself for the strike but Robert Thom as, the business representative, said that the local had asked for help from the international more than eight months ago and had not received an answer. In Washington tonight, R. J. Ciampi, the union's national di rector of organization, said that he was “surprised” at Mr. Adams's reported conduct. He said that the international had no right to sanction, au thorize or terminate strikes. “That decision,” he said, “lies solely with the workers in volved.” The strong insistence by Mr. Adams that the workers return to their jobs was totally un expected. The blacks had felt that simply walking off their jobs represented a major step. It is believed that this was the first time in the Deep South that all black employes walked off their jobs in a strike for un ion recognition. Most of the blacks are paid $1.70 an hour and few receive take‐home pay checks of more than $50 a week. They had con sidered some wage increase es sential in any agreement to end the strike.

1180-> Diplomats in Moscow Gloomy on Mideast and Asia
MOSCOW, May 3 — The chances for a negotiated set tlement in either the Middle East or Southeast Asia—the world's two most inflammatory spots—seem more remote than ever to Western diplomats here. “We diplomats haven't been able to get anywhere up to now, and I suppose it's natural that the generals are getting their chance again,” said a se nior Western European diplo mat who has spent years work ing for peace in the Middle East and Vietnam. “I think it will be a long time before we ever get a workable peace in those areas.” His remarks today under scored the sense of new frus tration among diplomats over the two major news develop ments in the last week: the disclosure that Soviet pilots were apparently flying rear guard missions in the United Arab Republic, and the speech by President Nixon sending American forces into Cambodia. The reported presence of Soviet pilots—something still not officially commented upon by Soviet officials—came as no surprise to the Western diplo mats. Ever since February, when the Soviet Union began a massive anti‐Israel campaign with a Tass statement that the Russians would give all neces sary military help to the Arab states, diplomats have predict ed a major increase in direct Soviet aid. “The Israelis were flying at will against Egypt,” one dip lomat said. This must have raised concern here that Nas ser's Government might fall, and be replaced by either a wild bunch of Maoists or some pro‐Western group. The Rus sians have worked with Nasser for 15 years. They know him. They probably don't completely trust him, but he has opened the way to the Soviet Union's getting a foothold in the Mid dle East.” The consensus among those questioned was that the dis patch of pilots did not mean the Russians were looking for di rect confrontation with either Israel, or in the long run, with the United States, although Moscow must have realized the risk. Most diplomats believe that Moscow's main goal is to return, to the situation that existed be fore the June, 1967, war. There are no signs that the Soviet, Union has dropped its basic ne gotiating package, which in eludes the demand that Israel withdraw from all Arab terri tories without any direct nego tiations with the Arab states. Some diplomats said that Moscow probably did not mind the continued tension in the area because that left the Arab states little flexibility except to turn to the Soviet Union for help, thereby increasing Mos cow's influence in the area. The fact that the Soviet Union has neither announced it has sent forces to Egypt or confirmed the Western reports was taken as a “good sign” by one senior diplomat. He said that as long as the Soviet Union does not admit the forces are there, Soviet prestige is not di rectly involved. If some pilots are shot down, Moscow does not have to express outrage or seek revenge, he said. “The main problem is not so much that the Russian pilots are going to be having dog fights with Israeli or American pilots,” a diplomat said. “The problem is that Israel is now going to be more rigid than ever. If Israel was thinking of making a compromise, it will change its mind because it doesn't want to look like it is backing down under Soviet pressure.” “And the Egyptians, with Soviet planes in their rear, are not going to be in a rush to sweeten their terms either,” he added. The Cambodian intervention was viewed as symptomatic of the inability of the two sides to make any progress at a diplo matic solution of the Vietnam war. One senior diplomat spec ulated: “The generals said to Nixon: ‘Look, here's a golden opportunity to break the back of the enemy.’ The diplomats could offer no comparable breakthrough.” Many West Europeans argued that Washington should have “played out the diplomatic string” longer with the Rus sians. Some suggested going to the United Nations and present ing evidence of North Viet namese infiltration of Cambo dia, forcing the Russians to the defensive. Since the Government in Pnom Penh has yet to ask for outside help against United States troops, the Soviet re sponse is expected to be more polemical than anything else, the diplomats said.

1181-> Notes From the Field of Travel
TWO blocks from the Dawson County Court house in Dawsonville, Ga., is a 30x90‐foot log building known as The Moon shine Museum. Inside are four stills. They have never produced anything but curi osity in their present loca tion, swears the museum's owner, but he's confident they could. Carl Phillips, whose stubby beard and hand‐rolled ciga rettes help create a carica ture almost as much fun to observe as the museum itself, greets most visitors. The builder and owner of the mu seum is Fred Goswick, a Dawsonville furniture dealer. Goswick says he never drank much moonshine “be cause I never cared for strong drink ... although some shine was good whis ky,” but he considers it a valuable part of North Geor gia's folklore. That is the rea son for the museum, says he, adding, “I'm not knocking moonshine and I'm not pro moting it.” Goswick researched the subject matter, then scoured the area in search of de funct, abandoned stills, which Phillips ultimately reassem bled. Then Goswick wrote a script of the history of moon shining, beginning with the early Chinese experiments of making wine from rice. He also cited the influence of Scotch‐Irish settlers, who brought a fond taste for whis ky to the New World (strange fluids from the Celtic fringe, according to David Daiches in his reecnt book, “Scotch Whisky”). Someone read the script into a tape recorder, and the product is the narration that visitors listen to as they walk through the museum. Four different types of still are re created in the museum: Introduced in the late 1800's, this still could produce about 100 gallons of moonshine in 12 hours. Huge, man‐made barrels of the prod uct sold for $1.50, and such barrels are included in the display. Used from the early 1900's on into the Prohibition era, this still, run by one man, could produce 200 gallons a day. An auto mobile radiator was used to condense alcohol‐laden steam into moonshine. This is the still, says Goswick, “that really made the Government mad.” Manufac tured in the 1930's, it could produce 500 to 1,000 gallons of liquor a day under the op eration of only one man. The steamer on display has a boiler that was blown up twice during raids by Federal agents, patched up and then used again. Invented only about 20 years ago, one man could produce 1,000 to 3,000 gallons a day with this de vice. The display in the mu seum is actually a miniature. The Moonshine Museum was opened on July 4, 1969, and will remain open this year until Thanksgiving. Hours are 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily, and admission is $1 for adults, 50 cents for children.

1182-> MORE FLEXIBILITY EVIDENT IN METS
PITTSBURGH April 8—To morrow night the New York Mets will play at Forbes Field for the last time. Even if Three River Stadium, the new home of the Pittsburgh Pirate, is not ready on May 29, the schedulea moving day, it will he be fore the Mets return here on Aug. 7. The old park, with its un usually attractive setting against a green hillside, has been the site of historic Met triumphs. It was here o tithe night of April 23, 1962, that they won their first game, 9‐1, behind Jay Hook, after nine straight losses. And it was here yes terday that they won an open ing game for the first time, 5‐3, in 11 innings. Forbes Field has also been the scene of some of the more spectacular Met disasters. But while it is pointless to compare the present Met team to those that created the Met joke, it is instructive to compare the team that won yesterday with the one of only a year ago. Four of the five runs the Mets scored yesterday, includ ing the two that broke the tic were driven in by players who weren't with them last April. Donn Clendenon, whose pinch single with the bases full decided the game, was not acquired from Montreal until June 15. Joe Foy, who de livered a third‐inning run with a fly, carne from Kansas City over the winter. And Art Sham sky, who drove in a run with a single and later added a double, was in Florida at this time last year working out with Tidewater and trying to recover from a had back. These changes emphasize the greater flexibility Manager Gil Hodges has this year, and indicate why the club's basic ability should be judged by the way it played late last season rather than at the beginning. For instance, Hodges decid ed that Ken Boswell, the regu lar second baseman, wasn't quite ready to play after tour of military duty. So he put Wayne Garrett at second and, to compensate for any loss of left‐handed batting pow er, Shamsky at first. He could do this partly he cause Foy was ready to be the full‐time third baseman. Last year Garrett was frequently used at third. Also, Hodges had no hesitation in using Ron Swoboda in right field, even against right‐handed pitching, since Swohoda had clone so well down the stretch last sea son against all pitching. It worked fine. Shamskv hit and started a double play; Foy did his job; Swoboda made a sensational catch. But what happened later was even more significant. With the score 3‐3 in the eighth inning, Hodges put Mike Jorgensen, the only rookie to have made the team, at first to holster the defense. It was Jorgensen who led off the 11th with a single and started the winning rally. Meanwhile, Hodges still had plenty of bench strength. Such maneuverability is often as important, in the long run, as the success or failure of a particular pinch‐hitter in a par eticular game. The Mets who finally won a game here in 1962 were a national myth in the making. The Mets of last April were merely hopeful. These Mets are simply a good team. Fritz Peterson, the left‐hander who won four spring‐training games and lost one, will try to pitch the Yankees to their first victory of the season today against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Ray Culp, a right‐hander with a 17‐8 won‐lost mark last sea son, will oppose Peterson. Manager Ralph Houk will have at least three left‐handed hitters in the line‐up—Horace Clarke, Thurmon Munson and Gene Michael. He has not de cided who the starting third baseman will be—Jerry Kenney or Danny Cater. Kenney bats left‐handed. Mickey Mantle, whose No. 7 was retired last June, and Joe DiMaggio will be honored with plaques Sunday between games of the double‐header with Cleve land.

1187-> Personal Finance: Consumer Help
Last year, in what has since become a landmark legal case, the city, suing for itself and for thousands of con sumers throughout the coun try, obtained an out‐of‐court settlement for $120‐million from five major drug compa nies charged with illegally fixing prices and overcharging Purchasers. In nation‐wide ads run at the time, consumers who could produce evidence that they had bought these drugs were invited to share in the refunds. Claims are still being processed today. The city's Corporation Counsel, J. Lee Rankin, who brought the suit, and its Commsioner of Consumer Af fairs, Mrs. Bess Myerson Grant, hailed the settlement as a “major breakthrough” for the victimized consumer. When a Government ini tates such cases they are known as “mass restitution actions.” When consumers seek relief for themselves and for others similarly vic timized, this is a “class action.” Regardless of the termin ology, the result is the same: the consumer can go into court against a powerful ad versary with millions of dol lars at stake. And now, for the first time, the consumer has the edge. • In the announcement of Mayor Lindsay's budget last week, $3.8‐million was allo cated to the Department of Consumer Affairs, with $100, 000 to provide for a new office—Consumer Advocate. Philip Schrag, a 27‐year‐old 1967 graduate of Yale Law School and the city's first Consumer Advocate, thus he conies the only one in the country with a staff and funds to operate. His job: to investigate and bring mass restitution actions for the city's consumers. Governor Rockefeller, in a bill signed recently to pro vide New York with a Con sumer Protection Board, gave the new agency broad powers in class actions. So far, however, as many lawyers see it, the courts in New York like those in many other states except Califor nia, Michigan and Washing ton State, take a narrow, conservative view of what constitutes a class action. New York and California law for example provide that for the courts to consider a suit a class action there must be “a common or general in terest.” But New York courts have ben more strict than Califor nia in interpreting this doc trine and, as a result, class actions are widespread in California but almost impos sible to bring in New York. Just a few days ago, for example, a class action suit brought two years ago by Mr. Schrag against the Co burn Corporation of America when he was assistant coun sel for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund, was rejected in the state's highest court because of insufficient “unity of in terest.” Coburn, then in the small loan business, was charged with printing its contracts in a smaller size type than re quired by law. • Many lawyers contend that in such cases where strict states deny the consumer the right to bring a class action, a Federal court would be more willing to hear the case. But Federal courts have rules that presently bar most such cases. For one thing, they must involve more than $10,000. Then, there must be a Fed eral question involved or what is known as a “diver sity of citizenship,” where the parties to the suit come from different states. Now, in a hotly contested pending in Congress—and widely expected to pass later this year—consumers with legitimate grievances would be permitted to bring a class action suit in a Federal court, regardless of whether it met present Federal prerequisites. In the Senate, it is being sponsored by two Democrats, Frank E. Moss of Utah and Joseph D. Tydings of Mary land. In the House, its spon sor is Representative Bob Eckhardt, Democrat of Texas. Ironically, the nation's two most famous consumer advo cates are on opposing sides of the bills. • Mrs. Grant, New York's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, is wholeheartedly in favor of the legislation. The President's Consumer Ad viser, Mrs. Virginia Knauer —once in favor of the meas ures—has switched sides, joining the Administration in opposing the bills. Powerful forces are active on both sides. With Mrs. Grant are about a hundred Congressmen, the A.F.L. C.I.O., the Consumer Federa tion of America and Ralph Nader. With Mrs. Knauer, is the Retail Federation of America, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the United States Chamber of Com merce. In liberal states, the class action according to Herbert S. Denenberg, professor of the Wharton School of Fi nance and Commerce, Uni versity of Pennsylvania, “is already beginning to work miracles for the consumer.” But if class actions can be brought directly to Federal courts, consumers living in strict states can beat the sys tem. That doesn't mean they'll win, but at least they'll get a chance to be heard.

1190-> Businessmen Applaud and Criticize Nixon Speech
The business and financial community greeted President Nixon's economic speech yes terday with a mixture of ap plause, indifference and some disappointment. A survey of executives in a variety of business fields found most of them happy that Mr. Nixon would not impose wage and price controls, or even guidelines. They also expressed hope that the formation of a National Commission on Productivity would focus more attention on a fundamental Lause of infla tion. One of the strongest backers of the President's speech was David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Two weeks ago, Mr. Pockefeller publicly urged Mr. Nixon to take a more active role in discussing economic problems and in encouraging business and labor to take “a more respon sible attitude” toward wage and price increases. Mr. Rockefeller said yester day he was “enthusiastic” about the President's speech. “It was important for him to speak to the general public about the economy and explain what has been done, why it has been and what the pros pects were,” he said. Mr. Rockefeller said he thought it was “important” that Mr. Nixon had decided not to impose wage and price controls, or guidelines. “Of course, now we have to see what will happen,” he add ed. “That will be the test, But, at this stage, this was the right thino to do.” William Freund, vice presi dent and economist of the New York Stock Exchange, said he believed the President was “absolutely right” in his ap proach. “I was very much concerned that his emphasis would be on short‐term solutions,” Mr. Freund said. “I consider the problem of inflation is primari ly a longer‐term one. “One solution would have been wage and price controls, which are irreconcilable with our economic system. The other is to step up our productivity.” Joseph F. Dorsey, president of the Argus Research Corpo ration, a major investment ad visory service, said he thought the most significant aspect of the speech was its “restrained tone.” “I think this showed that the President has considerable con fidence that his disinflation pro gram is working,” Mr. Dorsey declare d. “We think it is work ing even better than he indicated.” Mr. Dorsey pointed to stead ily declining rates of increase in wholesale pricas as one sign of easing inflationary pressures. “We haven't yet seen the ef fect on the cost of living,” he said, “but we will toward the end of the year.” Despite general approval, there were some business ob servers disappointed that the President had not taken a stronger approach. A bank economist, who re quested anonymity, said the speech “was an effort to take a fresh initiative without taking a fresh initiative.” “I thought It was kind of a blah speech,” said John Wester gaard, president of Equity Re search Associates, Inc., an in vestment advisory service. “There were no surprises. He played it right down the middle. The stock market won't get particularly exicted about it.” Maxwell Dane, chairman of the executive committee of Doyle, Dane, Bernbach, Inc., major advertising agency, said: “It was a typical low‐key Nixon speech including a brief course in elementary economics. There was little to take issue with.” Emerson E. Mead, chairman and president of the SCM Corporation, said: “We have been advocating—and frankly had hoped for—more definitive measures to curb, Federal spending and excessive labor demands. I think the business community was looking for more than the establishment of another advisory panel.” Although there had been no expectation that Mr. Nixon would speak in favor of wage and price controls, many busi ness executives, particularly in manufacturing, hailed his com ments against controls. “I am pleased that the Presi dent didn't saddle is with wage and price controls,” declared Donald F. Whitehead, president of the Standard Register Com pany, a Dayton, Ohio, manufac turer of business forms. James D. Finley, chairman of J. P. Stevens & Co., Inc., a major textile producer, said he agreed with Mr. Nixon that “such controls would not ac complish a lessening of infla tion.” “They would put the coun try in an economic strait jacket,” he said. Robert W. Sarnoff, chairman and president of the RCA Cor poration, said he shared the President's view “that the Gov ernment should actively enlist the aid of both business and la bor in a program of voluntary price and wage restraints, un derpinned by a joint effort to ward increased productivity.” In a telegram to the Presi dent, Edmund F. Martin, chair man and chief executive officer of the Bethlehem Steel Corpora tion, described the speech as “most encouraging.” “I am fully in accord with your emphasis on productivity as the key to economic growth with stable prices,” Mr. Martin said. A spokesman for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., said the proposed committee on productivity “could be a useful instrument in the fight against inflation” and added. “The President's plans to reduce de fense spending are gratifying.” Dr. A. Gilbert Heebner, senior vice president and economist of the Philadelphia National Bank, declared that if Mr. Nixon “really does hold the growth of Federal spending to the rate projected, that will be more significant than any of the actions he announced today.” Dr. Heebner said the forma tion of a productivity commis sion would call “attention to one of the most fundamental elements in the wage‐price equation.” “But,” he added, “produc tivity is tough to affect in the short run by means at the dis posal of a Governmental com mittee.” George P. Hitchings, vice president and economist of the C.I.T. Financial Corporation, said the commission was “de sirable as a means of focusing on the reasons for lack of pro ductivity advance in the past one and a half years and what it required to correct this.” But “on the wage‐price side, the accomplishments of an advisory group studying wage‐price poli cies are likely to be relatively modest, judging by past per formance,” he said. One of the first labor leaders to comment on the speech was Paul Jennings, president of the International Union of Electri cal, Radio and Machine Work ers. He charged that the anti‐in flation program was “weighted against the American worker.” “It includes nothing that goes to the heart of the current problem — nothing to bring down interest rates, nothing to correct the imbalance between high prices and inadequate wages, and nothing to put a brake on excess profits,” Mr. Jennings said. Meanwhile, Nicholas Kisburg, a teamsters union analyst here charged that the New York metropolitan area had experi enced more inflation in the first two years of the Nixon Admin istration than it had during the Administrations of Presidents Johnson and Kennedy.

1192-> Red Attack on Neak Luong
CHROI DANG, Cambodia, May 3 — Vietnamese Commu nist forces were reported today to have attacked and at least partly occupied a key Mekong River crossing point in Cam bodia 35 miles southeast of Pnompenh. Official Government reports said the attack on the town of Neak Luong, on the opposite side of the river from the cap ital, began at 1 A.M. and that fighting was still continuing at midday. Fourteen busloads of Cam bodian Army troops — about 300 soldiers—sent southeast to clear Highway 1 to the river stopped this afternoon at this little village four miles from the river, apparently because Vietcong and North Vietnamese soldiers held positions along the near side of the Mekong, too. The Cambodian soldiers, armed mostly with AK‐47 auto matic rifles and some machine guns and mortars, fanned out into the countryside. One sol dier tuned in United States Armed Forces' Saigon station on a transistor and listened to a baseball game. It appeared from here as it the enemy was trying to cut off from Government control Neak Luong, a town of several thousand, including many eth nic Vietnamese, along with the rest of Cambodian territory east of the Mekong. Vietnamese Communist forces were also reported to have at tacked farther southeast along Highway 1 at the town of Kom pong Trabek, halfway between Neak Luong and Svayrieng and closer to Neak Luong at Kom pong Soeung. The Government also reported a heavy enemy assault on the town of Takeo to the south. All attacks seemed designed to secure an increas ingly larger area from the southern and eastern borders in toward Pnompenh.

1194-> 100,000 to Get Smallpox Vaccine in Rhine Epidemic
BONN, Feb. 1—An epidemic of smallpox that has caused two deaths has prompted health authorities in the populous state of North Rhine‐Westphalia to plan the vaccination of 100,000 people, starting today. About 200 people have been placed in quarantine in and around the town of Meschede, where physicians found that 20‐year‐old Bernd Klein had contracted smallpox on a trip to Pakistan and had come home with the dis ease early last month. Last week a student nurse, Barbara Berndt, died of small pox at a Meschede hospital, where she had apparently been infected by Mr. Klein. Last night, Anton Hömberg, 80, died. Twelve more per sons are under treatment for smallpox, which takes two to three weeks to incubate. Meschede, on the Ruhr River, is on the edge of the heavily populated Ruhr in dustrial basin. So far the epi demic has been confined to three counties within 15 miles of Meschede. Since yesterday, travelers departing from nearby Düs seldorf Airport have been get ting vaccinated at the termi nal. Authorities in Spain, Portugal and Britain have been insisting that travelers arriving from Germany show immunization cards or subject themselves to vaccination and quarantine.

1195-> Tories Select Law and Order As Issue for General Election
LONDON, Feb. 1 (Reuters) — A swing to the right in Conservative party thinking was foreshadowed today as the Conservatives, the main British Opposition party, completed a three‐day meeting for electoral planning. Twenty‐five Tory leaders, as sembled for a weekend confer ence in a country hotel south of London, decided that law and order would be the top isssue in the election campaign. Britain's eighth postwar gener al election must be held by May, 1971. The decision riflects the Tory belief that Britons are increas ingly impatient with student power, antiapartheid demon strators and other indications of civil disorder. For some time, it has been apparent at party conferences that the Tory leadership stands slightly to the left of the rank and file. The new emphasis on strengthening civil authority could ease the danger of a split. Over the weekend, the Con servative strategists also agreed that their platform should stress labor‐union reforms, cuts in taxes and close attention to the cost of living. The weekend session was the first of its kind that the Con servatives have ever held. The discussion of a platform con trasted with the usual practice of leaving leadership decisions to very small group, usually called “the Magic Circle.” A rising note of confidence has been heard among Con servatives because of a favor able trend in recent opinion polls, reversing inroads made by the Labor party recently. Although the election can be put off for 15 months, the Con servatives until recently have regarded October or November of this year as the last prac tical moment for an election. An unpopular conversion to decimal currency in February, 1971, seemed to rule out a 1971 election. But this weekend there were second thoughts following re ports Prime Minister Wilson might postpone the date of the decimal changeover.

1196-> ‘CARMEN’ RETURNS WITH NEW VOICES
Bizet's “Carmen” returned to the Metropolitan Opera reper tory on Tuesday night for the first time in the 1969–70 sea son, bringing some singers new to their roles with the company and returning Jean Morel to the Met podium after an absence of seven years. Mr. Morel, who devotes him self nowadays chiefly to teach ing at the Juilliard School, was most welcome. From the very beginning it was clear that he was not going to coarsen the score by bearing down on its most obvious rhythmic and dramatic elements. Instead, he emphasized its clarity of con struction, unity of style and statement and its sensitivity. He had the orchestra playing at times with unexpected grace and refinement. The title role was sung by Ruza Baldani, a Yugoslav mez zo‐soprano who has sung smaller roles with the com pany under the name of Ruza Pospinov. Baldani is her mar ried name. She made a fine Carmen in terms of looks, temperament and acting ability, and her voice, at its best, seemed right for the part. But her vocal production allowed the voice to spread badly on many occa sions in this performance, and the end result was disappoint ment in so far as her singing was concerned. Pilar Lorengar, doing her first Micaela at the Met, is another singer whose vocal control is uneven, and unsteadiness of tone marred her interpretation Things were better vocally in the male roles. Richard Tucker was Don Jose, Robert Merrill was Escamillo, and the lengthy cast included Ray mond Gibbs, who, in his firs appearance as Morales, made a commendable vocal and dra matic impression.

1197-> JENKINS OF CUBS BEATS DODGERS, 4‐2
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24 (UPI)—Joe Pepitone belted his 19th home run of the season with a man on base in the fourth inning tonight and the Chicago Cubs went on to post a 4‐2 victory over the Los An geles Dodgers. Ferguson Jen kins registered his 16th victory. Pepitone's firth homer as a Cub came with Billy Williams, who had singled, on base. The Cubs chased Sandy Vance, the Dodger starter, in the sixth in ning with a pair of runs to take a 4‐1 lead. Jim Hickman and Pepitone opened the inning with singles. Ron Santo's sacrifice fly brought in Hickman. Vance was taken out after Johnny Callison singled, sending Pepitone to third. Pepitone scored the fourth Chicago run on Bill Sudakis’ error on a pick off play. The Dodgers’ first run came in the fifth and was unearned. With two out, Maury Wills singled and went to third on Randy Hundley's passed ball, scoring on an error by Santo on Bill Russell's ground ball. The Dodgers lost Ted Size more, second baseman, in the second inning. He sprained his: left wrist while batting in the second inning. ??

1198-> Police See All of Central Park's Faces
Without sirens, the police cars wove carefully among the bicyclists along the 72d Street. Transverse. At the Mall, the, cars stopped sud denly. As policemen rushed into a sun‐dappled glade, other policemen arrived on scooters. Within a rew minutes, rour handcuffed young men were in the police cars, being driven to the Central Park Precinct to. be charged with sale or possession of narcot ics. The police on the scoot ers vanished. Only the bicy clists remained. At the peace rally on the Mall, the speaker did not miss a syllable. At the Bethesda Fountain, where the young were draped along the ledge, guitarists strummed without interruption. in the sunshine. “This is a very sensitive area,” said Deputy Inspector Warren Kneeht, commanding officer of the Mounted. Dis trict, which polices Central Park. “We don't use a siren Unless it's absolutely neces sary. We know pebple come here to enjoy themselves and we don't want to spoil that mood.” All Are. Volunteers To the scores of thousands of New Yorkers—and visi tors—who come to Central Park on a summer weekend, Manhattan's most famous patch of greenery is a play ground. To the police it is an outdoor factory for high ly skilled workmen. The regulars in this pre cinct are all‐volunteers who have to be able to ride horses as well as in cars. There is always a list of more than 200 policemen in other precincts who want to join the Central Park outfit. They have a special esprit that is born of dealing with special problems that change from hour to hour. Some of the park situations are rather amusing, at first glance. Patrolmen William Aquino and Robert. Graham were in a police car over the weekend. To the average person everything seemed serene, but to the policemen a horseman appeared to be in trouble. They stopped their car just as the rider began kicking the horse and pulling the reins. The horse became balky. Riding Tips Given Patrolman Graham patted the horse on the‐neck and talked to the young man in the saddle. The horse and in experienced rider soon re laxed. A few seconds later the horse and across the road and on the bridle path. “He was just inexperi enced, said the policeman. “I told him to hold the reins tighter, to take command of the horse. He wasn't kicking hard enough. They were just love taps. Imagine riding a horse with sneakers, Guys like that cause runaways. You don't have to worry about the horse. The hcirse will get back to the stable, but the guy could get hurt.” The policemen drove up into the 90's, where teams were playing softball. In the shady area to the east of those fields, they said, they have encountered more armed robbery than anywhere else in the park. “These criminals,” said Pa trolman Aquino, “know that tours change at 4 o'clock, and they try to do their jobs between 3:30 and 4:30 P.M.” Boaters Are Watched To outwit those criminals, the Central Park Precinct has a special day shift that works from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., in stead of the usual 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. And during the sum mer months its complement is increased by 40 men from other precincts. The total number assigned to the pre cinct is kept secret. As policemen roamed throughout the park, on the lake the boaters seemed as happy as usual, sometimes splashing themselves as they rowed clumsily, yelling to friends, calling to girls. But the police watched for those who tried to show off in the boats. Every year they can count on some such persons falling into the water. One person drowned last spring. Picnickers were eating, singing, and playing musical instruments as they sat on blankets or on the grass. Edging toward them were un licensed peddlers with carts of pretzels, juices, ice cream and ices. Peddlers are the bane of the policeman's life in Cen tral Park. Some peddlers are expert at stirring up the peo ple nearby as a policeman is writing out a summons. “Why don't you get the big gang sters,” the watchers some times say. One peddler is so well known to the police that they call him by his first name, Aaron. He has been known to continue selling merchandise even while the policemen are writing out summonses. The more astute peddlers let their summonses accumu late until they can go before a judge that they know is sympathetic to them. Then, according to the police, they'll come before the judge with as many as 20 summonses, plead poverty and charge per secution, and be let off with fines of maybe only $2 a summons. “The peddlers cause us more trouble than lost chil dren,” said Patrolman Gra ham, as he carefully observed a youngster who seemed to be lost but was soon grabbed and reprimanded by his irate mother. Peaceful Crowds The park's evening atmos phere changes sharply, the family scene vanishing with the sun. At the Woilman Memorial Skating Rink, there were long lines filing into the amphi theater for a rock concert. Others just sat on the grass outside or on rocky knolls, where they could hear the music just as well. “You practically never have trouble with the people at these concerts,” said Inspec tor Knecht. But ranged out side were more than a dozen members of the Tactical Pa trol Force. “We're just here for crowd control,” said one of the members of the T.P.F. “I don't think we'll have much to do.” And at the Delacorte The ater, the police had even less to do, as hundreds of Shake speare‐lovers, some of whom had been waiting for more than six hours, filed in to be come absorbed in the violent chronicles of the Wars of the Roses. ‘Think It's Nothing’ But in radio cars patroling the dark park, there was a sense of danger. Benches and lawns were almost deserted. Couples kept to the roads with heavy auto traffic. The police organized a drive through the Rambles, a hang out notorious for muggers. Patrolmen Dennis Ryan and Lawrence Males were on the 4 P.M. to midnight tour. “You tell someone to go from 72d Street to 79th Street,” said Patrolman Ryan, “and they think it's nothing. They don't know we're going up and down the hills and along narrow paths.” He and his partner occas sionally roused someone who had fallen asleep. They played strong searchlights into bushes and recessed areas. “The people who go home before sundown are the smart ones,” said Patrolman Ryan. ‘Get Lots of These’ The police radio crackled. “Female voice calling for help from the bushes at 108th Street and Eighth Avenue. just inside the park.” Now the sirens of the police cars seemed to explode from all over the park. Rooftop lights began spinning vividly as the cars raced to the site. Police men spilled across the lawns and into the bushes. They found nothing. “Probably somebody's idea of a practical joke,” said Patrolman Manes. “You get lots of these.” Shortly after 11 P.M. the Shakespeare play ended. Po licemen took up posts at a road where a traffic signal had been knocked out in an accident. Patrolman Michael Long. as he watched the thinning line of theatergoers head to ward Central Park West. mused: “For once, nobody will he asking us why we're not out getting the big gangsters.”

1199-> South Africa Relaxes Curb On Percy Sledge Audiences
JOHANNESBURG, South Af rica, June 10—The Government has relaxed restrictions on Percy Sledge, the American Negro singer, to allow him to appear before all‐white audi ences. The success of Mr. Sledge's South African tour has been so great that white fans have been clamoring to see him. The soul singer was orginally re stricted to appear before non white audiences only. Some whites even tried to masquer ade as colored in order to slip into his opening night show in Capetown. On his nonwhite‐only cir cuit it was estimated that Mr. Pledge would earn about $19, 000. Now the estimates are doubled. He had a big hit in 1966 with his first recording, “When a Man Loves a Woman.”

1201-> Governor's Panel Urges City U. To Consider Charging Tuition
ALBANY, Feb. 1—Governor Rockefeller's Council of Eco nomic Advisers has recommend ed that “serious consideration” be given to charging tuition at the City University of New York because of a gap between the university's plans for ex pansion and its limited sources of revenue. In the council's first annual report, released today by the Governor's office, the seven‐ member group was critical of the university because of what it called “the apparent disparity between targets for planned expansion and their fiscal fea sibility.” The report, which dealt main ly with the City University problem, also said that the state's economy for the year was “colored by uncertamty” because of national conditions. The council said that it doubt ed that a major recession was in the offing and that the ef fects of any risk in unemploy ment would be felt more in upstate manufacturing centers than in New York City, which has a higher percentage of people working in service in dustries. Discussing the City Univer sity, the report noted that al though the city's Board of Higher Education, appointed by the Mayor, was instrumental in formulating policy, it was not “a budgetary agency and thus has no fiscal responsibility.” In an allusion to state aid given to the City University, the report said that “salary and admissions commitments are made without formal involve ment of the agencies ultimately called upon to fund them.” “Such procedures,” it said, “tend to foster unrealistic de cisions.” Noting that faculty salaries in the system were among the highest in the country, the re port recommended that the state be a party in City Uni versity collective‐bargaining agreements here. “Not only is the state called upon to finance its share of agreements arrived at without its participation,” the report said, but also “decisions ema nating from these agreements have an impact on other public and private institutions of higher learning in the state.” State aid to the City Univer sity for the 1969–70 school year is about $85‐million. The city provides about one‐ half of the university's current operating budget of $235‐mil lion, with the remainder coming largely from fees and a small portion from grants and interest on capital funds. The university has warned that its costs will be increased sharply when the open‐admis sions policy goes into effect in September, since the expected increase in enrollment will re quire expansion. The Governor's advisers said that the state's share could reach a level of $450‐million in 1975–76 and expressed “doubt as to whether such extraordi nary increases in funding ac tually will occur.” The report concluded by say ing that “serious consideration should he given to establishing a system of tuition charges, coupled with generous scholar ship awards based on need.” While not mentioning a spe cific tuition figure for the system's nine senior colleges and six community colleges, the advisers said that “a zero tuition policy, in fact, frequent ]y discriminates against those whom such a policy is thought to aid most, and its continua tion would damage efforts to provide quality education in creasingly to New York stu dents.” The State University of New York—with its 63 colleges and centers conducting classes for nearly 260,1900 full‐time and part‐time students—established tuition fees in 1963. Under graduates pay $400 a year, graduate students $600 and medical, dental and law stu dents $800. Dr Albert H. Bowker, the City University's chancellor, could not be reached for com ment on the report. A Univer sity spokesman said that he had not yet seen it, but added that he was “rather disap pointed that they look at this as a one‐shot investment.” A graduate of the tuition free City University system, the spokesman said, “builds an eco nomic base for the New York State economy” because he has “a lifetime economic expect ancy of a quarter of a million dollars more than a guy who doesn't.” A spokesman for Mayor Lind say said the Mayor had not seen the report and would not comment at this time. A spokesman for the Governor said Mr. Rockefeller also would not comment until he had studied the council's recom mendations. Free education at the City University was mandated in the state education law for more than a century, but in 1961 the Legislature removed the mandate at the Governor's re quest. The removal gave the Board of Higher Education the authority to impose tuition. but it has never exercised the option. The Legislature could super sede the board and require that tuition be charged. However, to date, it has shown no disposi tion to do so. The Council of Economic Ad visers was created by the Gov ernor in 1968 to study and re port on economic developments in the state and to advise Mr. Rockefeller on state, local and regional economic and fiscal policies. The seven members are: Eugene R. Black, chairman, and former president of the Interna tional Bank for Reconstruction and Development. William F. Butler, vice president and chief economist of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Alan K. Campbell, dean of the Maxwell Graduate School of the University of Syracuse. Allan M. Cartter, chancellor and executive vice president of New York University. Paul W. MacAvoy, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. William H. Meckling, dean of the College of Business Administra tion at the University of Roch ester. William I. Myers, former dean of the College of Agriculture at Cornell University.

1202-> Tokyo: Kabuki, Rock and the Twain
TOKYO—Shusaku Endo, a Roman Catholic novelist who has sometimes been called the Japanese Graham Greene, is working on a new novel, a life of Christ as seen through the eyes of a fictitious 13th disciple. The novel will shift back and forth between the Palestine of Christ's day and the Japan of to day as it explores Mr. Endo's favor lite theme — the great distance be tween East and West, the isolation and lone liness in which each dwells beneath a surface show of comprehension and good fel lowship. Arts Abroad Two years ago, Mr. Endo's novel “Silence,” about two Portuguese Jesuit priests who apostatized during the perse cution of Christians in 17th century Japan, won wide critical acclaim. “Father, you were not defeated by me,” says the chief Japanese in quisitor to the novel's pro tagonist, Sebastian Rodrigues. “You were defeated by this swamp of Japan.” Or, as Mr. Endo expressed himself the other day: “Peo ple often say of Japan that it is a country with only a su perficial sense of philosophy, or of ideology. They say the Japanese lack originality, that they are intuitive rather than rational. That may be so. But what I sense about Japan is something sinister and uncanny, like a flower that sucks in and dissolves an insect with its own fluid.” “Silence,” incidentally, is being made into a film under the direction of Masahiro Shinoda. The film is likely to be a joint Japanese‐American enterprise, Mr. Endo said, with an international cast. Mr. Endo wrote the screen play himself, on Mr. Shino da's request. Mr. Shinoda, whose two most recent films took up well‐known Kabuki plays as seen through the keen, questioning but loving eyes of a contemporary and somewhat iconoclastic cine ast, has been scouring Japan for likely locations in which to shoot the film. Crank‐in time probably will be October. This summer, as in previous years, the National Theater atop Miyake Slope near the Diet has been presenting a series of Kabuki perform ances by younger actors, as much for their own training as for the pleasure of the au dience. The atmosphere of feudal times still surrounds the actors, as well as the roles they play, for to rise to the top in this world one must still be horn or adopted into some illustrious acting family. The oldest and most repre sentative of these study per formances by younger actors is the Kinomekai, or tree bud series, put on annually by the brothers Somegoro Ichikawa and Kichiemon Na kamura. Somegoro, who is 28 years old, spent two months on Broadway this spring play ing Don Quixote in “Man of La Mancha.” Kichiemon, 26, has been active on television and in the contemporary the ater, and was co‐star with Shima Iwashita in the first of Mr. Shinoda's recent film versions of Kabuki plays, the classic “Love Suicide at Ani jima.” “Musicals and Kabuki are like oil and water—they don't really mix,” Somegoro said in his strawmatted dressing room at the National Theater during the Kinomekai's 10th anniversary series last month. “I must confess I enjoy doing them both. Now that I have realized one ambition—to ap pear on a musical on Broad way, I hope to work toward another goal — to put on Shakespeare in the original. I was tremendously impressed by the Royal Shakespeare Company when it. came to Tokyo this winter — at the freshness of its concepts, the creativity of its perform ances.” In Kabuki, however, Some goro feels the scope for in ventiveness is limited. “This is a world in which you build up your interpretations, one step after another. It is not one in which, to give birth to the new, you have to destroy the old. You can perform Shakespeare in modern garb, but you cannot do that with Kabuki. As a play, yes; as Kabuki, no. Style is every thing in Kabuki—from cos tumes to gestures to timing. To me, the challenge of Ka buki is to keep the form, the style while making sure the performance is so alive there is instant communication with the audience.” Somegoro and Kichiemon started the Kinomekai in 1960, when they were still teen‐agers. The series gave them opportunities to play leading roles which, in the normal hierachical course of events, they would have had to wait years to absorb. For the anniversary, they chose the one‐act dance drama “‐Kanjincho” and a por tion of “Chushingura.” Both have been performed in New York during the visit last year of a troupe headed by Shoroku Onoe, uncle of Some goro and Kichiemon. Another recent returnee from New York is Shuji Tera yama, avant‐garde playwright and director whose style and subject matter seem at first glance to be the complete antithesis of stately Kabuki. and yet, says Mr. Terayama, he feels closer in spirit to Kabuki as originally per formed in the 17th and 18th centuries than to the type of Moscow Art Theater realism of Japan's orthodox contem porary theater companies. Currently, Mr. Terayama is directing a rock musical, “Baron Bura Bura,” at the open‐air stage in Korakuen amusement park. In New York earlier this summer, Mr. Terayama used American actors to put on an Off Broadway performance of his play, “Mink Marie.” At Korakuen this month, he has adapted Aristophanes's com edy ‘Lysistrata” into a mod ern antiwar improvisation, using masks and enormous, grotesque dolls as well as live actors from his Tenjo Sajiki Company. Mr. Terayama has retained the basic idea of “Lysistrata” —that women will withhold their sexual favors from their husbands and lovers until the latter give up their favorite sport, war. He con cludes his version with a question, and the success of the play depends on with how light a touch the ques tion is asked. There is a truce, the men return to their wives and then manage once more to go off to war, de lighted that they have had their cake and eaten it, too. Is this to be allowed? Can the students and young people who form the bulk of this au dience raise their voices in shrill protest against the war in Vietnam, against the man eating American war ma chine, and at the same time lead perfectly happy hedonis tic lives replete with sex and drugs or with more mundane dreams of my‐car or my home? Mr. Terayama says of the theater: “It doesn't matter if a piece is ephemeral. What matters is that it be alive. Kabuki as performed today is a museum piece, but in its origins it was splendidly alive. The living theater we build up in each day's performance may be ephemeral, but it has the power to make history, not to repeat it.”

Miss Diana Davenport, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Braxton Bragg Davenport of Lancaster, Pa., was married on June 3 in Athens to E. Haring Chandor, a stock broker with Shearson, Ham mill & Co. The ceremony in the American Protestant Church was performed by the Rev. Dr. Otto Meinardus. The bride, who attended Bryn Mawr College and was graduated in 1962 from the University of Hawaii, is free lancing in fashion public re lations. Her father is a re tired Naval officer. The bridegroom, a 1942 graduate of Princeton Uni versity, is the son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Reginald M. Chandor of New York. His father was an editor and publisher of material on in surance law. Previous mar riages for Mr. Chandor ended in divorce.

1204-> Retreat From the Moon
It cannot have been easy for Dr. Thomas O. Paine to end his tenure as head of NASA by announcing what amounts to a retreat from the moon well before all hoped‐for scientific objectives have been achieved. The decision to cancel two of the six remaining Apollo flights and to terminate Project Apollo within less than two years means that, even at best, the return on the huge national investment in this program will be much less than originally anticipated. An incredibly intricate technology and the elaborate organization built to exploit that technology are, in effect, being abandoned. And as the expert teams that made pos sible the historic feats of Apollo 11 and 12 are dis solved, it will become ever more difficult and more expensive—in time and money—to recreate them should a change in policy later seem desirable. This nation spent roughly $24 billion to put the first men on the moon. Now, little more than a year after that triumph, the already limited program to utilize this new capability is being cur back a third to make savings that will amount at most to $60 mil lion this year, less than 2 per cent of the expected $3‐billion‐plus NASA budget for fiscal 1971, and less than a quarter of 1 per cent of the over‐all investment. The budgetary myopia which forced this penny wise, pound‐foolish decision can only vindicate the critics who have insisted that Apollo was motivated by purely prestige considerations, not scientific goals. It is being abandoned now that the easily bored world audience has begun to yawn. All this represents an inglorious letdown for an effort whose brilliant out come was and is one of the proudest fruits of human ingenuity and courage. Throughout the last decade this newspaper opposed the top priority then accorded Project Apollo on the ground that too much money was being diverted from urgent social needs. But now that these huge sums have been spent the need is to obtain the maxi mum yield, scientifically and otherwise, from that investment. Surely, NASA, which has been able to reach the moon, can find a better solution than the one now offered for adjusting to austerity in space research. One desirable alternative would be to enlist foreign resources in the exploitation of Apollo technology, perhaps by offering to send teams of British, French or Soviet astronauts on the journey pioneered by Apollo 11.

1206-> Text of Nixon's Statement
WASHINGTON, March 25 —Following is the text of a statement issued today by President Nixon proposing legislation to deal with crim inal bombings and bomb threats: Recent months have brought an alarming increase in the number of criminal bombings in the cities of our country. In recent weeks the situation has become partic ularly acute, as telephoned threats and actual bombings have sent fear through many American communities. Schools and public build ings have had to be evacuat ed; considerable property has been destroyed; lives have been lost. Clearly, many of these bombings have been the work of political fanatics, many of them young crim inals posturing as romantic. revolutionaries. They must be dealt with as the potential murderers they are. Under existing law, the transport of explosives across state lines is, under some circumstances, a Federal crime. I am proposing an ex tensive strengthening and ex pansion of that law. In the propbsals being sent to the Congress, it is asked that: ¶Anyone involved in the transport or receipt in com merce of explosives, intend ing their unlawful use, be made subject to imprison ment for 10 years or a fine of $10,000 or both. The cur rent maximum penalty is a single year in prison or a $1,000 fine or both. ¶The maximum penalty he doubled to 20 years in prison or a $20,000 fine or both if anyone is injured as the ultimate result of such transport of explosives. ¶ Penalties for bomb threats be raised from one year in prison to a maximum of five years or $5,000 fine or both. ¶ Incendiary devices he in cluded in the category of “explosives.” bringing such devices under the anti‐bomb ing provisions. ¶Use of explosives to damage or destroy any building, vehicle or other property owned or leased to the Federal Government be made a Federal crime. ¶Possession, without writ ten authorization, of any ex plosive in such a building be made a Federal crime. ¶Use of explosives to damage or destroy any building or property used for business purposes by any person or firm engaged in interstate commerce, or in any activity affecting such commerce, be made a Fed eral crime. ¶Possession of explosives with the intent to damage either Federal property or property used in its business by a person engaged in in terstate commerce also be made a Federal crime. ¶The individual engaged in the transport or use of explosives in violation of these provisions be made subject to the death penalty if a fatality occurs. Our purpose in bringing these crimes under Federal jurisdiction is not to displace state or local authority. Fed eral investigations and prose cutions would begin only after the Attorney General had determined that interven tion by the national Govern ment is necessary in the pub lic interest. Our purpose is rather to assist state and local govern ments in their efforts to com bat the multiplying number of acts of urban terror. I am also asking that Law Enforce ment Assistance Administra tion funds be specifically designated for special train ing programs for state and local law enforcement agen cies to aid them in coping with this latest threat to the public safety and the main tenance of a free and open society. The anarchic and criminal elements who perpetrate such acts deserve no more patience or indulgence. It is time to deal with them for what they arc.

1207-> Weekend Fishing and Boating
AREA A — “Fair to mid dling” is the report along the Jersey coast, with the catch es of blues, weakfish and bass along the beach seem ing to improve the farther north you go. John Falkiew icz called the surf picture fair at Surf City, with the bay area a bit better. Snap pers, some weakfish and fluke were biting at the south end of the bay, he said, although the big story was crabbing, which was “very, very good.” AREA B — At Sea Bright, however, the report was ex cellent. Striped bass up to 40 pounds, bluefish from one to 3½ pounds and weakfish 2 to 4 pounds were “all over the beach,” according to Norman Giglio. The reason, he indicated, was that the waters were filled with bait fish. Boats were also doing well trolling. Ron Crawford of Mt. Holly nabbed a 40‐ pound striper, while Herb Gmeineder of Union snagged a 37½‐pounder on a rigged eel. Off Freeport, L.I., blues were reported plentiful, es pecially near The Stain. At the BA Buoy, albalore and bonita were being taken by, chumming. AREA C—Halfway out on the island, Bob Kondrick of Mastic Beach said that nice sized weakfish were being taken around Smith Point Bridge and in the deeper waters. There are plenty of kingfish around, too, he said. Snappers were also biting, and if you want crabs, the picture is extremely healthy. Farther out at Montauk, bad weather has spoiled it for urf fishermen, but boats are finding a lot of blues and bass. There is still some tuna offshore. AREA D—In Southold Bay, weakfishing was very, very good, said Peter Lieblein, and should stay that way until the cold weather hits. Best spots: Old Brickyard and Buoy 16. Best bait: squid and sand worms. Porgies also plentiful. Also a lot of kingfish in the area. At Orient Point, blacks are starting to get better. Larger boats are having ex cellent luck at The Race. George Laub of Greenport caught 130 blues by noon time, all over eight pounds. Pigeon Rip was described as another spot for big blues as well as stripers. Quite a few small flounder still around. AREA E—Bluefishing is good all along the coast. Bet ter spots include The Race, Little Gull Island and Plum Island. Large striped bass, 25–30 pounds, are being taken off the Norwalk Islands. School stripers are abundant, but most are under the legal size limit. Flounder fishing is picking up at Stonington Harbor and the mouth of the Mystic River.

1208-> Gen. Pierre Koenig, Hero of World War II, Dead
PARIS, Sept. 3—General of the Army Pierre Koenig, one ' of France's most prestigious military leaders in World War II and a leading champion of French‐Israeli friendship, died last night at the American Hos pital of Paris in suburban Neuilly, following surgery. He was 71 years old. Pierre Marie Joseph Fran cois Koenig, who has many an avenue and boulevard to his name all over France, figures in French history books as “the victor of Bir Hakeim.” Bir Hakeim is a small speck on the map of eastern Libya. In the summer of 1942 it marked the outermost position of the British Eighth Army's left flank southwest of Tobruk. The British were being pushed back towards the Egyptian bor der by Gen. Erwin Rommel's German Afrika Corps. The 5,600 men of the Free French first light brigade, freshly arrived from Syria, were put in charge of defending Bir Hakeim. It was the first time that French forces were directly pitted against the Germans since the fall of France two years before. For 15 gruelling days, the French were to sustain a siege by vastly superior enemy forces after ignoring an ultimatum to “surrender in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.” Gen eral Koenig lost 946 men. But the delay afforded the British allies time to consolidate their positions. Thus the stage could be set for El Alamein, the vic torious battle that marked the turning point in the desert war. Pierre Koenig, born at Caen, Normandy, on ‘ Oct. 10, 1898, of Alsatian parents, had a long military career behind him. A volunteer in 1917, he ended World War I as a second lieu tenant. As a captain with the Foreign Legion, he fought in Morocco in the early thirties in 1940 he participated in the ill‐fated Battle of Norway as a major with the French Expedi tionary Corps. That same year he was one of the first officers to join Gen. Charles de Gaulle in London. At the head of Free French units, he successively, fought in black Africa and the Near East before moving to the desert. Having become a symbol of France's ability to play her part in winning the war, Gen eral Koenig in 1944 was named General de Gaulle's chief dele gate to General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower's Allied High Command. He was put in charge of both the French forces in Britain and the French underground Army of the In terior. He play an important role in planning the latter's har assing operations against the occupation forces and he walked down the Champs Ely sees in the victory parade with General de Gaulle. For four years after war's) end General Koenig became General de Gaulle's viceroy in occupied Germany as com mander in chief of French forces in that country. General Koenig — towering, gaunt, dark and with characteristic trim black mus tache — thereafter embarked on a political career. Elected Gaullist deputy for Strasbourg in the national assembly, he was twice a Minister of De fense, under the premierships lof Pierre Mendes‐France and Edgar Faure. The first time in 1954 the maverick general re signed over the issue of Ger man rearmament, which he op posed. The second time the following year he also resigned because of his opposition to a policy preparing the way for granting independence to Morocco. Following his retirement from the army in 1959, General Koenig devoted much of his considerable energy to the cause of French‐Israeli under standing. He was president of the French‐Israeli Solidarity Committee and the French‐Is raeli Friendship Society. Himself a Catholic, General Koenig explained that, all other arguments aside, he was pro Israeli “for strategic reasons.” He argued that Israel was the only possible bulwark against a Soviet takeover of the Arab world. In recent years, the general thus consistently spoke out against the French embargo on arms delivery to Israel. He was praised today by both the grand rabbi of France and the Israeli Ambassador. Rabbi Jacob Kaplan called him “an excellent, sincere and faithful friend” of Israel. Ambassador Walter Eytan said “the whole Israeli nation had total confi dence in him.” General Koenig, after his re tirement, became a member of the board of several corpora tions, including an oil company with considerable interests in Arab North Africa. His pro Israeli activities at one point prompted the Arab League to demand his ouster from the oil company. The demand had no effect.

1209-> Market Place:
In the oil exploration game, a world in which puffery is not unheard of, Charles Hann defiritely must be regarded as a low‐key op erator. Ask the conservatively tressed vice president of the Apache Corporation what cind of profits you can ex aect as a subscriber to one of Apache's programs and he razes at you piercingly as though to give you a big build‐up. But he then says, modestly, “Maybe not so large as you would get in a top‐notch investment of an other sort.” Then Lancelot‐like, he goes on to downgrade the pros pects further saying, there is “no magic” in oil invest ment. However, Apache investors are protected against disaster through the company's con servative approach to oil ex ploration, Mr. Hann says. He adds that the investor should get a 5 per cent after tax return on his investment and that “most important and the reason he comes to us in the first place,” is that he is exposed to the oppor tunity for a substantial gain. He explained that there is a chance for a five‐to‐one return—if Apache gets a big strike. “We have not had one like that so far. We do have a program that looks like a three‐to‐one return and a couple of others which look like two or even three to one. This is out of 25 programs. We are starting our 26th now. “The possibility of that big strike is what makes this thing attractive. What is wrong is to lead the innocent investor into believing that the odds are greater than they really are. Most people who buy into oil exploration companies are disappointed because they don't under stand that most of the time we fail.” Apache is regarded in Wall Street as one of the more conservatively managed oil exploration companies. In fact, Apache sells few subscriptions through invest ment bankers because the company has found many in vestment bankers unwilling to accept responsibility for their salesmen's statements arguing that they can't control what they say. Mr Hann says, “That's a lot of baloney.” “Anyone in this business knows that it is sufficiently complex so that no investor an make a judgement on what is good to do and what isn't. The investor must trust the company and the corn pany that accepts his money, must accept the responsibility of the trust. “Many newcomers in this tusiness see it as an oppor tunity to raise capital for their oil business. This is un fair to the participant be cause this raises a conflict of interest. Say that an oil com pany has a first‐class lease and have the choice of drill ing for their investors or for themselves. That's a serious conflict. That's why we do not operate in our behalf. “Other exploration compa nies raise capital and place it with one or more inde pendent oil companies, leav ing the responsibility for op erations to others. We feel you must take the full re sponsibility for acquiring the land, doing geology, geo physical work and hiring the contractors to find the oil.” Mr. Hann said that Apache had had over 1,500 investors since the company was reg istered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1956. Apache is the oldest registered company. A com pany that started earlier is no longer offering subscription plans. Of the 1,500 investors, Apache has refunded money to about a dozen. This was the result of protests by the investors and a company de termination that the invest ment was unsuitable. By and large, oil explora tion subscriptions have ap peal for taxpayers with combined tax rate of 50 per cent or better. This puts the investor more or less on an equal footing with the oil companies that have a raw tax rate of about 50 per cent, A unit subscription in Apache costs $15,000 al though the company will also set units in thirds for a mini mum $5,000 investment. A major tax advantage for the investor in the 50 per cent bracket or higher is that he can invest $15,000 out of pre‐tax earnings and receive a deduction of about $12,000 for the year. This takes into account the vari ous tax preferences available to investors in oil. This would mean a tax savings of $6,000 for the 50 per cent taxpayer.

1214-> A ‘DEAL’ IS CHARGED IN PANTHERS' TRIAL
JERSEY CITY, March 25 — The defense counsel for one of the Black Panthers accused of machine gunning a police station here in 1968, charged today that the prime prosecu tion witness had made a deal with the Hudson County's Prosecutor's office to avoid prosecution of himself as a participant in the attack. The accusation — denied by the witness — was made by Raymond A. Brown. The wit ness, John Wesley Maxwell, has testified that he joined in the scheme to attack the Greenville section police station on the night of Nov. 29, 1968. He has also said he decided to “make a clean breast of it” and to cooperate with James A. Tumulty Jr., the Hudson County Prosecutor. On trial before County Judge Edward F. Hammill and an all‐white jury of nine men and five women are Isaiah Rowley, 26 years old, of Jersey City, a truck driver; Charles Hicks, 35, also of Jersey City, a welder, and Victor Perez, 20, of 584 Knickerbocker Ave nue, Brooklyn. Mr. Brown represents Mr. Rowley. Mr. Hicks and Mr. Perez are being defended by Seymour Goldstaub. Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor John J. Carlin is conducting the prosecution. A recess was called in order to permit Mr. Carlin, at his re quest, to ascertain if any such deal had been made outside his knowledge by the Prosecutor's office or the police. The court reconvened at the end of a half‐hour, and Mr. Carlin told the court that he found no evi dence of such promises of im munity to Mr. Maxwell.

1216-> KENT SLAYINGS LAID TO MILITARY BULLETS
KENT, Ohio, May 18 (AP)— The Portage County coroner, Dr. Robert Sybert, said today that the wounds that killed four Kent State University stu dents May 4 “were caused by bullets similar to .30‐caliber military ammunition” National Guard officials had said there was evidence that some of the four dead and nine wounded were hit by non military bullets. Dr. Sybert said in his au topsy report that whether the deaths “are accidental or homicidal is undetermined and under continuing inquiry at this time.” He gave no indication in his two‐sentence report what he meant by the phrase “similar to,” and he was not immediate ly available for further com ment. Lieut. Col. J. E. P. McCann, administrative aide to Adj. Gen. S. T. Del Corso, said the National Guard had not seen the report and would not com ment until it had an opportu nity to review it. “I think we have established that there was another weapon fired,” Colonel McCann said, citing a physician's statement concerning an injury suffered by one of nine students wound ed during the shooting. The four students died dur ing a confrontation between Ohio National Guardsmen and demonstrators who had defied a guard order banning as sembly.

1217-> SHORE WILL WINS WESTBURY EVENT
WESTBURY, L. I., Feb. 14— Prince Butler's name vanished from the list of unbeaten standardbreds tonight as the 4‐year‐old son of Adios Butler Ladry Scotland finished fifth in the $12,500, featured one‐mile handicap pace in the snow at Roosevelt Raceway. Following five triumphs in as many outings, the bay was no match for Shore Will, the winner; Cardinal Garrison, Le high Boy and Sampson Counsel. The Prince earned 5 per cent of the purse for this junior free for‐all, Class AA race, beating only Dillrod and Meadow Elva. The last‐named needed to win to become the world's greatest money‐winning pacing mare. Norman Dauplaise drove Lee Benson's Shore Will to a head decision over Cardinal Garrison, handled by John Chapman. Del Insko, had the reins on Lehigh Boy. The top three figured in a blanket finish. Cardinal Gar rison saved the place by a nose. Shore Will, a 6‐year‐old gelded son of Eastern Shore Evenmor, returned $9.60 for $2 to win. He has raced twice this season. The time, following a final quarter of 30 seconds, was 2:03 1/5. Racing conditions were made miserable by a 15‐mile wind, a relentless snowfall and a bit ing cold. Because of the weath er, Many fans arrived late, as Lucien Fontaine, who was to have driven Shore Will. Fontaine and his wife, Mar cia, en route from their home at Tarrytown, N. Y., had a traffic accident, but nobody was injured. Dauplaise, however, took good care of Loosh's interests. He saved ground with Shore Will after having left from the outside No. 7 post, moved to the outside briefly at the top of the stretch, then switched to the inside when he discov ered an opening along the rail. Shore Will squeezed through and proceeded to triumph. Hunch players, encouraged( by the previous night's Friday the‐13th clicking of a 1, 3 daily double ($29.80), took an other chance. Quite a few hacked Snowy Valentine at 3‐1, but the mare finished seventh in the opening race. Insko disclosed that he had turned over to the Nassau County police on Thursday an anonymous obscene, threaten ing letter. Del reached the 2,500 victory mark that night. ??

1220-> Why Block Reform?
Unless Congress takes action this week to block President Nixon's proposal for streamlining the Execu tive Branch of the government, an effective reform will automatically go into operation this summer. The plan was developed by an advisory council, drawing on the work of earlier commissions. The need to give more form to what has become an administrative sprawl is glaringly apparent. And the recommenda tions themselves appear to make excellent sense. The heart of the proposal is to give the President two institutional arms for the performance of his staggering responsibilities. A National Domestic Coun cil, composed of appropriate Cabinet officers and agency heads and supported by a staff and executive director, would advise the President on the entire range of domestic policy, integrating its various aspects into a coherent pattern and providing a sense of continuity. An Office of Management and Budget would do more than take over the present Budget Bureau's function of preparing the annual budget and taking a financial hand in recommended legislation. It would be the President's field reporter in determining whether Federal programs were being carried out efficiently, economically and effectively—in short, whether the public was getting its money's worth. A major reorganization of this sort is bound to have aspects of varying appeal. We wonder, for example, if the Budget Bureau has not already grown too powerful. But if its scope would perhaps be broadened still further under the President's plan, it would also be brought under closer public scrutiny, with account ability more firmly fixed. The Domestic Council would give Cabinet officers, some of whom are now smarting from a sense of Presidential neglect, a greater opportunity to contribute to the over‐all policies of the Administration. The arrangement whereby such changes as these are left to the Executive, subject only to Con gressional veto, shows where the responsibility for effective administration really lies. Congress should leave it there.

1222-> French Combating Litter After Outbreak of Fires
LA PIOLINE, France, Aug. —A rash of fires in town dumps has spurred French authorities to try to cope better with one of western Europe's most apparent environmental problems: the mourning masses of litter that scar the countryside. Several of the recent forest fires that blackened tens of thousands of acres of greenery in southern France have been traced to garbage dumps. Many of the dumps like the one at this hamlet near Aix‐enProvince offer prime tinder for a casually tossed match or cigarette. A forest fire was averted here the other day when firemen arrived in time to put out flames that began in a pile of pine boughs and spread through the dump's bonbon wrappers cigarette packages and other waste. “They should stop the dumping—and they should stop the people from throwing cigarettes.” complained Paul Marin, the stocky farmer who works across the highway. Alarmed by such fires, the Government has moved to restrict dumping and to frame new national policy concerning what it calls “the erosion of beauty” in the countryside. Other western European countries, notably West Germany and Belgium have also been plagued with growing quantities of solid waste. They have been using new equipment and techniques to attack the problem. The French Government said in a recent report to the Council of Europe that France's “coastal zones, notably in the south, are particularly threatened by the rush of tourists.” Growing numbers of transient vacationers and summer residents have strained existing refuse disposal facilities. They have also disfigured the landscape with what specialists call “decharges sauvagcs,” or wild garbage. This is litter that is simply thrown away anywhere. not even in a dump. Some refuse is smoldering already when it is discarded. and some is set afire on burpose, or lighted by accident. To cope with the immediate ?? problem, the French Government has instructed provincial administrators to forbid garbage dumping within 200 yards of wooded areas. But motor tour of this area suggested that this directive was bung widely ignored.

1223-> Cambodians, in Retreat,Talk of Their Battle
CHILEA BRIDGE, Cambodia, Aug. 2—For some 100 tired and hungry Cambodian soldiers huddled here, the muddy stream running beneath this whitewashed bridge is today's front line in the Cambodian war. Across it, nine miles to the east on Route 7, lies the small district town of Skoun, from which the men retreated last night after being outgunned and outmanned by Communist forces invading the town. When reinforcements and ammunition arrive, the men know, they will head back down the road and, after more men have died on both sides, the Communists will withdraw from Skoun. As the soldiers waited today, they told of the battle. The Communist attack on Skoun began shortly about 1 A.M. yesterday with mortar fire, exploding in volleys of five around the town's Government garrison of nearly 200 men. Without machine guns and firing five different kinds of handme‐down rifles, the Government soldiers were slowly pushed out of the town, 37 miles north northeast of Pnompenh. ‘They Had Everything’ “They had everything,” the company commander, who asked to be unnamed, said of the enemy. “They had mortars, machine guns and radios. They even had loudspeakers they used to relay orders to each other.” By 1 P.M. yesterday, the captain said, 11 of his men had been killed and 54 had been wounded, and the enemy had gained the center of the town after leaving 20 of their own dead, including a young Vietcong girl, in the swampy fields around Skoun. A lull settled on the town. and the captain sought to call For reinforcements and new supplies on his company's antiquated United States Army radio. During the night of fighting, the radio had not been able to reach a Government airplane circling overhead to give directions for bombing enemy positions, so the plane only dropped flares and flew off at daybreak. “It didn't matter, I guess” the captain said in French. “We were fighting man‐to‐man and bombs would have hurt us as much as the Communists.” The radio was not able to reach 25 miles to battalion headquarters at Kampong Cham either, so no reinforcements came. Cambodians Retreated By five in the afternoon, the Government forces were out of ammunition. With the road in enemy hands, they began an allnight march west across the swampy countryside, bearing their wounded through streams and tangled forests, to the bridge and the school house here. They arrived at noon today, and the strain showed in the captain's eyes as he slowly made out his report in a tiny, round handwriting. “You know,” a soldier said, “we have not had anything to eat since the fighting began except one little lump of rice.” But the man managed to grin as he spoke. “Our morale is good,” the captain said. “But if you don't have proper guns and enough ammunition, you begin to feel despair.” As he spoke, five civilian ambulances from Pnompenh arrived to carry off 26 of the most seriously wounded. Two civilian buses and a dump truck arrived with 100 fresh troops and a meager supply of ammunition. A few soldiers made disgusted noises when they say’ that there was none to it their World War I Spring field rifles. Shortly afterward, the first refugee family from Skoun crossed the bridge on a rickety two‐wheeled cart drawn by a motorbike. They had come to escape the Government counterattack, the man said, adding that more families were coming.

1224-> Sewage‐Control Law for Boats Takes Effect Next Sunday
State Health Department, which has refused to approve any of the macerator‐chlori nator devices that treat sew age before discharging it into the water. The boat owner is saying, in effect, “Why me? All the big guys are 10 times dirtier than I am, and they're all still out there playing in the mud.” The “big guys” are the cities, towns and indus tries that continue to pour millions of gallons of raw, untreated sewage into the state's waters every day. “It's the wrong solution,” says Charles Sagar of the Boating Antipollution Coun cil, the major lobby group opposing the new regulation. “All it does is carry this stuff around and it never takes care of it. Unless the law says all sewage must receive secondary treatment, there's no real gain.” In response, Dr. Meredith Thompson of the Health De partment pointed out that the boat regulation was merely one aspect of a much broader antipollution program in New York. “You have to start some where,” he said. “Eventually, we hope to control every source of water pollution in he state.” A $1.7‐billion bond issue approved by New York voters three years ago is aimed at forcing every municipality and industry in the state to establish secondary‐treatment facilities for sewage. “We're not opposed to macerator ‐chlorinators per se,” Dr. Thompson said. “All we know is the existing ones simply don't meet our stand ards.” Meanwhile, pump‐out sta tions are being built at public and private sites around the state (see map on this page) to service boats equipped with the required holding tanks. Here are the answers to some of the major questions being asked by generally con fused boat owners: Q. How many boats will be affected? A. Of the state's $425,000 registered pleasure boats, 55, 000 are believed to have marine toilets. The law also applies to about 10,000 com mercial craft, such as tugs, but riot to vessels that are subject to quarantine regula tions. The larger vessels, such as ocean liners, have sewage treatment facilities as good as the best shoreside systems. Q. How many boats already are equipped with holding tanks? A. Only about 2,500, most ly in areas such as Lake George and Greenwood Lake, where it has been illegal for yea'rs to discharge any sew age, treated or untreated, in to the water. Q. Does the new law mean boats with macerator‐chlori nators will have to remove them? A. No. The effluent pro duced by these units can simply be transferred to holding tank. Actually, only a few thousand boats in New York have chlorinators. The vast majority of the 55,000 toilet ‐equipped pleasure boats, as well as the commer cial vessels, have been pump ing their raw sewage into the Water. Q. Where will boats be able to get pumped out? A. New York has appro priated $250,000 to install pumping stations at 25 state operated marinas. Of these, three are in Long Island waters, one on the Hudson River, and 21 upstate. In addi tion, 114 privately operated pumping stations are either completed or expected to be completed by next week. Other private marinas, more than 160 of them, are con sidering building stations. Q. How much will each pump‐out cost? A. State stations plan coin operated, self‐service units at a cost of 50 cents. At private marinas, the service charge is expected to average about $3.50, with a low of $1 and a high of $4.50. Q. Will the sewage removec from the boat at the pump out station be pumped back into the nearby water just as it came out of the boat? A. No Marinas without ac ceptable shoreside treatment or removal systems will not be approved by the Health Department as pumping sites. Q. How many devices have been approved? A. Five, so far. Three are recirculating Monomatic toi lets from Monogram Indus tries, Inc., of Los Angeles, similar to those built by the company for jet aircraft, campers, trailers and buses. These are somewhat more compact than regular holding tanks, yet offer longer use, because the flushing water Is re‐used, or “recirculated.” The other two approved de vices are basic holding tanks: the Sani‐Tank, from the Sani Tank Corporation of Auburn, N.Y., and the Jonny Trap, from Joseph B. Stinson Com pany of Fremont, Ohio. These add about three‐quarters of a gallon of water to the tank with every flush. Q. What are the capacities and prices? A. Monogram's models are the 3‐S Low Profile (six gal lons). Each sells for $256 and each cycle of the units begin with a charge of four gallons of water and certain chemi cals. The Sani‐Tank, a 24‐gal lon unit, costs $156 and the Jonny Trap (20 gallons) $140, not including the fittings. Additional devices, from these and other companies are ex pected to be approved in the near future. Q. Where can the devices be bought? A. At most marinas and boat‐supply stores. Five dis tributors are servicing the Metropolitan New York area, where a third of the State's boats are based, and there are at least two major up state distributors. Q. How are holding tanks installed? A. They can be installed by the boat owner, if he's rea sonably handy with wrench, screw driver and drill, or they can be installed by boat yards at a cost of $10 to $100, depending on the size of the boat. Q. Do the tanks have to be vented to the outside of the boat? A. Yes, by the use of a through‐hull fitting. Q. Is there any danger of a holding tank exploding as a result of improper venting? A. The State Division of Motor Boats, the agency charged with approving pollution ‐control devices from a safety standpoint, says no. Q. Does the law apply to all waters in New York, coastal as well as inland? A. Yes. Q. Can it be enforced? A. State officials acknowl edge that enforcement will be difficult without help from local police departments. Q. What are the penalties for violation of the new law? A. A $100 fine or up to 60 days in jail, or both. Q. Could pending Federal pollution‐control bills over ride the New York legisla tion? A. Yes, but the outlook for that appears unlikely. Pres ent indications are that the Federal law will establish minimum requirements, while at the same time allowing the states to demand stricter standards if they want. Q. If a boat is registered in another state, such as New Jersey or Connecticut, will it be the subject to the New York law if it enters that state? A. Yes. Q. If the owner of a toilet equipped boat decides not to buy one of the pollution control devices, what does the law require? A. It requires that the toi let be sealed and the through hull fitting plugged so that the toilet cannot be used. Q. What about incinera tors? A. The Health Department apparently feels they would meet its pollution‐control standards, but none of the devices has been submitted for approval, and the Divi sion of Motor Boats indicates it would reject them as un safe. The controversy over boat pollution control began in 1966, when the State Legis lature passed an amendment to the Navigation Law pro hibiting the discharge of un treated sewage into the water. The amendment stipu lated that every marine toi let should be equipped with a pollution‐control device ap proved from a health stand point by the Health Depart merit and from a safety standpoint by the Division of Motor Boats. In October of 1968, the Health Department decided that only holding tanks or incinerators would meet its standards, and the new law was set to become effective on March 1, 1969. When boat groups objected, public hear ings were held, and enforce ment of the law was delayed for one year—to next Sun day. Meanwhile, the boatmen initiated a bill that would permit the use of on‐board treatment devices such as macerator‐chlorinators. The bill passed the State Senate in the spring of 1969, but died in the Assembly with out a vote. Boatmen contin ued their efforts this year, and, until recently, a compro mise on the pollution‐control law appeared likely. The boating groups ob ject to the holding‐tank con cept on three counts: 1) Not enough pump‐out stations, 2) Aesthetically unpleasant, “the idea of having your own sew age in bed with you,” and 3) No guarantee that the sewage pumped out of the boat will receive acceptable treatment at shore facilities. They say the effluent pro duced by chlorinators is not as important in the legislative action as the affluence of the boat owners. “They're making us the whipping boys,” a boating official said. “The politicians are saying, See, we're sock ing it to the rich guy But they're ignoring the munici palities and industries that are contributing most of the pollution.” Boat spokesmen estimate that a third of New York's towns and cities have second‐ ary‐treatment facilities, an other third have only pri mary‐treatment systems and the remaining third have no treatment at all, simply pumping their untreated sew age into the rivers, bays and lakes. “New York City alone pumps 500 million gallons a week of raw sewage into the Hudson River each week,” said Sagar. “The new‐gener ation macerator ‐chlorinators are as effective as secondary treatment plants, but the Health Department refuses to test them.” Dr. Thompson, responding for the Health Department, said that his department was not in the testing business. “We don't test anything,” he said. “We have a set of standards, and the manufac turers can have their devices tested against those stand ards by any of the acceptable laboratory groups, such as the Yacht Safety Bureau. The existing chlorinators don't meet our standards.” Macerator ‐chlorinators grind up the sewage into small particles and treat it heavily with chlorine before discharging it into the water. If properly operated, this system compares favorably with shoreside treatment processes in three of the four critical factors of sewage treatment: bacteria, nutrients (amount of nitrates and phos pates released into the water) and biochemical oxygen de mand (amount of oxygen taken from the water and needed to dissolve the ef fuent). The fourth factor (solids) is the key one in the dispute. Macerator‐chlorinators grind up the solids into a liquid emulsion, but they do not re move them from the water. If the water was filtered, solids could be taken out. “The devices just don't take anything out of the sew age,” says Dr. Thompson. “They'll have to develop a macerator ‐chlorinator that does.”

1225-> Yarborough Says Apathy, War and Prayer Issue Defeated Him
HOUSTON, May 3—Senator Ralph W. Yarboroough said to day that he was defeated for renomination yesterday by voter apathy, war weariness and, primarily, the last‐minute introduction as a campaign issue of his vote against a pub lic school prayer proposal. However, a Democratic Texas Congressman who fol lowed the Yarborough cam paign closely, Representative Robert C. Eckhardt of Houston, said that a preliminary analysis showed the Senator did not get the strong labor vote he had been counting on. The 66‐year‐old liberal Sena tor believed, however, that the prayer issue did the most harm because he did not have time to answer it adequately. Mr. Yarborough's vote against the late Senator Ever ett McKinley Dirksen's pro posal to allow public school prayer was raised as an issue in the last days of the campa ign by Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr., the Houston millionaire who won the Democratic nomina tion by a margin oof 90,000 to 100,000 votes. Senator Yarborough has depended on a coalition of liberals, Negroes, Mexican Americans and labor union members as a base of power in his numerous campaigns in Texas. In two industrialized areas where organized labor has been strong — Beaumont and Orange in the southeastern Texas oil belt — Mr. Bentsen led Senator Yarborough. Statewide, about 10 per cent of the votes still had not been counted today. The Texas Elec tions Bureau, which unofficially tabulates returns in Texas elections, said in Dallas this afternoon that the latest count showed Mr. Bentsen, a 49‐year‐ old insurance man, ahead 793, 942 to 706,147. Mr. Bentsen's upset victory was something of a personal triumph for former Gov. John B. Connally Jr., now a Houston lawyer, who persuaded Mr. Bentsen to run. Senator Yar borough and Mr. Connally have long been bitter enemies, and it was to try to patch up quarrels between them that President Kennedy went to Texas in November, 1963. Former President Lyndon B. Johnson took no part, offi cially or unofficially in the race. This was the second time that the prayer prposal had been an important campaign issue in the Southwest. In 1968, Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma was almost de feated by a virtually unknown political figure who made Sen ator Harris's votes against the Dirksen amendment the major issue in the campaign. However, political polls taken in Texas a week before yesterday's primary had one‐time Congressman who quit the House after three terms in 1955 to go into busi ness, was closing the gap be tween himself and Senator Yarborough. Mr. Bentsen had adopted President Nixon's “Southern strategy” as a campaign tac tic and it called Senator Yar borough “too liberal for Texas.” He attacked Mr. Yar borough's votes against Judges Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell for the Supreme Court, and he criticized the Senator for fail ing to vote on a bill to pro hibit forced busing of pupils public schools. A preliminary analysis of voting patterns showed that Senator Yarborough maintain ed his appeal to Negro and Maxican‐American voters in general. However, in Southwest Texas many Mexican‐Ameri cans boycotted the primaries to take part in a convention of a Mexican‐American third party, the Raza Unida, which nominated 15 candidates for of fice in three counties. Mr. Bentsen's victory will bring him into this fall's gen eral election against Represen tative George Bush, a 45‐year‐ old Houston oilman who easily won the Republican nomination yesterday over a college presi dent, Dr. Robert Morris.

1226-> In the Excelsior, Bitterness Replaces Tenant Unity
The Excelsior, at 303 East 57th Street, is an apartment house divided against itself. There is bitterness among old friends. Nextdoor neighbors once on friendly terms ride in the same elevator without speaking. Some tenants will soon be moving out after only brief tenancy in the three‐and‐a‐half‐year‐old, 47‐story luxury building, the tallest apartment building in New York. These frayed feelings are the upshot of the June 4 announcement by the Excelsior's owners that they had achieved the consent of 35 per cent of the tenants—the percentage required by law to make a co‐op conversion plan operative. By the expiration of their leases, in many cases by this September, tenants will have to buy their apartments or move. Among the tenants, all was not forever so disharmonious. Six months ago, when the owners first announced their proposed terms for a conversion, the tenants met and vowed to fight the plan. They chose Joseph Eckhaus, a lawyer, to lead them. At that meeting he denounced the proposal of the owners, 303 Associates, as “avaricious.” Two weeks ago Mr. Eckhaus bought his own apartment. The price was 40 per cent lower than the original price at which the apartment was offered, he said the other day. “Very frankly, I looked around and saw what was available,” he said. “There were very few comparable apartments around. Discretion was the better part of valor.” But there were other tenants who felt they were “sold out” by Mr. Eckhaus and other tenant leaders. They feel that these leaders were “bought off” by the owners, who reduced the prices of larger apartments drastically but raised the prices of smaller apartments. Under the amended plan, a tworoom apartment with bath on the sixth floor is selling for $17,500. Under the original plan, the price was $14,100. At the other cost extreme, a 10‐room duplex with four baths and a terrace that was listed at $350,000 under the original plan is priced at $210,000 under the amended plan. “Sure I think some of them were bought off,” said Marilyn Glass, tenant. “And there's a combination of anger at the landlords and at many people who stood with the tenants’ committee and then backed off.” Since the announcement that the conversion had succeeded, more tenants have agreed to buy their apartments rather than move out. Robert S. Olnick, a member of the syndicate that owns the building, estimated that the total now is 55 per cent. He predicted that more tenants would sign before they lose their right to buy under present terms. “After the initial hostile reaction,” Mr. Olnick said, “we sat down with a group of tenants and got their point of view and their criticisms of the first plan. Based on various points they raised we revised the plan and tried to satisfy each of the criticisms we thought had merit.” Mr. Olnick denied that any tenant was “bought off” with lower prices for his apartment. “Many of the tenants who bought were almost under coercion,” said Miss Glass, who plans to leave her $260a‐month studio when her lease expires in September. “Older people have sort of had it. They don't want to move again, they've invested in structural changes—builtin bookcases, paneling, wallpaper. They wouldn't have bought their apartments, but looking for an apartment in New York City is not easy.” According to Mr. Eckhaus, the tenants dislike “being forced to do anything they don't like to do, and they don't like to be told three years after they move in that they have to buy to stay in the building.” “I'm not convinced that a cooperative is the best way to live in New York City,” he said. “But we must face reality. Before long it will be the only way to live in New York. Owners of property with large investments find the best return they can get on an apartment is by selling it as a cooperative—they get a much better price than if they sell it to another real estate investor. “As far as my family is concerned, it's like owning home, and there's more security.” The current business slump, many agree, plays a large role in the thinking of many purchasers. “I had to sell securities that would have bounced back in a year or so,” said one reluctant purchaser. “I had to sell them at a tremendous loss in order to get the money to buy my apartment. I just didn't have $50,000 lying around and I resent having an economic decision like this being forced on me in the present economic condition.” For those who will move, the prospects are equally dismal—pounding the pavements looking for the few apartments that might become available in a period of short supply. “There's just no place to go,” said John Abbate, an advertising executive who has decided to purchase his co‐op. “I looked for three weeks just comparing prices. couldn't find very many places. I don't like to tie up $15,000 or $20,000 in an apartment but I did my looking around and unless you live in a walk‐up tenement and get robbed twice a week, you can't escape it.” Mr. Abbate said that after he had agreed to purchase his apartment, he began to notice the change in atmosphere within the building and among the tenants. “This one woman, when she found out bought my apartment, she told me off,” he said. “She called me an idiot. When she saw me walking down the corridor she turned around and walked away.” The indication from an examination of the two prospectuses issued for the original offer and the revised offer is that 303 Associates—Mr. Olnick, Abraham Feinberg, Edwin J. Glickman, Marvin B. Tepper and Milton Young —made a substantial profit on the conversion despite the lowered price. Under the first plan of sale, the total price for the building was $37,620,500, according to the prospectus issued by the State Atorney General's office. Of the total, $17,784,786 was computed to be 303 Associates profit. In the amended offering plan, the total price, assuming all apartment units were sold, is $30,665,026. Of this, $12,183,900 is computed to be profit. “We're selling the apart ment for what we feel it's worth,” said Mr. Olnick last November. “If the tenants think were offering the right price for each apartment, what difference does it make to them if we make one dollar or $15‐million?’

1228-> Alioto Out of Race To Oppose Reagan
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12— Mayor Joseph Alioto, regarded for many months as an un announced candidate for Gov ernor, removed himself abruptly from the race today. The 52‐year‐old San Francis can reached his decision during the weekend and made it known at the end of a 13‐minute talk this afternoon to the city‐county Board of Supervisors. While declaring a conviction that Gov. Ronald Reagan, a Re publican, could be defeated next November, Mr. Alioto said he was taking himself out of consideration because of the burdens that a concentrated campaign would impose upon him. Not only would he have to conduct a hard primary cam paign against Assemblyman Jesse M. Unruh, but he would also have to “fulfill my obliga tion as Mayor [and] prosecute a landmark suit against an in famous libel,” the Mayor said. He added that he could not simultaneously pursue the three activities “without jeopardizing, each effort for the others.” The lawsuit to which he re ferred is a $12.5‐million action he filed against Look magazine after its publication of an arti cle last September linking him with various alleged members of the Mafia. At a news conference fol lowing his speech to the board, Mayor Alioto asserted his in tention to “continue to prose cute vigorously” the suit against Look. Trial of the suit is scheduled to begin on April 13. Mr. Alioto said he would have liked, in other circum stances, to go to the voters for a verdict not only in the Look matter but also in a case more recently publicized. This in volved his division of a $2.3‐ million fee in antitrust suits in Washington state with John J. O'Connell, who was then Wash ington's Attorney General, and an O'Connell staff member. Mr. Alioto, who was then engaged in the private practice if law, noted he had collected $16‐million for his clients—15 public utilities and the state— in the suits against electrical equipment manufacturers. He said the recent publicity about the fee had had no effect on his decision against seeking the Governorship. His decision brought no dem onstration in the supervisors' chamber in City Hall, but the crowd of several hundred gave him very cordial applause. A political well‐wisher, one of many who had conferred with him during recent weeks, said privately: “It was a wise decision but I would have bet $20 to $10 as recently as last Tuesday that Joe was going to run.” Mr. Unruh, 47, the former Speaker of the Assembly, now seems to have virtually clear sailing for the Democratic nom ination for Governor. He de clared his candidacy early in December. Several times he has voiced the hope, and even has predicted, that he would have no Democratic opponent of stature in the primary. This had led to rumors that he and Mayor Alioto might, reach some sort of working arrangement but Mr. Alioto told his news conference that he had “neither conferred with Unruh nor heard from him.” Mr. Unruh at Sacramento praised the Alioto decision as “an act of statesmanship and concern” and said it “immeas urably strengthened” his own chances of beating Governor Reagan. He said he knew noth ing of the action until it was announced by the Mayor.

1229-> Peking Gives Sihanouk A Triumphal Welcome
PEKING, July 2 (Agence France‐Presse)—Prince Noro dom Sihanouk of Cambodia was given a triumphal wel come today when he re turned to Peking from a 17 day official visit to North Korea. Some 300,000 soldiers, militiamen, civilians, Red Guards, workers and peas ants hailed him. Prince Sihanouk and his party, arriving by train, were met at the station by a Chi nese delegation headed by Premier Chou En‐lai, Huang Yung‐Sheng, Chief of Stiff of the armed forces, and Deputy Premier Li Hsien nien.

There is “no way” for Philip Morris to put its $38 million television budget for cigarette advertising into other media, according to John T. Landry, group vice president of Philip Morris, U.S.A. He said he expected the coming broadcast ban on such advertising to cut the company's advertising budget in half. Speaking yesterday to the Sales Promotion Idea Work shop in Chicago, Mr. Landry also said that Philip Morris plans to stay out of “any wild escalation of contests, give‐aways and promotional circuses” such as took place in England after the TV ban on cigarette commercials there. “This is the kind of rat race we fully intend to avoid,” he said.

BOSTON, Jan. 18 (AP) — Bobby Orr broke his season scoring record for defensemen and his Boston Bruins team mates staged a four‐goal rally in the final period tonight for a 6‐3 National Hockey League victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Orr assisted on Phil Esposi to's 23d goal of the season on a power play 49 seconds after the opening face‐off to give Boston a 1‐0 lead that stood up in the first period. The Bruins fell behind, 2‐1, in the second session on goals by John Ferguson and Marc Tardif. But Orr came through with a slap shot from the blue line to tie the score at the 16:09 mark. It was the 21‐year‐old de fenseman's 13th goal of the season and, with 52 assists, gave him a total of 65 points, breaking the record he set last season. ??

1233-> Delay in Kopechne Inquest Data Is Linked to Liability of Clerk
BOSTON, April 24 (AP) — State Attorney General Robert H. Quinn called today for the “full and speedy disclosure and publication of the report and transcripts of the report and transcripts of evidence” of the Mary Do Kopechne inquest. Mr. Quinn told a news con ference that the “overriding public interest was for tontin ued confidence in our court systems and the administration of justice.” Miss Kopechne, 28 years old, was killed last July 18 when a car driven by Senator Edward M. Kennedy went off a narrow bridge on Chappaquiddick Is land. An inquest into her death was held last January in Duke County District Court at Ed gartown. The papers connected with the proceeding were filed Feb. 18. Mr. Quinn said the major problem in releasing the papers from the office of the Suffolk County Superior Court clerk, Edward V. Keating, was “the personal liability” involved for Mr. Keating. He said that since April 15 his staff had met with judges of variouss courts involved in the case on 14 occasions in attempts to resolve the quees tion of how has the responsibility for releasing copies of the papers. A court stenographer, Sidney R. Lipman, has contended in a suit before Federal courts that he has the right to distribute copies of the testimony because he recorded the original pro ceedings. Mr. Quinn told the news con ference that the United States District Court had ruled in favor of Mr. Keating, but that the United States Court of Ap peals for the First Circuit had said that Mr. Keating would distribute copies at his “own risk.” The Attorney General said the if the situation was not resolved by Monday he would file emergency legislation de signed to protect Mr. Keating. He said he had been assured by legislative leaders and the Governor that immediate ac tion would be sought. “I am still hopeful that by the first of next week we will be able to resolve this matter and get the report and tran scripts distributed,” Mr. Quinn said. If the matter is not solved by next week, Mr. Quinn said, he will ask the Appeals Court to hear the stenographer's case as soon as possible, “remembering that it may take many months before Federal litigation can be concluded.

1235-> 2 BIG BANKS EASE CONSUMER LOANS
Two of the nation's largest banks announced reductions yesterday in their interest rates on consumer loans. Two other major banks (one of them in New York City) indicated that such reductions were being considered. All the banks linked their actions to the general easing in the national money market in recent months. In California the Bank of America and the Wells Fargo Bank, both statewide banks with headquarters in San Fran cisco, said they were cutting charges on most types of con sumer installment loans by one‐half percentage point, fig ured at a simple annual interest rate. The California banks said these reductions would apply across the board—for example, to loans for home improve ments, automobiles, mobile homes and the purchase of mer chandise as well as for out right cash loans. The action by the Bank of America, the nation's largest bank, was taken Monday but was not disclosed then. The Wells Fargo Bank announced its move yesterday, effective immediately. In Los Angeles officials of the Security Pacific National Bank said a similar rate cut was “definitely under consid eration.” A .spokesman for a fourth major California bank, the Crocker Citizens National in San Francisco, said his institu tion would “remain competi tive” in its consumer lending rates. In New York senior consum er lending officials at all but one of the major banks said they had no plans to cut their consumer loan charges. The bankers here pointed out that loan charges were far higher in California than in New York —where banks are limited to a simple annual rate of 12 per cent. However, one very large New York bank (which asked not to be identified) took different attitude. Its officials said privately that a decision to lower consumer lending charges might be made this morning. The lending charges that were reduced yesterday vary widely, depending on the type of loan and its maturity. Rates Compared As an example, Glenhall E. Taylor Jr., vice president of the Wells Fargo Bank, cited the‐ rate on a $2,000 personal cash loan for a period of two years. Previously, Mr. Taylor said, the rate on such a loan was $8 per hundred dollars bor rowed, with the interest charge added to the face amount of the loan. Under the new sched ule. he said, the rate would be $7.75 per hundred dollars borrowed. At a simple annual Interest rate, the new charge works out to 14.24 per cent, against the 14.68 per cent implied by the previous rate schedule. Mr. Taylor said that the same reduction of 25 cents per hun dred dollars borrowed (figured on the same “add on” basis) would be applied across the board, except for loans of less than $500. Administrative costs of these are very high in rela tion to the amount of the loan, he asserted. Chauncy J. Medberry, ex ecutive vice president of the Bank of America, said the under‐$500 exception would also apply at his bank (which has a total of more than $2 billion in personal loans out standing).

1236-> Mountbatten, 70, Has a Shaky Time at Ceremony
LONDON, July 2 (UPI)—Princess Anne saw it first today: the ordeal of Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Seated to the left of her mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and her father, Prince Philip, in the House of Lords for the opening of Parliament, Anne looked up and her blue eyes widened. Standing in front of her on a throne step, Lord Mount batten, one of the last of the Brahmins who led Britain through World War II, was trembling as he clutched the great sword of state. His eyes closed. His forehead bent and touched the.30‐pound gold and diamond‐studded broad sword, which be held upright. It was 11:44 A.M. The Queen was two minutes deep into her speech from the throne (“My Government will work for a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East and for a settlement of the con flict in, Indochina...”). The six‐minute ordeal of Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas (Dickie) Mountbat ten, a veteran of two wars, had begun. He is a cousin of every royal person who sat for this, the ceremony that symbolizes democracy in Britain. He was the “German cousin” who rose to become Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had a destroyer, H.M.S. Kelly, torpedoed out from under him in the Medi terranean. He commanded the commandos. He was Allied chief in Southeast Asia. He played political midwife in delivering India into inde pendence from Britain. Septuagenarian in Trouble But on June 25 he turned 70. And today the grand old aristocrat was in trouble. He had carried the sword up through the marble halls and grand staircases to the Lords, marching ahead of the Queen. He was chief spear carrier in this drama of pomp and circumstance. But at 11:45 he wobbled and his ermine‐trimmed crimson robes shook. Up in the Strangers’ Gal lery, William George Heath, 82, had sat with eyes only for his son, the new Prime Minister, Edward Heath, but now he turned toward Lord Mountbatten. Princess Margaret, seated at the head of. the court ladies, is a veteran of state occa sions, but she too turned. The Prime Minister and his predecessor, Harold Wilson, also took in the drama with in the drama. At 11:46 A.M. the worst came. Lord Mountbatten's knees appeared to bend, his head fell, his right hand went slack. A Wiggle of the Thumb The Earl Marshal of Eng land, the Duke of Norfolk, who directs ceremonies such as this, wiggled his left thumb, which is the panic button of courtly circum stance. A sergeant at arms, Thomas Barnham, stepped to the throne. The only sound was the Queen reading her speech (“My Government will review the role and size of the ter ritorial and army volunteer reserve...”). The courtier put a hand to the sword to steady it, then nodded at Lord Mountbatten. Should he take the sword? Lord Mountbatten jerked his head up and shook it no. The courtier retreated. Twice more Lord Mount batten appeared almost to faint. Each time he recovered. At 11:50 A.M. the Queen finished. With grace but with speed, she rose and stepped away. Lord Mountbatten shook himself and looked at her. The Queen smiled and they marched away together, the broadsword firmly in Lord Mountbatten's hands.

1237-> Bus Line Proposed From Nassau to City
MINEOLA, L. I., Jan. 18—Al plan for de luxe bus service be tween four places in Nassau County and the East Side of Manhattan during the morning and evening rush hours has been announced by County Ex ecutive Eugene H. Nickerson. The proposal, by the Jeru salem Avenue Bus Line, Inc., of North Merrick, is now before the Public Service Commission. The commission said that a pub lic hearing on the proposal would be held next Wednesday at 10 A.M. at the County Exec utive Building. The bus company proposes to use new air‐conditioned coaches, with reclining scats, that would leave for the city every 20 min utes between 6:50 A.M. and A.M. and return between 4:30 P.M. and 6 P.M. Newspapers would be pro vided, executive work tables would be available and a hos tess would serve coffee. Each rider would be guaranteed seat. George Semke, president of the bus line, said that service would begin at May's depart ment store in Levittown, with boarding stops at Eisenhower Park, East Meadow; Roosevelt Field, Garden City, and Chris topher Morley Park, Roslyn. The county would cooperate in the project by providing free park‐and‐ride centers at Eisen hower Park and Morley Park. The bus would use either the Long Island Expressway or Northern Boulevard to get to the city. Stops in the city are planned between Third Avenue and Sixth Avenue, from 34th Street to 57th Street. Mr. Nickerson said that the purpose of the proposal was to win auto drivers over to comfortable bus service and thus relieve traffic congestion on highways into Manhattan. He said it would not affect passenger business on the Long Island Rail Road because the fares on the express buses would be higher than the com mutation rates on the railroad. The proposed tariff for one‐ way trips are: $2 from Levit town, $1.65 from Eisenhower Park, $1.55 from Roosevelt Field and $1.45 from Morley Park. Lower rates are planned for round trips and 10‐trip tickets. Residents of Mineola, who might use the Garden City bus stop, now pay $1.50 for one‐way railroad ticket to Manhattan. Morris Tarshis, director of the New York City Bureau of Franchise, said the bus com pany would have to obtain the approval of his department within 20 days of approval by the Public Service Commission.

1238-> Tunnel to Ease Traffic Is Opened Under Etoile
PARIS; July 25—The” Paris authorities opened a tunnel under the Place de l'Etoile to day in an effort to ease the heavy traffic that for years has been swirling — or inching — around the Arc de Triomphe. The opening itself was less than triumphal. White‐gloved policemen had to wave their arms vigorously to get drivers to turn off the Champs Elysées into the 1,200‐foot underpass. The first private motorist to arrive at its entrance was a burly man named Frederic Sidibé. He had the harried air common to Paris motorists, particularly around the Place de l'Etoile. Asked why he had chosen to take the underground route on a breezy summer day, Mr. Siddibé rolled his eyes and muttered: “Because the cop told me to.” Then he gunned his British Ford sedan into the passage, which comes out on the Avenue de la Grande Armée. All told, 12 streets meet at the Place de l'Etoile, which is a circle with the great 19th century arch at its center. These streets have grown more and more full of cars as France has become more pros perous in recent years. The re sult is that as many as 200,000 cars have been known to navi gate around the arch in a sin gle day—or 20,000 in an hour. Inevitably, this led to what the Paris newspaper Le Figaro terms “traffic jams that were memorable.” The situation was not only inconvenient, it was degrading for a spot that is, after all, focal point of France's grandeur. And in 1967 the Paris author ities earmarked $4‐million for the tunnel, although the arch itself had only cost less than $2‐million to build. Work began 18 months ago, despite grumbling from officials at the Ministry of Culture that the project might turn the Champs‐Elysées into “a sort of autobahn. The designers showed a healthy disrespect for the driv ing skill of their fellow French men. The tunnel is equipped with emergency buttons that a motorist can push in case of an accident, thereby switching on red lights at the tunnel's mouth. Both of the two 11‐foot lanes run in the same direction, from the Champs Elysees northwestward to the avenue. Traffic experts hope this will syphon off as much as 40 per cent of the traffic that now crosses the Etoile. As a further safety measure, bicycles, motorcycles and vehi cles with explosive cargoes are banned from the tunnel, which will be constantly under police guard.

1244-> SAFETY REMINDER: A CHECK ON SEATS
The seats in a fast powerboat receive more of a beating than the seats in any other kind of conveyance, and the reason is obvious. The situation is about the same in a boat as it would be in a car if there were no springs between the wheels and chassis. Then the seats become the major shock‐absorbing and springing units. Seats serve two purposes. They provide for the riders' comfort and also position them securely within the boat. Many boats have back‐to back seats that fold down to become loungers. Once in a while you find that the position ing mechanism of such a seat has become worn or loose just enough so that there's a pos sibility of the seat back slipping and dropping down as the boat hurdles a wave. Naturally, a sudden happen ing like that can take a driver by surprise. It actually lets him down . . . and can cause him to lose control of the boat. Whether they are perma nently built in, or of the folding type, check the seats detail by detail for loose mounting bolts, cracked or broken supports and bent or loose hinges and latches. A few minutes thus spent is cheap and effective insurance against anything from annoy ance while afloat to serious trouble. Also, get into the habit of making certain that latches or catches are fully engaged when raising back‐to‐back seats from reclining to sitting position.

The two top leaders of Orthodox Judaism in this country issued a joint statement yesterday condemning “indiscriminate and blanket” abortions. The leaders were Rabbi Joseph Karasick, president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, and Rabbi Bernard L. Berzon, president of the Rabbinical Council of America. The rabbis emphasized that their comments were aimed specifically at the medical profession and women about to take advantage of the state's new permissive legislation. State law, the most liberal in the nation, now leaves the decision to have an abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy up to the woman and her physician. Beyond that time an abortion can be performed legally only if it is necessary to preserve the woman's life. The joint statement declared that no woman was the “final arbiter about the disposition of her body and the embryonic human life flourishing therein.” “Doctors, too,” the statement insisted, “must face up to the moral dilemma: whether they can play havoc with the basic worth and dignity of human life when they freely perform abortions. “In Judaism, the life of an unborn child is sacred and only when It is a threat to the mother can the moral issue of abortion be resolved. For each person to decide arbitrarily, on the basis of economics or convenience, whether a fetus is to survive is literally for man to play God and is religiously blasphemous and socially destructive.” In an interview, Rabbi Karasick declared that to destroy human embryo Is “sacrilegious interference with life itself and akin to murder.” “Only when there is actual and acute danger to the life of the mother does Jewish religious law permit termination of pregnancy,” he said. According th the rabbi, the Talmud asserts that “whoso sheds the blood of man within man his blood shall be shed.” This has been traditionally interpreted as constituting a commandment against the killing of unborn children, Rabbi Karasick noted. Rabbi Bernard Twersky, information director for the Rabbinical Council, said the joint statement was the first public expression of opinion on the new state law by a major Jewish body. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches have always opposed abortion. Protestantism, in general, has been less restrictive. Catholics Warned LOS ANGELES, July 10 (AP) —The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles says he will excommunicate any member of the church in his jurisdiction who becomes involved in abortion. “Thou shalt not kill Is the unchangeable law of God,” Archbishop Timothy Manning declared yesterday. “Loudly and clearly our voices must guard the religious convictions of every doctor, nurse, social worker, employe of any medical or social welfare group agency. They must not be pressured to assist in abortion practices, nor may they advise, counsel or pressure welfare recipients toward the procurement of an abortion.” The Los Angeles Diocese has 1.7 million members. Under California law, aborton is permitted in cases of rape, and incest, and to preserve f,the mother's physical or mental health.

1246-> Rights Leaders’ Statement on Moynihan
Statement Daniel Patrick Moynihan's call for “benign neglect” of the plight of black Ameri cans is a flagrant and shame ful political document. Following is the text and a list of signers of a statement by individuals and organiza tions involved in civil rights commenting on a memoran dum to President Nixon from Daniel Patrick Moynihan: But its real tragedy is that it is symptomatic of a cal culated, aggressive and sys tematic effort in the present national Administration to wipe out all the civil rights gains made in the 1950's and 1960's. While Mr. Moynihan talks of benign neglect what the black man has actually been suffering from in the last year or so is malignant ne glect. This has the effect of strengthening the boast of black and white extremists that our own government does not intend to try to solve the race problem. This attitude is rapidly building up social dynamite in. Amer ica's black ghettos. The President of the Unit ed States has pledged to unite the American people, “to bring us together again.” Yet Mr. Moynihan's memo randum will be interpreted as a deliberate effort to set blacks against other minority groups, thereby weakening the drive toward equality for all groups. To say that greater atten tion should be given to other ethnic groups and less to Ne groes is, incredibly, to miss the point of life in a demo cratic society. We insist that equal attention be given to all of them since they are all afflicted with the com mon problems of poverty or discrimination or both. It is a travesty on the truth for anyone to claim, as Mr. Moynihan claims, that America's Negro population has achieved “enormous gains” and made “extraordi nary progress” in the last two decades. These gains have been significant, but they have not been monu mental. Nor have they brought equality to black people. It is clear to all who wish to see that millions of blacks still live in housing unfit for human habitation, that mil lions of black children still suffer the agony of inferior schools, that uncounted num bers of black children still go to bed hungry every night. It is still shockingly true that the unemployment rate among blacks is still twice as high as it is for whites and that the rate is even higher among black youth. But we will not dwell for ever on misleading statistics and statements by the Presi dent's counselor on urban affairs, for it will only divert us from our real work of achieving full equality for all Americans. We are equally certain that efforts to divide minority groups in this coun try will fail, because these groups are moving toward greater unity than ever. This is their unswerving mission as they face hostile attempts to turn back the clock on human rights. The gains that minority groups have made in this country were not won by benign neg lect, but by courageous and aggressive action. We pledge that our efforts will continue until the last vestiges of prejudice, discrimination and segregation are wiped out. We urge all decent Ameri cans to join, us in this his toric task. List of Signers The statement was signed by the following organizations and individuals: Lehman Brightman, United Na tive American Association.

1248-> Walton of Leafs Reinstated As Report Confirms Illness
TORONTO, Dec. 24 (AP)— The suspension of Mike Walton, a Toronto Maple Leaf center, was lifted today by Clarence Campbell, the president of the National Hockey League. The suspension was handed out two weeks ago when Wal ton refused to show up for practice saying he was ill. The Leafs’ medical staff had report ed Walton was fit to play. The suspension has been lifted, Campbell said, “because the report of an independent medical specialist who exam ined Walton shows him to be in a state of illness that ex empts him from either prac ticing or playing.” With the suspension lifted, Walton must be paid his back salary, which was also sus pended.

1249-> Lon Nol Announces He and Sirik Matak Exercise Full War Power in Cambodia
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, July 2—Premier Lon Nol asserted today on his own behalf and on that of Deputy Premier Sisowath Sink Matak that they jointly have full power to make all governmental decisions dur ing the war emergency. The proclamation of what most political and diplomatic observers consider unrestricted power came in two messases to the nation, one by Chief of State Cheng Heng and the other by the Premier. Both were based on a vote of “full confidence and total support” for Lieut. Gen. Lon Nol and Maj. Gen. Sirik Matak by the National Assembly last Satur day and announced today. The effect of the proclama tions, in the view of qualified sources, is largely to ratify and make more specific the exist ing state of affairs. No Criticism of Move Since neither of the two lead ers is suspected of di tatorial strivings, the reassertion of wide wartime powers appears so far not to have aroused criti cism from the limited number of Cambodians who take an active interest in politics. The nature of General Lon Nol's attitude to power and its exercise was indicated in his message. He said, after noting the confidence vote and the subsequent message from the Chief of State giving him and General Sirik Matak full powers: “But we ask in advance your indulgence for the measures that we shall be called upon to take in all urgency to face up to the preset t situation.” The first measure he men tioned was a shuffling of the Cabinet, increasing the num ber of ministers from nine to the 16 called for in the Con stitution. However, five of these cases involved the rais ing of officials who had headed ministries from the rank of state secretary to that of min ister. A number of younger, well educated men of modern out look were added to the Cabinet. This move was believed intend ed to lessen the criticism from the intellectual elite that the Lon Nol‐Sirik Matak leadership was not sufficiently employing the talents of the university educated younger men who had also been kept out of influen tial posts under Prince Noro dom Sihanouk, who was de posed as Chief of State March 18. Keuk Kylim, a representative of the younger intellectual elite, was named Information Minister, replacing Trinh Ho anh, who had come under criti cism for his performance in presenting Cambodia's case to the world. Mr. Trinh Hoanh was left out of the Cabinet but retained his post as secretary general of the Sangkum, Cam bodia's single political party. Other moves included the shifting of Yem Sambaur from his post as Foreign Minister to Minister of State charged with justice and relations with Par liament. He was replaced by Koun Wick, who was Ambassa dor to Yugoslavia until that country broke relations with Cambodia. Yugoslavia has rec ognized the Peking‐based exile Government of Prince Sihan ouk, formed May 5. A Concern for Legality In the shuffling, Premier Lon. Nol retained the defense port folio, signifying the division of responsibilities between the two leaders, with the Premier in charge of the military side and his deputy in charge of admin istrative and diplomatic func tions. General Sirik Matak is now known as Deputy Premier in stead of First Deputy Premier as he was before the shuffle. The posts of second and third deputy premiers have been abolished. Commenting on today's de velopments, a Cabinet Minister said that a principal reason for the reaffirming of the existing state of affairs was General Lon Nol's concern for legality. He said the Premier wanted to avoid being suspected of as suming power for its own sake and asked for the confidence vote for that reason. In a similar bow to legality, the Government is putting Prince Sihanouk on trial in ab sentia tomorrow. The principal charge before the military tri bunal is believed to be high treason, and the principal rea son for the trial is to provide legality for the impending con fiscation of Prince Sihanouk's vast holdings, palatial houses, motor pool and other proper ties. Only two members of the Prince's close family remain in Pnompenh, living in enforced retirement. They are Queen Mother Kossomak, his mother, and a daughter, Princess Boup ha Devi, a beautiful, much mar ried dancer in her twenties. They are playing no political role and appear to be as for gotten as the very institution of royalty in this kingdom, which has been without a king since Prince Sihanouk father's death a decade ago. In all but in name and the letter of the Constitution, Cam bodia is a republic and “wive la republique” signs are wide spread in Government offices. General Sirik Matak has re nounced his title as a prince and was referred to in the new Cabinet roster as “monsieur le major‐general.”

1250-> Pompidou Sees No Indochina Peace Till U.S. Pullout
PARIS, July 2 — President Pompidou criticized President Nixon today and declared that peace could not come to Indo china until the Americans made up their minds to get out. The statement, Mr. Pompi dou's strongest yet on the issue, echoed the speech made by. President Charles de Gaulle in Pnompenh four years ago and again placed the burden of re sponsibility for the Indochinese’ tragedy on the United States. As he was speaking at a news conference at the Elysee Palace, the Communist delegations at the Vietnam peace talks were taking a similar harsh view of Mr. Nixon's latest announce ments. They minimized the sig nificance of his appointment of David K. E. Bruce as chief negotiator. The name of Mr. Bruce was not even mentioned at the 73d session of the Paris peace talks today, and his appointment was only alluded to by Philip C. Habib, the acting chief of the American delegation. Following the meeting, Mr. Habib boarded a plane bound for a conference with Mr. Nixon and Mr. Bruce at San Clemente, Calif. Happy About Appointment President Pompidou, asked about the outlook for peace after Mr. Nixon's latest declar ations, said the Bruce nomina tion was “a point I am happy about.” However, he went on, “There are not only causes for rejoicing in the statements of President Nixon. I cannot conceal it, and I cannot fail to repeat what told the United States, inci dentally—that there will be no prospects for peace in Indo china until the day when the United States has taken, by it self, and voluntarily, the firm resolution to evacuate Indo china. “That is the basis for every thing, and starting from that, one can hope that intervention and all interference of all kinds will cease and that each of these unhappy states of Indo china will recover the possibil ity of life, of peace and of in dependence — and, I hope, of neutrality. “And since everybody makes appeals, if I had one to make, well then, as for me, I would say: pity, for the Vietnamese people; pity, for the Cambo dian people; pity for the Lao tian people; pity, perhaps to morrow, for the Thai people, and let these unhappy people no longer be made the subject and the victim of rivalries that go beyond them and don't even concern them. “That is the policy of France.” In reply to other questions, today, President Pompidou re iterated his belief in a confer ence on Indochina of all par ties concerned — including, he emphasized, China. Asked whether France would “contin ue relations with the govern ment of Prince Sihanouk,” he replied, “we maintain relations with Prince Sihanouk,” omit ting the word “government.” France still recognizes the government of Premier Lon Nol in Pnompenh, not the Peking based exile government of Prince Norodam Sihanouk. Saigon Is Restrained Special to The New York Times SAIGON, South Vietnam, July 2—South Vietnamese re action to President Nixon's ap pointment of David K. E. Bruce as chief American negotiator at the Paris peace talks and to the President's television inter view last night was relatively restrained. Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam said yesterday before the name of the chief negotiator was publicly announced that the appointment did not mean a concession to the Communist side. Peking Sees Nixon ‘Trick’ Special to The New York Times HONG KONG, July 2—Com munist China has described the withdrawal of American troops from Cambodia as a “trick” and called on the Communist forces in Indochina to “perse vere in a protracted people's war.” At the same time, Premier Kim Il Sung of North Korea has promised both moral and material support for Prince Sihanouk in his efforts to over throw the Pnompenh Govern ment. An article in Jenmin Jih Pao, the official Peking newspaper, said the Nixon Administration had announced the expansion of bombing raids on Cambodia “while playing with the trick of troop withdrawal” to press ahead with its “criminal scheme of making Asians fight Asians. ” The article, which was pub lished in the paper today transmitted abroad by Hsinhua, the Chinese press agency, said that no matter whether the United States dispatched its own troops or mustered its lackeys or puppets to “pick its chestnuts from the fire,” it would never escape thorough defeat. Premier Kim's support for Prince Sihanouk, who was de posed in March, was pledged in a joint statement issued at the conclusion of a visit by the former Cambodian leader to North Korea. Premier Kim said the Korean people would “do everything necessary not only morally but materially” to actively support and encourage the Cambodian people's struggle against the United States until it was “crowned with complete vic tory.”

1251-> TIM's Cartoons: Direct Line to Fame
PARIS—One way to be im mortal in France is to wear the sword of the French Academy. The other way is to appear in a cartoon by the country's foremost political cartoonist, who signs his work TIM. Week in, crisis out, his pen is mightier than the sword. He broke tradition by being the first to have a cartoon published in Le Monde, and over the years — in the Al gerian war, in the grandeur of Gaullism his art has moved some Frenchmen more than words. TIM's cartoons appear in the magazine L'Express and his portraits brighten the liter ary pages of Le Monde. He has illustrated Zola, and soon he will be doing the Bible. For saints as well as sin ners, the procedure is iden tical. “I begin my drawings by miming the person,” he said in an interview at his home here. “That way I know how he holds his hands, whether he has quick gestures like Foreign Minister Schumann or gestures of eternity—like de Gaulle Gesture Before Word “With de Gaulle the ges ture always preceded the word—probably so that the thought should be better de fined. With President Ken nedy the rate of speech was rapid, even childlike. “Chaban‐Delmas, the Pre mier, finds it impossible to move normally; he strides as though he's been selected for the national rugby team, as indeed he once was. His voice is impossible to bear, and he knows it, so he's working to improve it.” The 51‐year‐old cartoonist, whose real name is Louis Mitelberg (his nom de plume is the first three letters of Mitelberg backwards), was born in Warsaw and emi grated to France in 1938. There's the body,” he said, “and the character around it. De Gaulle and Churchill adapted their physical ele ments to their mentality. It's as if they first had their soul and then selected a physique to match. With some people you find the opposite — the body first, then the soul. Nixon had the body first, Kennedy had the soul first.” Taking pen and paper in hand, TIM drew and observed: “Nixon is an eight. He has an interesting face, not with out material for a cartoonist. The black of the hair is agree able. “For me Nixon is the lawyer who has learned to dissimulate—never to be him self. When you hear him you discover what American cus tom imposes on such a man. The voice is voluntarily pitched deeper, to make it consistent with the style of Westerns denoting virility in America. As the voice deep ens, a double chin emerges.” “Every country has its own way of expressing virility.” he added. “In Latin countries you look a woman in the eye and speak directly to her. In Anglo‐Saxon lands the virile way is not to speak directly to the woman and not to look into her eyes.” Kennedy—'A Good Head’ Lyndon Johnson, according to the cartoonist, is a type that repeats itself in all races and countries. “A very good face,” he said. “The fact that he became a teacher — and wears glasses to read—helped me. It's the opposite of Nix on's face, because it's a hol low face while Nixon's has cushion hanging down on each side.” Mr. Kennedy he summed up as “a good head.” “First the extraordinary hair. You could take his hair style and put it onto other heads and you saw at once that it was Kennedy. But his head was difficult. With age his chin would have become more powerful.” “Eisenhower was very dif ficult, an evasive baby face, impossible to draw,” TIM continued. “It gave me all the trouble in the world to give the face expression. His cranium was enormous and his smile climbed right up his cheeks. If you made him smile your drawing resembled Eisenhower. If not, it didn't.” Discussing Vice President Agnew, TIM said he saw smugness: “He resembles Mr. Magoo. I would draw his face as a thick mass with two slashed for the eyes, one for the mouth, and a big sausage for the nave. His hair doesn't obscure the shape of the skull: it's pasted down to the original form. With a face like that you see that no logi cal argument will trouble him; all you will do is dem onstrate the impotence of reason.” General de Gaulle is TIM'S long‐standing favorite. “A carotoonist's dream,” he said. “Every week you could count on him to do everything but write the caption for the drawing — by a declaration, by a gesture, by a word al most underlined in red.” President Pompidou appears a worthy successor—“a for midable face and a rasping voice to match his expres sion, a man of ruses who can wait.” To render Picasso, the car toonist borrowed something of the artist's style.

1252-> Old English Sheepdog Best in Show
HARTFORD, Feb. 14—The Selection of an Old English sheepdog as best in the show, Mr. and Mrs. Hendrik Van Rensselaer's Fezziwig Artful Dodger, from Basking Ridge, N. J., was the main thing that happened tonight at the 41st dog show of the First Company Governor's Foot Guard Athletic Association. The announcement that Ch. Arriba's Prima Donna, the boxer that won Westminster's top award in Madison Square Garden last Tuseday, would not be shown again was the chief development of the day light hours. Prima Donna was entered in Hartford's fixture, but absent.. Artful Dodger came out of the open dogs class to achieve a sensation. First he completed his championship. Then he won his first variety group. Then he became a first‐time best‐in show winner. Frank Foster i;Savis of Alexandria, Va., a judge at the Foot Guard event for 22 of the last 24 years, made the choice. Davis thought the sheepdog, a son of the Van Rensselaer's late successful campaigner, Ch. Fezziwig Raggedy Andy, “was not good, but great.” But he thought it awful that the dog was out of control much of the time because of the inex perience of the young amateur handler, Jim McTernan, a friend of the owners. “There is no excuse for a top show dog not to be under con trol at all time,” the judge said. The reason the announce ment of the boxer's retiremnt was So important was that her future remained in doubt when she gained America's No. 1 canine honor at the Garden. Now. Mrs. P. J. Pagano of Pel ham‐Manor, N. Y., a co‐owner, said the decision had been made and Suzie, the boxer's callpame, would be seen in a show ring no more. The deci sion—was not unexpected. Most dogs that gain West minster's best are retired be cause there are no higher worlds to conquer. “The dog has done all she can be expected to do so far as winning prestige shows goes,” Mrs. Pagano said. “They include bests at Westminster, the. Chicago International and Boston's Eastern. She is the country's top dog for 1969 in all breeds, according to the Kennel Review standing. So there is no reason to go on. I will campaign one of my males instead. His name is Ch. Bromax Beau Brummel.” Mrs. Pagano said that Prima Donna would be bred when she came into season next week. A rumor that the dog was al ready in season when she won Westminster had gained circu lation. It was not true, Mrs. Pagano said. Prima Donna was the only one of the six Garden finalists to be entered in the Foot Guard competition and har absence deprived the customary large crowd of a star attraction. But there were many other fine dogs in the limit entry of 1,266. Besides Artful Dodger, the finalists included a Shihtzu, Ch. Chumulari Ying‐Ying; a standard poodle, Ch. Alekai Luau, an English springer spaniel, Ch. Charlyle's Fair Warning, A Basenji, Ch. Rev eille Re‐Up and a Kerry Blue Terrier, Ch. Chalkerry's Defiant. Capt. George A. Ford, the show chairman for 24 years, said the limit not only filled, but was exceeded by 300 en tries that had to be returned for lack of benching space. Ford is a firm believer in benching as a means of giving the public its money's worth, Benching assures that the breeds the public want to see are there, he says. Ford was astonished at the nature of the entry this time. “This is a big dog show. There are a lot of dogs in the large breeds and relatively few in the small ones,” he said., “For example, we used to get, 80 to 90 cocker spaniels. There are only 22 today. The poodle entry was once big. Now there are 30. The terriers are very light, but there are many big working dogs. The collies number 72, and the 39 Dober man pinschers are more than I can remember. There are 48 Siberian huskies and for this area that's a lot. “There are 38 Great Danes and I can't remember having 24 Old English sheepdogs. But the German shepherds are way donwn. They used to go 85 to 90 without a spe cialty. Now there are 31. I can't understand it.”

1253-> Bond Market Stages a Rebound As 6 Syndicates Are Disbanded
The bond market went through a catharsis yesterday, and it came out of the experience with a much healthier mental attitude toward the future. Half a dozen under writing syndicates decided to terminate because they were unable to attract investors. The bonds dropped sharply in price, hit bottom, bounced and closed well above their lows. The credit market shrugged off the Nixon Administration's decision to cancel the $1.5‐ billion freeze in construction funds ordered last September— a decision that might have been, interpreted as a weakening in the Government's effort to fight inflation. New Bond Issues ?? Instead, it chose to pay more attention to Arthur F. Burns' testimony to Congress yester day. The Federal Reserve chair man disclosed that the central bank had already moved to re lax somewhat its severely tight monetary policy. New issues of corporate bonds rose in price, and Treas ury notes and bonds advanced —some as much as half point. At was the first genera advan?? in the bond marke in a week and a half. “Things don't look as black as they did yesterday,” one tax‐exempt bond dealer re marked after the close of trad ing. By deciding to disband, fiv syndicates offering new corpo rate bond issues permitted thi securities to find their own level for prices and yields. In the process, a large vol ume of unsold securities was placed with investors, clearing the way for the heavy supply of additional bonds still sched uled for sale between now and the middle of April. The $75‐million issue of Chesapeake & Potomac Tele phone Company of Virginia first marketed on March 10, was a typical example of this ac. tivity. The bonds, carrying an 831 per cent interest rate and ma turing in 2010, were offered first at 101.116 per cent of their face value to yield 8.65 per cent. They dropped to a low of 973, where they yielded 8.97 per cent, and then rebounded to close at 98%, where they yielded 8.90 per cent. In the market for new corpo rate bonds yesterday, mean while, the Baltimore Gas & Electric Company sold $40‐ million of Aaa‐rated securities maturing in 1974. A four‐manager underwriting network headed by Lehman Brothers won the issue and then offered it to investors at a yield of 8.25 per cent. The noncallable bonds were given an 8½ per cent interest rate and a price of 100.837. The $100‐million of Public Service Electric & Gas Company Aa ‐ rated bonds priced late Tuesday were offered formally yesterday, and most of them apparently were sold by the end of the afternoon. A syndicate headed by Mer rill Lynch marketed the bonds with a 9⅛ per cent interest rate and a price of 101.29 to yield 9 per cent. The $200‐million of Federal National Mortgage Association five‐year debentures priced late Tuesday were offered yester day, too, and they sold quickly. The securities were marketed with an 8 per cent interest rate at a price of 100. The $100‐million issue of Tennessee Valley Authority 25‐ year Aaa‐rated bonds offered originally on Tuesday were de scribed late yesterday as virtu ally all sold. The tax‐exempt bond market performed much Iike the cor porate bond market. The $75‐million of New Jersey bonds, put on the market March 12, were cut in price yester day enough to raise their 35 or 40 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point). As a result, the $56.92‐million the underwriters still had un sold prior to the price reduc tion was cut to $28.18‐million by late afternoon. Today, the underwriters mar keting $30‐million of South Carolina bonds will let the $22, 325,000 still unsold trade in the free arket. This isue was auctioned March 10. Three new moderately large, tax‐exempt bond issues were brought to market. In the largest, the Allehany County Port Authority in Penn sylvania awarded $30‐million of A‐1 transit bonds to a First National City Bank. Atlanta sold $18‐million of Bâa‐rated airport revenue bonds to an eight‐manager group led by Phelps, Fenn & Co. Hartford, Conn., awarded $9.45‐million of Aaa bonds to a three‐manager First Boston group. In the short‐term tax‐exempt market, $203,981,000 of Feder ally backed housing notes awarded to a five‐member First National City Bank group were offered publicly at yields 20 basis pointers higher than sim ilar notes marketed a week earlier. Six‐month notes were offered at a 4.45 per cent rate and one‐year notes at 4.50 per cent. In Washington, the Treaso iry announced that it will of fer $1.7‐billion of nine‐month. Dills and one‐year bills in ex change for $1.5‐billion of bills coming due March 31 and tol raise $200‐million of additional funds.

1255-> TEAMSTERS ENDING CLEVELAND STRIKE
CLEVELAND, May 3 (AP)— Dissident teamsters in Cleve land voted today to end their 32‐day wildcat strike, and 6,000 truck drivers in the local were to 20 back to work tomorrow. The vote, which union of ficials said was 951 for re turning to work and 378 against, was taken by Local 407 two days after Akron teamsters voted to end their walkout. About 4,600 drivers are in volved in the Akron vote. In Cleveland, violence during the strike had prompted the call‐up of 3,000 National Guardsmen to protect drivers who remained on the job. Robert Sweeney, a Democrat gubernatorial candidate and labor specialist called by the dissidents to help bring a settlement, said the votes were on the condition that there he no reprisals against the strikers. The tentative national con tract calls for a pay increase of $1.10 an hour over 39 months. The Ohio drivers, who currently average about $4.03 an hour, began their wildcal strike on April 1 to demand a 82 an hour increase over there.

1256-> Lions Seen as Deserving
Of the 10 teams vying for the five remaining playoff positions and a shot at the Super Bowl riches, the De troit Lions deserve oft merit to qualify more than the others. Yet the Lions, second behind. Minnesota in their division, are in one of the most precarious positions. They must win About on Sunday against Green Bay. Pro Should the Dal Football las Cowboys also win from Hou ston, while the Giants beat the Rams, the Lions would need a victory An a subse quent coin toss to break their tie in the standings with the Cowboys. The Lions and Cowboys, with 10‐4 won‐lost records, would be in a tie for second place in the National Con ferende, and second is good for a playoff spot. Because the two did not meet in the regular season, the only way under the rules to break their tie would be to have Com missioner Pete Rozelle toss a Rozelle said yesterday, “I certainly hope this doesn't have to happen.” Rozelle and the Lion fans recognize the club's out standing record. The nine teams beaten, by the Lions have by far the best com bined won‐lost percentage, .576, of any of the other, con tending clubs’ opponents. The St. Louis Cardinals, for example, have beaten teams whose combined won‐lost percentage is merely .307. The figures show that the Lions have played the most difficult schedule and done the most with it. With the three teams that have already clinched berths, here is the ranking of the prospective playoff teams with regard to the combined won‐lost percentages of the foes they have defeated: It was stated here incor rectly in yesterday's edition that the only way, the Giants and Rams could qualify for the playoffs would be by fin ishing first in their divisions. Not so.

1259-> Next U. S Pullout Includes First Division
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Jan. 12—The United States mil itary command announced here today that the First Infantry Division would be the major combat element to leave South Vietnam in the third phase of President Nixon's withdrawal program. The other combat units scheduled to be pulled out by Apri1 15 are the Third Brigade of the Fourth Infantry Division and the 26th Marine Regimen tal Landing Team. Also includ ed in the withdrawal plan will be three jet fighter squadron of the Air Force's 12th Tactical Fighter Wing and Army and Navy support units. According to the announce ment, none of the troops will leave South Vietnam before early February, presumably not until after the Tet, or Lunar New Year, holiday on Feb. 6. Major enemy offensives have taken place on or near the Tet holidays in the last two years. Thee 50,000 servicemen to leave Vietnam by April 15 will comprise 29,500 from the Army, 12,900 marines, 2,000 Navy men and 5,600 from the Air Force, the announcement said. According to Presiaent Nix on's third withdrawal an nouncement on Dec. 15, the authorized United States troop level in Vietnam by April 15 will be 434,000. The peak level last year was about 540,000. The 18,000‐man First Infan itry Division, in Binhduong Province just north of Saigon, has had, little contact with enemy forces since early last summer. It has engaged mostly in security pacification pro grams and building roads, skir mishing in small, battles with depleted Vietcong units in the area. To the north, in Phuoclong, Binhlong and northern Tayninh Provinces, the First Cavalry Di vision (Airmobile) has served as the major allied screening unit, and has reported success in blocking infiltration of main North Vietnamese Army units along the‐ Cambodian border toward the First Infantry Division's area of operations and, ultimately, Saigon. The First Infantry Division, known as the “Big Red 1” from its distinctive shoulder patch, will be reduced to a token force of a few hundred men and returned to Fort Riley, Kan., where it will be re organized as the First Infantry Division (Mechanized). Members of the division who have served only short periods in Vietnam will be transferred to other units to serve out their one‐year tour of duty. [It was believed that those with more than seven months of service in Vietnam would return to the United States, while others would be reassigned, The As sociated Press reported from the divigion's headquarters at Laikhe.] The Third Brigade of the Fourth Division, with 5,000 men, is based in the Central Highlands, operating in a vast and sparsely populated area around Pleiku. Allied military officials in this area have been urging that the major burden of the fighting there be turned over to South Vietnamese Army units. The 26th Marine Regimental Landing Team, also made up of about 5,000 men, has been under the operational control of the First Marine Division in Quangnam Province, west of Danang. The area, still one of the most difficult in the coun try, has been the scene of nu merous fierce battles through out the summer, with most, of the fighting being done by the First Marine Division. The jet fighter squadrons of the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing are based at Camranh Bay, from where they have support ed United States troops, main ly in the Central Highlands. As in the past, the ratio of combat and combat support troops to general support troops being withdrawn will be about 60 to 40, spokesmen said. SAIGON, Jan. 12 (UPI)—Al lied troops have killed 130 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers in the last two days of fighting near the Lao tian border and near Danang, military spokesmen said today. The American casualties were given as six men killed and 20 wounded. The spokesmen said one of the largest battles in the last two days had involved troops of the Americal Division who fought enemy forces of com pany strength yesterday near Tamky, 36 miles southeast of Danang on South Vietnam's northern coast.

1261-> Sports Editor's Mailbox
To the Editor: I appreciate The Times's mention of my letter‐writing campaign to preserve the name and insignia of the American Football League [Feb. 15]. How ever, the column, “About Pro Football” is erroneous in its comment “Coniglio, and plenty of other fans, are confused by the new designations, Ameri can Conference” ... etc. We are not confused, we are in furiated. We fully understand that the loss of the A.F.L.'s name is due over themselves A.F.L. owners' stumbling lover themselves to attain the glittering name of the N.F.L. This is exactly what is so re pulsive to American Football League fans. We have supported the A.F.L. since the time when a crowd of 10,000 was considered fabu lous. Along with our fine teams, we have been insulted and ridi culed by N.F.L. fans, writers, players and officials. Yet Pete Rozelle, Lemar Hunt and com pany expect us to run to the N.F.L. with open arms, play under that damned N.F.L. shield, and forget that we were a part of the strongest profes sional football league ever or ganized. Confused? It is the owners of pro football who are confused, if they believe that A.F.L. fans will take this insult lying down. I urge all A.F.L. fans to write to the owners of their favorite teams, and to Rozelle, demand ing that the American Football League retain its name and in signia, along with the 2‐point conversion, players names on jerseys, the A.F.L. Spalding football and the official score board clock as used in the A.F.L. They should also boycott all products endorsed by the N.F.L. unless such products are also endorsed by the American Football LEAGUE. ANGELO F. CONIGLIO A.F.L. Identity Committee Amherst, N. Y. To the Editor: With due praise to Steve Cady for his eloquent obituary about Hirsch Jacobs, he did not make one point. That was to mention Hirsch Jacobs's hon esty as a horse owner‐trainer. When a Bieber‐Jacobs horse was running on the card, the horseplayer knew they would be “up there” trying—the horse, the jockey and the man who saddled the horse—Hirsch Jacobs. For many horseplayers, despair turned to hope when they saw the names Bieber Jacobs. It will take many “Big A” openings to forget Hirsch Jacobs. MERIAM KAHN $2 Bettor New York, N. Y. To the Editor: There appears to be a decided difference of opinion between contributors to the Feb. 15 Sports Editor's Mailbox con cerning the impact of the Mill rose Games. A gentleman from Red Bank maintains they're “poorly staged.” Another, from New York, notes with approves the “trumpet flourishes” em ployed to signal a meet record. With reference to the first writer's complaint, it occurs to me that today's television minded sports fan has devel oped a peculiar trait. Unless he's assured that what's being shown is out of the ordinary, he hesitates to exult or to trust in his own judgment. “The an nouncing is rudimentary and lacking in excitement,” we're told. Ought not the last‐men tioned element to be provided by the contestants? Since the Millrose Games generally prove to be a visual treat, some might find it more satisfactory merely to look and not listen. For anyone who deems the spoken commentary dull, a pair of ear‐stopples could be very helpful. THOMAS G. MORGANSEN Jackson Heights. N. Y

1262-> Advertising: Europeans Doing Own Thing
Just back from a triumphal, whirlwind tour of the Con tinent and a sojurn in Merrie England, John E. O'Toole, the top knocker of Foote, Cone & Belding, was ready yesterday to share his philosophical overview of the advertising scene. It's coming along, he said. But being ‘a Yankee to the core, he testified, “The best of United States advertising is still the best in the world.” What took Mr. O'Toole away from us for 12 days was the third annual creative meeting of the agency's nine major European offices that was held in London. It was the first he'd attended since he only recently came to power. The purpose of these meet ings is to make each office's output “better according to the basic standards of F. C. & B.—the same profes sional approach. It also gave the visiting American an in sight into how other admen The British, he noted, are the most advanced when it comes to thinking out the strategy and the unique posi tioning of a product, and also in the execution of the ad vertising. “If they have any fault, it's an inordinate reliance on puns,” he said pointing to Exhibit A on the corkboard, which was a blanket ad head lined “Good Knight's Sleep.” The Germans, he said, are wonderful as far as their beautifull logical strategy and their meticulous research, “but that's where they leave it.” Charging them with “over directness in execution” Mr. O'Toole waved at Exhibit B, an ad for an underarm spray deodorant,that shows it being applied. You don't find that anywhere else, he said. As far as Italian advertis ing goes, he felt that while the strategy might not have the thoroughness of the Ger man, the execution was far better. “I'm hopeful and pleased about what is hap pening in Italy. The Dutch advertising, he noted, might be characterized for the boldness of its graph ics and type and added, “If that's a trend, this is all to the good.” And, while a concern about ecology is “sweeping Eu rope,’ Mr. O'Toole felt that the concern is shown most in Scandinavian advertising. The agency president also reported that when the boys got together in London, sex in advertising was “a great topic of discussion.” And Mr. O'Toole had some instant analysis in that area, too. Although there's no such thing in Italy, he said, “The British are in the dirty‐little boy school. The German's say, ‘Here's a nipple if that's going to make you look,’ and then there's the Scandinavian approach, total openness.” But, he added, “I found the absolute worst when I came back here.” He indi cated Exhibit X, a small‐space ad torn from a recent News week. Over the picture of a man—fiftyish and in dinner clothes—a really young‐look ing girl and a bottle of Scotch is the headline, “There's a right age for everything. In Scotch, it's Grand Old Parr, Over at A.C.&R., the Ted Bates subsidiary that created the ad, there was obvious shock and chagrin when they learned the someone might have read their ad wrong. In the larger version of the ad, they explained, the young woman's wedding ring shows —they're supposed to be mar ried—and besides the model is 23 old. Beware of the beholder's eye! Generally speaking, Hunt Wesson was pleased with the way the story about their menu program turned out in this column yesterday. Gen erally, not totally, since in stead of indicating they re ceived 800,000 consumer re sponses, it came out 80,000. The West Coast chief of Young & Rubicam is off to Washington and plans to go into Government service, as the saying goes. Jesse T. (Tom) Ellington Jr., a senior vice president in the Los Angeles office, expects to become a special deputy to the Postmaster General. His late father founded Ellington & Co., so that makes Tom a second generation adman and a first generation mailman. He is being replced as West Coast leader by Julian E. AvRutick, who has been upped to senior vice presi dent. Mr. AvRutick has been with the agency for 10 years, having joined up across the border in the Toronto office. And isn't it about time we had somebody besides J. Wal ter Thompson graduates run ning the country? Doyle Dane Bernbach has ben named by Boise Cascade to handle advertising for its two‐year‐old Recreation Com munities Group, which is de scribed as a “leisure land de veloper.” There are more than 30 such developments on the United. States mainland and that's as far as D.D.B.'s re sponsibility goes. Previously, local agencies handled advertising for each of the developments. Now, D.D.B. from its leisure land in 43 Street will paint the big. picture, while its Promotion Plus subsidiary handles the collateral material. then it won't dissolve in water, either. Hopefully. This business definitely will not bill $22‐million, but Columbia Pictures will be the first movie company to take advantage of Mutual Sales’ “basic bus” concept— that's where one advertiser takes all the ads inside a bunch of omnibuses. Apparently the move has affected their minds since the ads for their films will be joined on Dec. 15 in the 200 New York buses by such mes sages as, “Welcome Aboard the Columbia Buswagon,” “Columbia Puts You in the Movie Seat,” and “Merry Co lumbia and a Happy New York!” Eleven different movies will be advertised on each of the buses for the du ration of the four‐week ef fort.

1263-> Fame and Obscurity
Gay Talese is a journalist who can be a graceful, accomplished writer gifted with a shrewd eye, a stout and ample heart, and the patience to wait endlessly until the moment finally arrives when the subject of his portrait, his vigilance lulled, drops his guard. His intention, he says, is “to absorb the whole scene, the dialogue and mood, the tension, drama, conflict, and then... write it all from the point of view of the persons I am writing about, even revealing whenever possible what these individuals are thinking during those moments I am describing.” Portraits by Gay Talese. 357 pp. New York and Cleveland: World Publishing Company. $7.95. The aim, that is to say, is to press the observed scene toward the modes of fictional representation while at the same time remaining committed to the traditional strictures on faithful reportage; to use (he says elsewhere in another but related connection) “the techniques of fiction, an aspiration on my part to somehow bring to reportage the tone that Irwin Shaw and John O'Hara had brought to the short story.” But the fictional frame has a way of cropping and composing the experienced scene, in essence creating it from the “given” material. Leaving to God the question of what is truth, and what really happened that day in Jerusalem, the issue here is what kind of “fiction” results from the transplant. How high is the yield, and of what quality? The results are mixed. “Fame and Obscurity” is a collection of representative work spanning much of Talese's career: Esquire profiles of tabloid and neon celebrities; all of “The Bridge,” his short book on the mighty race of bridge‐builders; and all of “New York—A Serendipiter's Journey,” glimpses and oddments culled from the streets and alleys of the city. There are good things here, very good, details which in themselves give pleasure, attract light and take on color, assume dimension in isolation and distinctiveness because they are well seen—especially in the vignettes of city life. It is noteworthy that here Talese tries for nothing grand; he is gathering and arranging found objects for a setting, but not populating and activating it with characters and actions. When he does—as in the pro Creamy insights, pop Psychologizings files—the results are quite different: the larger the ambition, the smaller the success. Rendering some plausible version of what makes Sinatra run, what drives Joshua Logan, what it is with Peter O'Toole—that is another matter. And here, where it counts, is where Talese slips, in some instances badly. What would you suppose about the likes of a Sinatra then pushing 50? Exactly, exactly, just right: all the received platitudes rush to the mind. And Joshua Logan, up from Louisiana and fighting now, after faltering the last few times out, to stay up. Logan, who has been in mental ‘hospitals and was then in psychotherapy, was directing a Negro cast in a play that was destined to fail. And Logan, who as a small boy had been driven furiously by a carnivorous Mom (a bit of a plantation belle) and further intimidated by a formidable Negro maid‐nurse, is directing the strongwilled, commanding Claudia McNeil. Naturally, vestigial emotions, dredged up from past pain and spilled inappropriately into the present, produce unexpected fireworks, rewarding Talese with a remarkable scene. Very well; but is this “why” Logan acted as he did? Logan implies as much, and Talese obediently records it; but we have as little reason to credit Logan with reliable knowledge of his own unconscious dynamics as we have to yield our consent to Talese. And so with all the others: the insights are too easily won, they emerge too creamily from the insightmachine that manufactures such stamped and certified knowledge. Somehow none of it is convincing; it rings hollowly of instant psychoanalysis, pop psychologizing. Talese is too unwary, too incautious, too ready to accept at‐hand conveniences, gladly presented by the subjects themselves as the hard, bitter truths of their interesting lives. These are the “truths” of bad‐to‐middling fiction. This, precisely, is what the good novelist rejects, refusing all kinds of offers of help generously bestowed, knowing that truths are to be found elsewhere than at home, waiting to be picked up for the asking. And this is what the New Journalist — compelled to write at restrictive length for an audience that demands familiar formulas above all and has no more tolerance than he for loose, tattered ends, bewildering inconsistency, apparent contradiction, surprise and enigma, the elements that steadfastly resist the false coherence of imposed pattern—apparently cannot acknowledge, settling instead for the flat, varnished tale, the kind that goes down so easily, and is as easily forgotten.

1264-> North Korea Offers to Sign Pact With South if U.S. Troops Go
SEOUL, South Korea, June 24 (UPI)—North Korea today marked the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the Korean war by offering to sign a non aggression pact with South Korea and take other steps leading to eventual reunifica tion of the country. The con dition was that all American forces be withdrawn first from the peninsula. There was no immediate re action from Seoul. Shortly after the proposal was broadcast by the North Korean press agency, North Ko rea requested a meeting tomor row of the Korean Military Armistice Commission. The United Nations Command asked that the meeting be held Mon day instead. A command spokes man said North Korea gave no reason for requesting the meet ing. North Korea could submit its proposal at a commission meet ing at Panmunjom tomorrow, the anniversary of the war here. The proposal, as broadcast by the press agency, said the Gov ernment of Premier Kim II Sung was willing not only to nego tiate a nonaggression pact but also to work out a reduction of up to 100,000 troops in the armed forces of both North and South Korea. It also urged re unification through free elec tions, with the social and po litical systems in both North and South remaining the same until the issue can be decided. North Korea insisted, how ever, that the United States must withdraw all of its forces from South Korea, before any agreements could be made. “To prevent war in Korea to day, the source of war must be removed,” the statement said. The proposal was announced one day after President Chung Hee Park of South Korea said the United States must not withdraw its troops here until this country was able to defend itself from the North. HONG KONG, June 24—With Communist China playing a pivotal role, leaders of East Asian Communist states and movements are preparing for a big display of solidarity for the 20th anniversary of the out break of the Korean war to morrow. Delegations from North Viet nam, the provisional revolu tionary government of South Vietnam and the Communist led Patriotic Front of Laos, or Neo Lao Hak Xat, converged on Pyongyang, the North Ko rean capital, today after being feted en route in Peking. They will join a Cambodian delega tion under Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the Commu nist‐dominated Cambodian gov ernment in exile. It is assumed that the Chi nese will also send a delega tion to Pyongyang for the oc casion. A joint editorial in the three major Peking publications to day said North Korean and Chinese troops had defeated “United States imperialism” in the Korean war and started “the beginning of its slide downhill.” The editorial, which was relayed here by Hsinhua, the Chinese press agency, said that “United States imperial ism” was continuing its aggres sion, in Korea, in “occupying China's territory of Taiwan” and in sending large numbers of troops “to invade Indo china.”

1268-> Bermuda Tackles Task of Recreating First Sailboat
ST. GEORGE, Bermuda — This is where it all started, this madness that engulfs mil lions of seagoing citizens of the Western Hemisphere. The first blue‐water ship built on this side of the At lantic was put together near this quaint, ancient town. She was called the Deliverance and was the first sailboat built in Bermuda. Now, a short reach from the cannon and pillory in the square, the framework of a sailing ship identical to the Deliverance is taking shape. This replica is imbedded in concrete and will serve as a monument to Bermuda's first sailboat. The Deliverance — as her name implies—was born out of desperation, for she was conceived to rescue ship wrecked British emigrants on this Atlantic isle and carry out their original mission of saving the colony of James town from extinction. As it turned out, when the Deliverance and a smaller ship also built here reached the Virginia colony, they were greeted by only 60 sur vivors of the 500 settlers who had arrived in Jamestown six months earlier. The palisades of the fort were torn down and charred skeletons remained of houses burned by maurauding Indi ans. There was little food left for the starving settlers. So desperate was the plight in Jamestown that the De liverance was sent back to Bermuda for provisions. At this point—mid‐June of 1610 —all trace of the Deliverance has been lost. Her mysterious disappear ance from history posed a ma jor problem to the Junior Service League. How do you reproduce in detail a ship that suddenly ceased to exist? The question was handed to Cyril Smith, former director of Bermuda's Public Works Department, who was charged with the task of drawing plans for the replica. Since. Smith had no origi nal design from which to cre ate the Deliverance, he was forced to draw his inspiration from the Sea Venture, the ship that was wrecked in the original effort to reach Jamestown. The Sea Venture set out in 1609 from Falmouth, Eng land, as the flagship of a fleet of nine vessels. Sir Thomas Gates, the Deputy Governor for Virginia, was aboard the 200‐ton Sea Venture, com manded by Admiral Sir George Somers. The Sea Venture became separated from the rest of the convoy in a storm off the Azores and, after seven weeks at sea, sailed into a hurricane. Cargo was jetti soned, but—in spite of every thing—the ship sprang a leak and water poured into the hold. The Sea Venture, hundreds of miles from Jamestown and foundering, appeared doomed until Sir George gazed through weary eyes at the horizon and shouted, “Land, ho!” It was Bermuda. To sailors of that era, Ber muda was a fearful place, lined by reefs. It was a grave yard for ships and became known as the “Devil's Isles” among superstititous sea farers. The Sea Venture was bat tered against the reefs and became wedges, quite fortu nately, between two rocks off an island that later was called St. George's, in memory of Sir George Somers and for the patron saint of England. Lifeboats ferried the colo nists ashore, along with what ever tools and equipment could be salvaged, and at evening prayer meeting, 150 answered the roll call. One month after the land ing, a longboat from the Sea Venture was fitted with sail and a crew of eight tried to make it to Jamestown. Those left behind feared — quite prophetically—that the long boat would not succeed and they started, on Aug. 28, 1609, to build the Deliverance. The new sailboat was less than half the size of the Sea Venture and obviously could not carry all the stranded colonists. When the longboat failed to return frcim James town, a second barque, the Patience, was built. The Deliverance was made from the wreckage of the Sea Venture and native Bermuda cedar, caulked with turtle oil and boiled Bermuda lime stone. The amateur shipbuild ers improvised, taking pat terns and templates into the woods to find trees of usable sizes and shapes. The trees were hauled back, sometimes for miles, through thick growth. When the Junior League decided, in 1964, to restore the Deliverance, a massive sleuthing job was undertaken. Smith spent years leaf ing through old documents and books in maritime mu seums and extrapolating from existing plans of contempo rary ships (the Mayflower was one). “We feel we have the plans as close as we can get to what the Deliverance looked like,” Smith said. The Deliverance was de scribed rather well in the writings of William Strachey, secretary to Sir Thomas and a passenger on the ship. Strachey kept a diary and wrote extensive letters to England. “Most of what I have came from Strachey's writ ings, drawings of other ships of the period, and advice from William Baker,” Smith said. Baker, curator of the Nautical Museum at the Mas sachusetts Institute of Tech nology and designer of the Mayflower replica, is confi dent that the Deliverance project is “on the right track.” “The planners have made a good effort to do the job correctly,” he said, “and with historic accuracy.” The new Deliverance is be ing built in a concrete base on Ordnance Island, a man made slip connected to St. George by foot bridge. The island, which houses the St. George Dinghy Club and few coral block build ings, was used for the serv icing of ships. It is about mile from where the original Deliverance set out to save Virginia.

1270-> State Department Now Neutral On Repeal of Tonkin Resolution
WASHINGTON, March 12 The State Department has shifted to a neutral position on a proposed congressional repeal of the 1964 Tonkin Gulf resolution. The resolution gave prior ap proval of “all necessary meas sures” that the President might take to repel any armed attack “to prevent further aggression.” Former President Lyndon B. Johnson used the resolution to justify the bombing of North Vietnam and the commitment of United States soldiers to combat in South Vietnam. The repeal of the resolution is part of a proposal offered by Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, which would alto repeal three similar resolutionl. In December, the State Depart ment took an official position opposing repeal “at this time,” but Secretary of State William P. Rogers said later that the department would look into the matter further. An aide of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmed tonight that the department had sent a nine‐page letter to Senator J. W. Fulbright, chair man of the committee, altering the Administration's stand on the resolution. In the letter, the State De partment said it neither advo cated nor opposed repeal of the Tonkin Gulf or the other resolu tions, explaining that the crises under which they were adopted had since passed. The Mathias proposal would also repeal resolutions backing Presidents Dwight D. Eisen hower and John F. Kennedy in crises involving Taiwan, the Middle East and Cuba.

1271-> Skippers to Observe Separate Handicap Rules in Two Great Lakes Events
Skippers who sail in both Mackinac races on the Great Lakes next summer—the De troit Bayview Yacht Club's event on July 11 and the Chicago Y.C.'s trip on July 18 —will operate under separate handicap rules. Bayview, sponsor of the 235‐ mile race from Port Huron to Mackinac Island, announced that it would be sailed under the old Cruising Club of Amer ca rating rule. However, the Chicago club said earlier it would use the new International Offshore Rule, which was adopted and approved by the C.C.A. and the North American Yacht Racing Union last summer. Wendell (Pat) Cody, chairman of Chi cago's 330‐mile race, says he expects more than 200 starters. Skippers without the new I.O.R. rating will not be al lowed to enter, says Cody Walter Lindeman of Milwaukee chief measurer of the Lake Michigan Yachting Association is confident that implementa tion of the I.O.R. rule will not hold down the entry unduly. John Burkard, in charge of measurements for the Cruising Club of Detroit fleet, says there isn't time to have the fleet for the Lake Huron race measured. Stanley Puddiford, race chair man, expects 275 starting boats. Mark Baxter, the union's Chicago representative, says a seminar on the I.O.R. rule will be held at the Chicago Y.C. next Thursday and Friday for all fresh‐water measurers. Detroit area skippers who race cruising boats, such as the Mackinac group, are more in terested in the contemplated action of the recently formed Detroit One‐Design Yachting Association to move its class races from Saturday to Sunday on the regatta calendar next summer. The change will free crews for Saturday racing, of ficials say. Cruising boats and One De signs have raced the same day, Saturday, since the Detroit River Y.A. was organized in 1915. Detroit Bayview's move to Sunday has the approval of all 14 class representatives. Big‐boat owners Say their crew problems will be solved largely if the small fry race Sundays. The shortage of crews has become more acute than ever with the recent boom in cruising sailboats. “A man wearing topsiders who wanders down the dock on race days is all but shang haied,” says Irv Yackness, com modore of the Detroit River Y.A. who sails the 35‐foot sloop Huntress out of the Great Lakes Y.C. “There has been more stealing of crews, and skippers recruit helmsmen and light can vasmen with stories of ice boxes packed with steaks, beer and scotch. “A good helmsman comes high. A skipper will frequently turn the boat over to him for his own use during the week.” There's another angle. “The young guys like the, idea because they can race, Saturdays on the cruising boats and get the experience in One Designs on Sunday,” said Bob Sellers of the Tempest Class. More than 300 boats turn out for the Saturday regattas on Lake St. Clair. More than half of those race in handicap divi sions. The One Designs usually are represented by 100 to 125 boats, and there are nearly 400 registered in the St. Clair area. The move to Sunday for the One Designs is expected to bring out larger fleets. Instead of a single race, it has been suggested that two or three races be held and that the old course, far up in Lake St. Clair along the Canadian shore, be moved to the area south of Gaukler Point along the Grosse Pointe shore.

1272-> Looking Over the Talent at Grossinger's
GROSSINGER, N. Y., April 2—Politics and overcrowding made strangers roommates at Grossinger's, the sprawling resort hotel in the Catskills that was the scene of the meeting of the State Demo cratic Committee. In the confusion of arrival, Congressmen and other elected officials stood in line for as long as an hour to check in, and there was a great deal of unplanned doubling‐up. Arthur J. Gold berg, the party's gubernato rial designee, was unable to get a room at all, and stayed at another resort hotel. • HE Democratic designee for the United States Senate, Theodore C. Soren sen, had a “hospitality suite” that became a bedroom when the nominating proceedings stretched over into today. Mr. Sorensen's wife, Gillian, set up 11 folding beds in the suite for Sorensen staff mem bers who had expected to be able to leave last night. And there were mattresses spread out on the floor of Adam Walinsky's suite as well. Mr. Walinsky was the commit tee's choice for Attorney Gen eral. The delegates, whose busi ness suits and ties looked out of place in the pleasure palace decor, were given maps of Grossinger's to find their way around. The weather, if not political business, kept them from enjoying such recreations as golf and ten nis. Some stayed not in the main hotel but in cottages that bore names such as Eddie Cantor House or Mil ton Berle Cottage. • HERE was a ban on dem onstrations, but everyone wore at least one button, in cluding the waiters, who wore whatever was being handed out or seemed to harmonize best with their short jackets. And there was the button that said simply: “Moczyd lowski.” It was not, as many dele gates assumed, a joke. Aloysius Moczydlowski, the vice mayor of Yonkers, was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor. Mr. Moczydlowski larded his speech to the convention with Polish—a promise to his father, he said—and with a phrase in Italian to honor the bulk of his constituents. He got one of the biggest hands of the convention as he wound up by saying: “Erin Go Bragh! Shalom!” • S Wednesday night wore on Thursday morning, fatigue twisted the tongues of speakers: Eugene H. Nick erson, the Nassau County Executive who sought the gubernatorial designation, was twice referred to as “Mr. Nixon.” Mr. Goldberg was twice called “Mr. Goldwater,” a reference not to the 1964 Republican presidential can didate but to Monroe Gold water, the 84‐year‐old lawyer who served as law chairman of the convention; at least once, Mr. Goldwater was called Mr. Goldberg. • ACH delegate was given a strip of blue cardboard, perforated at set intervals, when he arrived; a portion of the strip was torn off for each meal. The kosher food was ample if perhaps less lavish than the legendary Grossinger's spreads, but eat ing was not the primary function of mealtime. For candidates, it was public relations hour. All of them walked to their tables by routes that took them past the greatest number of tables to be greeted and hands to be shaken. For others, it was a time to watch who smiled at whom and speculate as to its deep significance; the loud speaker was in constant use as politician after politician was paged. • THE PLAYHOUSE, the barn style theater in which the meeting was held, was fes tooned with the standard red, white and blue bunting and equipped with aluminum poles used as standards and mi crophones placed around the floor. But the urge to decorate — or to campaign — left the hotel's staff with a cleanup problem: late tonight they were deployed with buckets of soap and water and razor blades to remove the stickers that had been affixed to walls, lampshades and any other available space.

1275-> Compulsive Escalation
With terrifying speed all the tragic errors of esca lation are being repeated in Southeast Asia. Once again a President elected on a pledge of extricating the United States from the Vietnamese morass is em barked on a delusive quest for peace through widen ing the war. And each plunge down that road to dis aster is followed posthaste by another and still an other in a dismal replay of the futility ushered in by the initial escalation after Pleiku in February 1965. The large‐scale air attack on North Vietnam by American fighter‐bombers this weekend did more than shatter the bombing halt ordered by President Johnson eighteen months ago. Coming just two days after the assignment of American troops to combat duty in Cambodia, the raid made it plain that the Pentagon is finding a receptive ear at the White House for its long campaign to strike at the enemy wherever its bases and supply lines may be. This is a “domino” theory in reverse involving lim itless risk and no discernible hope of success—a course rejected as to unpromising even at the height the Johnson military expansion. Unquestionably, the Nixon Administration is encour aged by the conviction that the Soviet Union and Communist China are so busy with their mutual ani mosities that they will refrain from stepped‐up action in support of Hanoi and the other Communist elements in Indochina. Yet the history of all past escalation in this area has been that it stiffens the Communist will to resist, pushes up the death toll, brings no serious move to ward the peace table and drives both Moscow and Peking into more vituperative anti‐American positions. This is a two‐way process of gambling with human destiny. Much of the inspiration for the President's stance in Cambodia obviously derived from concern that Moscow's increasing aggressiveness in the Mid east stemmed from a belief that the United States was a paper tiger. *** What makes the current escalation doubly dismaying is its panicky pace. On April 20, from the relaxed setting of his ocean‐front refuge at San Clemente, President Nixon gave the nation a reassuring report on the progress of Vietnamization and pacification. He was able to “say with confidence” that both proc esses were succeeding so well that another 150,000 American troops could, be brought home. Ten days later a much grimmer President was on television with a warning that the United States was in danger of battlefield humiliation that could topple it into the status of a second‐rate power. Since then the area and extent of United States involvement have broadened so rapidly that even the defenders of the Administration's course have been left tongue‐tied. The first embarrassment was the disclosure that the Government Washington seeks to prop up in Cam bodia was among the last to learn that American forces were en route to mop up Communist sanctu aries there. Comparable was the plight of such Admin istration stalwarts as Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott cut adrift with White House‐inspired statements that renewed bombing of the North was a remote con tingency at the very time a hundred American planes were dropping bombs across the demilitarized zone. The defeat in the Texas Democratic primary of Sena tor Ralph Yarborough, a Vietnam dove, will no doubt be taken by many around the President as evidence popular approval of his new tough line. Mr. Nixon, by characterizing far‐out elements among his campus critics as “bums,” already has provided additional fodder for fear that much of his sudden militancy in Vietnam stems from a desire to divert attention from inflation, unemployment and other difficulties as the Congressional election moves into high gear. The need in the conferences the President plans hold tomorrow with four key Congressional commit tees is to get the focus back on deceleration of a war that, as Vice President Agnew acknowledged yester day, the United States cannot hope to win and that makes impossible the attainment of urgent national goals. Making the war bigger is a formula for calamity, not extrication.

1276-> Regan Says Fixed Rates Should Be ‘First Relic’ Discarded in Changes
The president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., the nation's largest brok erage house, called yesterday for an elimination of fixed mini mum commissions for stock transactions on the New York’ Stock Exchange. In a speech before the Rotary Club of Dallas, Donald T. Re gan said that fixed minimum commissions should be “the first relic to be chucked over board” as part of a far‐reach ing reorganization of the secur ities industry. Mr. Regan thus aligned Mer rill Lynch, generally regarded as the most efficient and prof itable as well as the largest concern in the securities indus try, with views expressed by Robert W. Haack, president of the Big Board, in a controver sial speech before the Economic Club of New York on Nov. 18. In that speech, which some Wall Street observers believe may cost him his job, Mr. Haack called for an end to the exchange's 178‐year‐old policy of fixed minimum commissions and urged a broad reorganiza tion of the exchange's policy making procedures to eliminate “vestiges of a private club at mosphere.” Despite bitter opposition from many elements of the Wall Street community, Mr. Haack is understood to believe that pub lic opinion is on his side in the commission controversy. The support voiced by Mr. Regan added considerable weight to that view. Although Mr. Haack proposed a gradual elimination of fixed commission rates, starting with large‐volume transactions, Mr. Regan said yesterday that “right now is the time to be gin” with changes in the organi zation of the securities indus try. He also paid tribute to the “great courage” of Mr. Haack in calling for a “break with past methods.” In calling for various changes in securities industry practices, Mr. Regan said: “Part of the preparation is to rid ourselves of useless weight. The first relic to be chucked overboard is the fixed commission structure.” He added: “Wall Street is hiding behind a protective pricing system, while it preaches free competition and free markets. That is like catch ing Carrie Nation tippling in the basement. We say that competition is good for every one.” The Merrill Lynch president also called for changes in the capital structure of brokerage houses and tighter requirements for persons seeking to enter the brokerage business. He proposed reducing the industry's present rule of a debt‐to‐equity ratio of 20‐to‐1 to 10‐to‐1 and setting up more stringent rules on the withdrawal of capital from brokerage houses. “Another bizarre aspect of our industry is that anyone who knocks can enter,”’ he said. “Anybody who has $5,000 and possession of his senses in sufficient degree to pass a simple examination can then rent a hat rack and a tele phone and call himself a broker.”

1279-> DURRENMATT SUED FOR LIBEL BY HABE
GENEVA, July 8—Hans Habe, the Hungarian‐born novelist, has filed suit for libel against Friedrich Diirrenmatt, the Swiss playwright. The story of the suit has its genesis in Mr. Habe's attack on Harry Buckwitz, the new director of the Schauspielhaus, the Zurich municipal theater. Mr. Diirrenmatt, an old friend of Mr. Buckwitz, a long time German actor and director, vigorously defended him after Mr. Habe accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Mr. Habe based his charges mainly on a book published by Mr. Buckwitz in Germany about his stay in a British detention camp in Tanganyika at the start of World War IL In the ensuing dispute, Mr. Dtirrenmatt called Mr. Habe Fascist and “a piece of excrement” in an interview published in a Zurich literary weekly, Sonntags Journal, of which the playwright is part owner. Reconciliation Doubted Mr. Habe's attorney, Dr. Lilio Franscini of Locarno, said that before the case was tried the presiding judge of the Zurich cantonal court's press libel division would require Mr. Habe and Mr. Diirrenmatt to appear in court and would try to arrange a reconciliation. However, there are no signs that Mr. Dtirrenmatt,, who was known for his outspoken opposition to Hitler will withdraw his attack on Mr. Habe. Rolf Hochhuth, the anti‐Nazi author of “The Deputy,” also had defended Mr. Buckwitz. Speaking from his home in Ascona, Mr. Habe said of the Buckwitz book: “It was a violent war‐mongering book, antiBritish, anti‐Jewish, anti‐Negro and pro‐Nazi.” Mr. Habe said that he had not asked for damages, but that if the judge found that a libel had been committed he could award damages and could also sentence Mr. Diirrenmatt to fine or imprisonment. He also said that the truth or falsity of his charges against Mr. Buckwitz would not be taken up. In reply to the Habe charges regarding his book, Mr. Buckwitz said that he had always been anti‐Nazi and that the objectionable passages in his 60page book, which was published in 1940, had been inserted by Nazi authorities. Some essays he wrote during his detention in Tanganyika, where he had first gone in 1937, came to the attention of German publishing house, which offered to publish them, he related. Later, Mr. Buckwitz said that the publishing concern, under Nazi orders, had inserted the sections to which Mr. Habe objected. After Germany's surrender, he said, he was cleared by the American de‐Nazification authorities. Charges Anti‐Americanism Both Mr. Dtirrenmatt and Mr. Hochhuth, Mr. Habe said, belong to the “left Establishment,” which wants to forget about the past records of Nazis and concentrate on anti‐Americanism. To prove this, Mr. Habe said that although Mr. Buckwitz would not take over as director of the Zurich Schauspielhaus until Aug. 1, he had already arranged to put on Mr. Hochhuth's latest play, “Guerrilla,” next January, and direct it himself. Mr. Habe added that the antiAmerican leanings of the play were obvious from the original subtitle, “How to Overthrow the American System by Force From Within” although, he said, Mr. Hochhuth has now dropped it. Mr. Buckwitz denied that the Hochhuth play, which has already been produced in Sweden, is anti‐American. It was concerned with the fate of democracy everywhere, he said, and sought to convey the message that things would have been better in the United States had President John F. Kennedy not been assassinated.

1280-> Many Democrats Assail State Nominating System
GROSSINGER, N. Y., April 2 —The confusion and disarray and the charges of “bossism” and racism that marked the Democratic State Committee's meeting here during the last few days have brought wide spread demands for the elimina tion of such meetings from the nominating process. Influential Democrats and members of the state committee criticized the system of state committee meetings as unwork able, confusing, a waste of time, a charade and a farce. The reaction of some of them was a result of the declaration by Arthur J. Goldberg that in addition to accepting the en dorsement of the state commit tee for the Democratic nomina tion for Governor he would circulate petitions among the voters to demonstrate that he was not the candidate of the “bosses” and to show that can didates were picked “by a fair and open process.” The criticism was stimulated when it became apparent at the meeting in Grossinger's that there would be primary fights for every statewide office ex cept Controller—the incumbent, Arthur Levitt, was the unani mous choice of the committee. Stanley Steingut, the Assem bly minority leader, said he would introduce a bill in the Legislature calling for the elim ination of the designating meeting of the state committee. “This is a confusing, wasted, inoperative device and largely a farce,” he said. “We should just use the petition system.” He said that he had always been in favor of the change and that the events here “have confirmed what I've felt.” The charges of bossism ram pant here have long been a familiar part of the Democratic nominating process. In the view of many Democrats they have weakened the party and fur nished political ammunition to the other parties in the gen eral election. The charges were based here on allegations that the county leaders were able to control the votes of committee mem bers from their areas and thus assure the endorsement of Mr. Goldberg. Influential black Democrats backing State Senator Basil A. Paterson for the nomina tion for Lieutenant Governor charged that some of these leaders were maneuvering to keep him off the ballot because they thought having a Negro on the statewide ticket would hurt the party's chances in No vember. They did not name the leaders. But even before the meeting began three of Mr. Goldberg's opponents asserted that county leaders were using Mr. Goldberg's candidacy in an effort to regain power in the state. Howard J. Samuels named Joseph F. Crangle of Erie, Pat rick J. Cunningham of the Bronx, William F. Luddy of Westchester, and Stanley Stein gut, former Brooklyn leader and now Assembly minority leader. Deputy Mayor Robert M. Morgenthau mentioned Frank G. Rossetti of Manhattan, Meade H. Esposito of Brooklyn and Mr. Cunningham. Nassau County Executive Eu gene H. Nickerson also made frequent use of the boss charge and he said today he would use it again in the primary. He as serted that Mr. Goldberg had won the majority endorsement of the state committee here “with the support of the bosses.” When Mr. Goldberg was asked at a news conference today for his definition of “boss,” he gave one often used by those who scoff at the charges of boss control. “If someone supports you, he's a leader; if he's against you, he's a boss,” Mr. Goldberg said. And he added that that was the attitude of those criti cizing him as the candidate of bosses. Mr. Steingut called the charge of bossism “completely phony.” “Every one of the candidates who appeared at the conven tion came to the leaders and the delegates to ask for their support,” he asserted in an in terview. The charge of bossism was used effectively against the Democrats in the 1966 guber natorial race. In that contest Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., a Democrat who ran on the Lib eral line, charged that power ful Democratic leaders had joined to get the party nomina tion for Frank D. O'Connor, who was defeated by Governor Rockefeller. Those who want the state committee designation meet ing abolished argue that it would be more democratic and far simpler to allow any candi date who wished to do so to enter the primary by collecting a specitiled number of petition signatures. Such a move, in the view of many politicians here, would weaken the power of the coun ty leader and aso minimize the charges of boss control so often leveled against the party. Under current law state com mittee meetings give the party's official endorsement to any candidate for a statewide of fice who receives a majority of the vote. Other candidates are auto matically entitled to enter the primary if they receive at least 25 per cent of the vote. Still other candidates may enter if they collect 10,000 petition sig natures with at least 50 from at least 47 of the state's 62 counties. This system, which went into effect for the first time when candidates for the United States Senate were selected in 1968 and which applies this year for the first time to other statewide contests, was considered a major electoral reform. Under the convention system the nominations were made by the convention and there was no provision for primary fights. Mr. Goldberg said at a news conference today that he was strongly in favor of eliminating these meetings and that if he became Governor he would use his influence to bring about the change. Mr. Nickerson and Mr. Samuels repeated demands they have made before for a direct primary system. “The state committee system is ludicrous,” Mr. Nickerson de clared. “Let's go directly into the primary.” One committee member re marked loudly in the lobby of Grossinger's: “Anyone who spent $120 to come here is a fool.” The reference was to his hotel bill. “Why don't we just put guns to our heads and get it all over?” Another committeeman was overheard asking a friend. “Then we wouldn't have to suffer like this.”

1281-> Group Is Organized to Teach Handicapped Children to Ride
AS headmaster of the Graf ton School of Berryville, Va., an institution that spe cializes in teaching young sters with learning disabili ties, Howard D. Haynes is aware of the value of ther apeutic measures. For many years, he used riding as an instrument in teaching the chil dren at Grafton better balance, Haynes is not novice trying to teach an unfa miliar subject because he still in the field three days a week. “I had been thinking of the great value of riding to these children for several years,” he said the other day on visit to New York. “I was aware of an organization called Riding for the Handi capped in England.” So Haynes, Alexander Macky‐Smith, editor of the Chronicle of the Horse of Middleburg, Va., and Mrs. Lin da McCowan, another Virgin ian, decided to do something about it. Out of their efforts has emerged an organization named the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (N.A.R.H.A.). “There has been a great deal of interest in riding programs for handicapped children in the last three or four years,” Haynes, an in tense man of 34 years, said. “Many individuals working with handicapped children are looking for new tech niques and this is one of the best.” Last year, Mrs. McGowan went to Chigwell, England, headquarters of Riding for the Handicapped and studied the program laid out by its director, John Davies. • “Now Mrs. McCowan is opening a riding center for the handicapped in Battle Creek, Mich.,” said Haynes. “There is a Cheff Foundation. out there and it is assisting Mrs. Cowan. I think her run a program of its own. handicapped children.” Haynes said that the N.A. R.H.A. will act as a clearing house and will not actually a program of its own. “We felt,” he said. “that since riding programs for handicapped children are mushrooming, there should be a governing body to set up some rules and regulations. “A program of this sort can be a powerful aid, but incorrectly used it can he harmful. We will make rec ommendations for the equip ment at the centers, training of instructors and types of horses to be used. “Our information will come from physicians and physical therapists. The technique of working with cerebral palsy children would not be the same as that used in treating children who have been stricken with polio, so care must be exercised.” • Haynes said the program will be patterned after the one in England which has about 12 centers scattered about the country. “Each center in England is under the direction of a physical therapist,” Haynes said. “There is also considera ble volunteer help from the parents of the children en rolled. It has been running about 10 years.” Davis attended the first meeting of the N.A.R.H.A. two months ago and outlined guidelines for the new group. Haynes said there are only two formalized programs now —the Battle Creek group headed by Mrs. McCowan and the Happy Horseman Center in Malvern, Pa. “One of our main hopes,” he said, “is to interest or ganizations such as the United States Pony Clubs in lending us volunteer assist ance. We think our program will provide a rewarding ex perience for Pony Clubbers. “Placing a handicapped child on a horse improves not only his physical but his emo tional stability as well. For severely disabled children, it provides them with four legs and access to movement they never have known before.”

1283-> A Handwritten Memo by Sweig Persuaded Jury to Convict Him
A short bit of Dr. Martin Sweig's own handwriting on Government Exhibit No. 5 in evidence persuaded the jury to convict him of one of the seven counts against him, a poll of the jurors disclosed yesterday. Sweig, tne suspended former chief administrative aide to House Speaker John W. McCormack had been tried on six counts of perjury and one of conspiracy. But the jurors acquitted him on all but one count when they returned their verdict Thursday night. That count alleged that Sweig had lied to a Federal grand jury here last October when he denied ever having heard of Gary Roth of Lawrence, L.I., or having made telephone calls in the name of the Speaker in an attempt to get him out of the Army. The bit of Sweig's handwriting that led to his conviction was written on memo paper on the top of which was printed “Speaker's Rooms.” The words were: “T W Roth. Real agitated fellow. Colonel wants to discharge him. Draft Board not in sympathy with his being discharged from the Army.” Memo on ‘Selby’ The memo was from a file in the Speaker's office produced as evidence by the Government. Also in the file was a handwritten memo by Sweig that he had “T W Selby.” United States Attorney Whitney North Seymour Jr. had explained to the jury that “T W” meant “talked with,” and witness identified “Selby” as Pentagon officer. Also in the file was a carbon copy of an unsigned note to “Dear Nat” informing him that Mr. Roth's “application for a hardship discharge has been approved and he will be discharged as soon as possible.” Mrs. Bertha Drotos, a secretary in the Speaker's office, testified that Sweig had dictated this note to then The Government called 47 witnesses in an attempt to prove that Sweig had made telephone calls to various Government officials to exert the Speaker's influence in behalf of clients of his alleged coconspirator, Nathan M. Voloshen. Voloshen. 70‐year‐old lawyer‘lobbyist, pleaded guilty to the indictment when the trial began June 17. Some of the witnesses brought office memos and telephone bills to show that the calls had come in and had been returned. “But each time a witness was asked If he was sure it was Dr. Sw.eig, he would say he ‘presumed’ it was Dr. Sweig,” one juror said yesterday. “W1Nn we talked it over in the jury room we had to agree with Mr. Smith that the cAls could have been made by Voloshen or somebody else.” Paul T. Smith. the Boston lawyer who defended Sweig, also succeeded in convincing the jurors that there was a reasonable doubt that Sweig had been aware of the free use being made of the Speaker's office by Voloshen, another juror said. “Dr. Sweig was such a busy man, handling all that mail and calls and visitors,” the juror said. “And the Speaker testified that he had the O.K. to use his name and sign it to mail.” Speaker McCormack testified for a full day during the trial as a Government witness. But in the opinion of one juror, “He helped Dr. Sweig more than he hurt.” “He didn't condemn him, said nothing but good about him. “He was a character witness, really.” Of another person called by the defense as a character witness, Representative Robert L. Leggett, Democrat of California, this juror said, “After hearing him, it's my opinion they should investigate all the members of Congress.” Representative Leggett had testified that he regarded the whole United States as his constituency and had no hesitancy about letting any constituent use his office or telephone on behalf of commercial clients. Gary Roth, 29, his father‐inlaw, Alfred Novick, owner of Stanton Junior Petites, dress manufacturers, and four Army officers testified on the discharge incident at the trial. Mr. Novick said he had paid $1,500 in cash to Voloshen to get Mr. Roth out of the Army. The Army officers testified that he was on the verge of being discharged anyway, as a “punitive” measure. However, Gary Roth testified that his actual hardship discharge came through after his brother‐inlaw, Sidney Ander, saw Senator Jacob K. Javits in Washington. A letter from Senator Javits stating that Mr. Ander, a deafmute, needed the services of his partner, Gary Roth, in business they operated that employed the physically handicapped was also in the file. “We could understand how such a busy man as Dr. Sweig could have forgotten about the other people, but we thought he should have remembered Gary Roth,” one of the jurors said yesterday. Judge Marvin E. Frankel set Aug. 31 for sentencing Sweig For the one count on which he was convicted, Sweig faces a maximum penalty of five years and fine of $2,000.

1284-> Blast in Mine Kills Company Official On Inspection Tour
DOLA, W. Va., April 2—An explosion of methane gas roared through the Compass No. 2 mine of the Clinchfield Coal Company this afternoon. One man was reported killed. The victim was one of eight company officials on an inspec tion tour in the mine following a ventilation failure earlier in the day. The normal day‐shift work force of 70 miners had been withdrawn when the mine fans failed. The miners escaped injury. The Dola mine was the scene of a major explosion disaster on April 25, 1963, when 22 men were killed in a methane ex plosion. Dola is about 20 miles southwest of Farmington, where 78 men were killed in the last large mine disaster—a methane explosion and fire—on Nov. 20, 1968. The dead man, described as the leader of the midafternoon inspection teacm, was identified as Baxter Ellison, 50 years old, the Compass No. 2 superin tendent. The West Virginia State Po lice at Clarksburg and spokes men for the Clinchfield Coal Company, a division of the Pittston Company of New York, said that high winds accom panying a storm caused a power failure at the mine in the early afternoon. According to law, officials said, the day shift of miners was ordered to the sur face during the ventilation failure. When power was restored to the fans at 2:09 P.M., the mine superintendent led the safety inspection crew into the mine, 550 feet below the mountains of Harrison County in north central West Virginia. Their aim was to inspect underground conditions before the afternoon shift entered the mine at 4 P.M.

OWARD ZINN, historian and profes sor of political science at Boston University, has never ben one to wait around for history to decide its next move. In the nineteen‐forties he fought in World War II as an Air Force bombardier. In the fifties he fought in the battle for Negro civil rights as chairman of the hisposing those facts that any society tends to hide about itself: the facts about wealth and poverty: about tyranny in both Com munist and Capitalist states; about lies told by politicians, by the mass media, by the church, by popular leaders.” The argument will sem obvious to some, outrageous to others. It sems to me that Mr. Zinn makes a very strong case. But I should also add that he develops it far more extensively and subtly than I can begin to indicate here; indeed, two of the three parts of the book, as well as seven of its 20 chapters, are devoted to specula tions about the writing of history rather than to history itself. And it should also be said that he goes out of his way to emphasize that his aim is not “to disengage history from the classical effort to be scientific,” nor to argue for a “uniform ap proach ... to writing history,” nor to “call for tampering with the facts — by distortion or concealment or invention.” Where his approach is somewhat weak, however, is in the middle section of his book—in his “essays in history”—where he attempts “to begin to meet those for a radical history.” It somehow amounts to less than a clarion call to action to learn that inequality has existed in America ever since the first settler landed on our shores and slaughtered his first Indian. Or that the United States Government has throughout history tended to side with the overdog. Or that he jazz age was not all jazz. Or that the so‐called pragmatism of Roosevelt and his Brain Trusters had its theoretical limitations and may not have finally solved America's social and economic problems. Or that the abolition ists cannot be rounded up and dismissed as social malcontents. These arguments have been made before. And better. Yet in the historical essays where Mr. Zinn is more directly involved—as a moral outraged critic of the war in Vietnam, as the diarist of his mission to Hanoi, as the investigator of the results of a bombing raid that the himself participated in long ago—he is far more eloquent and engaging. His prose sloughs off its halting ambigui ties and begins to drive. Perhaps what Mr. Zinn is really getting at is that there is a time for historical thought and a time for political action and the two disciplines don't mix. Perhaps, for al lits eloquence, his quarrel is misplaced —and he is really attacking the people who would waste these parlous times studying irrelevancies, and not the inherent value of doing so. On the other hand, perhaups its simply that many of the essays in this book seem dated because they were written at other titnes for other publications. And it is entirely possible that now that he has brought them all together and forged them into a book with a single thesis, Mr. Zinn has prepared himself to write more inci sive radical history— or to act it out. In any event, he has made a strong case against the traditional antiquarianism of the academy. tory department at Spelman Col lege in Atlanta and as a partici pant‐observer of S.N.C.C. activities. In the sixties he fought against the war in. Vietnam as a member of thr Resistance movement in the Boston area. In 1968, as you may recall, he flew to Hanoi with Father Daniel Berrigan to receive the first three American fliers released by North Vietnam. Four of his first six books were written directly out of his activist experiences: “The Southern Mysti que,” “S.N.C.C.: The New Abolitionists,” “Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal,” and “Disobedience and Democracy.” The other two, “La Guardia in Congress” and “New Deal Thought,” an anthology he edited, were only silghtly removed from his first‐ hand experience. Considering his record then, it should come as no surprise that the general thrust of his latest book, “The Politics of His tory,” is to push aside the barriers between the life of action and the life of contempla tion. Specifically, Mr. Zinn makes the case for a radical approach to history, and by im plication it amounts to an indictment of America's entire higher‐educational sys tem. For he holds that in a world that is bursting into flame and corruption, it is immoral to treat knowledge as a com modity to be confined to the classroom and the monograph (“We publish while others perish.”). In saying so he assults the traditional view that the historical scholar's function is to be “disinterested, objective, neutral, scientific, disengaged.” and concerned only with his own “disci pline.” Instead, according to Mr. Zinn, the his torian must recognize that in the very act of selecting a portion of the past for study from a certain point of view, he is ex ercising a strong bias toward the present. Since this is so, it follows that the scholar should investigate the past with an eye to becoming an actor in the present. He should use his “time and energy to sharpen the perceptions of the complacent by ex

1286-> Yankees Down Royals, 5‐3, as Cater's 2‐Run Homer in 5th Breaks 3‐3 Tie
The long ball, once an almost every‐game occurrence with the New York Yankees but a rarity in ‐recent seasons, came to the fore last night at Yankee Sta dium before 6,891 fans. The result was a 5‐3 triumph over the Kansas City Royals, the second in succession, and put the club five games over 500 with a 28‐23 won‐lost record. Mike Kekich was the win ning pitcher, picking up his second victory of the season against one loss. But the young left‐hander needed help from one of the mainstays of Mana ger Ralph Houk's bull pen, Jack Aker. After Kekich walked the first man in the seventh (his only pass), Houk sent in the sinker ball thrower. The right‐handed Alter gave up only the Royals' eighth hit in the ninth as he gained his 10th save of the sea son in his 18th appearance. Dick Drago was coasting along with a 3‐2 lead when the Yankees struck suddenly and drastically in the fifth. Bobby Murcer, with one out, smashed a towering triple off the top of the auxiliary scoreboard in right field. Roy White followed with a run‐producing double to left, then Danny Cater crashed an 0–1 pitch deep into the lower left‐field seats. The homer, his fourth of the campaign, sig naled the end of Drago's chores for the evening, and Manager Charlie Metro sent in a left bander, Tom Burgmeier. Burgmeier proved the right man, but too late to help the Royals. The southpaw retired the 11 Yankees he faced. But Aker was almost as good, per mitting only three of the 10 bat ters he faced to reach first, one by an error—his own. The Royals scored in the first on Amos Otis's sixth homer of the season. After a 20‐minute delay because of rain, the Yankees moved in front, 2‐1, in the third on singles by Horace Clarke, Murcer and White. The Royals staged their first and only rally in the fourth, scoring twice to take the lead again, 3‐2, as Kekich yielded singles to Bob Oliver, Lou Pi niella, Joe Keough and Ellie Rodriguez. The rally might have meant even more, but Keough was cut down at third base on Rodri guez's hit on a Murcer‐Cater Jerry Kenney relay for the third dut. The Yankees whacked Drago for all of their 10 hits in send ing him to his fourth defeat. He has won three. Aker's appearance was the 54th by a relief pitcher in the club's 51st game. Only four Complete games have been turned in by the staff, two of them Stan Bahnsen. ??

1287-> GOVERNOR BACKED BY SANITATIONMEN
Governor Rockefeller was endorsed for re‐election yester day by the Uniformed Sanita tionmen's Association as the union's president, John J. De Lury, repeatedly praised the Governor for refusing to call up the National Guard during the city's 1968 garbage strike. “Nelson Rockefeller was practically relegated to the political garbage heap because he did what he thought was right,” Mr. DeLury said during a discussion of the 1968 strike at a joint news conference with Mr. Rockefeller at the Gov ernor's office at 22 West 55th Street. “When the press and other media, both liberal and conservative, screamed for the National Guard, Nelson Rocke feller still said no.” The sanitationmen's endorse ment was no surprise because the 11,000‐member union is part of Teamsters Joint Council 16, which has already endorsed the Governor. But it does have some political significance be cause the union is generally considered among the most politically active and effective in the state. Extensive Files Kept The sanitationmen's political affairs committee maintains files on all past and present members and their families and, in addition to being a val uable mailing list, those files have also been the source of volunteer political workers in past campaigns. The union has also demon strated sound political in stincts, in Mr. DeLury's words, “supporting many candidates in.30 years and only support ing two losers.” The last win ner supported by the sanita tioninen was, ironically, Mayor Lindsay, the man who asked for National Guard troops to collect the garbage in 1968. Mr. Rockefeller was also sup ported by the union in 1966 The Governor, who was also endorsed by four locals repre senting barbers and beauticians yesterday, says he has the sup port of 50 labor groups with a total of more than 1.2 mil lion members. Goldberg Cites Support Arthur J. Goldberg, the Democratic ‐Liberal candidate for Governor, says he has the support of unions representing more than 500,000 members, including the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and Local 1199 of the Drug and Hospital Union, which had sup ported Mr. Rockefeller in the last two elections. In switching, LoCal 1199 spokesman charged that the Governor “has trimmed his sails to the more conservative poli tical winds of the day.” During the day, Mr. Rocke feller also appeared before a conference of the International Union of Operating Engineers, where he blundered a bit by praising “statutary engineers” instead of the stationary engi neers in his audience at the Commodore Hotel. Upstairs in the same hotel, he addressed shipping execu tives who are members of the New York Propeller Club. He later announced that Jackie Robinson, the baseball hall of falter, would be a deputy man ager of his campaign.

1288-> Sports of The Times
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 5—It's just as well that all the preliminaries ended yesterday for next Sunday's climac tic Super Bowl. If the boisterous brutalities of the two championship games had been permitted to continue over an even more extended period of time, there might not hive been sufficient survivors to man the platoons. It isn't often that a football nut can turn on his television set and be privileged to watch in quick succession two games as engrossing as the Viking‐Brown battle for the National Football League title and the Chief‐Raider donnybrook for the American Football League crown. The videots had one huge advantage over the on‐the‐spot spectators. They could watch both games instead of one and they could do it in solid comfort at the perfect price—for free. In toying with the Browns during a 27‐7 clobbering, the Minnesota Vikings were awesome and impressive all the way as they took immediate control from the open ing kickoff and then remained in charge. “We felt we had to come out winging,” said Bud Grant, the unemotional coach of the Vikes. So they winged it with such rapidity that the outcome never was in doubt. Far from awesome were the Kansas City Chiefs in a dramatic upset of the Oakland Raiders, 17‐7, and yet they're impressive in a strangely curious sort of way. They were so dreadful and so hopelessly ineffec tive in the first qua:rter that it seemed as though they'd be blown right out of the stadium. Doggedly the Chiefs hung in there as the Kansas City defense acted like the Viking defense, slambang crashes that slowed the Raider running to a walk and bedeviled Daryle Lamonica with more pressure than ever before had been applied to him in his life. When the Raiders Were rolling to their first touchdown Lamonica completed seven of 10 passes in the first quarter. He clicked on only eight of his next 29. Sure, there were extenuating circumstances. In the third period he was creamed so violently that he had to retire temporarily to the sidelines for repairs to a damaged hand. These clubs went at each other as if this were a football version of a motorcar Demolition Derby. By the game's end, it was a wonder that any motors were still perking. “This team has character,” said Hank Stram, the coach of the Chiefs. It proved it at Oakland yesterday, especially in the last quarter. It really took something extra special to hold up under a period that was pure slapstick, a throwback of sorts to a Keystone comedy of another era. Three times the Chiefs were hit by the most demoralizing set of misadventures that could befall any football team. Yet the Kansas City men of character emerged from the holes that they dug for themselves through their transgressions. Within the span of a few minutes they fumbled away the ball inside their 31‐yard line three times and three times they got it back by means of interceptions as the harried Lamonica was forced into hasty throws, mostly by Aaron Brown, his principle tor mentor. If there was one play that was the key to the Chiefs' success it was the unbelieva ble catch that Otis Taylor made of a Len Dawson throw just when the Kansas City plight seemed most hopeless. The Raiders had been rolling toward what seemed a tie‐breaker when the score was 7‐7 in the third quarter. But then Emmitt Thomas of Kansas City intercepted a pass in the end zone and foolishly tried to run it out, only to be abruptly dumped on the 6. But the situation worsened when Robert Holmes was nailed on the 2, a long 98 yards from the opposite goal line. What could be more desperate? But Dawson fired a heaven‐help‐us pass downfield. Taylor sped along the right sideline, reached in front with his fingertips, cradled the ball to his manly bosom and was on the 37‐ yard line in a clear‐cut escape. The Chiefs just kept coming after that hair‐raising episode until Holmes bulldozed his way over from the 5 standing up. Kan sas City was ahead, 14‐7, and later added a field goal for insurance. But that big catch by Taylor was the ball game. There was a longer but easier catch in the Viking‐Brown affair. It also put the game out of reach. Joe Kapp, lofted one down the middle to Gene Washington, his deftest receiver. To the rescue came that Minnesota climate. Erich Barnes, the de fender, slipped on a well‐placed chunk of ice. Down he went and Washington en circled the ball with no one near him and jogged the rest of the way on a 75‐yard touchdown jaunt. So the champions of the two leagues, the Vikings and the Chiefs, will have it out in the Super Bowl next Sunday. It should be a wingding.

1290-> WHITE HOUSE AIDE CRITICIZES F.C.C.
Speaker Here Says Policy Is Created too Vaguely Clay T. Whitehead, director of the White House's Office of Telecommunications Policy, sharply criticized the Federal Communications Commission yesterday as a “pretty vague” arbiter of public communica tion, and Called for a re‐exami nation of governmental policy toward communications and commercial broadcasting. He was particularly harsh hi his estimation of the F.C.C.'s “fairness doctrine” which he ,termed “intricate, confusing and inherently arbitrary,” concocted out of individual cases rather than from a basic policy. Mr. Whitehead's criticisms came in an address at the sec ond annual award ceremony of the duPont‐Columbia Awards in Broadcast Journalism in the rotunda of Low Library on the Columbia University campus. Mr. Whitehead said: “Many of the dissatisfactions with broadcasting grow out of the way we have structured that industry, rather than from failings within the industry it self. This industry structure is largely the product of govern ment policy—or the lack there of. Such policies as we do have are an accumulation of ad hoc solutions to piecemeal prob lems.” He said the key to reform of Government communications policy lay, in the ability to for mulate policy that would be conducive to “the free and open exchange of ideas. . . It is not enough for the Government simply to refrain from interfer knee with free press and free speech. We have an affirma live obligation to see that con ditions are conducive to’ such ei.ichange.” Powers Are Broad’ He summarized the regula tory powers currently held by the F.C.C., which giv,e that agency the right to ascertain whether a broadcaster has per famed in the public interest. Then he added: “Now this is all well and good so long as no one expects radio or television ‐to be a serious news medium, and so long as television is a new and novel entertainment medium. But television has now become a major vehicle that informs the average Amer ican about the world around him.” He said the F.C.C. had been “pretty vague” about what it considered “the public inter est,” and had permitted its rul ings on many fairness questions to become less than specific policy. “As a result,” he said, “we find the commission requiring each individual station to be fair in its handling of each in dividual issue, rather than at tempting •to create an open marketplace of ideas in the media of a community. Under the commission's approach the commission itself is the final arbiter of what is an issue or i'dea, of which side has or has not been presented fairly on a particular station; of how many different sides the public should hear, and of who is an accept able spokesman.” Awards went to Kenneth A. Cox, former Federal Communi ‘cations Commissioner, to Fred erick Wiseman and National Educational Television;. to John Laurence and the Columbia Broadcasting System, to Fred `Freed and the National Broad casting Company, and to tele vision stations WCCO in Min neapolis and WOOD in Grand Rapids.

1292-> PANEL DENOUNCES BUSINESS TAX AID
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2— A new tax incentive for business that the Nixon Administration wants attached to the foreign trade bill has been denounced as discriminatory and probably ineffective by the nonpartisan staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The committee's staff criticized the proposal in a confidential report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which is writing a trade bill. The incentive provision, which is aimed at encouraging American companies to expand their export sales, has been given tentative approval by the Ways and Means Committee but will be subject to reconsideration this week. Veto Threat Some members of the Ways and Means Committee reportedly voted for the incentive the first time mainly to give the Administration at least one provision it wanted in a bill that is threatened with a Presidential veto because of its protectionist provisions. The confidential staff report strongly questioned whether the tax relief provision would actually work to increase exports by any significant amount. The staff also found that the incentive would reduce the taxes mainly of large corporations and would probably amount to a partial tax exemption, rather than a mere postponement of taxes, as the Administration has contended. The one‐sidedness of the argument against the tax proposal was highly unusual for a joint committee staff analysis. The staff serves as technical advisers to members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, and its analyses of pending legislative proposals always cover both the pros and cons. In this instance, the staff found almost no arguments in favor of the proposal, which would cost the Government an estimated $600‐million in lost tax revenues annually, according to the Treasury Departments, where the plan originated. The tax incentive plan is generally known as DISC, an acronym that stands for domestic international sales corporation. Under the proposal, companies with present or prospective export business could organize a DISC as a subsidiary, sell their products to the DISC at less than the regular market price, then have the DISC sell them overseas_ No one would owe any United States corporate taxes on the profits of the DISC so long as the profits were uses, by the parent company or any other company, in export‐related activities, and so long as certain limitations were observed. Untaxed Profits The staff analysis noted that the ability of a manufacturer to sell at less than the market price to its DISC subsidiary meant that some of what were really profits from the manufacturing company would go to the DISC and be untaxed. This feature, the staff said, means that creation of a DISC is potentially much more valuable to a large, integrated company than to a small processor, who would have much lower manufacturing profits to shift to the tax‐free DISC. Similarly, an independent exporting company unaffiliated with a manufacturer would be strongly disadvantaged compared with a DISC affiliated with an integrated producing and distributing company. Even assuming that these discriminatory effects were desirable as incentives, there is doubt that the incentives would really lead to increased exports, the staff said. Import Restrictions Even if corporations make more effort to sell overseas, these efforts could run afoul of import restrictions abroad or a simple lack of increased demand, the staff said. And even if the DISCs passed through, in the form of price reductions, the whole $600million they are expected to realize in lower taxes, the increased export sales would probably amount to no more than $300‐million, the study continued. The ration of price reductions to increased sales was the one used by Hendrick S. Houthakker, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, in a recently published article. The $300‐million increase in exports is rather small compared to the decline in the United States trade surplus that the DISC proposal is designed to counteract. That surplus plummeted from $6.8‐billion in 1964 to $690‐million last year. The staff study also criticized the Treasury's argument that the DISC proposal would encourage American manufacturers to keep manufacturing in this country for export sale, rather than moving their plants — and attendant jobs overseas. The cost savings on foreign production are likely to be greater than the tax savings from the DISC plan, the study said. And many plants are located overseas to avoid import restrictions, a situation that would not change with adoption of the DISC proposal.

1293-> G.O.P. Found Hurt by Cambodia Drive
WASHINGTON, May 10— President Nixon's decision to send American troops into Cambodia and the protests that followed have hurt the Repub lican party's standing with the voters, Republican and Demo cratic politicians agreed this weekend. Political leaders in all parts of the country, interviewed by The New York Times, said that if this year's Congressional election were held tomorrow, the Republicans would have little chance to gain control of the Senate, where they need seven more seats, and would certainly lose seats in the House of Representatives. But many of the same peo ple added that the President retained the initiative and warned that, if Mr. Nixon was able to show results from the Cambodian attack, he might be able to turn the entire episode into a net gain for his party by November. “If the President gets the troops out of Cambodia,” said a Democratic Senator who faces a difficult fight for re election, “if he suffers rela tively few casualties there, if he can show any evidence of military success—even if the evidence is bogus—we will have a tough time making a case against him.” Former Gov. Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, a Democrat who is seeking the seat held by Sena tor Winston L. Prouty, said he had been helped in the short term but would be hurt if there were further student violence, such as that at Kent State University in Ohio last Monday. At the White House, the two men most concerned with po litical matters — Murray M. Chotiner, general counsel of the Office of Special Representa tive for Trade Negotiations, and Harry S. Dent, deputy counsel to the President — have told apprehensive state Republican leaders to let time heal the wounds of the last two weeks, not to pants, and that every thing would be all right long before this fall. President Nixon will un doubtedly make the same point to some of the Republican Governors tomorrow. All 50 Governors have been invited to confer with him at the White House at 1:30 P.M. The exact dimensions of the public response are not yet clear. A Gallup Poll, taken im mediately after the President's speech on April 30, in which he announced his decision to send United States troops into Cambodia, showed that only 51 per cent of the public ap proved of the Cambodian ac tion and that 58 per cent were opposed to sending American troops into Cambodia. Louis Harris began a na tional survey this weekend, hoping to catch reaction not only to Cambodia but also to the deaths of four students at Kent State, the President's news conference last Friday night and the largely peaceful antiwar demonstrations in Washington yesterday. “The instinct of most people is to rally around the Presi dent,” Mr. Harris said in an in terview. “The question of whether people really approve of a policy or not must be measured later.” Mr. Harris's reading of the national mood will be available, in about 10 days. The Cambodian invasion is only one of the things that will sway voters when they go into the booths on Nov. 3. The state of the economy, local taxes, the personalities of the candidates and other issues yet unknown will also have an impact. But all the politi cians questioned agreed that Southeast Asia, after a lapse of six months, had resumed its place as the primary factor in the political dialogue. Evidence that that conclusion is shared by leaders of the Democratic party was supplied by the tough anti‐Nixon state ment issued last week by the Democratic Policy Council and by the outspoken speech of Lawrence F. O'Brien, the Democratic national chairman, at a dinner in Milwaukee on Friday. Ira Kapenstein, Mr. O'Brien's deputy, said that the Adminis tration was presenting a public image of discord and incom petence that would help the Democrats. But he argued that the Republicans were effective ly taking their case to the elec torate through appearances on television by Mr. Nixon; his communications director, Her bert G. Klein, on the Dick Cavett show, and Vice President Agnew the David Frost program. “The public is confused,” Mr. Kapenstein added. “If we don't present our viewpoint forcefully enough, we might not make any real headway.” Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Commit tee, expressed apprehension about student response to the Cambodian campaign. Trouble on the campuses and on the streets, he said, “could turn this into a political two‐edged sword very quickly.” But Mr. Inouye argued that resentment over the President's decision could tip the balance in such races as those of Mr. Hoff in Vermont; Senator Frank E. Moss, Democrat of Utah, who faces a strong challenger in Representative Laurence J. Burton, and Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, who is fighting for political sur vival against Representative William E. Brock 3d. Mr. Gore's advisers agree with Senator Inouye's conclusion that the Senator will now be able to say, with more force than before, “I told you so.” He has been an aggressive and consistent opponent of the war. Senator John G. Tower of Texas, Mr. Inouye's Republican counterpart, said he was “well aware that the President's ac tion is a net political liability in some parts of the country at the moment, but with any kind of success in Cambodia and a bit of luck, we should be able to change that.” In Mr. Tower's own state, Cambodia will probably make little difference. Senator Ralph W. Yarborough, a Democrat and long‐time dove, was de feated in the primary earlier this month, leaving two hawks — Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr., a Democrat, and Representative George Bush, a Republican—to clash for the seat. Nor is there likely to be much impact in Virginia, where Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. is running as an independent against relatively unknown Re publican and Democratic oppon ents. In Illinois, Adlai E. Steven son 3d, already ahead of Sena tor Ralph T. Smith in the polls, will almost certainly be helped. Authoritative sources report that Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie, while publicly supporting his fellow Republican, Mr. Nixon, is privately infuriated by the Cambodian action and what he considers its prohibitive political cost. Other states where dovish Senate candidates may benefit are California, New Mexico, North Dakota, Alaska and New Jersey. Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Democratic Senatorial nomi nee in Ohio, said that Cambo dia “has to help me, because I'm an anti‐Nixon kind of can didate, and with the stock mar ket, Kent State and especially Cambodia, the people in this state are thinking anti‐Nixon.” One of the chief strategists for Representative Robert A. Taft Jr., Mr. Metzenbaum's. Re publican opponent, tended to agree. “It has to be a very substan tial minus for most Republican candidates,” the strategist said. “Taft will be hurt. In fact. I wouldn't be surprised to see him part company with, the President if there is no evidence pretty promptly that this op eration is going to shorten the war.” In Alabama, where the gu bernatorial run‐off is less than a month away, the events of the last week appear to most observers to have helped each of the two candidates, former Gov. George C. Wallace and Gov. Albert P. Brewer, in dif ferent ways. “Cambodia has helped Brew er,” said Robert Vance, the Democratic state chairman, “Be cause George has to attack Nixon to make his case, and people here don't like to see the President attacked in times of emergency.” But Mr. Vance added: “The demonstrations in Kent State helped Wallace, because people here don't like unrest. It scares them, and When they're scared they look, to George.” Generally, however, those In terviewed echoed the senti ments of a leading Republican conservative, known for his ac curate assessment of voting trends, who said: “This Administration said that it was going to take com mand, but we get the picture that it is not in control of things. The focal point is Cam bodia and Kent State, but the state of the economy lies be hind that and is just as im portant, if not more so. “If Nixon gets out, or if vio lence gets the upper hand, he may be able to solidify votes in favor of the Administration. Otherwise, I'm afraid that we are in for a very unpleasant year.” Or of a Republican national committeeman from the Middle West, who commented: “I'm hiding. Either it blows over, or we've all had it.”

1294-> Lund Captures 300‐Mile Daytona Race
late‐model stockers, designated Grand Nationals. Lund, who runs a fishing camp and other enterprises around Cross, S. C., when he isn't racing, drove his blue and white 1966 Ford at an average speed of 133.316 miles an hour. His purse, prizes and awards totaled $11,850. The runner‐up, in a 1967 Ford, was Red Farmer of Huey town, Ala., the 1969 champion of the Sportsman Division of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. He won $7,375 today. Donnie Allison, also of Huey town, finished third in a 1963 Ford. Sonny Hutchins of Rich mond managed to place fourth even though he ran out of fuel and lost valuable time being pushed toward the pits by a wrecker. In fifth place was Hooker Hood of Memphis in a 1965 Chevelle. The finish was highly un usual. On the 117th lap, three laps before the end, the yellow, caution flag came out because of tire debris on the track. It appeared likely the race would be completed under the yellow, which means drivers are for bidden to improve their posi tions. However, a yellow‐flag fin ish is considered poor show biz. Race officials prefer a crowd ‐ pleasing, hard‐ driving finish under the green. Bill France Jr., a vice presi dent of NASCAR, who was of ficiating in the control tower, satisfied himself the track was safe. He passed the order over the telephone hook‐up to the two flagmen on a small bridge over the finish line. At this moment the pack was rounding the fourth turn into the front straight, 1,800 feet from the finish line. The flagmen were caught by surprise, and they had to scramble awkwardly to grab the green flag from its holder. Equally surprised were Lund, who was leading the pack at a limited pace, and Farmer, who was right behind. The ef fect of the green flag was to create a new race. Lund bolted forward, passed the finish line half a car length ahead of Farmer—and he kept going around for another lap. Farmer raced just as hard. “I was taking no chances,” Lund said of that extra lap. “I figured Tiny knew what he was doing,” Farmer said in explanation. “So we both just went flat‐out.” Actually the finish was one of the few interesting elements of the race, a lackluster affair. Twenty‐eight of the first 60 laps were run under the yellow. Altogether, there were seven caution flags for 35 of the 120 laps, or more than one–fourth of the race. Some of the cau tions were caused by accidents and others by debris on the track surface. One accident resulted in serious injuries. The casualty was Glenn Guthrie of Temple Hills, Md., who hit the wall after losing control coming off the second turn. Guthrie suf fered two broken ribs, a punc tured lung and compression of vertebrae. Lund clearly had the best car in the 40‐car field, the same 1966 Ford that won two major races last year. He started from 15th position and on the first lap he picked up 12 positions to reach third place. By the fourth lap he was leading. Between them Lund and Farmer led 113 of the 120 laps —Lund 87 and Farmer 26. The race was run under sunny sky with a brisk wind and temperatures in the low fifties. For tomorrow's Daytona 500, a computer here rates the fav orites as Cale Yarborough of Timmonsville, S.C., and Lee Roy Yarbrough of Columbia, S.C., in factory‐backed entries. Yarborough will drive a Mer cury Cyclone and Yarbrough a Ford. Other formidable factory supported contenders are David Pearson, A. J. Foyt and Don nie Allison in Fords; Buddy Baker, Bobby Isaac and Charlie Glotzbach in winged‐fin Dodges, and Richard Petty in Plymouth. ??

1296-> March in Capital Tomorrow to Back Vietnam War
WASHINGTON, April 2—A march on Washington is sched uled for Saturday to support “victory over the Communists in Vietnam.” The demonstration, arranged by the Rev. Carl McIntire, will include a parade along Penn sylvania Avenue that will cover the same route as last Novem ber's massive peace march. The parade, beginning at noon, will end with a rally at the Wash ington Monument between 2 and 5 P.M. Supporters said they expected up to 150,000 participants. Dr. McIntire, a fundamental ist radio preacher, said backers of the pro‐war demonstration included former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama; Gov. Lester G. Maddox of Georgia; Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and Represent ative L. Mendel Rivers of South Carolina. Clearance for the march fol lowed several days of contro versy and confusion between the sponsors and the Federal Government. Earlier in the week, a White House aide mistakenly reported that the march had been can celed. This prompted Dr. Mc Intire to charge that there were Communists in the White House and to call for an in vestigation by the Federal Bu reau of Investigation. Arriving in Washington to day, Dr. McIntire, pastor of the Bible Presbyterian Church in Collingswood, N. J., said at a news conference that the cause of the march had been dam aged by the mistake and that the cause of the Communists had been aided. He said that two F.B.I. agents questioned him “at length” in Collingswood about his charge and informed him that a complete investigation was under way. However, an F.B.I. spokesman here said to day that no such investigation was being conducted. The spokesman would neither con firm nor deny that agents were in touch with Dr. McIntire. The evangelist, who is presi dent of the International Coun cil of Christian Churches, said that White House “underlings” had hurt chances for a big, turnout Saturday, but he still) predicted that more than 100, 000 persons would participate. Dr. McIntire also complained that he had encountered trouble from District of Columbia and National Park Service officials over permits for the parade and rally. Planners of the march have been working for about three weeks out of a one‐room office of The Christian Beacon Press in the National Press Building. The Rev. Clifford Peterson of Phoenix, Ariz., is coordinator of the march. On one wall of the office is a copy of the Declaration of Independence and on another is a poster showing ho?? the peace symbol of the peace movement, with a few line changes, could become a hammer and sickle. One of two female staff workers was asked why Dr. McIntire, who was driving from his Collingswood home to Wash ington, was late. “Well, is wasn't his fault, she replied. “I don't know why the Lord didn't let him get down here as fast as you‐know‐what.”, The demonstrators will con cent themselves not only with winning the war, but also with prayer in the schools and riot ing. A bulletin published by the sponsors declares: “No more backing down to the rioters, radicals, militants and city burners! We want freedom for prayer and Bible‐reading in our schools.”

1297-> Going to the Fair?
NE of the first conversations had after coming to Tokyo in February, 1946, was rather one‐sided. A man came up to me in the street, clutched my elbow, stared me in the eye for a few seconds, and declaimed: “I—don'to—know!” TOKYO. Having practiced his English phrase for the day, the man grinned happily and went about his business. “This country will go far,” I said to myself. I didn't know how right I was.* Years of practice, abetted by radio and television language lessons, paid off. The Japanese, having acquired about five years ago a first‐class simultaneous‐interpreting capability, and linked now by satellite with Europe and America, are communi cating in all directions as if their lives depended on it. Never a month goes by without Japan's playing host to some international conference or symposium. XPO '70, Japan's first World's Fair—the first World's Fair to be held in Asia — is itself a kind of gigantic exercise in communicating. Japan has come a long way—from “I don't know” to Expo — in one generation, and I expect that most visitors will leave Japan wondering, with me, just how far she will go in the next generation. Overtake the United States in per capita gross national product by the year 2000? Or by the nineteen‐eighties, as some of the futurologists are now begin ning to say? And in what direction will Japan's path take her? Will she continue, in cooperation with the United States, to devote a fair share of her growing wealth to peaceful construction in Asia? Or is she bent on re‐creating by economic means the empire she could not hold by military power? Must Japan, as some insist, pick up again the military burdens she was persuaded to put down in 1945? If she does, will she do so in coopera tion with the United States, or will she emulate de Gaulle? Will Japan choose unarmed neutrality, nuclear armed neutrality, a link‐up with Communist China against the “white” world, or any other of the aberra tions theoretically to it? To quote: “I—don't—know!” Neither do the pundits, some of whom think they know, and neither will the Expo visitor, as he says sayonara and climbs aboard his plane, still trying to remember the word to say for “thank you.” (Was “alligator,” or “crocodile”?) The visitor may nevertheless enjoy his stay more if he tries to form his own opinions about some of these controversial questions. For me, any way, half the fascination of visiting and revisiting Japan has been trying to sort out my experiences and see if they help answer the questions: What makes Japan tick? And, is that ticking sound a time bomb? Even the uninitiated will come up against aspects of the Japanese character that have a bearing on these major questions. I would like to suggest a few samples of the kind of thing you will notice about the Japanese, and how they might be related to larger problems.  OR a country with the third most productive economy in the world, the Japanese still put up with a lot of inconveniences in their daily lives. In living stand ards, Japan is still only 20th in the world. The Japanese have seen public investment in housing, roads and other amenities deferred year after year for the sake of the na tional economy. A group of European ex perts, in Japan recently for a conference on urban problems, was being shown through a newly completed high‐rise housing development. Despite the rather cramped floor space of the apartments, the Europeans considered the de velopment on the whole an excellent slum‐clearance proj ect, and told their hosts so. The compliments were re ceived with some embarrass ment, as the building was actually intended to provide luxury accommodations. The Japanese tend to be group‐minded. They are very tolerant of crowds, as you will notice as you queue up for two hours to get into the major pavilions of Expo. Bands of uniformed school children trooping happily along in the wake of a teacher will become a familiar sight. They learn early to accept group discipline, work for group goals and share the group's hardships. Japan, in fact, is a kind of super in‐group, and this is one of the secrets of her success. Other things being equal, in groups tend to do well in competition. Japan has been able to manage its national economy almost as though the country were a single corpo ration. If the statistics indi cate to the bankers and bu reaucrats that some sector of the economy is becoming less productive, they somehow manage to hold down invest ment in that sector and en courage investment in a more productive sector. This makes for rapid growth. It can also be rather painful for business men and workers in the less productive sectors, where in vestment is being discour aged. Only an extraordinary acceptance of group discipline and group goals, involving untimately a strong sense of national identity, would have made all this collective self sacrifice possible without dic tatorship. And Japan, by most objective tests, is democracy. Will success spoil the super in‐group? As the Japanese become more affluent, are they becoming more individ ualistic, as some conservative Japanese complain? How durable is the cement that binds the group together, and how strong are the group's common goals? OKES seldom survive translation.* Here is a Japanese joke. It may or may not strike you as funny, but it will tell you something about Japan's national goals: A champion bicycle racer is awakened one night by, shouts of “Stop, thief!” He rushes outside and is told that the thief has escaped by bicycle. “The road has no exits for at least four kilometers,” says the champion. “I can catch up with him in no time!” He hops on his own bike, and sure enough, he not only overtakes the thief but soon gets a one‐ kilometer lead on him! Getting ahead in the race for gross national product is in some ways more important to the Japanese than the ma terial benefits of economic progress. People call the Japanese “economic animals,” and you will find yourself agreeing with the description. But it is not just greed for material possessions that makes the Japanese so intent on economic success. The Japanese want their nation to move ahead as far and as fast as it can in the race for inter national recognition, and they have found that the world re spects economic progress.

1298-> Private Lines Running Express Buses to the City's Outskirts
The bus is called the Fresh Meadows Express, and it leaves 34th Street and The Avenue of the Americas every 10 minutes during the rush‐hour period. It makes three stops in midtown Man hattan and then rolls nonstop until it reaches the winding roads and garden apartments of eastern Oueens. “It's a great way to com mute,” said Herb Solomon, an accountant who rides the red‐and‐yellow bus between Fresh Meadows and Herald Square. “I arrive home on time and rested. When I was taking the subway I arrived home a nervous wreck.” The Fresh Meadows Ex press is a promising idea in local transportation — the linking of outlying areas of the city to Manhattan by nonstop buses. Five such ex press bus lines have sprung up here in the last two years, providing 10,000 regular riders with service to mid town from Bayside, Fresh Meadows and Glen Oaks in Queens, Riverdale in the Bronx, and Staten Island. All are privately operated, ex cept the Staten Island line. Service from Parkchester in the Bronx is to start this summer. The fare is $1 each way on all the buses. Weekly commutation tickets are available on the Queens lines for $S.50. The express buses, all air conditioned have won rave re views from many passen gers, although the service still has many bugs to be worked out. A recent sur vey by the city's Transporta tion Administration shows 98 per cent of the passengers found the buses comfortable and convenient. The vehicles are similar to the familiar green city buses, but the seats are two abreast and cushioned. The survey found that 83 per cent of the riders used to get to and from Manhattan via a local bus and subway. The remaining 17 per cent either drove into Manhattan or drove to a subway station and took the train. Express bus passengers are spending about as much time commuting as they used to. But the buses are not plagued by the occasional long delays that occur on the subway, some of the passengers said. “Thank God for this serv ice,” one passenger wrote on his questionnaire. Other comments included: “Your bus is so comfortable, I sleep all the way home,” and “At last the city admin istration has done something decent.” Some of the riders com plained, however, that service outside of rush hours was too infrequent; that existing routes did not reach out far enough, and that the Queens bound buses often got caught in crosstown traffic in Man batten during rush hours and should be rerouted. All the existing express lines are run by private con cerns, with the exception of the Staten Island line, which is operated by the Transit Authority. The Transportation Admin istration offers the private companies technical assist ance in planning their routes and political support in win ning route approval from the Board of Estimate. The private fines report that the express‐bus business is “excellent.” For example, a spokesman for the River dale Transit Corporation, op erator of the Riverdale‐Man hattan line, said the line was carrying 4,500 passengers a day, compared with 1,200 two years ago. All lines operate at inter vals of 10 minutes or less in rush hours, and at 30 to 60 minute intervals the rest of the day. Riders pay as they board buses to Manhattan and as they leave buses from Manhattan, except on the Riverdale run, where they al ways pay as they board. Express bus drivers will make change. The companies say they have not suffered the high number of driver holdups that plagued local public buses before the exact fare rule went into effect. The Queens express buses leave from 34th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, and from 34th Street and Third ??nue. They stop at 49th, ?? and 59th Streets on both avenues before turning east on 59th Street to the Queens borough Bridge. They then go nonstop to Fresh Mead ows, Bayside or Glen Oaks, making about a dozen local stops. Each run takes about 65 minutes The buses run be tween 6:40 A.M. and 7:30 P.M. The bus to Riverdale heads up the Avenue of the Americas from 34th Street, stopping at 41st, 51st, 57th, and 62d Streets and Central Park West before going nonstop to 230th Street and Broadway in the Bronx. The bus then makes local stops to the Yonkers city line. The trip takes about 45 minutes. The first bus leaves Riverdale at 6:30 A.M. The last leaves Manhattan at 11:40 P.M. Express buses bound for Staten Island leave from both First Avenue and 42d Street and Park Place and Broad way, near City Hall. After making three stops in Manhattan, they travel via the Verrazano Narrows Bridge to Staten Island, where they make 14 local stops between Narrows Road South and Great Kills Park. The first bus leaves Staten Island at 6:40 A.M. and the last leaves Manhattan at 5:45 P.M.

1299-> Sholokhov Assails Poets Who Criticize Soviet and Recite in U.S.
MOSCOW, June 24—Milchail A. Sholokhov, the Nobel Prize inovelist, today rebuked Soviet poets who look for things to criticize and who are willing to recite their poems in the Cap itol in Washington. In an interview in Komso molskaya Pravda, the paper of the Young Communist League, Mr. Sholokhov, who is 65 years old, said that “in my view constant opposition In what ever dorm it takes is good for nothing.” “It smells bad both in crea tive work and in personal con duct,” he said. “I wish that some of our young people would change their, opposition to elementary exactness. And by the way, I don't think that Mayakovsky would go to re cite his poems in the Capitol He would, of course, try to understand why and for what purpose he was invited there.” Mr. Shalokhov was referring to Vladimir Mayakovsky the poet whose verse and extro verted manner made him‐popu lar with Soviet youth in the nineteen‐twenties. Soviet au thorities have given him special status because of some of his pro‐Bolshevik poems. The remark about reciting An the Capitol could be inter preted as a slap at the favorite poets of today's youth, Andrei Voznesensky and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Both have been critical of some aspects of So viet society and both have re cited their poems in the Library of Congress, which adjoins Capitol Hill. Both Mr. Voznesensky and Mr. Yevtushenko have had dif ficulty in recent years in get ting permission to leave the Soviet Union to visit the United States where they have beer invited to give poetry readings However they continue to haw their works published in the Soviet Union. Mr. Sholokhov, beet known for his novel of the nineteen thirties “And Quiet Bows the Don,” has alienated many in tellectuals by attacking Alek sandr L. Solzhenitsyn, the now elist, at the last writers con gress. Mr. Sholokhov has been working on a novel about World War II called “They Fought for the Motherland,” which, he said in the inter view, is still unfinished. Excerpts from this novel ap peared last year in Pravda, the Communist party paper, and it was announced at that time that the book would be pub lished soon. There have been recurring rumors here that Mr. Sholokhov is having trouble getting it past the censors be cause of some critical refer ences to Stalin. In the excerpts published last year, Mr. Sholoklmv sug gested that Stalin had weak ened the Soviet Union's de fenses on‐ the eve of the war by unjustly imprisoning and ex ecuting leading military men. Today, Mr. Sholokhov said that as far as Stalin's wartime record was concerned, “I fully subscribe to Marshal Zhukov's view on this matter.” Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov, In memoirs published last year, painted a complimentary por trait of Stalin as a wartime leader, and this has become the official line, contrasting with Nikita S. Khrushohev's at tempts to denigrate Stalin's wartime role. “Stalin's activities in that pe riod must not be belittled or made to appear foolish,” Mr. Sholokhov said. “First of all this would be dishonest and secondly, harmful to the court try, to the Soviet people, nor because success is never chal lenged but because tearing down does not accord with the truth.”

1300-> Shoes and Salesgirls From France
The biggest name in French shoes comes to Fifth Avenue today. The Charles Jourdan shop, designed by a French architect with most of its Plexiglas, steel and leather interior made in France and assembled here, opens at 700 Fifth Avenue (55th Street). It is the first of a projected chain of retail shops that the manufacturer plans to establish in the United States. There are 14 other Charles Jourdan shops, in Paris, other European cities and Hong Kong. New York women have been buying shoes with the Jourdan label at Blooming dale's, Lord & Taylor, Altman's and I. Miller. Christian Dior and Pierre Cardin shoes, which are also made in the Jourdan factories, have been available, respectively, at Delman and Bonwit Teller. All of these associations will continue but now the three high fashion brands of shoes will all be sold in the new Jourdan shop, along with handbags, stockings, scarves and men's tics. Two American traditions have been broken. Prices, which are seldom shown with high fashion shoes, are marked with tiny numbers in the Jourdan windows. “We believe we have nothing to grandson of the founder of the company. “We'll have prices in the windows so that people will he aware if they can afford the shoes.” They range from $36 to $60. Boots are from $70 to $110. Another departure along a trail al ready blazed by Pappagallo and Shoe Biz at Bendel's is to have pretty young women selling the shoes rat her than dignified and often stolid men. Seven young women have been im ported from the Jourdan shops in France to work in the New York branch. “We impose the midi or Chanel length on them.” said Roland Jourdan, head of drsign and retail shops. “In Paris I've been wpaling the mini.” confessed Christina fin lion, a fragile looking brunette who has the essential, narrow proportions for the rust‐colored wool midi she was wearing with shoes and stockings in the same tone. The shoes in the current Jourdan col lection have a graceful, elongated silhouette with oval toes and solid heels that rise from just under two inches for sport to nearly three inches. The two leathers used, suede and a satin finish kid that resembles patent, come in 70 colors. The Jourdan shoes are made on American lasts, in sizes 4½ to 10½ and widths from Triple A to B. • Summer dining, not surprisingly, the theme of the new table settings on Tiffany's second and third floors, with wicker as the common decorative motif. Many of the wicker tables are set with earthenware or ironstone plates, and among the latter is a new pattern the store is introducing, that has a blue parrot amid blue and gold flowers on a robin's egg blue ground. The dinner plate is $3.90; a five‐piece place setting is $13. The store has recently brought in several other new dinnerware patterns, including a fresh‐looking dishwasher proof floral from Royal Worcester with scattered orange‐ and plum‐colored blos soms on a white ground. The place setting is $19; the dinner plate, $6. There is also an unusual ironstone set from Spode ($43 for a setting), Blue and red leaves and flowers with a few pink and apricot buds fan across a gray white ground. Among the most interesting of the tables in the display is one covered with a wicker‐printed fabric and set with glass and crystal. (You have to look twice to even see that the dinner plates are there.) One summery‐looking table has white wicker armchairs drawn tip to it and pale mottled green service plates be neath glass soup howls. The centerpiece consists of bunches of freshly washed parsley set in small white ceramic baskets. The settings an he seen through July 31.

1301-> Vietnam‐Study Conclusion
The assumptions regarding the present situation in Viet nam and the expected future course of developments in that country, on which U.S. policy is apparently based, seem to rest on far more ambiguous, confusing, and contradictory evidence than pronouncements from Wash ington and Saigon indicate. The success of present Amer ican policy appears to depend on three factors: 1. The progressive Vietnam ization of the military effort. 2. The stability and cohe siveness of the Thieu Govern ment. 3. The expectation that the enemy can and will do noth ing to inhibit Vietnamization or disrupt the Thieu Govern ment's stability. There is, of course, an inti mate relationship among these three factors. Indeed, it may be said that all must succeed —or, perhaps accurately, that none may fail—if present U.S. objectives in Vietnam are to be realized. Vietnamization is perhaps the most important factor because the possibility of a continuing, progressive Amer ican withdrawal obviously depends upon its success. So does pacification, for the key to its success is security. Thus if Vietnamization fails, the United States cannot withdraw and still claim to have achieved its stated ob jectives. The stability and cohesive ness of the Thieu Govern ment is of fundamental im portance because there must be an agency through which the process of Vietnamization can be effected. Futhermore, given the importance which has been attached to the con stitutional legitimacy of the Thieu Government, its over throw would probably plunge. South Vietnam into a state of political anarchy and at the same time severely strain public patience in the United States. Three Factors Related As for the enemy's inten tions and capabilities, the policy of Vietnamization is based on the assumption that the enemy is either willing to permit, or unable to pre vent, the phased withdrawal of American combat forces and the progressive assump tion of the combat burden by the Vietnamese. Were the North Vietnamese to launch a massive attack at any point in the course of this with drawal, the United States would be faced with the ago nizing prospect of either halt ing—or even reversing—the process of withdrawal, on the one hand, or being forced, on the other hand, to effect an accelerated, complete with drawal which would be inter preted at home, and probably abroad, as a military and po litical defeat. We believe that the evidence presented in this report leads to the inference that the pros pects for a successful outcome of any one of the aforemen tioned three factors, much less all three, must be re garded as, at best, uncertain. Dilemmas thus seem to lie ahead in Vietnam, as they have throughout our involve ment in this war that appears to be not only far from won but far from over. Agonizing Prospects

1302-> Marine Freed in Vietnam Slayings
DANANG, South Vietnam, June 24 (AP)—A young ma rine who testified he had never kille danyone, even an enemy in combat, was ac quitted today of charges of having taken part in the slaying of 16 Vietnamese women and children on a patrol in February. Pfc. Thomas R. Boyd,. Jr., 19 years old, of Evansville, Ind., greeted the verdict with tears of joy, shouted, “Thank God!” and embraced his ci vilian lawyer, Howard T. Trockman, also of Evans ville.

1306-> The Designer With the Chartreuse Hair
Zandra Rhodes describes herself as an “unnatural” person and few people catch ing sight of her for the first time would be inclined to disagree. Miss Rhodes, a 28‐year‐old British designer, whose fash ions are now available here, has chartreuse green hair, hazel eyes boldly framed in Burgundy red and aquama rine, and a wardrobe that juxtapose Indian beads and knee‐high boots with bow tied, wavy‐hemmed silk dresses. “Maybe I'm hiding behind my exterior,” she said in a burst of candor. “Some peo ple are understated but it doesn't work with me. I pre fer things to be overdone.” The hair, arranged in a somewhat shaggy coiffure, has some of the uneven ends caught up in varied colored feathers, stuck into place with eyelash glue. The eyes are lost in a wide arc of Burgun dy painted under almost non existent eyebrows, another arc of aquamarine on the lid and a fat swath of the same color under the eye. The low er lashes are long, painted spikes in a russet‐wine shade. “When my hair was brown, I didn't feel as exciting,” Miss Rhodes said, “and when I don't wear lots of eye make up, I don't feel me.” Miss Rhodes, who trained as a textile designer at the Royal College of Art in Lon don and started her career in that field, went into dress de signing because she wasn't satisfied with what other de signers were doing with her fabrics. She now creates both the fabric, always hand print ed, and the dress. Her first solo collection made its debut last year. “It was exactly what I wanted to do,” she said. “I guess I must think of my self when I'm designing be cause I can wear all my things.” Hand‐printed chiffons that flutter in swirls of pastel shadings, quilted calicos, panne velvets and shiny sat ins are some of her current favorites in the fabric field. They have been translated into one — and two‐piece dresses for day and evening and an occasional coat or cloak that can be worn both in and out of doors. Many have saw‐toothed hemlines. The current collection is priced between $300 and $500 at Henri Bendel. Miss Rhodes has also designed a collection of wallpapers for And Vice‐Versa. It is priced from $12.75 to $19.50 a roll and is available only through decorators.

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N. Y., Aug. 24—Eddie Belmonte is about to be “sprung” at the end of this week, and immediately he will spring into action—in Venezuela. Since the first week of the current meet ing at the Spa, Belmonte has been stall walking because of a penalty resulting from one of his rare losses of temper. He put the slug on a fellow rider, and for that reason was “given the meeting,” as the language of the race track describes tDe time that a member of the thorough bred colony might be punished. Belmonte has a pretty tight timetable outlined for the next few days. He is tak ing off for Venezuela on Thursday, he'll ride there on Sunday and will return to New York to ride at Belmont Park on the opening day's activities there on Mon day. All this speed, of course, is in keep ing with the make‐up of a young man whose very livelihood depends on speed. In Belmonte's case this quality really pays off extremely:well. Over the last five years the modish Puerto Rican has been making as much money as any of the more widely ballyhooed athletes on the world scene. How, for example, would you like to settle for the $100,000‐a‐year that Belmonte has averaged since 1966? And what does Belmonte do with all his money? Anybody seeing him when he is not riding would bet that the trim young athlete puts it all on his back. There's football player named Joe, for instance and a hockey player named Derek, for example, and a baseball player—another guy named Joe—who have been known to attract attention by their raiment, shall we say, as applied to a man. Or attire? Or grab? Well these space grabbers are little more than Victorian conservatives compared to Senor Eddie.Belmonte, the 27‐year‐old native of Santurce, P. R., for whom the term “mod dress” must have been invented. Chromatic Scale Frills that once were identified with the extreme set among the regency bucks are commonplace in the Belmonte wardrobe and color, touching every shade of the chromatic scale, is equally as common. He is quite unlike many of the athletes in that he designs his own clothes, along pat terns of such startling originality as to cause gasps of wonderment, surprise, or maybe even envy, on the part of many beholders. His penchant for the “far out” has had some influence on other jockeys, several of whom seek to imitate, but who succeed only in flattering him.” When Belmonte was permitted to enter the Spa grounds last week, after the stewards relented and lifted the visiting part of the ban against him, the “re prieved” rider appeared in a flamingo see through jacket, flamingo flared pants, fluffy frills at the cuffs and a huge medal lion of some symbolic significance, dan gling from his neck. He was seemingly oblivious of the attention that he created among the “gaping rustics gathered round,” but it was obvious that he de lighted in the excitement that he was creating. He enjoyed the role of the poor boy, who had arrived. And poor he was, once. When he was a boy in Santurce his residence was in the upper part of a stable just over the horses. It was natural, then, that he should take to working with horses, mainly under the direction of his father, who was begin ning to enjoy some small success as jockey. In time Eddie himself became rider on the Puerto Rican tracks and in the winter of 1961 he believed that he was good enough to try riding on the main land. His first visit to New York was a rather depressing one, because of limited ac quaintance and because of his lack of knowledge of English, which by the way, he now handles with confident ease. In recounting his reactions during that first day, Belmonte wryly smiles as he recalls his eating problems. Chicken and Malted Milk “All that I could eat in those days he says was chicken and malted milk. Why? Because those were the only words knew in English. Three times a day, chicken and malted milk. Since that time I never have had either, chicken or malted milk.” That limited’ diet, by the way never built up his frame too greatly. He is trim 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs a safe 108 pounds. Disappointed at his failure to make big on his first visit, Belmonte went back home. He returned to the mainland in 1964, not, he insists, at the urging of anyone at all, only on his own impulse. “On that second time I had the good luck to come in contact with Charlie Reynolds, a trainer, and he liked the way I worked horses,” Belmonte recalled.” I rode for him and from there on I was able to progress. People began to know me when I won the 1965 New Hampshire sweepstakes with “Pass The Word.” For the last four years. Belmonte's riding engagements have been handled by Ralph Theroux, one of the more astute agents in the game. Belmonte has a quiet home life with his wife Maxine, and his children. “Eddie was named after me, Willie was named after Shoemaker, and Edith also was named after me,” he explained. He likes to go fishing and to play softball. As regards to life in the jockey colony he says “we're all friends, we get along fine. Of course you like some people better than others, perfect gentlemen like John Rotz and Wallie Blum, and funny fellows like Larry Adams.” Like them or not, Belmonte was a little surprised two seasons ago when he went into the jockey's quarters with a pet lion cub. “They chased me out,” he said. The reason could be obvious. He should have had a cheetah.

1312-> Fuel Shortage May Force Rationing, Swidler Warns
ALBANY, Sept. 18—Joseph C. Swidler, the chairman the State's Public Service Commission, said today that the shortage of fuel was so serious in New York State that it might be necessary to resort to rationing for the first time since World War II. Mr. Swid ler said he felt his agency would have the authority to ration oil, coal and natural gas supplies to electric pow er generating plants but not to individual homeowners. But, he said, homeowners would feel the impact of ra tioning through shortages of electricity that could lead to brownouts. He defined a brown out as “any situation where people cannot use all the power they want to.” These situations could be as mild as voluntarily curtailing the use of electricity, but they could range up to voltage re duction and even selective cut ting of all power for periods of time to certain areas and indus tries, he said. Brownouts in New York Such power reductions were used in New York City this summer to conserve electricity during periods of high demand brought on in part by the wide spread use of air‐conditioners and in part by reduced gener ating capacity because of the breakdown of two generators. Mr. Swidler, who spoke at news conference during a meet ing here on the Beneficial Uses of Thermal Discharges, said that “with lucky breaks we could get through the winter” without any serious emergency. He said that among the “breaks” needed were: ¶No long rail strike that would tie up coal deliveries. ¶No worsening of the Middle East situation that would block oil supplies. ¶A late freeze on the Great Lakes so that ships could have a longer season to bring in fuel supplies. ¶A relatively mild winter. He did not hold out the hope that all the breaks would occur. For example, he said, “A rail strike is more likely than not.” Mr. Swidler did not give any specific figures on fuel short ages or indicate the basis for his estimate of available sup plies. Nor did he give any details of how a rationing pro gram might work. Mr. Swidler said that the fuel shortage had come about be cause “everything seems to have happened at once.” Notes Environmental Controls A major factor in making the fuel shortage serious, he said, has been the stringent controls put ‘on fuel burning in the ef fort to protect the environment. These controls have led to natural gas's being the most seriously short in supply as users have shifted to it because it causes the least air pollution. But prohibitions on the burn ing of anything but fuels with low sulphur content have led to shortages of fuel meeting these antipollution require ments. “The essence of the prob lem,” Mr. Swidler said is that “our usage of fuel increases and our supply diminishes.” He said there was no ques tion that nuclear fuel would have to be developed to meet, energy needs as conventional fuels were depleted. Earlier this year the short age of natural gas prompted three New Jerey utilities to restrict new large customers. The New Jersey Natural Gas Company said it had notified 100 projected new industrial plants and laboratories that it could not supply them with gas for heating, and similar action was taken by the Elizabethtown Gas Company and the South Jersey Gas Company. The meeting Mr. Swidler was at today was devoted to find ing ways of using waste hot water that comes mainly from power plants and is becoming generally recognized as a threat to the environment. The water, heated when it is used to con dense steam, can raise the tem perature of lakes and rivers to the point where fish and plants die. The heat results from the energy loss in the process of, converting fuel to electricity. Only about 30 per cent of the fuel energy is transformed into electricity; the rest is waste heat. Because of the relative in efficiency of this process, Mr. Swidler said, further research might show that, faced with a serious fuel shortage, “We should use electricity sparingly for safe heating.” Electric utilities have been promoting winter space‐heating with electricity to balance off the extra generating capacity they have had to install to meet the peak summer demands for power to run air‐conditioners. Mr. Swidler said that it might be necessary to keep using electricity for winter heating in order to keep in operation gen erators that would represent prohibitive capital investment if they were used only for a few months during the sum mer.

1313-> Exchange Affirms Its Support Of Bills on Investor Protection
The New York Stock Exchange reaffirmed yesterday its support of the investor‐protection legislation that is now pending in Congress. In an unusual action taken in response to what the exchange called “misleading reports,” the board of governors formally passed a resolution endorsing the bills that would provide for a securities investor pro tection corporation to be used in case of brokerage‐house failures. The resolution noted that the board originally endorsed the concept of a Federally backed protection fund on June 11. An exchange spokesman said the “misleading reports” involved questions raised by members of Congress. Two weeks ago today, Sena tor Edmund S. Muskie, the Maine Democrat, called a news conference in Washington and said that some securities indus try representatives had applied pressure to force a delay in subcommittee session that had been scheduled for final draft ing of the legislation. “The representatives of the industry tell us they don't want us to consider any ideas except their recommendations,” he al leged, adding, “They tried to block consideration unless they can decide what the agenda is going to be.” Stock exchange officials dedined to comment yesterday, when asked if the board's res olution had been voted in re sponse, to Senator Muskie's charges. “The New York Stock Ex change, as it has already stated publicly on several occasions, considers this legislation to be vital to the securities industry and the millions of investors who use its facilities,” the Big Board asserted. The resolution was passed at a time when speculation has become widespread that the exchange's own Special Trust Fund, used to protect custom ers of member firms that be come insolvent, did not have sufficient resources to cover any more major failures. The Trust Fund's resources amount to $55‐million, but ap parently have been largely com mitted in the six liquidations now under way, and in at least four others that may draw on the fund. A number of other firms are known to be In severe financial distress. Leon T. Kendall, president of the Association of Stock Ex change Firms, said in a speech Wednesday that 80 member firms of the stock exchange had disappeared in the last 18 months because of mergers, lissolutions and liquidations and predicted that 50 more would follow the same route in the next six months. The Big Board noted yester day that the customer‐protec tion bill supported by the secu rities industry, as well as by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Treasury, had been sub mitted on July 9 to the Sub committee on Commerce and Finance of the House Inter state and Foreign Commerce Committee headed by Repre sentative John E. Moss.

1314-> Smoke From Train Fire Forces Evacuation of Biltmore's Lobby
A fire in a diesel ‐electric locomotive sent thick clouds of smoke into Grand Central Ter minal yesterday forcing the evacuation of 20 people from the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel, which is directly above part of the terminal. The blaze, according to Bill McLaughlin, a Penn Central It would have. spokesman, was caused by a short‐circuit in “an electrical panel located right behind the engineer's seat.” The engine was on a parked train and there were no passengers or personnel on board. Fire Chief Edward A. J., who directed the 52 men at the scene, said he would lodge a complaint against the Penn Central because of “a 20 to 25 minute delay” in calling the Fire Department. Danger Cited “It would have been a sim ple fire to handle if we were called sooner,” Chief Lally said. “But everyone wants to be his own fireman.” Chief Lally said that empty extinguishers at the scene in dicated that train personnel had tried to put the fire out themselves. “There was danger for my men,” Chief Lally said. “The diesel fuel tank could have ex ploded,” he explained, pointing to a section of metal running along the lower part of the engine. Mr. McLaughlin, the Penn Central spokesman, said there had been no delay in reporting the fire that broke out shortly after the train arrived on Track 41 from New Haven. “At 12:10 P.M. the fire was reported and at 12:16 we got through to the Fire Depart ment,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “In waiting for the Fire De partinent we were making every endeavor to put the fire out.” Mr. McLaughlin said there was no delay because of “an understanding reached with the Fire Department a week ago.” The railroad, he said, agreed to report conditions that might cause a fire.” Firemen, who according to the department, responded to a call at 12:19 P.M., brought the fire under control within 45 minutes. The police blocked traffic on East 43d, Street be tween Vanderbilt and Madison Avenues while firemen sprayed water at the hotel and terminal entrances to rid the area of smoke. Will Cheek Law Chief Lally said he would also inquire today if there were a regulation Of law restricting the use of diesel engines in Grand Central tunnels. In answering other Fire De partment complaints, Mr. Mc Laughlin said that the diesel electric train came in yesterday under eledtric power and not power generated by its diesel. City regulations require trains to use electric power from third rails or overhead lines within the city. Penn Central officials said there were no delays nor in juries as a result of the fire.

1315-> Federal Reserve Relaxes Its Credit Policy Further
The Federal Reserve Sys tem's credit policy eased further in the last two weeks, banking data published yesterday showed. The monetary aggregates— the broad totals that measure the availability of funds in the economy—continued to show accelerated rates of growth, in some rates so rapid that they clearly are not sustain able. For example, total reserves of member banks, which form the basis for expansion of bank credit, grew at a 25.5 per cent annual rate over the last month, and at a 15 per cent rate in the last three months. Growth rates of this sort, analysts said yesterday, are certainly far above any conceivable target the money managers could have in mind for their policy—which officially still calls for “mod erate” monetary expansion. Meanwhile, demand for bank credit at major New York City banks remained slug gish, adding impetus to the speculation that the prime, or minimum lending rate at the banks will, be cut from its present level of 8 per cent. Walter E. Hoadley, executive vice president and chief econo mist of the Bank of America, told a news conference yester day in San Francisco that the economy was entering a “tech nical zone” where a cut in the prime rate was possible. The last reduction in the prime rate from 8½ per cent to 8 per cent was in late March, which most bankers believe to have been premature. Business loans at the major New York banks—adjusted for transfers of loans between the banks and their parent holding companies in connection with sales and redemptions of com mercial paper—declined $80‐ million in the week ending Sept. 2, in contrast to a $78‐ million increase in the cor responding week last year. Since midyear, adjusted busi ness loans at the New York banks have declined $467‐mil lion, against a $296‐million drop in the corresponding pe riod of 1969. In the week ending Wednes day, reported business loans (not adjusted for loan trans fers) rose $221‐million, but bankers dismissed this as a statistical abheration, related to the rapid runoff of commercial paper (unsecured notes) sold by the bank holding companies. When bank holding com panies pay off maturing paper, they sell loans back to their subsidiary banks to get cash. This causes the reported loan totals to go up, but it does not indicate any change in net bank lending. In the week ending Sept. 2, total commercial paper sold by all issuers declined almost $1.1‐ billion, partly reflecting sea sonal pressures in the market, and partly the decision by many banks to reduce their reliance on this market as a source of funds. Total bank‐related paper de clined $601‐million in the week of Sept. 2; paper sold directly to investors by other concerns (chiefly major finance com panies) declined $681‐million; but paper sold through deal ers by other than banks (prin cipally industrial concerns) rose $230‐million. The withdrawal of the banks from the commercial paper market is in large part a con sequence of the Federal Re serve's decision last month to impbse a mandatory reserve re quirement of 5 per cent against such notes of more than 30 days’ maturity, and reserves of up to 17½ per cent against notes of less than 30 days. As an offset to the drop in commercial paper, banks have been bidding aggressively for large‐denomination certificates of deposit. Total daily average domestic time deposits at the major New York City banks rose $256‐million in the week ended Wednesday, for a over all increase of $3.1‐billion since late June, when the Federal Re serve suspended rate ceilings on deposits from 30 to 89 days’ maturity. In the latest week, the Chemical Bank and the First National City Bank accounted for the bulk of the increase in deposits. The rapid easing of Federal Reserve credit policy, and the growing belief that the business slowdown has ended, are pro ducing cross currents in the de bate on the economic outlook. In an analysis titled “an early look at 1971,” the Sank of America warned yesterday that “the prospect of another acute credit squeeze will grow as confidence and economic momentum improve.” The de cline in the demand for invest ment funds that the bank ex pects “over the months ahead imply important (but probably only temporary) relief for the money markets.” The pattern in the general economy next year should be one of “restless resurgence,” with real, or constant‐dollar gross national product rising 2½ per cent, against the one half per cent gain expected for 1970. However, the bank ex pects unemployment to be high er next year, while business fixed investment should decline 5 per cent. On the other hand, Albert H. Cox Jr., chief economist for Lionel D. Edie & Co., told group of analysts in Philadel phia yesterday that by 1972 the economy may not be as infla tionary as some people have presumed. For 1971, Mr. Cox said, the G.N.P. would average $1.05‐trillion, up 7 per cent in money terms and 3 per cent in real terms. Among the monetary aggre gates showing annual rapid rates of growth in the last three months were the adjusted bank credit proxy (total mem ber‐bank deposits plus cer tain non‐deposit items), up at a 16.8 per cent rate, and the money supply plus time de posits, up 14.5 per cent. The monetary base grew at a 6.6 per cent rate in the last three months, while the money sup ply expanded at 4.3 per cent rate in the last three months, and 6.7 per cent in the last six months. Borrowings of the New York City banks in the Eurodollar market declined $225‐million to an average of $7.3‐billion, the lowest since early June, 1969. Securities held in custody for foreign central banks by the Federal Reserve rose $232‐mil lion in the week, for a total rise over the last 18 weeks of $3.4‐billion. Net borrowed reserves of member banks rose to an esti mated $498‐million, up from $415‐million. Member bank bor rowings rose to $762‐million from $661‐million.

1316-> LIFE FACES LAWSUIT BY ST. LOUIS MAYOR
ST. LOUIS, May 25—Mayor Alfonso J. Cervantes said to day that he would file a $12‐ million libel suit against Life magazine and Denny Walsh, author of a Life article ac cusing the Mayor of having personal ties with underworld figures. Terming the article a “sin ister, calculated smear” and a “complete lie,” Mr. Cervantes said he was calling for an im mediate investigation of Life's Mafia charges by three agencies here. He said an inquiry would be conducted by William D. Jones, attorney in charge of the Federal mission on organ ized crime and racketeering in St. Louis; United States At tdrney Daniel Bartlett Jr., and the St. Louis board of police commissioners. Mr. Cervantes, striving to keep his composure at a news conference, angrily accused Mr. Walsh of vindictive journal ism. “The magazine's statement that I have had business and personal ties with gangsters is a bare‐faced lie, and I believe that some people at the maga zine know it is a lie,” the Mayor declared. The Mayor said the libel suit would be filed promptly in Fed eral Court and would seek $2‐ million in actual damages and $10‐million punitive damages from the magazine and the author.

1318-> Superb Swiss Restaurants
The restaurants reviewed on this page on Friday are rated four stars to none, based on the relationship of food and service to cost. Credit cards are honored where indicated. ***Swiss Center Restau rant, 4 West 49th Street, 247‐6545 (for Swiss Pavilion Restaurant) and 247‐6327 (for Fondue Pot). This is a conglomerate of Swiss res taurants, all connected, and together they comprise — with certain faults — the finest Swiss restaurants ever to exist’ in Manhattan and, therefore, probably in Amer ica. They really do have the feel of Switzerland and they are: The Swiss Pavilion: This is the most “formal” of the Swiss restaurants in the center and, all things con sidered, it boasts the most impressive menu. It offers various regional specialties some Suisse Alemanique, some Suisse Romande; some from Tessin; and some from the Grisons. Among the appetizers can be found an exceptional baked snail dish—the snails bathed in a splendid, rich, curry‐flavored butter sauce; and vitello tonnato or cold, thin‐sliced veal with a tuna, mayonnaise and caper sauce. Among the main courses, an excellent veal Engadinaisa (like cordon bleu), the bread ed, sautéed veal stuffed with ham and cheese and with a wild mushroom garnish; and good osso bucco or braised veal knuckle. Among the desserts, the walnut torte is special, the Black Forest cake, pure joy. Snobs to the contrary, I hap pen to feel enthusiastic about Swiss wines and they are good here. Among the reds, there is a first‐rate Dole, 1968. The Swiss Pavilion is a fairly large restaurant with rough‐textured white walls, modern sculptured lamps, and vivid cloth crests on the walls. The service is Swiss inspired and generally good. All dishes are a la carte, with main dishes from about $4.50 to $7.25. Cocktails, wines. Reservations are recommended. The Fondue Pot: This is a restaurant in the Swiss Cen ter “cellar.” At least you walk one flight down to get there, and it is a pleasant place with somewhat less “classic” dishes than are to be found in the Pavilion, although numerous of the Pavilion's dishes are dupli cated here, including the snails, and vitello tonnato. There are typical regional dishes like the quiche made with Gruyere cheese, onions and bacon and the emince of veal Zurichoise, choice pieces of veal sauteed with shallots in a cream sauce. The rosti potatoes are well seasoned and crisp. Among the appetizers, the cheese ramequin is delicate and the mehlsuppe made with brown flour and cheese is fascinating. The restaurant derives its name, of course, from the fondues served here — one, oddly enough, fla vored with Bourbon whisky. The cheese fondues are all to the good, but the beef fondue—generally listed as fondue bourguignonne — needs lots of ventilation, more than is apparent at the Fondue Pot Restaurant. The odor of cooking fat — how ever light — pervades the premises. All dishes on the fondue pot menu are a la carte, with main courses from about $2.50 to $5.95. Cocktails, wines. Reservations are rec ommended. The Bell Bar: The littlest restaurant of the Swiss Cen ter is called the Bell Bar, and it is situated immediately above the entrance bar, which is dominated, as the name implies, by cow bells. There are light dishes here of the sort found in many Swiss terrace restaurants. Among them are cold meat dishes, the slices of meat served on wooden platters and garnished in great style. Among them ‘is the Grisons platter with the famed air dried beef and dried ham from the Swiss Alps. They are served with small cor nichones and pickled white onions in the best Swiss fashion. The salads here, as in the other restaurants, have an excellent dressing. Dishes in the Bell Bar are a la carte, with platters from about $2.50 to $2.75. Cock tails, wines. The restaurants of the Swiss Center are closed Sun day. All major credit cards are honored.

1319-> ‘Avon Calling’ Is Heard At Ogilvy & Mather
The door chimes rang at Ogilvy & Mather yesterday and a pleasant voice was heard to say, “Avon calling.” And, by George, it was calling with a piece of busi ness, no less. Avon Products, whose cosmetic and grooming aids are sold door‐to‐door in many parts of the free world, has assigned the agency to do advertising for its children's line and its new teen line. Dreher Advertising, the com pany's agency for 33 years, will, in Avon's words, “con tinue to carry major product responsibilities.” Avon declined to estimate what kind of billings this assignment would bring to Ogilvy, but the entire com pany spent something like $7.5‐million in spot TV and magazines in 1969.

1320-> TV: A Noncommercial Sports Winner
Noncommercial television — specifically WGBH‐TV in Boston—takes the measure of commercial TV in the cov erage of at least one sport— tennis. Reports and pictures of the United States Profes sional Tennis Championships at Brookline, Mass., were thoroughly professional and a sustained treat for tennis buffs. They were seen yes terday and on Saturday over Channel 13 via the Eastern Educational Television net work. The coverage illustrated one distinct advantage in not having a reporter of the game either on the payroll of a team or subject to the team's approval, as is the prevailing custom in commer cial video. Bud Collins of The Boston Globe was always on the side of the viewer in analyzing the performance of the players. He did not hesitate to ask some questions and to note that Rod Laver paid a high price for the intermission after the third set in his even tual loss to Tony Roche for the championship. Mr. Laver left his momentum in the clubhouse. More refreshingly, Mr. Col lins doesn't conceal the fact that if tennis is a sport, it is also a business. In interviews with players he talked freely and naturally about their economic rewards or lack thereof, and elicited from Mr. Roche the opinion that both physically and mentally the pro tennis tournament grind is too rough. The new cham pion disclosed that he had made a deal with a Dallas tennis club that would allow him to stagger his tourna ment appearances next year. In contrast to the gee whiz air and innocuous com mentary that attend so many sports events on commercial TV, Mr. Collins documented that a given game becomes even more interesting if the viewer is made privy to the feelings of those who actu ally do the playing. In the final moments of Mr. Roche's defeat of Mr. Laver, Mr. Col lins spotted the situation where one linesman called a shot in and another called it out, something even the players didn't realize. After the match Mr. Collins had all the parties to the dis pute give their versions of what happened, and satisfied the set owner's curiosity as far as possible. It was a good job. The instant replay is com mon enough now in all sports but Grey Harney, producer and director for WGBH‐TV, lifted the technique into prac tically an art form in itself. His slow‐motion replays of the bouncing footwork of Mr. Laver were a sensational gem of athletic choreography. The positioning of cameras, and the crispness and accu racy with which Mr. Harney used them, were unusually fine. New York viewers—Boston viewers had seen it before— had their first taste of a con troversial sudden death ex periment in the men's doubles final match, which Mr. Laver and Roy Emerson won from Torbin Ulbrich and E1 Shafei. One purpose of the sudden death innovation, whereby as soon as the set reaches six games each, the matter is de cided by the winner of the next five points, is to avoid marathon games and — not too incidentally—make tennis more manageable within TV's scheduling framework. Late yesterday afternoon the bone‐weary Mr. Laver must have been a little grate ful for the sudden death procedure that terminated matters in his and Mr.Emer son's favor. On TV, however, it was dubious showmanship, since the colorful Mr. Ulbrich from Denmark, who at 42 could scramble spectacularly about the court in his pig tails, had too much box office appeal to shut off so quickly. The Eastern Educational network and WGBH‐TV per formed a coup in carrying the professional champion ship, but in the process non commercial TV might be wryly compared to amateur tennis of past years. The cov erage, both in Boston and New York, was made possible in part by grants from a de partment store, an insurance company, and a maker of athletic footwear. A New England bank, which donated the prize money for the pro fessional championships, en joyed some very respectable plugs, and a soft drink com pany was mentioned by name for its contribution to the grand prix of professional tennis. No harm was done and no advertising disrupted the cov erage, but subliminal plugs may be well on the increase over noncommercial TV. Pub lic broadcasting could cer tainly use the money, and the grant procedure is not a bad TV buy for institutional advertising. So long as edi torial content and mention of the donors of grants are kept separate, the viewer could be grateful for the ar rangement.

1321-> Curb on Disrupters Urged
WASHINGTON, March 25 (AP) —Representative Richard H. Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee, asked today for broader Con gressional powers to seal with persons who disrupt committee hearings. The Missouri Demo crat urged passage of a bill that would provide a one‐year jail sentence or a $1,000 fine for “misbehavior in the presence of either house of Congress.”

1322-> Charge by Samuels
Howard J. Samuels, a can didate for the Democartic nom ination for Governor, charged yesterday that Arthur J. Gold berg's candidacy for that nom ination was being used “to re turn a handful of Democratic county leaders to power.” Mr. Samuels, who returned yesterday from an upstate po litical tour, said in a statement that his party had lost elections in this state and in New York City because Democrats “con sistently handed to the Repub licans the deadly issue of boss ism.” “After each election there is an immediate wringing of hands and a resolve not to re peat the mistakes of 1958, 1962 and 1966,” he continued, in a reference to the years in which Mr. Rockefeller defeated Demo crats. “Now it is 1970 and againist fear that a small handful of leaders could maneuver our party into snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.” When Mr. Samuels, a former Under Secretary of State, was asked which leaders he had in mind, he mentioned Patrick J. Cunningham of the Bronx, Jo seph F. Crangle of Erie County, William F. Luddy of West chester County and Stanley Steingut, the former Brooklyn leader and now the minority leader of the Assembly. He said that the counties that they were from were in large measure responsible for the nominations of Mr. Morgen thau in 1962, and Frank D. O'Connor, now a State Supreme Court justice, in 1966. Mr. Samuers sought his par ty's gubernatorial nomination in 1966 when he lost out to Mr. O'Connor, but he won the nomination for lieutenant gov ernor when delegates to the party convention revolted against party leaders. He predicted that “like 1966, the large counties will remain silent, pretending they are neu tral” when the Democratic State Committee meets next week to designate statewide candidates. “But the fact remains that Arthur Goldberg's base of sup port rests with a handful of Democratic county chairmen who are using their positions to enhance their personal power,” he asserted. Mr. Samuels called in a tele gram to the Democratic state chairman, John J. Burns for a secret ballot for all offices, for a bar on proxy votes, for adop tion of a state platform before the votes on candidates and for an agreement by all candi dates on rules and procedures for the meeting. Mr. Goldberg's entry into the campaign was said by politi cians in a position to know to have virtually ended all talk of Mayor Lindsay making a bid for Governor. Reports, which were not taken seriously by veteran poli ticians, circulated last week that the Mayor was considering run ning as a Liberal‐independent, but the Mayor then told a news conference that he was not a candidate for Governor or for any other office. “I'm too involved in the busi ness of running the city,” he said. One politician said most of those who had been talking about Mr. Lindsay were now backing Mr. Goldberg.

1323-> Smith Says He Urged Goldberg To Enter the Race for Governor
Stephen E. Smith, whose mar riage into the Kennedy family thrust him into politics, ack nowledged yesterday that he had played a leading role in drawing Arthur J. Goldberg into the race for Governor. The brother‐in‐law of the late President John F. Kennedy and the late Senator Robert F. Ken nedy of New York, said his sole motivation was the belief that Mr. Goldberg had “the best chance of beating Nelson Rockefeller.” He vehemently denied that his political activity was in any way tied to the possible Presidential ambitions of another Kennedy brother, Edward M., senior Senator from Massachusetts. “Talk like that is crazy—it's ridiculous,” Mr. Smith said. “In the first place Teddy has said he will not be a candidate in 1972. That was not just a statement. It was a definitive attitude.” “But conceding that circum stances might alter the situa tion,” he continued, “both Gene Nickerson and Bob Morgenthau would certainly not be un friendly to a Kennedy candi dacy.” Mr. Nickerson, Nassau County Executive, is a declared candidate for the Democratic nomination and Mr. Morgen thau, former United States At torney here and now a Deputy Mayor in the Lindsay adminis tration, said yesterday that he was “still seriously considering a race.” Mr. Smith said his decision to work for the nomination of Mr. Goldberg, a former United, States Supreme Court Justice, Secretary of Labor and United States representative to the United Nations, had been “per sonally very difficult.” “I have very great admira tion and respect for Gene [Nickerson],” he said. Mr. Nick kerson, a supporter of Robert F. Kennedy for the Presidency, committed himself at the last moment to stand for the Senate in 1968 to help the Kennedy cause. His defeat in the primary 10 days after Senator Kennedy's death contributed to the belief held by some, that he is “not a winner.” Mr. Kennedy said he had high regard for Mr. Morgen thau, Who became United States Attorney by appointment of the Kennedy Administration. “As I told Bob,” Mr. Smith said, “I didn't consider him in the picture for Governor while he was in the United States Attorney's office, and later thought he had taken himself out of consideration when he joined the Lindsay administra tion.” Mr. Smith scoffed at the charge of “bossism” that has been raised. Interviewed in his spacious corner office on the 30th floor of the Pan Am Building over looking midtown and downtown Manhattan, he said, “The very candidates who are talking about bosses are knocking themselves at the door of these same supposed dragons.” He said that, after surveying the field, he decided last No vember that Mr. Goldberg, with an “unusual set of credentials,” could win. He then offered his services and was surprised that Mr. Goldberg, who had been viewed as a more likely Sen ate candidate, brought up him self his residential qualification to run for Governor. Mr. Smith said he had been invited 10 days later to what was viewed as the kickoff luncheon for Mr. Goldberg, in former Governor Averill Harri man's house, but that he was out of town and so could not attend. “I was glad I was,” he said. “It was all premature. Who wants a four‐month campaign before the designations.” Mr. Goldberg withdrew his name from consideration on Dec. 9, saying his decision was “final and not subject to change.” He repeated that stand on Feb. 22. Mr. Smith said he continued his efforts to induce Mr. Gold berg to run because “I saw none of the candidacies elsewhere were catching fire.” “I told him the minute he announced he would be the strongest candidate,” he re called. “I did not twist any arms, as they say. Confront me with someone who says did. I did not even make phone call until he told me last Wednesday that he was running. I had told him the day before he was delaying his decision too long and had to act.” Mr. Smith raid that many persons had called him to get his thinking on the situation— “maybe they got in the habit over the years.” He started making calls him self, trying to enlist support only after. Mr. Goldberg told me “a week ago yesterday he would go.” Mr. Goldberg an nounced last Thursday. He said he had not objected to Mr. Goldberg's putting off his entry until after the New Democratic Coalition made its endorsement for Governor, “largely because I discounted it going anywhere except to Mr. Nickerson.” He conceded that, as a can didate, Mr. Goldberg had to overcome his age, 61 years, “though he's active”; the failure to meet with Liberal party leadership — “he had a date and it was canceled” and his lack of record on state issues—though “there is not a major national issue where he is not on record.” Asserting that the case was “now before the jury,” Mr. Smith said he had warned Mr. Goldberg that he might not win majority support for the designation in the State Com mittee next week, that he would probably have to face at least one opponent “and may be more” in a primary if he got the designation. Mr. Smith acknowledged that he had let certain political chairmen, like Joseph F. Cran gle of Erie County, use his offices until headquarters are set up, that there was still no staff, that everything up to now had been handled on a “day to‐day” basis, including com munication with the press. “When you make a judgment, as I did to support Mr. Gold berg, you have to do it so far in advance,” he said philosphi cally, “you just can't tell how things will work out. I some times ask myself: ‘What are you doing in this?’ Maybe I'm foolish.”

1324-> City Bank to Pay 4½% Interest On ’71 Christmas Club Accounts
The First National City Bank announced yesterday that it planned to pay interest of 4½ per cent to members of its Christmas Club for 1971. It be came the first of the major commercial banks in New York City to break with a long no interest tradition for such ac counts. However, some of the area's 45 savings bank do pay interest on such accounts. Through Christmas Club ac counts, depositors make regular deposits, usually weekly, of as little as $1 in some cases. The accounts, accompanied by some promotional fanfare, begin in October or November and con tinue for the ensuing year. Then, a few weeks before Christmas the bank mails the depositor a check for the money accumulated. Traditionally, the banks paid no interests on the, accounts, on the theory that the cost of handling the small deposits made them unprofitable. Only three year ago, a First Na tional City official said, “Christ mas Clubs are an expensive operatoin. It just doesn't pay to pay interest.” The popularity and wide use of the club idea is evidenced by the fact that each recent Christmas more than $2.2‐bil lion of deposits have been ac cumulated by such savers just before Christmas. However, for the last decade the concept has been criticized by some public officials be cause a very small percentage of the banks have paid interest on the accounts. One vociferous critic has been Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz who claims that “in terest‐free deposits don't make sense” and that the public should receive “an equitable amount of interest.” He has tried to persuade the state leg islature to pass a law requiring interest on such accounts, but with no success thus far.

1325-> Soviet Role in Mideast
MOSCOW, Aug. 2—Soviet authorities are telling anyone who wants to listen these days that the recent moves toward a settlement in the Middle East were due largely to Moscow's military and diplomatic efforts in the Arab world. In private and at embassy receptions, the Russians are saving that the American initiative which has been accepted by most of the important parties—came about only after the Soviet Union stepped up its military aid to the United Arab Republic earlier this year. News Analysis “It was only then that your Government seriously showed interest in a realistic political settlement,” a Soviet expert on the Middle East told an American the other day. “Until then, all your proposals were proIsraeli. And Israel, seeing we were serious about helping the Arabs defend themselves, realized it could no longer count on imposing a militarily dictated solution on the Arabs.” The American initiative for a cease‐fire and peace talks appeals to the Soviet Union—and presumably to President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic—because of its simplicity and apparent acceptance of the principle of withdrawal by Israel from all Arab lands occupied since the six‐day war in June, 1967. Moscow Encouraged It was circulated to concerned governments at about the same time that the Soviet Union was taking new diplomatic soundings of its own. Western diplomats here believe that Moscow was encouraged by what it found in May and June, before Mr. Nasser came here for three weeks of crucial policy talks. The American proposals were made at a time when the United States was growing increasingly unhappy because of the enlarged Soviet presence in Egypt and was wary of a big‐power confrontation. At the same time, Israel's worldwide popularity had fallen. And, probably most important for Egyptian acceptance, President Nasser's confidence had been restored by the new Soviet military equipment and pilots after Israeli raids to the outskirts of Cairo had caused a drop in his morale. Mr. Nasser now apparently, indicated that he was ready to talk about a solution, no longer having to fear that he would be negotiating out of weakness. During his visit to Moscow, Mr. Nasser undoubtedly received assurances that Soviet military and economic aid would continue, even if a settlement were reached. The Soviet Union was also ready for a political solution, diplomats believe. Although Moscow has given strong support to the Arab cause and made often crude attacks on Israel, the Soviet Government has nevertheless been consistent in seeking a diplomatic settlement. On every possible occasion it has reaffirmed its support for the Nov. 22, 1967, Security Council resolution, which also forms the basis of the American initiative. An end to the crisis would have immediate economic benefits to Moscow which, while not immense, will help the somewhat strained Soviet economy. The opening of the Suez Canal would allow Moscow's Black Sea fleet to operate more efficiently in south Asian waters. It would reduce the need for. expensive Soviet arms and large numbers of Soviet military men to be sent to Egypt, and it would decrease bigpower tensions. All these are goals sought by Moscow. In addition, a solution acceptable to the major Arab states would give Moscow political capital in those states after the peace. A solution would also improve Soviet prestige in Europe and the United States, where the Russians would receive a large part of the credit. In addition, a solution would be popular in the Soviet Union where aid to the Arabs has never been a popular cause. It would also gain the support of Soviet Jews who feel their chances for emigration to Israel would improve with the end of the crisis and perhaps a resumption of Soviet‐Israeli diplomatic relations. In coming weeks and months. Western diplomats expect the Soviet Union to put subtle but direct pressure on the United States to get Israel to agree to a complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory. The Russians are expected to argue that they have “delivered” the Arab side to the negotiating process, and that anything short of a complete withdrawal would be unacceptable to the Arabs and also against the Security Council's intentions. Soviet Appears Willing Moscow seems confident that the United States, in return for Soviet and Arab pledges on Israeli security, will not let this opportunity for a solution escape. For its dart, Moscow seems ready to undertake the task of keeping the Arabs interested in a negotiated settlement and of overcoming doubts about dealing with Israel, even indirectly. The Russians can also apply some pressure on both Syria and Iraq to accept a diplomatic solution but their leverage on the Palestinian organizations is limited. Presumably, the Arabs themselves will have to handle their “extremists.” If a solution is reached—and doubt; are as strong here as elsewhere — the Russians will explain that the United States and Israel were forced by Soviet‐led public opinion to accept a just solution. If the negotiations break down it seems certain that the Americans and Israelis will be held responsible. In the long run. Soviet interests in the Middle East call for the creation of stable, leftwing states friendly to Moscow and at best neutral toward the West. The Russians hope that after the crisis is settled the United States will find it hard to regain a foothold in the Arab world.

1329-> Italian Expert Denies Charge
ROME, July 25 — A leading Italian hydrologist said here this week that it is “ridiculous” for French officials to blame sewage from Italy for the pol ution along France's Riviera beaches, since there are no major shore currents in this part of the Mediterranean to (tarry the filth from one coun try to another. Much of the waste that has made beaches around Genoa dangerous for swimmers dis solves and disperses several hundred yards out to sea, said Prof. Roberto Passino, director of the National Institute for Water Research. Professor Passino added that Strict national and international control of polluters and pollu (ants was essential to keep the Mediterranean clean. He Sug gested wryly, however, that as far as dirty Riviera beaches are concerned, the French “would do well to think of their own problems, and we will worry about ours.” Professor Passino made his remarks after an interviewer showed him news reports that Rend Thomas, Prefect of France's Alpes‐Maritimes De partment, planned to press Italy to stop pollution from washing westward toward Antibes and Cannes. Mr. Thomas was also quoted as having promised to keep a strict watch on illega refuse dumping on his side of the Alps. The Italian hydrologist said that the major problem in the Mediterranean “comes from toxic and persistent wastes, mainly from oil products and industrial refuse,” dumped di rectly into the sea by tankers cleaning their holds or carried there by rivers whose waters are inadequately treated. Since “the Mediterranean is a lake, whose only outlet is at Gibral tar, Professor Passino added, “the long‐term effect of this kind of pollution is certain to he very important and very serious.” He said that existing laws and international conventions are sufficiently strong to permit control of pollution in the Medi terranean. “The problem is to get the laws enforced,” he said.

1333-> LEADERS OF COUP IN CAMBODIA BACK A NEUTRAL POLICY
BANGKOK, Thailand, March 19 — The leaders of Cam bodia's coup d'état assured for eign governments today that the ouster of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as Chief of State yesterday meant no change in the country's policy of “inde pendence, sovereignty, peace, strict neutrality and territorial integrity.” The assurance, disclosed by diplomats here, came from the new Premier, Lieut. Gen. Lon Nol, and the first Deputy Pre mier, Prince Sisowath Sirk Matak, who have been regarded as anti‐Communist figures re sponsible for recent outbreaks in Pnompenh directed against North Vietnam and the Viet cong. Prince Sihanouk had pur sued a neutralist policy and al ternated between anti‐American and anti‐Vietcong statements. [In Pnompenh, according to news‐agency dispatches, the National Assembly de clared a state of emergency and suspended constitutional liberties. In Washington, the United States said its recogni tion of Cambodia continued unaffected by the coup. Page 14.] Prince Sihanouk had been in France for health reasons for two Months when the riots broke out. He arrived in Pek ing today after a five‐day stay in Moscow. Today, a day after the re port of his ouster was broad cast from Pnompenh, the Cam bodian capital, diplomatic mis sions there resumed communi cations with the outside world, which had been cut off. They described a quiet city. Troops, some backed by armored cars, were reported remaining out side the royal palace and Gov ernment and public buildings, where they were posted yes terday. No armed clashes or violent incidents have been reported. Foreign residents and tour ists were said to be safe and unmolested. Indications were that international air traffic, in terrupted yesterday, might soon be resumed. Analysts of Cambodian af fairs considered the statement pledging adherence to the ten ets of the Prince's foreign policy as inconclusive in hinting at the new Government's policy. The analysts noted that while the statement defended the prin ciples of Prince Sihanouk's neu tralism, it also declared that the crisis was provoked not only by the persistent violations of Cam bodian territory by North Viet namese and Vietcong forces “but also “by the attitude of Prince Norodom Sihanouk against the will of the entire Cambodian nation.” The new Government has not said publicly what abuses or failings it ascribes to the de posed Chief of State, but the Pnompenh domestic radio serv ice, monitored here, has been rebroadcasting since last night a recording of the closed session of both houses of Parliament yesterday that ousted Prince Sihanouk. A number of deputies casti gated the Prince, largely charg ing such domestic abuses as dic tatorial rule, nepotism, the tol eration of corruption and the building of Government‐owned casinos for gambling. The depu ties also repeated insinuations, often heard in Cambodia, that Prince Sihanouk's wife, Princess Monique, was linked through members of her family to wide spread smuggling operations. The broadcast even contained a charge by a deputy that Prince Sihanouk had supplied arms to the Vietcong while he was sending the Cambodian Army into combat with the in truders. The analysts noted that the tenor of the assembly criticism reflected the principal views held by Cambodians during the reign of the 47‐year‐old Prince. The emphasis of popular criti cism, the analysts said, had been on his failings in domestic affairs, while his frequently ar ticulate neutralism had been genuinely popular. Students of Cambodian af fairs believe that General Lon Nol and Prince Sirik Matak despite the deeply felt Cambodian resentment of Vietnamese ter ritorial violations, would find little support for drastic devi ations from Cambodia's attempt to remain as little involved in the war in Vietnam as the long frontier with South Vietnam allows. The analysts saw signs of a realization of this in the Gov ernment statement, which spoke of “occupation of Cambodian territory by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and of the provisional revolutionary government,” the Vietcong organization. The an alysts viewed this as an im plicit acceptance of Prince Sihanouk's recognition last year of the transformation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam into a pro visonal government. The Prince allowed the Front's mission in Pnompenh to be raised to em bassy status. The sacking of this embassy last week, as well as that of North Vietnam, precipitated the crisis that led to Prince Si hanouk's downfall after 29 years of rule, either as King or as Chief of State. The broadcasts of the closed parliamentary session provided a picture of the mechanics of the ouster, which is believed to have been engineered by Prince Sink Matak and General Lon Noi. After a succession of critical speeches, the next step was a move to declare a state of emergency to give the Govern ment full powers to deal with the existing emergency this was unanimously approved. In Tam, acting chairman of the National Assembly, then de clared that the situation called for a vote of confidence in the Chief of State. The mem bers of the Assembly and of the Council of the Kingdom, houses that had in the past been noted for their adherence to Prince Sihanouk's views and policies, voted unanimously to withdraw their confidence. Mr. In Tam then rose once more to announce that Prince Si hanouk had ceased to be Chief of State. PNOMPENH, Cambodia, March 19 (UPI) — The Na tional Assembly granted what it termed “full power” today to Premier Lon Nol and de clared a national emergency. Exactly what “full power” meant was not made clear. Government announcements said that Articles 4, 9, 10 and 12 of the Constitution had been suspended because of the “dangerous situation.” Thus the Government was granted broad powers to arrest people and to prohibit public assem blies. The new Government was re ported to have sent large army units to the country's northeast corner, occupied by Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops. Cambodia began returning to normal today after a one‐day communications blackout. Tele phone and telegraph communi cations to the outside world were reopened and internation al air traffic was resumed. PNOMPENH, March 19 (Agence France‐Presse) —The Government declared the coun try “in danger” today. One senior officer has re signed and two others have re portedly been dismissed by the National Assembly. The officers are Col. Oum Mannorine, sec retary at the Interior Ministry in charge of ground defense, who resigned after having been accused of smuggling by the National Assembly, and Col. Sosthene Fernandez, in charge of national security in the In terior Ministry, and Maj. Buor Horl, commander of the palace guard and chief of the Pnom penh municipal police. PNOMPENH, March 19 (AP)—The overthrow of Prince Sihanouk as Chief of State came with surprising speed and was so smooth that Communist and Western diplomats had no idea that the change was com ing. The constitutional coup came yesterday morning after several battalions of soldiers filled the streets of this French‐style capital. By 2 P.M. the National Assembly had met and voted to appoint the Assembly President, Cheng Heng, as interim Chief of State. During the morning, the troop concentration was par ticularly heavy near the Na tional Assembly. At least 300 soldiers were in the immediate vicinity, backed by five tanks. More soldiers took up posi tions near the telephone and telegraph office. By evening, the forces had been doubled there and around the office of the Cambodian radio. Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON, March 19— The Cambodian Army report edly chased 700 Vietcong sol diers from the country's terri tory last Jan. 24 in the first battle involving the two sides and the first of a series of events leading to the coup d'état against Prince Sihanouk. The victory was disclosed by the Cambodian state radio last Sunday, on the clay desig nated two clays earlier by the Government as the deadline for the withdrawal of about 50,000 North Vietnamese and Vietcong soldiers from Cam bodia. English‐language transcripts of Cambodian domestic broad casts in the days preceding Prince Sihanouk's ouster be came available here today and they depicted the depth of the Cambodian sentiments against the Vietnamese Com munists in the National Assem bly in Pnompenh as well as in the provinces bordering South Vietnam. Material reaching analysts here suggested that observers might have underestimated un til the last moment the extent of the growing anti‐Communist feeling in the neutralist country, which North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces have long been using as a haven to mount war operations in South Vietnam. Until the monitored reports of the Jan. 24 clash in Suay Rieng Province became avail able, it had been widely be lieved that the first clash be tween Cambodian and Vietcong torces ?? ??

1337-> American in Every thing but Geography
EOPLE argue about whether the Japanese have an inferiority complex or a superiority complex. I sometimes think they have neither; what they have is an “eriority complex.” They just feel different from everybody else — sometimes superior, sometimes inferior, but al ways different. And this feel ing of uniqueness, the feeling of being a separate people, isolated on a few islands an chored off the far coast of Asia, has been a part of the cement holding the group to gether. Some people worry that creeping Americanization is changing all this. The American tourist stops at a coffee shop and, in his laborious phrase‐book Japa nese, asks the waitress for She transmits his order to the boy behind the counter: “One hot!” A Japanese (sal ary‐man) gets off the basu (bus), or, if he belongs to the (my‐car) tribe, out of his (car), goes into his homu (home), turns up the rumu kuraa (room cooler) and wonders what his wife has bought for supper at the (supermarket). Not (curry rice) again! He turns on the terebi (television) and watches a game of (baseball) over a can of (beer). Or he may prefer to watch “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “The Doris Day Show” or a rerun of “Waterloo Bridge”—all skill fully dubbed in Japanese. Japanese‐language dubbing of American TV programs is so prevalent, and so skillfully done, that the new generation may be subconsciously ac quiring the impression that the whole world speaks Japanese. A professor brought an American friend home with him recently. After repeated unsuccessful efforts to talk to the visitor in Japanese, the professor's young son burst out in frustration: “Daddy,” he cried, “all the Americans on television are smart and speak good Japanese. Why did you have to bring home a stupid one?” So many aspects of Japa nese life have been American ized, and “Jap‐lish” is so widely spoken, that the American visitor may acquire the mirror‐image of this boy's fallacy and start to assume that there is no communications problem. All you have to do, he may feel, is speak slowly enough and loudly enough and you'll get through to them. If you find yourself think ing this, watch out. Under neath that Jap‐lish veneer, the Japanese still communicate like Japanese. Nonverbal ob stacles to communication may be tougher than the verbal ones. Among themselves, the Japanese rely heavily on telepathy (i‐shin denshin or “heart‐to‐heart transmission” is one word for this everyday phenomenon; or “art of the belly” is another). A Japanese faced with an in sistent foreigner is usually re luctant to give him a flat “no.” That would be most impolite. So he looks embarrassed, hesi tates, averts his gaze and in general gives all the tele pathic signals for “no” while saying “yes” verbally. The foreigner goes his way, think ing he has concluded a diffi cult but successful negotia tion. The Japanese says to himself, “Thank goodness, that's over! I suppose I finally got through to him!” A mis understanding has been born. Maybe the Japanese will attain the golden mean of just enough Westernization to cooperate effectively with the West, and not so much as to lose their sense of uniqueness. EN years ago this June, Zengakuren, the name of the radical federation of uni versity student organizations, became a familiar word in America, as the snake‐dancing students demonstrated against Prime Minister Nobusuke Ki shi, the U.S.‐Japan Mutual Security Treaty and the scheduled visit of President Eisenhower. Americans visit ing Japan in 1960 commonly reported that for all the ap parent anti‐Americanism of the demonstrators' slogans, they as individuals were treat ed with friendly courtesy throughout Japan. The 10th anniversary year of 1970, after which either Japan or the United States (in the highly improbable event that either chose to do so) could serve notice of an intention to denounce the treaty, has been marked down by the left as another “anti‐treaty strug gle year.” Particularly now that the Nixon‐Sato meeting of last November has defused the irredentist issue of Okinawa, the left is given no chance of success in its attack on the security treaty. However, the worldwide student rebellion has its fanatic adherents in Japan, and they may try to make up for the lack of mass popular support by headline grabbing incidents like Molo tov‐cocktail raids on police boxes, and so on. The visitor may just possibly (but not probably) have a chance to assess for himself the signifi cance of this kind of political anti‐Americanism, but so far as he is personally concerned, he is most unlikely to find “Yankee, go home” (Ame‐ko, ?were!) sentiment a problem. In fact, Americans will be surprised at how little preju dice they encounter. We are even credited with smelling pretty good—or at least bet ter than we used to. In a cur rent book on traditional home remedies, I ran across this passage: “In talking with whites, you are apt to be sprayed with an odor like cheese or garlic, but you don't notice it so much because the body odor is also rather awful... “Scene in a foreign novel: the loved one napping in a shaded hammock, our hero slips softly to her side, brings his face close to steal a glimpse of her lovely sleeping visage, and feels his cheek brushed by a fragrance of roses. This is because she has used perfume liberally, to cover up less pleasing odors.” This passage is meant, not as an insult to foreigners,* but as an introduction to a prescription for halitosis (chewing tea leaves). Mr. Mihashi, the author, is a delightful man with a daughter and a grandchild living in America (the son‐in law works for Okura & Com pany in New York). He con fesses that America is his favorite country, next to Ja pan, and says that his olfac tory impressions of abroad date from a trip to Europe in the early nineteen‐thirties. We Americans — he would agree—have come a long way toward our paramount goal of odorlessness since then. Nevertheless . . . tea leaves, anyone? N general, the behavioral qualities the Japanese ad mire most in one another are somewhat obscure to outsid ers, including their fellow Asians. The visitor will en counter lots of spontaneity, warmth and charm; but he will occasionally be struck by a kind of deeply inhibited re serve or stiffness and will now and then find the Japa nese unexpectedly on their dignity. This sort of thing won't bother the American visitor as much as it does some Asians. It may be interesting to ob serve the reactions of the Asian visitors to Expo. To some of them, remembering the racial arrogance asso ciated with Japanese militar ism, stiffness and reserve can seem like standoffishness, and behavior that seems perfectly innocent to the Japanese may be offensive. Chinese, with their own historical tradition of cultural superiority, are particularly sensitive and par ticularly insistent that Japan should know its place and keep it. When Japanese trade dele gations visit Peking, they are subjected to humiliations not usually imposed on other foreigners. They are, of course, expected to be (and sincerely are) apologetic for Japan's bad behavior toward China during the war. They are required to make ritual denunciations not only of “American imperialism” and “Soviet revisionism” but also of Prime Minister Sato's ad ministration. One member of a recent trade delegation to Peking (I am told) got a little drunk one evening, and on his way up to his room gave the ele vator girl a pat on the pistol pocket. The Japanese are extraordinarily permissive with drunks, and this man's friends thought his immediate apology to the girl would settle the matter. Instead, the Chinese made the entire dele gation go through three hours of supervised “self‐criticism” before anyone was allowed to go to bed. Taiwan was the best‐run colony in the old Japanese Empire, and Chinese born there remember the Japanese with more affection than most Asians forcibly subjected to the Japanese “Co‐prosperity Sphere” of World War II. But even they have some mis givings. A Taiwanese businessman who knew the old Japan well recently paid his first postwar visit. “It's the same old Japan,” he told me, “still determined to climb to the top, only this time with cash registers instead of guns.” It isn't really the same, of course. A co‐prosperity sphere built by economic ani mals is quite a different thing from one built by militarists. But the uneasiness dies hard. Those who worry about Japan linking up with Com munist China against the white world would do well to observe Japanese interacting with Chinese. Likewise those who think Japan is likely to win esteem in Asia by a major rearmament program. ONE thing every visitor will notice is that the Japanese spend a lot of time bowing to one another. The Japanese child learns very early when and to whom he should bow. The visitor who observes all this may be par doned if he leaps to the con clusion that the Japanese live in a regimented caste system, and that the child will be bowing to the same people 30 years from now. That would be a mistake. As the child grows up in the world, he will move from positions with a high bowing quotient to ones with a low bowing quotient. One of the psychic rewards of advancement is a gradual straightening of the spine in encounters. Few readers will find this joke at all funny, but it makes a couple of points. I quote it, in full, from a 1969 joke book, “Three ‐ Minute Stories,” by Shimpei Kajima: “On orders of the company president, a certain section chief had to pay a call for the first time on a Mr. S —, department chief in a firm with which the company did business. “Having inquired of the re ceptionist the room number of Department Chief S—, the section chief is proceeding briskly along the corridor when he meets a portly, im posing fellow. ‘One of the di rectors?’ says the section chief to himself, and drops his head low. “No sooner is he past this man than he hears behind him one of the female employes: “‘Oh, Mr. Y—, the chief clerk, is going off on a trip tomorrow, I hear.’ “The section chief realizes that the plump fellow is a mere staff employe; his pro found bow of a moment ago now seems foolish. After five or six more paces, the section chief turns around, but the plump man has disappeared. “Accosting a passing em ploye, the section chief asks, ‘Did you see that fat employe who was here a moment ago?’ ‘Oh, you mean Y—? He went into the toilet.’ “The section chief goes into the toilet, finds the man standing at the urinal, taps him on the shoulder, and says: “‘Hey, you! What's the room number of Department Chief S‐?’” Bowing is still very much alive as a symbol of mutually acknowledged inequality be tween different positions within the Japanese in‐group. As such, it is an important element of the organizational discipline that is one of the secrets of Japan's success. It is legitimate to ask how long the bowing discipline will con tinue putting starch into the Japanese social fabric. Some Japanese, as we have seen, are beginning to find the custom ridiculous—if carried to extremes. Millions of “mere staff employes” stop off on their way borne from work for a quick one to unburden themselves from the day's discipline. After all that bow ing, who can blame them? The bar girls have discovered (so Mr. Kajima tells me) that the way to get big tips is to call everyone sha‐cho (company president). The fact that so many Japanese patterns of behavior contain an element of mu tually acknowledged inequal ity has some foreign‐relations significance. As Japan forges ahead in the world, it is hard for individual Japanese abroad not to reflect their awareness of this fact in their behavior toward foreigners. They are learning to take pride in Japan's competitive rise in the world without swaggering about it, but it isn't easy. ACE” means a great deal to Japanese, as witness these stories told by Mr. Kajima: A man carrying a sack of roast potatoes drops one of them in a busy street; a pass erby calls his attention to it but he is too concerned with his dignity to pick it up, and replies, “Thank you. I threw it away on purpose—the sack was too heavy.” A man buys a half‐pint bottle of milk at a stand on the railway platform, drinks it and starts to leave. Re minded by the attendant that he has forgotten his change, he says, “Sorry. I was just planning to go for a stroll and then come back for another bottle.” These are, of course, figures of fun, but the visitor will meet real‐life counterparts, with too much “face” to ad mit the most trivial mistake. Appearances, in fact, are at the heart of Japan's be havioral code. Everyone learns in the finest possible detail what a person in his role ought to be and act like and tries to conform his own be havior to this ideal image. You won't have to take part in the ritual tea ceremony to see Japanese conforming to a behavioral ideal. Look close ly, and you will notice that waitresses are waitressier, clerks clerkier and policemen coppier than almost anywhere else. I once shared a commencement speaker's platform with a man who devoted his en tire speech to exhorting the graduates always to “be like.” “Be like graduates of Fuji Girls' School, later on be like wives and mothers who grad uated from Fuji Girls' School,” etc., etc. Every powerful nation at some point develops an “im age problem.” Japan has one. However, as Japanese going abroad learn to “be like” the citizens of a new Japan, in tent on peaceful cooperation, the equal but not the su perior of every other nation, they will lick their image problem and acquire political influence to match the uni versal respect for their eco nomic accomplishments. OR status‐conscious Jap anese, success, meaning worldwide respect, is terribly important. If anything could cause Japan to abandon its current orientation and go off on any of the foreign‐rela tions tangents theoretically open to it (like Gaullism, nuclear ‐ armed neutrality or even alignment with the Com munists), it would be the un fair blocking of its chosen path to success via economic achievement. One of the four or five most powerful politicians in Japan once explained Pearl Harbor to me in these highly over simplified terms: “When the Depression came along, all the powers started to com pete for secure access to raw materials and markets. Ger many joined in. Japan tried to grab North China. After Japan was completely com mitted to this course, the path to success was blocked by the United States oil embargo. Japan considered its alterna tives, and made the wrong decision.” How does Japan go about making decisions? Readers of this magazine are probably less likely to be come involved in unpleasant nesses with the authorities than nonreaders. On the other hand, motor accidents can happen to anyone, especially in Japan. A few years back, just before the current road modernization program got under way, there was a three‐ day traffic jam here. People marooned in it had to send out for box lunches and bed ding while the snarl was dis entangled, car by car. Much of the three days was spent by the authorities in amassing data about the participants. Anyone involved with the Japanese authorities will be struck by what may seem an absolute mania for detail. Vo luminous forms to be filled out are only a beginning. After these are full, the of ficial will produce a black notebook in which to enter whatever other data may be available. You probably won't need it, but just in case, what was your grandmother's maiden name? This is Japanese pragmatism at work. Japanese decisions tend not to be made, but to make themselves, on the basis of accumulated data. As individuals, the Japanese can be as decisive as anybody; but organizational decisions are expected to represent consensus if at all possible, and the Japanese have found that as the mountains of data accumulate, a consensus will generally build itself around the facts and the decision will almost take care of itself. Emotional pressures to de clare Japan's independence from the United States in all the standard ways—by recog nizing Communist China, by developing Japan's own nu clear force de dissuasion, etc., have been significant in Japan for a long time. The visitor can easily verify for himself the existence of these emo tions, along with the less sen sational emotions of sentimental regard for the United States, genuine gratitude for the return of Okinawa, con cern for the fate of Taiwan, and a strong revulsion from nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the accumulating data have presumably—so far, at least —continued to indicate that Japan's present course is pay ing off, that the relationship with the United States is more and more one of equal ity and interdependence, and that no radical change of de fense policy is required. ILL the data go on in dicating success? The reader may feel him self quite capable of answer ing that question by the time he has finished his visit. He may even, if he feels so in clined, develop a convincing proof that Japan's current “success” is an illusion. He would not be the first. It was easy enough in 1953 or so to prove that today's Japan would never happen. For one thing, Japan's tradi tional employment practices accorded factory workers vir tual lifetime tenure; payrolls could not fluctuate in pace with demand, which made for inflexibility, militated against cost‐accounting and altogeth er seemed to insure that Ja pan's industry would remain backward. What the experts had failed to notice was that job security reduced resistance to innovation. If automation threatens nobody's job, no one fights it. Again, in the mid fifties, when the Japanese economy had started moving ahead, many experts pointed to the vastly overextended credit position of Japanese in dustry and compared the Jap anese economy to a bicycle: when it stopped moving ahead, it was sure to fall down. This inverse Micawberism, the feel ing that “something will turn down,” has not been borne out. So far, at least. It is fun to prove that Ja pan is impossible. Having done so, however, one is well ad vised to lie down, close one's eyes and count slowly to in finity. This allows time for more data to accumulate. ■

1338-> Operating Costs Found Too High for Tenant Income in Public Housing Crisis
WASHINGTON, June 24 — A study by the Urban Institute shows that inflation has creat ed a financial crisis for public housing authorities in major cit ies across the country and that the trend is expected to con tinue. The study covered 23 cities, including New York. The chief finding was that wages and prices were rising so much fast er than the incomes of the ten ants that in most of the cities operating costs were exceeding rentals: The report suggested that the only short‐term solution was for the Federal Government to cov er the deficits with appropria tions, which it began to do in a small way last year. The Urban Institute is a non profit research corporation sup ported by Government and pri vate funds. Its research is in tended to assist the Govern ment in the formation of poli cies and programs. The hous ing study was based on statis tics from 1965 through 1968, but the study released today said that the trends found in the analysis had continued or increased. “The findings lead to the con clusion that the gap between costs and rents almost certain ly will continue to emerge and grow for many local housing authorities in the near future, certainly so long as prices and wages continue to rise,” the report said. More than 2.5 million Ameri cans live in public housnig, which operate out of the rentals of the poor who are selected to live there. The report is considered sig nificant because of the acute housing shortage, because the Administration is proposing leg islation that many local offi cials say would raise consider ably the rentals of the poor, and because there is confusion as to the cause of the financial crisis. Some including Federal offidais, have indicated that mis management, vandalism and other factors are causing hous ing authorities to operate in the red. But in the cities studied, the report said, about three‐fifths of the cost rise “appears to be directly attrib utable to inflation.” A number of factors, in cluding the increasing age of the housing stock, contributed to the remaining one‐fifth of the cost rise, according to the report. Any rent increases imposed, the report said, “can be expect ed to offset only a part of the rising costs, at least as the system has worked in the past.” “Growing deficits seem by far the most likely short‐run outcome,” the report said. The Housing Act of 1969 au thorized up to $75‐million to pay the deficits caused by lim itations on rentals, but the Gov ernment so far has paid out only a few million dollars. A number of housing authorities have been operating from their reserves. Of the 23 cities, only in four — Philadelphia, Oakland, Milwaukee and Atlanta — did rent al income exceed operating costs. Raising the rentals has posed a problem because the income of the tenants has been rela tively stable. While costs rose 8.4 per cent in one year, ten ant income rose 3 per cent. “A policy of increasing Fed eral statutory payments or supplemental appropriations would avoid the need for great ly increasing the rent burden on the tenants, the report said. The report was prepared by Frank de Leeuw of the insti tute's research staff. The Nixon Administration's 1970 housing legislation, pend ing in Congress proposes basic changes in rental fees, now set under a flexible scale with the restriction that rentals cannot exceed one‐fourth of the family Income. Under the Administra tion bill, there would be a single national standard, with rental fees set at 20 per cent for income under $3,500 and 25 per cent for income over $3,500. The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials said in recent testi mony before the House Banking and Currency Committee that this would result in higher rentals for most tenants. One reason is the difference in the definitions of income. The Administration bill, an association spokesman testi fied, “would cause all but very low income tenants to pay rents much higher than their present rents and would un doubtedly cause higher‐income tenants to move out.” The association submitted tables that it said showed that public housing rentals could go up from average an average of $90 to $122 a month.

1339-> Discordant Zionist
JERUSALEM, April 9 — There are certain people in this country who don't like me, no matter what I do,” Dr. Nahum Goldmann said — nearly a dedade ago. The fact that the statement remains appropriate today testifies as much to Dr. Gold mann's endurance as to the unyielding nature of the feud that exists between him and the Israeli leadership. The apparent basis for much of this friction is Dr. Goldmann's involvement with Israeli affairs despite his re fusal to settle here. Although a lifelong Zionist, he remains outsider. The 75‐year‐old Dr. Gold mann has been a prominent member of virtually every international Zionist and Jew ish organization in existence, serving as president of the World Zionist Organization from 1956 to 1968. He is now president of the World Jewish Congress. But when he confers with world leaders— or tries to on subjects concerning Israel, he is regarded with deep sus picion here. Dr. Goldmann's effective help in the establishment of Israel, his negotiation of the West German reparations treaty and his service as an unofficial link in other nego tiations—are all accepted here. But the fact that he never took his chances in the Israeli domestic political arena, that his views often run counter to the Government's and that his attempts at international diplomacy have occasionally gone awry are all recognized here, too. It was the sum of many of these issues that con tributed this week to the furor over his reported poten tial meeting with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic and Israel's formal statement on the matter Tuesday. Dr. Goldmann enjoys the limelight. Even his friends concede that. He was, there fore, delighted with the pub licity surrounding the after math of what he said was the Israeli Cabinet's torpedo ing of the reported invitation from the Egyptian President. But the affair confused and irritated many Israelis who were disappointed that an apparent opening to confer with Cairo had been closed but who remained suspicious of Dr. Goldmann's role. Dr. Goldmann has had the distinction of irritating al most every Israeli leader he has dealt with in the nation's 20‐year history. When Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi leader, was brought to trial here in 1961, Dr. Gold mann said that the jury should include judges from every country that the Nazis had occupied. The idea was not well received here. He has termed the present Government inflexible, has accused it of failing to understand Arab psychology, has charged it with major mis takes in conducting military reprisals and with incompe tence in dealing with the Soviet Union. Some of his views are seen here as verging on the bi zarre. In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, he calls for the neutralization of Israel “under the permanent protec tion of the whole of man kind.” Born in Wisnowa, Poland, on July 10, 1894, Nahum Goldmann grew up with a German education, eventual ly achieving doctorates in philosophy and languages at Heidelberg, and was a vigor ous Zionist by World War I. He was publisher and co editor of the first Hebrew language encyclopedia pub listed in Germany, the Encyclopedia Judaica, but his main interest was Zionism, and it became his life's work. Dr. Goldmann's major achievement, in Israeli terms, was his three years of quiet negotiations with West German leaders, includ ing Chancellor Konrad Ade nauer over reparations and restitution for Nazi war crimes against Jews. Dr. Goldman married Alice Gottschalk in 1934 and with in the next few years they had two sons, Michael and Guido. He has lived in many countries and is reported to have held citizenship in more than half a dozen countries, including the United States. It was said of him that, like the Messiah, “he comes, he comes, but he never ar rives.” Less than a decade ago he finally did arrive, taking out Israeli citizenship and building a residence in Jerusalem. But he has continued also to live in Switzerland, and has more recently become a citizen there. An independ ently wealthy man of culture and wit, he is felt by Israelis In he an international per sonality. Many envy hint. But he remains a stranger here certainly not an Israeli.

1340-> ACCORD ON PLANNING REACHED IN EUROPE
BONN, Sept. 11 — Cabinet ministers of 17 European coun tries adopted a resolution here today laying down general principles of future cooperation in regional planning. The 51‐point resolution was adopted at the end of a three‐ day meeting, which was con ceived by the Bonn Govern ment. The first conference of its kind, it took place under the auspices of the Council of Europe. According to the resolution, European coperation in regional planning should concentrate on structural planning in border areas, exchange of experts and information, long‐term research as well as on standardization of statistics, terminology and cartographic methods. The conference, which in vited Eastern European coun tries to join in future delibera tions, is to be reconvened in France, possibly in 1972.

1341-> Japanese Cherry Trees Planted Along Henry Hudson Parkway
The first of 344 Japanese cherry trees, their pale pink petals just beginning to appear on slim green branches, were planted along the river edge of the Henry Hudson Parkway yesterday as a gift from the Albert and Mary Lasker Foun dation. The rest of the trees, which will line both sides of the park way from 72d to 125th Street, will be planted in the next 10 days. Cornelius O'Shea, horticul turist for the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Admini stration, which is planning the trees, said that the fragile looking trees adapted well to their environment and were ex pected to thrive despite the fumes of passing cars and the polluted waters of the Hudson River that flow beside them. Yesterday, the trees looked as though they were part of a Japanese watercolor as their delicate colors blended against the tall shadowy apartment buildings of Riverside Drive that were almost obscured by fog. The Department of Parks would not say how much the trees cost because the Lasker Foundation had asked that the amount not be made public. “The trees will blot out New Jersey,” said Kevin Hayden, with a smile, as he and two other men from the Parks De partment placed the trees gent ly on a back hoe before driving them to their appointed spots. “It will look more like the Po tomac than the Hudson.” It was only a coincidence, but in New York yesterday— the last Friday in April—it was Conservation Day, formerly known as Arbor Day. For the Parks Department, every day is Arbor Day and the cherry trees were not planted to pay tribute to it. But in other parts of the city, the day was marked with festivities and in at least one instance, with a reading of Joyce Kilmer's poem, “Trees.” That was in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, where a group of children from Public School 145 attended the plant ing of a sycamore tree one block from their school. The tree was donated by their neighbor, Rheingold Breweries, because Theodore Rosenak, the president of Rheingold, is an ardent conservationist who says he remembers fondly the planting of an elm tree in front of his school in Roanoke, Ill., when he was 6 years old. At St. Mark's in the Bowery churchyard park at East 10th four holly trees were planted among the paving stones by children from the neighbor hood. This is the site of an early cemetery where Peter Stuyvesant and hundreds of his descendants are buried — a place that had been desecrated by vandals, narcotics addicts and delinquents until a few years ago when renovation of the park was begun. The cherry trees on the Henry Hudson Parkway are among many private gifts that are made to the Parks, Recrea tion and Cultural Affairs Ad ministration every year. These include money for cultural pro grams; donated talent for sum mer concerts, and monuments and flowers. Among recent gifts have been three new playgrounds for Central Park at 59th Street and Seventh Avenue, at Fifth Ave nue and 71st Street and at Fifth Avenue and 84th Street. A lilac garden, which will have 50 or 60 varieties of lilacs, is being planted in the northeast corner of the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and more than 56 varieties of rhododendrons will be planted in the park be tween 85th and 97th Streets.

1342-> Market Place:
The Morgan Guaranty Sur vey, a review of economic and monetary affairs; has been using fables to illustrate our nation's economic pre dicament. In “The Fable of the Cat” —printed in last March's is sue—“Mouseville” was fac ing a new problem after nine years of affluence. There was a feeling of foreboding. For one thing, the plump proprietor of Honest Sam's Auto Emporium reported that sales of the new compact Rodent had trailed off be cause of worry about “the Cat.” At a town hall meeting, re spected leaders tried to allay fears, one saying, “Even if something were to threaten us for two consecutive quar ters, I still would not jump to the conclusion that it was a cat, necessarily.” Another mouse learned in political economy stabbed the air with his cigar for emphasis and said: “There ain't gonna be no cat.” There was much pawclapping at that. However, a workmouse summed up the fears, re porting that he had been laid off recently: “To me it's whole family of cats”—a real catastrophe. • A variety of Friedmouse, hailing from the Midwest, concurred, saying, “We are bound to have a ferocious cat because the cheese sup ply has been flat for nine months.” Another who professed to have seen the beast said it was actually a “tiny kitten— not a cat.” He called it a “mini‐cat.” Finally, a venerable figure rose to say ‘that semantics would not serve: that if there was indeed a cat, it would not stay hidden. “Do not panic and take rash action over a cat that may or may not materialize,” he said. The summary concluded that though the town hall chairman congratulated him self on his adroit handling of the meeting, bewilderment in Mouseville had not been re duced by so much as a cat's whisker. • In December, Mouseville was no longer worried about “cats”—recessions—but gold. Quite naturally, in Mouse vine, gold was “cheese.” (This represented a shift since March, when “cheese” was money.) Trouble had been brewing for years. Mouseville had al ways spent heavily for for eign economic aid and for de fense systems to protect foreign mice from bears and dragons. Businessmice built overseas factories and big spending tourists scampered about the globe. Mouseville's currency—the rallod — had been flowing out. Foreign claims soared against Mouseville's treasure — wheels of cheese neatly stacked in air‐conditioned vaults at Fort Xonk. Euro‐mice were threatening to exercise their rallod claims, wiping out Mouse ville's cheese hoard. Worried mice knew there was a mis tique about cheese. Said one, “You don't have to be a cheesebug to realize that.” A town meeting debated the rallod gap. Some wanted to cut all ties with cheese—no more exchanges for rallods. “It's Mouseville's produc tive power that counts, not its cheese hoard,” comment ed one mouse with a practical outlook. A Keynesmouse agreed, adding, “I have al ways considered cheese to be a barbarous relish.” Others were not so sure. Cheese was handy in strange lands: “No one questions you when you have cheese in your pocket.” Without cheese as backing, “The sky's the limit on paper rallods. • The town meeting nosed around the idea of doubling the price of cheese from the 1934's “whimsically set” 35 rallods to the nibble to 70, doubling the value of the cheese hoard at the stroke of a pen. This would make Mouse ville's goods cheap in foreign lands but an importer of Mauswagens complained his price would rise from 1,850 rallods to 3,700. One complained bitterly that the cheese‐hoarding Alpsmice would get a big windfall, but he was shouted down for gnomecalling. Another predicted the rise in cheese prices would send the world on a spending binge with inflation for lead ing currencies — the dnuop, the cnarf, the kram and the aril. Finally, Mouseville's mana gers decided the solution lay in belt‐tightening — greater production so that Mouse villa could earn its way in the world. * The Morgan Guaranty pieces were not signed, but George Cruikshank was be lieved to have the baited breath.

1343-> SONGMY FIGURE BIDS U.S. JUDGE BAR TRIAL
AUSTIN, Tex., July 10 (UPI) —S. Sgt. David Mitchell of the Army filed suit today in Federal Court to block the Army from trying him on 31 counts of assault to commit murder in connection with the alleged Songmy massacre and to have charges against him transferred to a civilian court. The petition charges that the general court‐martial trial of Sergeant Mitchell would violate his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments, and challenges the legality of the military proceedings. It asks Federal District Court Judge Jack Roberts to restrain the military authorities temporarily from beginning Sergeant ‘Mitchell's pretrial hearing next Wednesday, It also requests three‐judge Federal Court to determine if the Army should be permanently enjoined from further action against the soldier. Most of the 14 points in the petition challenge the legality of the military justice system, and contend that publicity over the alleged massacre’ at Songmy, South Vietnam, made it in. evitable “that the U.S. Army will attempt to extricate and exculpate itself from severe public censure by seeking to blame someone.”

1344-> Mrs. King, Hobbled by Leg Cramps, Loses to Miss Niessen in French Tennis
PARIS, June 3—Billie Jean King remembered to take her salt pills today. The French open tennis tournament, she said, “is the one I want to win before I retire.” She was leav ing no detail unattended. She had spent six weeks training on clay and was at home on the surface, which she showed by winning the Italian open. She had “never played better” and was in “great shape physically.” But something was missing today chemically. It might have been potassium nitrates; Mrs. King didn't know what. The re sult was cramps in both legs, particularly the right, and the Californian was beaten by Helga Niessen, 2–6, 8‐6, 6‐1, in the quarterfinals. The cramps hit in the third set, just after Mrs. King had broken the service of the top ranked West German by “play ing like a bomb: I was great.” But as she ran in to retrieve a drop shot, the cramps struck. She won that point, but not many thereafter. Limping and hobbling, she was unable to prevent Miss Niessen from running out the match. Also gaining the semifinals were Julie Heldman of New York, top‐seeded Mrs. Margaret Court and, surprisingly, Karen Krantzke of Australia. Miss Heldman, seeded fourth, routed Mrs. Vlasta Volickova of Czechoslovakia, 6‐1, 6‐1. Mrs. Court had trouble with the lobs of eighth‐seeded Rose mary Casals of San Francisco. The little American had a set point in the first set on her serve, but the Australian broke through to tie the set at 5‐5 and then went on to win, 7‐5, 612. She meets Miss Heldman on Friday. Miss Krantzke upset third‐ seeded Virginia Wade of Eng 6‐2, 1–6, 6‐3. The tall Aussie, unseeded here, had her strong forehand working well and was in command except when Miss Wade applied pres stire in the second set with well‐placed approach shots. In the semifinals, she will meet the seventh‐seeded Miss Niessen, not the second‐seeded Mrs. King who failed again in the only major tournanent she has not won. Mrs. King was magnificent in the first set, whether hitting from the baseline or volleying at the net. She was still in command in the second, getting to break point on Miss Niessen's service 18 times, including three games at which she went to 40‐love. On the 18th time, it was apparent that Billie wouldn't get that last point. She had Miss Niessen out of position and was ready to hit a backhand winner when she slipped. All she could do was catch the ball. In the 14th game Billie was broken as a result of three forehand errors and Miss Nies sen's passing shot set up by a fine return that caught the American at midcourt. Then came the cramps, which she said were usually caused by a body deficiency she didn't know what kind in her case. After a massage she limped back for a mixed doubles match, which she won with Bob Hewitt of South Africa. Not having to run too much, Billie played well. With the women as the at traction, the attendance slipped today to about 3,000. But to morrow it will reach 10,000 for the men's semifinals in which Georges Goven of France meets Jan Kodes of Czecho slovakia and Cliff Richey of San Angelo, Tex., plays Zeljko Franulovic of Yugoslavia. The contract pros have skipped the tournament be cause of a dispute on fees, but there has been unseasonable Paris weather—sunshine—and attendance is up. Receipts for the first week were 23 per cent ahead of the corresponding period last year despite the absence of Rod Laver & Co.

1347-> Much of Biafra Chaotic as Refugees Jam Roads
SOMEWHERE IN BIAFRA, Jan. 12 (Agence France‐Presse) —The situation was chaotic to day in many parts of Biafra, with roads packed with re fugees. Thousands of others have been cut off behind the lines of the advancing Nigerian troops. Many others are simply too exhausted and hungry to go any further and wait with res ignation for the arrival of the Nigerian soldiers. Two Biafran divisions, the 11th and the 15th, were re ported to be still holding out against Nigerian troops. The military situation was changing hourly and it was not known how long the two di visions could hold out as they were reported running short of ammunition. The Biafran Ministry of In formation office 10 miles from Orlu fell yesterday and several oil refineries were reported to have been either threatened or taken over by Nigerian troops. LIBREVILLE, Gabon, Jan. 12 (AP)—Gun‐running pilots who flew loads of munitions into Biafra aboard planes nicknamed “The Great Ghosts” gave up making the clandestine runs today. Although it was reported technically possible early in the day to land at Uli airport or a second Biafran strip at Oguta, an American pilot who com manded one of the planes said: “I am not crazy, man. I didn't go in.” An American pilot and his two flying officers, both in dirty T‐shirts, said they were flying back to Lisbon, the Por tuguese capital, where they had picked up their munitions load before the refueling stop here. Their plane, its top half painted dark gray for camou flage, had a pattern of metal patches in its fuselage, the re sult of earlier Nigerian fire. French Red Cross pilots flying out of Libreville twice attempted to reach Uli during the night but turned back both times. The pilots believed how ever, that at least one plane from the Portuguese island of São Tome had been able to land.

ROME. Aug. 2—Premier‐des?? Emilio Colombo ended his first week of political consultations today and indicated that he had made progress toIward forming a new center‐left coalition cabinet. But a spokesman for one of the four parties with which Mr. Colombo has been negotiating said the fourweek‐old government crisis was as far from settlement as ever. Mr. Colomno told newsmen here today that his talks with the Socialists, Social Democrats. Republicans and his own Christian Democrats had produced “further steps forward in defining the political base for government. The 50‐year‐old bachelor, who has been Treasury Minister for the last seven years, promised to speed up his work this week. Antonio Cariglia the deputy secretary of the Social Democratic party, said at a rally in Pistoia, however, that “despite certain biased optimism, the political situation is still in complete flux.” Mr. Cariglia said his party had not retreated from its insistence that t he center‐left coalition adopt program of opposition to the powerful Communist party. ??

1353-> WHEAT FUTURES DECLINE IN PRICE
Heavy profit taking sent prices of wheat futures down yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. The loss was offset somewhat, however, by good commercial support, generated by large export sales. Generally, trading was list less as traders bided their time until the anxiously awaited Government crop report, ex pected today after the close of trading. Considerable activity is expected Monday. Soybeans held on to some of their gains after across‐the board losses on Wednesday, prompted by a private report forecasting a possible record crop. Yesterday's confidence resulted from the fact that a good portion of the soybeans delivered Wednesday were taken by a grain elevator con cern. The, corn futures picture re mained blurred by uncertainty over the seriousness of the Southern leaf blight and prices were off fractionally. Dealers in this type of future are par ticularly anxious to find out what the Government report contains. Oats futures prices rose markedly as though some deal ers in that commodity expected the corn crap to be lower. Any sizeable decrease in the At the close of trading, wheat was unchanged to up 1½ cent a bushel; corn, off ½ to 1 cent; oats, up ⅞ to 23¾ cents; and soybeans, unchanged to up 1 cent a bushel. The steam seems to have been taken out of the rush for copper and silver futures, which resulted earlier in the week as a result of the Chilean election situation. The Decem ber copper futures dipped to 57.05 cents from 57.15 cents a pound while the December silver futures dropped to $1.88 an ounce from $1.90 cents an ounce.

1354-> BUSINESS DEMAND FOR CREDIT WEAK
Demand for short‐term busi ness credit was notably weak in the latest two‐week period, data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed yesterday. Commercial and industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $424‐million on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Wednesday, compared with a decline of $2‐million in the year‐ago period. Since midyear, these loans are down $45‐million, compared with a gain in the year‐earlier period of $1.46‐billion. Outstanding commercial pa per also dropped sharply, al though much of this was ac ?? counted for by normal seasonal factors. Total paper fell $1.47‐billion in the week ended Dec. 16, with nonbank paper down $1.23‐billion and bank‐related paper down $246‐million. Slumping demand for funds has prompted some observers to predict still another cut in the minimum lending rates of banks. Yesterday, Donald M. Gra ham, chairman of the Conill Corporation—the holding‐com pany parent of Chicago's Con tinental Illinois Bank and Trust Company — said this rate might soon drop again. Mr. Graham said his institu tion was assuming for budget purposes a 6½ per cent prime rate for 1971, or ¼ point low er than the current rate. The prime rate has been trimmed five times this year from a peak of 8½ per cent. Mr. Graham cautioned, how ever, that further declines in loan demand were necessary to produce another cut. The rate may even rise late in the year in response to a pickup in business activity, he added. While demand for funds con tinues to fall, the banks are gaining large amounts of lend able funds by selling certifi cates of deposit. The New York banks in creased such deposits by $253 million during the week. This brought the total increase since June 24, when the limits on rates for 30–89 day certificates were suspended, to $5.01‐bil lion. Savings deposits at the. New ?? ??

1355-> Woman Here Seeks Half of Fine Levied In a Pollution Case
A Manhattan woman who says she instigated the investi gation and conviction of a con crete mixing company for pol luting the East River claimed yesterday half of the $25,000 fine levied against the com pany by the United States Gov ernment. At a hearing In Federal’ Court, Mrs. Gwendolyn Zeich ner of 620 East 20th Street, in Stuyvesant Town, asserted that she had goaded the Corps of Engineers into an investigation after she and her 16‐year‐old son had watched and photo graphed employes of the Transit Mix Concrete Corporation dis charging washings from their trucks into the river. The Zeich ners live in an 11th‐floor apart ment overlooking the river. United States Attorney John M. Burns 3d told Federal Judge Inzer B. Wyatt that the Corp of Engineers had informed his office about the spills in 1965 and 1966 and that nothing had been done. He said “I'm satis fied that Mr. Zeichner aroused the engineers to try it again” in 1969, and he conceded that she “had a great deal to do” with the ultimate conviction of Transit Mix. Mr. Burns said it would be “a great boon” if the public knew rewards were made for pollution informants, but he questioned whether the reward statutes clearly defined who would be eligible to share in fines. Judge Wyatt reserved de ision on whether Mrs. Zeich ner's complaints constituted “information which led to the conviction.” However, he noted: “Mrs. Zeichner has quite an ap peal to the discretion of the court.” The judge remarked that, at present, the United States At torney's office “apparently is conducting the most vigorous and widespread investigation— but when Mrs. Zeichner came along, there wasn't anybody go ing after Transit‐Mix.”

1356-> A Saltonstall May Odvose McCormack
BOSTON, May 18 — A pri mary race challenge for the House seat held by John W. McCormack, the 78‐year‐old Speaker of the House of Rep resentatives, is under serious consideration by John L. Sal tonstall Jr., a descendant of a famed Republican Massachu setts family. He will make an announcement soon after June 1, informed sources say. Mr. Saltonstall, a 54‐year‐old Democratic City Councilman in Boston who has strongly op posed the war, could present the Speaker with one of the most serious challenges in his 42 years in Congress. Unhap piness with Mr. McCormack's leadership among House liber als has been growing. Even so, Mr. Saltonstall would face a stiff battle. “When John McCormack runs, they don't count the votes, they weigh them,” a high Democratic party official said today. Mr. Saltonstall would have to face Mr. McCormack in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary in Massachusetts, for which he must file by July 28. Mr. McCormack who has said he will seek a 22d term, has been solidly entrenched in the Ninth Congressional District for years. The district includes most of Boston. To Mr. Saltonstall's disad vantage, Back Bay and Beacon Hill, both considered liberal areas, were recently eliminated from the district. Nevertheless, the Saltonstall camp is said to be hoping that the McCormack machine, which has not had significant competition for 20 years, is not geared for a hard primary fight. They are also counting on antiwar sentiment, which runs deep in Boston. Mr. Saltonstall, a cousin of former United States Senator Leverett Saltonstall, is a late comer to politics. He ran un successfully for Congress in 1958, but easily won a seat on the City Council in 1967. He was an early supporter of Sen ator Eugene J. McCarthy in 1968 and is a former chairman of the Massachusetts unit of Americans for Democratic Ac tion. Mr. Saltonstall, a lawyer who was educated at Harvard and Yale, can trace his family back to the days of the Pil grims. Mr. McCormack, the son of a bricklayer, dropped out of school at the age of 14 to support his family when his father died. Mr. McCormack's position was undermined somewhat last year, by charges, which he has vigorously denied, that he allowed his office to be used for influence peddling.

1358-> U.N.Did Not Act on War, Terming It Internal Issue
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Jan. 12 — A spokesman for the United Nations, William Powell, answered with a curt “yes” this morning when he was asked whether the head quarters of the world organ ization had been surprised by the rush of events in Nigeria. His answer reflected the situation that has kept the United Nations from taking role in the Biafra problem. Secretary General Thant has been taking the position that the war in Nigeria is a civil war, and according to the Charter, therefore completely outside the competence of the United Nations. Mr. Thant has been traveling in Africa for the last 10 days. Today he was in Niamey, the capital of Niger, a few hundred miles northwest of Biafra. His personal representative in Nigeria, Said Uddin Khan, a retired Pakistani brigadier has been on leave in the United States for two weeks. Late to day the Secretariat announced that he would take a plane tomorrow for Lagos. Brigadier Khan has been heading a two‐man liaison mis sion between Mr. Thant and the Nigerian Government. His activities have been confined to the Nigerian side; he has had no counterpart in Biafra. The highest ranking United Nations official in Lagos today was Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the High Commissioner for Refugees, who flew there yesterday for a visit arranged earlier. Prince Sadruddin is under stood to be holding talks aimed at the protection of an expect ed flood of Biafran refugees into neighboring countries. Prince Sadruddin's responsibili ties cover all refugees outside their home countries, except those created in the Mideast wars, but none who are within their own borders. Officials of UNICEF, the chil dren's fund, at a meeting here this morning made plans to step up food and medicine ship ments as soon as the fighting stops. The agency is negotiating the purchase of 120 trucks, and hopes to airlift some to Nigeria so that distribution can be stepped up immediately. Other specialized agencies have given humanitarian as sistance during the war, but critics have asserted that the United Nations itself has been almost completely paralyzed on the political level. Mr. Thant has been de scribed as unwilling to take any initiative that might offend either the third world or the major, powers, and as eager to remain within the strictest in terpretation of the Charter. One of his main anxieties is understood to be his belief that the organization came close to being destroyed by its intervention in the Congo and the resulting clash between Sec retary General Dag Hammar skjold and the Soviet Govern ment. Mr. Thant often bristles when the Biafra question is raised at public functions. Invariably he points out that the heads of state of the Organization of African Unity unanimously de cided to regard the Biafran conflict as an internal Nigerian affair and that the United Nations therefore had no right to interfere. While not quarreling with Mr. Thant's interpretation of the Charter, his critics among diplomats point out that he could have taken action that would not have constituted interference. They say that Mr. Thant could have made an insistent formal appeal to the big powers to stop supplying both the federal Government and the Biafrans with arms. He would thus have called atten tion to the international aspect of the conflict, the critics say, and could even have called, a special session of the Security, Council. The Soviet Union and Britain have been supplying the fed eral Government and France as well as Israel, Portugal and South Africa have been supply ing Biafra. These same diplomats add, however, that the major powers must bear a large share of the blame because none of them made any move to bring the conflict before the world organization. LOME, Togo, Jan. 12 (Agence France‐Presse) — Sec retary General Thant said to day he had called upon the Nigerian Government to dem onstrate “magnanimity and spirit of humanity” toward the people of Biafra. He said he made the ap peal to the Nigerian leader, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, yester day, adding: “I think that the federal Government will coop erate with the international community to better the lot of the populations of Nigeria.” Mr. Thant made the state ment at the airport here just before taking off for Niamey, Niger, on his African tour. He said that when he learned of “the situation in Nigeria” yesterday, he sent an appeal to General Gowon “to ask him to show magnanimity and com munity spirit.” “Now that peace is close in that country, the international community must cooperate with the Federal Government in order to re‐establish a nor mal situation,” he said. He said he had had ex changes of views with his rep resentatives of several coun tries, “in particular France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Secretary General of the Organization of African Uni ty. “I discussed the situation in Nigeria wish them and these conversations have been very useful,” he said. He called on “all countries which have relations with Ni geria” to ask them to renew their efforts “and to contrib ute to the re‐establishment of peace on Nigerian soil.” He mentioned in particular Britain, Canada,Sweden, Po land, specialized United Na tions agencies and the Red Cross. “I am also taking this oc casion to present my best wish es to the Nigerian people and to their dynamic leader,” Mr. Thant said. He refused to elaborate upon his statement, which had been prepared in advance, or to an swer questions. NIAMEY, Niger, Jan. 12— (Agence France‐Presse) — Sec retary General Thant arrived today on another leg of his 10‐state West African tour.

1360-> Sorensen Argues Case for G.I. Here
Theodore C. Sorensen, whose candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Senator has prompted opposition from por tions of the party's Reform fac tion, acted to affirm his liberal credentials, on two fronts yes terday. As a lawyer, he argued in the United States Court of Ap peals here on behalf of a 21‐ year‐old Queens soldier with orders to go to Vietnam that the war there was unconstitu tional. And he brought Charles Evers, the Negro. Mayor of Fayette, Miss., in to speak for him during the closing days be fore Tuesday's primary elec tion. In the case challenging the war, Mr. Sorensen led the argu ment on a motion before the three‐judge panel in the Federal Court House at Foley Square. After Judge Robert P. Ander son ended the hearing, Mr. Sor ensen was questioned about the thrust of the verbal argument, which appeared to suggest that the war became unconstitu tional at some undefined level of American commitment. He did not want to define that level, he said, because it was an issue before the court. But he agreed that President Kennedy, whom he was serving as a top White House adviser at the time, had been “unwise” in increasing the number of American military advisers in Vietnam. Judge Lloyd F. McMahon asked Mr. Sorensen about the arguments mentioning the move of American troops into Cambodia, which he included in the brief he and his fellow attorneys had filed on behalf of Pfc. Malcolm A. Berk of 69‐44 178th Street, Flushing, Queens. The thrust seemed to be on the whole war in Indochina, not just Cambodia, the judge said. Later, one of Mr. Sorensen's associates, Norman Dorsen, gen eral counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “The issue is presented nar rowly, singly and precisely: Whether the Government of the United States has the right to deploy military forces in Vietnam.” The court continued a stay that would keep Private Berk in this country during further legal action. He enlisted a year ago, according to his mother, Mrs. Harold Berk, who sat at Mr. Sorensen's side for a series of interviews in the courthouse pressroom. He is “a patriotic boy who is willing to follow orders,” she said, “but unwilling to fight in an unconstitutional war.” The Sorensen headquarters announced an endorsement by former Secretary of Commerce Alexander B. Trowbridge, the third former Cabinet member to support Mr. Sorensen. The others are Stewart L. Udall, for mer Secretary of the Interior, and Wilbur J. Cohen, former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.

1361-> French B?? U.N. Admit Red China
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Sept. 18—Foreign Minister Maurice Schumann of France made a strong appeal here to day for the admission of Com munist China to the United Nations and for a larger role in world affairs for France and Britain alongside the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. In doing so, he was in line with traditional Gaullist policy, which has always insisted that no peace settlement anywhere could be valid without the participation of Peking and that the Big Four rather than the Big Two was the proper group to deal with such im portant questions as the crisis in the Middle East. But his address to the 25th anniversary session of the Gen eral Assembly also showed how much French policies have evolved since the times of President Charles de Gaulle. Mr. Schumann spoke warm ly and constructively of the United Nations, which the General had dismissed as “that thing,” and he referred in highly positive terms to the British, Irish, Danish and Nor wegian applications for mem bership in the European Com mon Market. At a news conference later, Mr. Schumann said he had reason to believe that the Chi nese Communist leaders, who once had shown indifference toward the United Nations, had now become interested in Membership. His statement coincided with a report from reliable sources that Scandinavian diplomats recently in Peking had been told explicitly by Chinese leaders that they were interested in membership. Series of Policy Statements Mr. Schumann was the first Foreign Minister of a major power to take part in the gen eral debate, the series of broad policy statements that takes up first three weeks or so of the Assembly each year. So far representatives of six nations have spoken. The Brit ish Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas‐Home, and Secretary of State William P. Rogers are to speak early next week. Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko is to be here in mid October, when 40 to 60 heads of government are expected for a special 25th anniversary com memorative session. Today, Mr. Schumann wel corned the “dialogue and rap prochement” between the United States and the Soviet Union on nuclear disarmament and the Middle East. But he warned that this must not lead to a “tutelage” over the world community by the two super powers. For this reason, he said, there Is a need to give a spe cial role to Britain and France, which are also permanent members of the Security Coun cil, “though not entirely in the first rank as far as power is concerned.” Cites the Middle East In the Middle East especially, only the permanent members of the Security Council can speak in the name of the entire world community, he said. A similar wish in a different form was put forth by the For eign Minister of Japan, Kiichi Aichi, who also addressed the assembly today. He argued, as he has before, that Japan should become permanent member of the Se turity Council, even though, unlike the Big Four, she has no nuclear weapons. The test, he said, should be the contribu tion that a member makes to the maintenance of internation al peace. The fifth permanent seat in the Council is held by Nation alist China, but for practical purposes, only the Big Four now act as a group. The Foreign Minister of Nor way, Svenn Stray, whose Gov ernment has long been one of the strongest supporte s of United Nations, urged greater efforts by the world organiza tion in many fields, including disarmament, environment anf particularly underdeveloped areas, where, he pledged, Nor way is ready to undertake strong financial commitments

ALBANY, Sept. 11—Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo ruled the Courape party and its gu bernatorial candidate off the November ballot today. At the same time, Mr. Lo menzo gave James L. Buckley's Independent Alliance party a chance to stay on the ballot, provided it submitted an ac ceptable party emblem. The Secretary of State held that nominating petitions filed by the Courage party for Gov ernor and Lieutenant Governor fell 832 signatures short of the minimum of 12,000 required for statewide office. The party, organized in 1968 with Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace as its Presidential can didate, had nominated Albert J. Bushong of Rome for Governor and Robert P. Shields of Flush ing, Queens, for Lieutenant Governor. The Independent Alliance party has nominated Mr. Buckley, the Conservative party's candidate for the United States Senate. The party was formed to provide Mr. Buckley with a second line on the November ballot. Mr. Lomenzo agreed with an objection to the party's em blem, containing Mr. Buckley's surname on a silhouette of map of the state of New York. The Secretary of State said the emblem violated state law, which limits a candidate to having his name only once on a ballot line.

1364-> LUBOVITCH ST AGES THEATRICAL DANCES
It is undeniable that Lar Lubovitch has a sense of thea ter, for he shows flashes of throughout his works. That which his pieces lack for the most part is a sense of sus tained flow. Last night at the American Theater Laboratory he presented three dances of which “Variations and Fugue on a Theme of a Dream” was the most completely realized. In this dance, Mr. Lubovitch opened the hatch of the slum bering mind to expose a series of little nightmares and pleas ant dreams. The dream figures entered and assumed various eccentric postures and group ings. At the end they left and the sleeper lay dozing peace fully. The choreographer made ex tensive and clever use of the Graham vocabulary, including small sideways jumps, the arro gantly unpointed foot, and rotating motions of the hands as if forming a ball of clay in the palms. He often isolated gestures in imaginatively self contained units and did not slavishly use this story‐line vocabulary to tell the unusual stories. “Ecstasy” was a lyrical study for four couples and showed Takako Asakawa at the top of her ebullient form. “Sam Nearlydeadman” was a sur realist series of tableaus, with a number of grotesque effects, including a troll's caper around Mr. Lubovitch in child's diapers, but little organic growth.

1365-> Times Mirror Ready to Acquire Control of Newsday This Week
Newsday of Garden City, L.I., the nation's largest circu lation suburban newspaper, will pass into new ownership this week under a plan pre pared by the prospective pro prietor, The Times Mirror Com pany of Los Angeles. The Company, which owns The Los Angeles Times and several book publishing con cerns, was reported yesterday to be ready to sign within the next few days a contract ac quiring the 51 per cent of Newsday stock owned by Harry F. Guggenheim, who is 79 years old and ailing. The announcement of the agreement, according to execu tives on both papers will be timed with the resignation of Bill Moyers, publisher and edi tor of Newsday for the last three years. Mr. Moyers, 35 and a former press secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, was not available for comment and his future plans could not be ascertained. Under a plan drafted by The Times Mirror's executives, the company intends to assume op erational control immediately instead of waiting until June 1, the date previously set for rati fication of the purchase by the board. One reason suggested for advancing the date was concern over growing opposi tion to the sale by many News day employes who fear that the newspaper will lose its in dependence. Executives of The Times Mir ror are expected to make it their first order of business to reassure the Newsday staff that they intend to respect the strong sense of local identity imbued in the newspaper by the late Alicia Patterson Gug genheim, who founded News day in 1940. Otis Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times and a vice president of The Times Mirror company, was reported ready to visit the Newsday plant immediately after the sales agreement is signed to discuss salaries and to reassure the employes that there will be local autonomy. “This whole period of uncer tainty could have been avoided if we had been in a position to spell out to the Newsday staff that we have no intention of interfering with the independ ent and genuine hope to help them in producing an even bet ter newspaper,” said one exec utive who asked to remain anonoymous. The theme of leaving the edi torial control in local hands is understood to have dominated a secret meeting held in Los Angeles last week between Mr. Chandler and the four minority stockholders of Newsday who have opposed the sale. The stockholders, all heirs of the late Mrs. Guggenheim, are Jo seph P. Albright, Blandina Al bright Adam M. Albright and Mrs. James F. Hoge Jr. According to publishing sources, The Times Mirror orig inally offered $75‐million for the total acquisition of News day, but then lowered the price to $65‐million when it found it could obtain only Mr. Guggen heim's controlling interest. Over the weekend, it became known that Al Marlens, News days's managing editor, had re signed to join Time magazine as senior editor. An executive of the newspaper said the resigna tion was not connected with the change of ownership.

1366-> PEPITONE CLOUTS FOUR‐RUN HOMER
HOUSTON, June 10 —With eager anticipation, about 200 residents of the Texas town of Alvin made the 30‐minute drive to the Astrodome tonight to watch their hometown hero, Nolan Ryan, pitch in person for the first time in two seasons. But Joe Foy and Joe Pepitone didn't cooperate, turning the Alvinites' anticipation into de pression, and the postgame ride back down Highway 35 seemed a little longer because the Astros battered Ryan for five runs in the fourth inning, four on Pepitone's homer and held on for a 5‐3 victory over the Mets. The loss ended the Mets' five‐ game winning streak over Hous ton and sent them home with nonchampionship caliber 2–6 won‐lost record for the road trip. One Alvin resident who didn't make the trip north was Ryan's father, who the pitcher took to the hospital late last night. Whether his father's illness affected his pitching can only be a matter for speculation, but Ryan was as wild as the spin ning Black Dragon ride at Astroworld. In spite of his walks, though, Ryan could have gotten out of the fourth inning without allow ing a run if Foy had been able to get Hector Torres's grounder out of his glove. The play came after Ryan had alternated two walks with two out. Foy charged the bouncer but it stayed in his glove long enough for Torres to reach first with what was ruled a hit. Ryan then compounded the situation by walking Denny Lemaster, his pitching oppo nent with a .115 batting aver age, and forcing in the first run of the game. But Pepitone, who until this, year teased his hair in the Yankee clubhouse, did the real compounding by smashing a 3‐1 pitch 430 feet into the right‐center field stand for his first National League grand slam home run (he hit five in the American). Pepitone, incidentally, was batting in the leadoff spot for only the second time in his life. The first was last night. ?? MANILA, June 10 (Reuters)— The World Boxing Council named today Nino Benvenuti, the world middleweight cham ion from Italy, as boxer of the month in May.

1368-> MARAVICH SINKS 38 AS L.S.U. WINS, 99‐89
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 14 (AP)—Pete Maravich of Louisi ana State scored 38 points and Danny Hester and Bill Newton combined for 45 today as the Tigers posted a 99‐89 victory over Vanderbilt in a regionally televised Southeastern Confer ence basketball game. Maravich, the nation's leading scorer, with an average of 47.9 points a game, hit 10 field goals and eight foul shots in the sec ond half. He now has 3,282 points in his college career.

Van derbilt dropped its fifth straght and has a 5–8 S.E.C. mark and is 9–12 over‐all. For the game, Maravich hit 14 field goals of 46 attempts and sank 10 free throws in 13 attempts. Hester and Newton, playing much of the time with four per sonal fouls each, tallied 23 and 22, respectively. Perry Wallace and Jimmy Conn shared scoring honors for Vanderbilt with 19 each.

1369-> More Than You Wanted to Know About Those Hemlines..
Fashion and protest are no strangers to each other, but never has a new fashion encountered as much hostility or been embroiled in as much contro versy as the midi hemline, a length that hovers around the calf. If the midi, with almost every major designer and manufacturer behind it, not a resounding success, it will be the fashion industry's first major defeat. The controversy this year has arisen not on the basis of good or bad fashion, as was the case with the mini, but rather on peripheral issues and circum stances. All of them will contribute to the midi's eventual fate. Among them are: ¶A hard‐sell promotion led by Wo men's Wear Daily, a fashion trade pub lication, fashion magazines and many stores, that many women call dictator ship. ¶More women confident of their own judgment, accustomed to the great choice and relative fashion freedom of the late nineteen‐sixties, less willing to accept a single trend and the dicta of designers, fashion leaders and movie stars. This new feeling of liberation is widely discussed and generally under rated. ¶A business recession coupled with inflation. ¶Almost universal male disapproval and hostility, from husbands and beaux to television talk show hosts and syndi cated columnists heard and read by millions. ¶A viable alternative in pants. ¶Unseasonably hot weather. Stores Full of Midis The stores, predictably, are full of midis, and some of them, particularly in the coat and skirt areas, are selling. Who are the women who have taken the plunge into a sea of controversy and uncertainty? They cut across eco nomic brackets, size ranges, age groups and occupations. They eat in fashion able restaurants and at hot‐dog stands; they pound typewriters and play bridge in the afternoons; they are busy dating and busy looking after grandchildren. Many of them are likely to be women who want to be first in fashion and will accept anything pushed with sufficient vigor. They have gone through the chemise, the mini, the maxi, the poor girl, the peasant, the gypsy, La Belle Epoque and the Moroccan look. Others are women with the time, money and inclination to change ward robes seasonally and, in some cases, even more frequently. There is, too, a not inconsiderable group of older women who have never felt dignified or comfortable fin shorter skirts, as well as career and college girls whose interest in pure fashion is minimal and whose look changes from day to day. These girls are buying the midi, but they are also buying the mini and anything that pleases them at the moment and is labeled as “fun.” Perhaps the largest pro‐midi group comprises the women involved in fashion—the models, buyers, designers, showroom assistants, copywriters and publicists—and the women married to men in fashion. In a random survey last week, 80 per cent of the women with completely co‐ordinated and well‐acces sorized midi look were involved in the industry. “New” is apparently the key word that is accounting for most of the sales. “I loved the shorter lengths, but the longer look is exciting because it's total ly new,” said Mrs. Mark Singer, who was shopping at Bloomingdale's in midiskirt. Mrs. Singer, whose husband owns the Camelot restaurant on the Upper East Side, described him as “an average normal male, and he's not happy about the midi length.” Mrs. Albert Mercker, whose husband is with the State Department in Wash ington, has already bought one midi. “I'll get more, absolutely,” she said. “I like something that is not like the year before and the year before that,” she said. “The midis are new, exciting and interesting, and my husband likes them.” Mrs. Chester Parker bought two midi skirts in Macy's Little Shop and said she planned to wear only the longer length. “I was in Europe this summer, and my eye got accustomed to it,” she said. Mrs. Samuel Rubin, active in the American Symphony Orchestra and co producer of the forthcoming Broadway play, “No No, Nanette,” plans to wear almost nothing but mid‐calf and longer lengths. “I think it's sexy, feminine and very comfortable,” she said, flying through the main floor at Henri Bendel. “It elongates you. I feel very raffine.” Andrea Grodin, a 5‐foot‐9‐inch tall secretary, was wearing a midi because, she said, “It's fun to wear something different. “I'll keep my minis,” she said. “I wouldn't want a whole wardrobe of midis. I'd feel like Mary Poppins.” Sonia Fung, shopping for a midi length coat (“It will keep my legs warm”) at Abraham & Straus, said she was self‐conscious with the new length but she'd wear it. “I don't think I'll go all‐out, because I like it but not that much,” said Miss Fung, a nurse at the Hospital for Joint Diseases. “I'd like one outfit, a coat and either a skirt or a dress.” Wants to Be Leader Mrs. Jack Trauring, wife of a New York businessman, and Mrs. Leonard Creizman, a visitor from Richmond, Va., were discussing midis during a tea break in their shopping expedition. “I must admit I'm not crazy about the look,” Mrs. Trauring said. “It makes you look older, but I've decided to buy midiskirts and tops because I like to be one of the first. But I won't invest or buy a lot because my feeling is it won't last.” Mrs. Creizman thought “Whatever is in fashion is pretty.” She had already bought a midisuit “because most mature women look more dignified in longer lengths.” Mrs. Harold Smith, wife of a Jersey City gynecologist, summed up the at titude of many as she shopped in Alex ander's. “No one likes to look better than do, but it's insane to place so much em phasis on it,” she said, trying on a midi length tweed skirt over her Pucci dress. “The whole thing makes me furious, but if I need something, I'll buy the midi length.”

1370-> NATALIE LAMB GIVES HOUR OF SOLO SONGS
Natalie Lamb, who usually belts out blue songs from the repertoires of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey with the Red Onion Jazz Band, gave a dinner recital last night at the Roosevelt. Grill, accompanied only by a pianist, Dick Miller. It was the first of a series of one‐hour recitals she will give there, Tuesdays through Friday at 7:30. Miss Lamb's strong contralto voice, buoyant and deliberately rough‐edged, has been proved an excellent vehicle for the lusty, brawling‐songs she usu ally sings with the Red Onion band. On her own last night, she was even more effective in the subtleties and shadings of more somber songs — “Am I Blue,” If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight” and particu larly an atypical song from Ma Rainey's repertory, the gentle, touching “Oh, My Babe.” Miss Lamb inadvertently pro vided an unexpected measure of her vocal power: She sang the first half of her program into a dead microphone al though no one was aware of it. There are very few popular singers these days who have enough voice to do that. J. S. W.

`Didja Enjoy the Funeral?’ Dave DeBusschere is reclining on a wooden bench, his ,back against the wall, legs crossed at the ankles, read ing “Red Sky at Morning.” Last spring, in the final weeks of the Knicks’ championship season, DeBusschere's face was an agonized mask of hollows and lines, his eyes were deep in their sockets and burning. On this evening,’ last ‐ Tuesday, his eyes are bright and receptive, his face is full and the skin of it glows with health. His hair is longer this season, and his sideburns frame and soften his angular face. DeBusschere does not look hungry this season. He closes his book and smiles. “Some of the excite:. ment is gone,” he admits. “Before expansion it ‘ was more of an individual thing, you'd be up against a tough man, but now the talent is diluted and it's hard to get up for some games.” He nods, yes, expansion and dilution will extend his life as a player. “But it can also lose the purpose of this whole thing. A good basketball game.” What followed was not a very. good basketball game. The Cleveland Cavaliers came into Madison Square Garden having won only two games, one each against their fellow newcomers, Portland and Buffalo, and having lost 31. Young, inex perienced individually and as a group, and without either a strong center or play making guard, the Cays do not offer an inspiring competi tion. The Knicks, who are far from any sustained rhythm of their own yet this season, looked stagnant and formless, even as they won by 18 points. New Ways Some of the Cleveland players have tried to buoy their spirits by likening themselves to the 1962 Mets, a false analogy. The Cays play to ‘small crowds home and away, and basketball is too demanding, physically and emotion ally, for fans to find humor in defeat. “We find new ways to lose every time,” said John Warren, afterward. Warren, a substitute on last year's Knicks team, is a Cav regular who measures his highs ‘in minutes and moves. “I feel good when we have a good quarter or a good half, when I feel the team is moving well, when it seems like we'll get better.” The coach of the new team, Bill Fitch, is a hearty man who has tried to throw his own screen of good humor over the team. Immediately after the game, he stepped outside the dressing room, and neatly’ blunted a request for a comment on his team's performance. “That's like asking didja enjoy the funeral?” The Big Question Fitch, for 14 years a college coach, offers up a canned routine. “A guy comes up to me on the street, he says, ‘Your ballclub looks like a million dollars.’ “I say to him, ‘How would you know? You've never seen a million dollars.’ “He says, `And I've never seen anything like your ballclub.’ “ Coach Red Holzman of the Knicks is not about to say anything even vaguely condescending about the Cavaliers. “This is a team in our league. I'm aware of their record, but beating them counts as much as beating anyone else.” Holzman, who reads avidly on the road, said this trip he would proofread his forthcoming memoir, “The Knicks,” written with Leonard Lewin, “to make sure’ I don't say anything about anybody.” The rest of the league, said Holzman, is improving, and not only does each team point to the Knicks, but each is more aware than last season of what the Knicks are trying to do on‐court. And any team on a given night, goes the litany Holzman repeats, can beat any other team. John Warren is not so sure. “The big difference between last year and this year for me is this. The Knicks could be down 20 points,. we knew we'd still win, the big question was when we'd get 15 ‘ahead so I could get into the game. Now I start, and we could be up 5 points, and we can't really tell ourselves we can win.”

1373-> U.S. JUDGE ISSUES MINE STRIKE BAN
PITTSBURGH, June 24 — A Federal judge granted an anti strike injunction today against thousands of dissident members of the United Mine Workers of America who quit the western Pennsylvania coal mines Mon day in a dispute with their un ion leaders over enforcement of Federal safety laws. It was uncertain how many of the miners would observe the order. Their lawyers said that they would file an appear and seek an emergency hear ing Friday before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, In West Virginia and Ohio; 9,500 other miners, not affect ed by the injunction, were still off their jobs. In issuing the back‐to‐work order, United States District Judge Wallace S. Gourley un derlined the unusual nature of the three‐day wildcat walkout by dismissing all top union officials as defendants. The strike is being led by union insurgents who say that they are dissatisfied with the union leadership. The request for the injunction was filed Monday by the United States Steel Corporation, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, th Republic Steel Corporation and the Jones & Laughlin Steel Cor poration, all of which operate their own coal mines in Penn sylvania. The complaints were against the United Mine Workers as an organization and its district leaders in the western Pennsyl vania coal fields. Today, Judge Gourley dis missed the complaints against them and substituted, at the steel companies' request, the names of insurgent leaders of local unions at the eight large mines owned by the companies. This turned the thrust of the injunction from the union lead ership to the leaders of a dis sident group called Miners for Democracy, which is composed of followers of the late Joseph A. Yablonski. Mr. Yablonski, a former U.M.W. board member and bitter critic of W. A. Boyle, the union president, was murdered with his wife and daughter last Dec. 31. The slayings came three weeks after Mr. Yablon ski lost an election bid to oust the 65‐year‐old union presi dent. Mr. Yablonski had char acterized Mr. Boyle as “a dic tator” who cared little for the miners' safety or welfare.

1374-> End Paper.
This is not a book of advocacy but of exposition. Although it is the conviction of the author, a science writer of long standing, that the pill works and is safe, it is a conclusion he reaches from the evidence. He is meticulous in taking up the objections to the pill and breaks down the statistics concerning its use, success and side effects so that they are under standable to the layman. The whole business of the harmfulness of the pill is a fascinating story in itself since it involves psychology almost as much as medicine. There are dangers and the author spells them out, but they apply to individuals more than to the mass. Each pill‐taker should be treated individually by a doctor in any case. Mr. Saltman's study is especially helpful in explaining how the pill works. For one thing it is more a process than a thing and not all the steps are known. To use his words, the pill throws a monkey wrench into the proceedings, but no one is quite sure how. The final chapters treat of other forms of contraception—in use and to come—and these put the pill into the perspective of the whole movement down the ages. Mr. Saltman's translucent, compact and evenhefted study should be useful to everyone troubled or puzzled by the pill.

1377-> St. Paul's Sets Back St. George's In School Hockey at Garden, 6‐1
The St. Paul's School hockey team made its annual Christ mas vacation appearance in New York yesterday, and the visit to Madison Square Garden was a successful one. The Con cord (N. H.) institution, which has been called the cradle of hockey in this country, extend ed a tradition that began 75 years ago, when it made its first local appearance at the now defunct St. Nicholas Rink. Opposing St. Paul's this year was the team from the St. George's School of Middletown, R. I. As was expected, the more experienced St. Paul's outfit had little difficulty win ning, setting down their rivals, 6 to 1. Actually, the game was more interesting than the score would indicate, in the first two periods, as the St. Paul's skat ers made their way frequently into their rival's zone, only to be repulsed by the stubborn defense presented by St. George's. St. Paul's scored only once in the first period and then vrhen the club was shorthanded because of a penalty. Eric Carl son, intercepting a St. George's relay deep in his own ice, sped the length of the rink to regis ter in 92:1. Another solo, this time with the teams at full strength, gave St. Paul's its second score, fashioned by Mike Sweeney in 1:56 of the middle period. In 5:18, Carlson tallied again, with the help of Karl Methven. After Jeremy Wintersteen caged a relay from Ben Stone in 2:40 of the third, the St. George's skaters pressed for ward with all five skaters in the hope of averting a shutout. They succeeded in 8:34 when Bill Hilliard beat the St. Paul's goalie, Steve Bedford, with long left‐lane shot, after an advance by Nick Brady and George Gebelein. St. Paul's capitalized on its rival's all‐out attack to strike back for two more tallies, by Bob Stockman, with the help of Carlin and Sweeney, in 12:56, and by Chris Blair, on a pass from Tom Painchaud in 13:11. The contest was far from tame one as the timekeeper, Ed Aubel, who also times the Ran ger games, pointed out. Eight penalties were handed out by the referees, Joe Patrick and Mickey Slovak, well above the average for prep school games.

1382-> EDWARD O'BRIEN, BROKER, 80, DEAD
BRONXVILLE, N.Y., Aug. 16 — Edward A. O'Brien Sr., member of the original outdoor New York Curb Exchange (now the American Stock Exchange), died yesterday in Lawrence Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived at 949 Palmer Road. Mr. O'Brien retired in 1968, when he sold the seat on the exchange he had bought for $1,750 in 1921 for $248,250. The peppery Mr. O'Brien, known to most regulars at the exchange as Eddie, was an in dependent floor specialist in an eight‐member joint account that made a market in 56 stocks. He was born in Philadelphia and first came to Wall Street on a two‐horse bakery wagon, which he drove from Newark to deliver pound cake to res taurants in the area. One day on his rounds he was attracted by the din of trading in Broad Street, where the old New York Curb Market Association was situated. He became interested in the trading taking place and de cided to become a part of the scene. Fed the Horses “I arranged to feed horses at that time,” he later recalled. Then he would run errands for the brokers earning an extra $3 or $4 a day. Before long, Mr. O'Brien began to trade mining shares and turned a few hundred dol lars of capital into $1,600 within a few months. After a Navy hitch in World War I, Mr. O'Brien returned to the market and, with an ad vance of $500 from his brother in‐law, began trading stocks for a living. “Soon I heard rumors about the exchange putting up building and I figured I'd better get in.” He paid $250 for a membership and an assessment of $1,500 for realty stock. Business at first was dismal and brokers jested that the’ building would be turned into a skating rink. “I was just barely making a living,” Mr. O'Brien said. Seat Declined to $650 The business climate im proved, however, and the value of his seat rose to $245,000 in 1929, but plummeted to $650 in 1942, when activity became so slow that many members, of the exchange took other jobs to pay their exchange dues. Asked in a recent interview what was the difference be tween Wall Streeters these days and those of bygone years, he replied: “I'd say today we have a younger class of men. They're better gamblers than we were.” Asked what advice he would give to a young man, he said that a good idea might be to become a $2 broker, one who executes orders on the floor for others. He was a former president of the Curb Exchange Five and Twenty Club and a governor of the Siwanoy Country Club. Surviving are his widow, the former Loretta O'Connor; two children by a former marriage, Edward A. Jr. of Wilton, Conn., and Mrs. John J. Murphy of Sepulveda, Calif., and eight grandchildren. A requiem mass will be of fered Tuesday at 10 A.M. in St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church here.

1384-> 2 VETERAN STARS AT U. OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 1 —The premiere of the Phoenix Theater's revival here tomor row night of “Harvey,” star ring James Stewart and Helen Hayes, will mark the 100th pro duction sponsored by the Uni versity of Michigan's Profes sional Theater Program. The premiere is notable on several accounts—not the least of them being Mr. Stewart's return to the theater after a 30‐year career as one of Hol lywood's major stars. Miss Hayes, on the other hand, is making her fifth appearance under the Professional Thea ter's aegis. Since its founding eight years ago by Robert C. Schnit zer, executive director, and Marcella Cisney, artistic di rector, the program has made Michigan one of the nation's leading regional theater cen ters. Playwrights like Archi bald MacLeish, Alice Childress, Evan Hunter, Studs Terkel, Paul Shyre, Jerome Weidman and James Yaffee have had premieres of their plays. “When we started,” Mr. Schnitzer commented, “only a few schools were supporting theater groups. Now over 100 colleges are housing some type of professional theater.” Throughout its history, the program has maintained close ties with the Association of Producing Artists, of which Mr. Schnitzer said: “We gave the company a home. Our one‐year contract grew into three and then into an eight‐year return engagement.” In its annual underwriting of productions by the A.P.A., which ended its association with the Phoenix Theater last spring, the Michigan program contributed a total of $250,000. Other companies presented by the program are the American Conservatory Theater, the Strat ford Festival of Canada and the Phoenix's productions of The Criminals” and “Harvey,” both of which will be seen later in New York. “Harvey” opens at the ANTA Theater mit Feb. 24. “The Criminals” is due at an Off Broadway theater at a date still to be announced. In addition to presenting established works, the program offers a yearly fellowship, un derwritten by the Shubert Foundation, to a gifted young playwright. Ransom Jeffrey, a 26‐year‐old Texan, was this year's recipient. The program also presents a touring series of Broadway and Off Broad way hits.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 (AP) —The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended today the broker‐dealer registration of Richard L. Kamen, a Chicago stockbroker, for 30 days begin ning next Monday. The commission said Mr. Kamen consented to its find ings and to the suspension without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.

1386-> CHANGES IN COURTS AND PRISONS ASKED
More state financial aid to local police forces, streamlined court procedures and more adequate prison rehabilitation programs were urged yester day by Arthur J. Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor, made his proposals for fighting crime during a campaign stop at a cooperative store at Seventh Avenue and 10th Street run by former prison inmates. “These prisons are crime fac tories,” one of the store pro prietors, Mel Rivers told Mr. Goldberg. “They do nothing to help you get a job when you're out.” “You're right,” Mr. Goldberg replied. “A new perspective is needed in our system of crimi nal justice.” In a position paper on crime and the administration of jus tice, the candidate said: “The state must form a part nership with localities to com bat crime in New York. It must provide direct aid and techni cal assistance to strengthen lo cal police agencies. “Our court procedures must be modernized and court con gestion relieved. Offenders, par ticularly first offenders, must be provided with increased vo cational and rehabilitative services in our correctional fa cilities. “The Rockefeller Administra tion simply has not done enough to upgrade the quality of local police forces, improve education and training, or to, use state aid as an inducement to encourage modernization.” Mr. Goldberg spent the mid dle part of the day walking through the Lower East Side in quest of votes from its low‐in come Jewish, Puerto Rican and Negro residents. Walking along Orchard Street where Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe settled at the turn of the century, he shook hands with Spanish‐speaking migrants from Puerto Rico. Later, Mr. Goldberg went to Harlem, where he addressed black ministers' coalition at a West 145th Street church. State Senator Basil A. Peterson, his running mate for Lieutenant Governor, was at his side. Commenting on the Demo cratic mayoral primary in New ark, which was won Tuesday by Kenneth A. Gibson, a Ne gro, Mr. Goldberg said: “The people there showed they were color blind. I commend them for it.” A helicopter carrying Mr. Goldberg was forced to make an emergency landing in a parking lot in Lynbrook, L. I., last night because of bad weather. The candidate and his party were taken by the police to the group's destination, a po litical rally at Patchogue, L. I.

1388-> PROFIT INCREASE POSTED BY A. & P.
Although earnings of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company in the third fiscal quarter were only 2.5 per cent ahead of the level in the pre ceding year, the gain for the nine‐month period was 11.9 per cent over profits for the cor responding three‐quarters of fiscal 1968, the report disclosed yesterday. The nation's largest food chain is expected to end its 1969 fiscal year of 53 weeks with record sales and higher profits than in the previous year. This would reflect the results for the final quarter, which is generally the best of the year, and the fact that it will in clude 14 weeks ending Feb. 28, one more week than in fis cal 1968. Net income for the 13 weeks to Nov. 22 amounted to $12,366,000, equal to 50 cents a share on 24,848,913 common shares outstanding, against $12,063,000, or 48 cents a share, for the corresponding third fis cal quarter a year earlier. Sales for the third fiscal year were up 4.6 per cent to $1.403,107,000 from $1,341, 467,000 a year before, bringing the volume for the 39 weeks to $4,189,421,000, or 3.7 per cent ahead of the $4,040,506, 000 sales for the prior year's period. Net earnings for the 39 weeks to Nov. 22 rose to $35,964,000, or $1.45 a share, from $32,120,000, or $1.29 a share, for the first 39 weeks of fis cal 1968. International Milling, which will change its name to Inter national Multifoods later this month, realized a 25 per cent rise in earnings for the nine months ended Nov. 30 on sales gain of 4 per cent, it was reported yesterday. Consolidated net earnings were $4,337,318, or $1.63 common share, compared with $3,461,479, or $1.28 a share, for the prior year's period. Consolidated net sales were $261,633,512 against $252,658, 477. For the third fiscal quarter net earnings were $1,815,854, or 69 cents a share, on sales of $94,975,216. This compares with $1,483,944, or 56 cents share, on sales of 489,674,441 for the quarter to Nov.30,1968. The nine‐month earnings were after providing 22 cents a share for costs mainly in volved in the closing and dis posal of plants. ANDREW JERGENS COMPANY ?? COMPUTEST CORPORATION ?? AY LI N, INC. ??

1389-> Draft Officials Redesign Lottery Procedures to Make the System More Random
WASHINGTON, June 24 — The selective service system announced today elaborate preparations intended to insure complete randomness In the draft lottery next week. Draft officials said the pro cedures eliminated virtually any possibility of human error in the drawing, which will determine the order in which men born in 1951 will be drafted. After the first lottery last December, statisticians and ex perts in mathematical prob ability questioned whether pure chance alone had been in lvolved in the drawing. Several law suits have been filed chal lenging the validity of that lot tery, but none have been de cided. Dr. Curtis W. Tarr, the di rector of Selective Service, re fused to say today whether he believed last year's drawing had been fair, but he ac knowledged that the heavy criticism of that drawing had led to more careful plans for this year's lottery. “It's a poor man that can't profit from experience,” Dr. Tarr said at a news conference. “We would like to have a draw ing this year that appears im partial, both to those profes sionally curious and to those whose lives are involved.” Dr. Tarr said that at his re quest statisticians at the Na tional Bureau of Standards had provided him with 25 random tables of numbers 1 through 365 and 25 other random tables of the dates of the year. The bureau used a computer to as sure that the tables were, in fact, random. On Monday, draft officials will pick one table from each group, and slips of paper cor responding to the dates and numbers on these tables will be placed in plastic capsules. On Wednesday morning, the capsules will be poured into two plexiglas rotary drums, one for the dates and others for the numbers and the drums will be rotated by hand for an hour before the drawing begins at 10 A.M. Members of the Selective Service System's youth ad visory committees will do the actual drawing, one member picking a capsule containing a date and another a capsule con taining a number, until all 365 dates and numbers are drawn After each date and number are picked, the drums will again be rotated by hand. A man's position In the draft sequence will depend on the number picked at the time his birthdate is drawn. Thus, if March 20 is drawn at the same time No. 150 is drawn, all men born on March 20, 1951, will have lottery No. 150. They will be called after all men in their draft board with No. 149 and before all men with No. 151. These cautious procedures are far different from those in December when slips of paper with the dates of the year were placed in calendar order in the capsules and the capsules were shaken by hand and then drawn from a fishbowl one by one. The new drawing will affect the 1.8 million men born in 1951 and will determine the order in which they will be drafted in 1971 or in later years if they have deferments next year. Dr. Tarr said that the lottery was being conducted six months before men would be inducted under it so as to give both the draft boards and the men affected time to make plans. He said that almost im mediately after the drawing local boards would begin call ing men with low lottery num bers for physical examinations. The drawing that set the se quence of selection for men drafted this year was held Dec. 1, 1969, only a month before it went into effect. One result was that many men with low numbers, who should have been called early in the year, had not been examined when their numbers were reached. This forced local draft boards in the early months of the year to call men with high er lottery numbers than would otherwise have been reached. The early date of this year's lottery should eliminate the problem. Men affected by last year's lottery — those born in the period Jan. 1, 1944, to Dec. 31, 1950 — will not have their places in the sequence changed by the new drawing. If such a man's number was not reached by the end of this year and if he did not hold a deferment, then he is safe from the draft forever. If he held a deferment this year, he will enter the draft pool in the year he loses his deferment at the same place in the sequence as the number he originally drew. Local draft boards have been permitted to process for induc tion through this July, men with numbers up to No. 190. Beginning in August, large numbers of men with lower numbers who held student de ferments until college gradua tion will be entering the pool and they will be drafted be fore men with higher numbers. Draft officials are reluctant to give a cut‐off number after which men will not be drafted this year. But the best guess of Selective Service and Defense Department officials is that the cut‐off will be in the range of No. 215 to No. 240. This is based on Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird's most recent estimate that draft calls for the year will total be tween 150,000 and 180,000. By the end of July, 116,500 men will have been drafted. Government manpower ex perts believe that the pool of men eligible for the draft in 1971 will be somewhat smaller than this year's pool of about 800,000.

1391-> 24‐Hour Child‐Care Facilities Planned at 2 Industrial Parks
The introduction of round the‐clock child‐care centers to serve working mothers at two Brooklyn industrial parks was announced yesterday by the Economic Development Admin istration. The centers will be built alongside the factories and of fices of the Flatlands and Navy Yard industrial parks, an inno vation hailed by city officials as a way of meeting the in creasing demand for child‐care services. The announcement was made by Ken Patton, who heads the city superagency that is dedi cated to creating new jobs. The agency worked out the plan in conferences with the Human Resources Administration, the superagency that deals with poverty and welfare problems. The new program, which will be supervised by the Depart ment of Social Services, will enable a woman to take her preschool children to work on any of three shifts and leave them nearby in the care of professionals who will provide meals, recreation, and medical and educational services. The problem of impoverished women who are willing to work but unable to find adequate child‐care facilities in their home neighborhoods has led to long waiting lists at the lim ited number of centers. The task of opening new centers in poor areas has proved difficult, in part be cause of a shortage of build ings that meet: health and safe ty standards. Each center will have a room for 75 youngsters to play and sleep in during a single work shift. The Flatlands center will be operated by Catholic Chari ties of Brooklyn in a building to be erected by the Renter Development Corporation at the industrial park. The Navy Yard center will be operated by the Commerce, Labor, and Industrial Corporation of Kings in a renovated building. Mr. Patton, the city's Eco nomic Development Adminis trator, said the centers would “liberate” mothers and help stabilize the workforce for employers. The goal is to open the centers in January. Mr. Patton expressed the hope the on‐site, round‐the clock feature would set a trend that would free more welfare families for new jobs. Welfare officials agreed with him, but said that previous attempts to interest major companies and labor unions in this approach had proved unsuccessful. At present, there are 8,345 youngsters of working mothers served in 129 conventional day care centers near their homes. An additional 4,873 youngsters are cared for in small family settings approved by the city. The waiting list includes 8,846 children, but Commis sioner of Social Services Jack R. Goldberg has estimated the true need is much larger, with tens of thousands of women who head welfare families will ing to go out and work but being unable to because of their children. The Flatlands park, near Ca narsie, is about one‐third de veloped toward a projected goal of 10,000 jobs in dozens of new businesses the city hopes to attract. The Navy Yard has more than 2,000 jobs filled in new plants at the converted shipbuilding yard, with the city hoping for a total of 30,000 new jobs. Whether these plans succeed will depend in part on the city's ability to provide a reliable labor force. The new approach, worked out with the assistance of Pratt Institute's Center for Community Improvement, will, be financed by Fedefal and city funds, the working mothers themselves and the employers, according to the city. Precise details of this finan cial formula were not available yesterday. A spokesman for Mr. Patton said that businesses would participate “to a small extent,” but that Federal man power‐funds would meet much of the cost.

1392-> Goldberg Campaigns Confidently Upstate in His Drive for the Governorship
SYRACUSE, March 25—Ar Ithur J. Goldberg campaigned confidently across upstate New York today and met Demo cratic leaders while his sup porters calculated that he now had enough solid support to guarantee him the Democratic State Committee's endorsement for the gubernatorial nomina tion. While Mr. Goldberg mingled, spoke, ate and joked with party members in five cities during a 16‐hour day, Joseph F. Cran gle, the Democratic chairman of Erie County, said, “We're well over 51 per cent now and we could get 60 or 65 per cent of the committee vote next week.” Mr. Goldberg, the 61‐year‐old former Supreme Court Justice, asked: “Do I look like a man who doesn't intend to cam paign? Do I look like a man who wafts the nomination on silver platter?” The men with him, politicians and reporters, agreed that he looked every inch a campaigner as he was marshaled through Buffalo, Rochester, Ithaca, Syr acuse and Albany by Mr. Crangle and an experienced team of Kennedy campaign workers, including Carmine Pa risi and Thomas Hanan, vet eran advance men. Skipping from city to city in a chartered Lear Jet, Mr. Gold berg, in his own words, “ex perimented to find my political style.” He began at 8 A.M. in Buf falo, speaking for 50 minutes to party workers in a style that sounded more suited to law school seminar. It was his first campaign speech to a political audience —a crowd of 500 that seemed disappointed and a bit bored —and he walked away saying, “That didn't go too well, did it?” At the next stop, a speech to 300 party workers in Roch ester, the candidate told Mr. Crangle to signal him “when I've spoken too long.” Mr. Crangle signaled after 10 minutes and Mr. Goldberg switched to a question‐and‐an swer session. He seemed more comfortable and the audience responded with frequent bursts of applause. Before each speech, Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Crangle met privately with county chairmen and state committee members. Afer those sessions and after comparing notes with Stephen E. Smith—who has been direct ing the Goldberg drive from New York City—Mr. Crangle re ported, in effect, that his candi date had the committee endorse men locked up. The report was that Mr. Gold berg, who has a solid core of support in New York City and Buffalo, had picked up support among previously uncommitted committee members, including some from Staten Island and Dutchess County. In three small counties and in Monroe, which includes Rochester, some com mittee members came forward to announce that they were switching their support from Mr. Samuels to Mr. Goldberg. “We're going to Goldberg be cause he's the man who can win,” said Frank Rapecci, coun ty chairman of Genessee, which had committed its two votes to Mr. Samuels. There are 345 members of the state committee, and they will. meet April 1 to endorse a state wide ticket. The endorsed can‐1 didates will appear on the June 23 primary election ballot along with any candidates who re ceives 25 per cent of the com mittee‐vote or who, collects the signatures of 10,000 enrolled Democrats, including 50 each from at least 47 of the state's 62 counties. call himself a noncandidate to day, saying that he would not run in the primary unless he received 50 per cent of the state committee vote. But he was obviously confident about getting that majority and ended a speech at Cornell University by telling 1,000 students that he “had to get to work on my noncampaign.” At each stop, he was ques tioned on state issues and as the day went along his an swers became more specific, reciting statistics about em ployment and taxes. Asked about Governor Rocke feller's proposed “no‐fault” auto insurance legislation, he said he favored that type of legislation in general but had not studied the Rockefeller plan. He also said that he was op posed to repeal of the so‐called Blaine Amendment prohibiting state aid to parochial schools because he felt it had “the same legal reach” as the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and that there were many legal ways for government to aid parochial schools.

1400-> U. S. JURY INDICTS EX‐JUDGE OF PERU
A former Supreme Court justice of Peru was indicted yesterday by a Federal grand jury in Brookivn on charges of smuggling diamonds worth $750,000 into the United States from Israel. United States Attorney Ed ward R. Neaher announced a two‐count indictment against former Justice Felix Portocar rero, 54 years old, of Lima. The suspect had been dis missed from his post on the highest court in Peru shortly after his arrest at Kennedy In ternational Airport on April 30, 1969. He was arrested by cus toms agents when he arrived on an El Al jetliner from Tel Aviv. The indictment was delayed because of personnel changes in Mr. Neaher's office, accord ing to sources there. It charges that he smuggled give packets of cut and pol ished diamonds, weighing 659.14 carats, which would have been subject to an 8 per rent duty. Sources close to the inves tigation said that he arrived with two friends, both Peruvi an nationals, neither of whom was held. Mr. Portocarrero, a short, dark‐haired man, attracted the lattention of customs agents be cause, they said, he appeared to be nervous and kept a hand near his “bulky” clothing. Aft er he was processed by immi gration inspectors, he went to the customs area for baggage Inspection. Agents then led him into a rivate room and searched him. They said they found a packet in his trousers pocket opened it and discovered the diamonds. Assistant United States At torney Howard E. Babbush said that the defendant claimed diplomatic immunity. But Peru vian Government officials here rejected this, and he was ar raigned before a United States Commissioner. He was released in the cus tody of a Peruvian vice consul who vouched for his appear ance here. He is scheduled to plead to the indictment on Oct. 1. If convicted, he faces two years in prison and a $5,000 fine on each count. According to Mr. Babbush, the defendant told agents he had purchased the gems in Is rael as “a hedge against poor economic conditions” in Peru. He was said to have expressed concern about the devaluation of Peruvian money. He had left Kennedy three days before his return here, ostensibly to visit his brother, Felipe Portocarrero, the Peru vian ambassador to Israel.

1401-> Matsushita Says Its Goal Is Abundance
OSAKA, Japan — Visiting the headquarters of the Mat sushita Electric Industrial Company, Ltd., is a bit like attending a Moral Rearma ment meeting. To ask the company's pres ident, Masaharu Matsushita, or any employe for the secret of the company's success is to invite a lengthy lecture on ethics, loyalty and the re sponsibilities of business and labor to world peace. The lecture is uplifting but does little to explain why Matsushita has become one of the most successful enter prises in a national economy where success has become commonplace. With sales of close to $1.7‐ billion last year—up 28 per cent from 1968—Matsushita was Japan's second largest manufacturer of electrical products after Hitachi, Inc. But Matsushita is the No. 1 company in the sale of con sumer appliances such as tel evision sets, air‐conditioners, washing machines, radios, tape recorders and electric and electronic ranges, which it sells under the National label here and in Europe and as Panasonic equipment in the United States. Thanks largely to the soar ing sales of color television sets to the United States and other equipment in Europe and Southeast Asia, Matsu shita was the biggest export er among Japanese electrical industry in 1969, with ex port sales of $300‐million, or about 2 per cent of total Japanese exports. Matsushita was also No. 1 In Japan where it really counted—in profits. Its es timated 11 per cent of profit ability on gross sales was the country's outstanding achievement in this area dur ing 1969. How did Matsushita achieve Its earnings results? “That is a very interesting and very important ques tion,” Mr. Matsushita said. Every Matsushita employe, he said, has a small note book that is carried and con sulted at all times. The first part of the notebook contains the “Matsushita Creed.” “The creed says, in effect,” Mr. Matsushita explained, “that we Matsushita people through the production and sales of electric products, must contribute to the well being and progress of the world. “We do not go after profits as such, but we are rewarded for our contributions to so ciety, and that reward comes in the form of profits. “In other words, we achieve high profitability because we do not seek profits.” This elevated approach to business has characterized the company since it was founded in 1918 by Mr. Mat sushita's father, Konosuke Matsushita, now 73 years old, who is the board chair man. The elder Matsushita, who started by making electric plug attachments in a back yard workshop, conceived his business theory after watching a vagrant drinking water from a tap outside a neighbor's house. He was im pressed by the fact that no body objected to the vagrant drinking water free of charge. “I began to think about abundance,” he later wrote, “and I decided that the mis sion of the industrialist is to fill the world with products and bring a better living to the people of the world.” The ways in which Mat sushita Electric carries out this “water tap” theory of business offer some clues to the company's high prof itability. The younger Matsushita explained that to offer serv ice to the consumer, the com pany does extensive research into what kind of products people want and how much they are willing to pay for it. Then the product is manu factured and constant effort is put into cutting production costs until it can be sold profitably. Often some of the profits are invested in adding new features or high er quality to the product. The company also invests about 4 per cent of its profits on research and development of new products. This is a high expenditure by Japanese standards, but it enables Mat sushita to put a constant stream of new or improved products on the market. It also allows the company to do long‐range market plan ning. Now, for example, it believes it has some future consumer winners in home facsimile equipment and cas sette‐type color television tape recorders. Relations between Matsu shita's management and its 45,000 workers are unusually good, even for Japan, where a company is regarded as one big, happy family. Every morning and evening, before and after work, all employes hold meetings of their departments to recite the “seven spirits” of com pany and to sing the com pany song, which goes: the It may sound unsophis ticated and perhaps a bit amusing. But who laughs at 11 per cent profits on sales of $1.7‐billion?

1402-> Albany Bill to Save 14 Periled Species Gets Support Here
State legislators and wild life experts met here yester day in support of a bill de signed to protect 14 endan gered species and to wipe out the sales of skins of exotic animals in Manhat tan—the fashion center of the United States. The legislation would ban the sale of objects made from the hides of leopards, snow leopards, clouded leopards, tigers, cheetahs, al ligators, caymans, crocodiles, vicuñas, red wolves, polar bears, cougars, jaguars, oce lots and margays. It is the first time that an endangered‐species bill has specifically named a broad spectrum list of animals that scientists believe are on the way to becoming extinct. Speaking at a champagne and‐sandwich news confer ence at the National Audu bon Society at 1130 Fifth Avenue, William G. Conway, director of the New York Zoological Society, noted that New York was the major American market for these skins. Dr. Richard C. Van Gelder, chairman of the department of mamma??gy at the Amer ican Museum of Natural His tory, noted that the profit motive—in the bush as well as in the market place—was a major cause of wildlife ex tinction. “In the Amazon Basin area in South America where I recently visited,” he said, “a man can support his family for six months by the sale of a single jaguar skin.” The sponsor of the bill is Assemblyman Edwyn E. Ma son, chairman of the Commit tee on Agriculture. He said at the news conference that another previously introduced wildlife conservative bill left the species to be banned to future determination.

1403-> Episcopal Seminary Cut Set as Funds and Rolls Lag
The Episcopal Church, on the recommendation of its Board for Theological Education, is going to reduce the num ber of its seminaries from the present 11 to five or fewer because of a lack of funds and small enrollments. The recommendation was disclosed yesterday by the Rev. Almus M. Thorp Sr., executive director of the board, in a sermon at St. James' Church, Madison Avenue and 71st Street. In an interview later, Mr. Thorp said the seminaries had been apprised of the board's ac tion, their administrations were aware of the problem, and they had promised to act jointly and “with dispatch” in carrying out the board's proposal. Mr. Thorp said the problem of enrollment was not so much one of decrease over the years as of “too few seminarians in too many schools.” He esti mated that in the last decade the number of students had re mained fairly static, at about 1,000, as had church member ship. The number of semin aries also remained constant. There are about three million Episcopalians in the nation. The crux of the matter, he emphasized, is a lack of money. Without a cutback and without substantial financial help from the man in the pew, Mr. Thorp told worshipers, the church's ministerial training program would face “educational sui cide.” In his sermon, Mr. Thorp said the largest seminary had 200 students and the smallest, 32. All 11 of the seminaries, he said, are reduced to “begging for money” on a stated Sunday once a year “simply to keep their doors open.” He said the Episcopal Church was “almost alone” among major Christian bodies in this situation. “Virtually none of the money you and I give through our regular weekly offering envel opes goes to support our theol oical schools,” he declared. Even this present Victorian means of support—this once‐a year begging operation—is fail ing. The Theological Education Sunday offerings last year were diminished by 5 per cent over those of the year before that; the same was true two years ao and the same will be true this year, I suspect. If my arithmetic is correct, a three‐ year loss of 15 per cent is in dicated.” Mr. Thorp reported that seminary endowments (about $45‐million) remained nearly static; gifts from individuals and foundations were invari ably the same, while giving to the national church had been off about 6 per cent during the last year. He said the annual cost of student to the institution was $6.000 and will go to over $10, 000 in just five years.” Every dean and trustee,” he commented, lives daily with the thought that in each of the decades since 1940, institution al costs have doubled, that pre sent costs and deficits will con tinue to mount, that deserved increases for faculty salaries may have to he indefinitely deferred, and most dangerous of all, that there is little or no chance to fashion creative new forms of education demanded by the world of the seventies.” The nine‐member Board for Theological Education, headed by the Right Rev. Frederick J. Warnecke, Bishop of the Dio cese of Bethlehem, Pa., was formed as the result of a recom mendation to the church's 1967 triennial general convention by the Nathan M. Pusey Commit tee's study on theological edu cation. The committee was set up by the Episcopal Church Foundation, a national organi zation of laymen that supports the work of the church. Turning to broader church problems in his sermon, Mr. Thorp noted that half of the 7,600 Episcopal parishes and missions had total annual budg ets of $22,000 and fewer than 200 communicants, and that the average cash salary for an Epis copal priest “in this affluent age” is $6,500. The church's 11 accredited seminaries are General, in New York City; Berkeley Divinity School in New Haven; Bexley Hall in Rochester, N. Y.; the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif. Also the Divinity School of the Episcopal Church in Phila delphia; the Episcopal Theologi cal School in Cambridge, Mass.; the Episcopal Theological Semi nary of the Southwest in Austin, Tex; Nashotah House in Nasho tah, Wis.; the Episcopal Theo logical Seminary in Virginia (Alexandria); the School of Theology of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn., and Seabury‐Western Theologi cal Seminary in Evanston, Ill. Mr. Thorp said that Episco palians had more seminaries per capita than other Protestant bodies because “we're about 50 years behind.” Bexley Hall has the smallest enrollment, with 32. General and the seminary in Virginia both have about 200 each. Roman Catholic seminaries are overhauling their training programs to combat decreasing enrollments, The Associated Press reported yesterday, yesterday. The Rev. Louis Putz, of Moreau Seminary in South Bend, Ind., said in an interview there that the church's minor seminaries were gradually being eliminated. Those schools have enrolled students of high school age and kept them through college and often for additional years of seminary. The emphasis now, Father Putz said, is to attract college students who will receive master's degree in theology on completion of four years of seminary study. Moreau is a major seminary founded by the Holy Cross order, which established the University of Notre Dame 128 years ago.

1405-> An Executive Bursting With Designs
“It's a good thing it doesn't snow in the summer because I'd be hard‐pressed to decide whether to go skiing or sail ing.” Coming from one of the nation's leading yacht de signers and general manager of one of the largest builders of fiberglass sailboats and vice president of its parent company and a recently named director of the National Association of En gine and Boat Manufacturers, it calls for some expination. Bill Shaw, the wearer of all these wet hats, is a vibrant, active, witty naval architect built on the order of a fire plug . . . or, in the jargon of his profession, “with a low center of buoyancy and a high ballast ratio.” Since he took over as gen eral manager of Pearson Yachts in Portsmouth, R.I., four years ago, his designs and administrative acumen have produced two big divi dends—success for his com pany and, for him, a vice presidency of Grumman Allied Industries, Inc., a sub sidiary of Grumman Corpora tion of Bethpage, L. I. It should come as no sur prise that, as a boy, Shaw's first sailboat design finished out its days as a powerboat. After that, young Shaw whetted his boating appetite as launch boy at the nearby Rhode Island Yacht Club. Shaw entered the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point in 1944, and while there he played trumpet as the leader of a 20‐man or chestra and helped organize the school's first intercollegi ate sidling team. Following graduation in 1947, Shaw skippered a tug boat on Long Island Sound, then spent some time design ing textile machinery before entering the Navy as naviga tor aboard an attack trans port during the Korean War. Upon leaving the Navy, Shaw joined Sparkman & Stephens and nine years later he was the head of its yacht design section. During this time Shaw “moonlighted” as designer, crusader and organizer for frustrated small‐boat sailors who were barred from long distance ocean races because rules precluded boats of less than 30 feet. He and a friend, Steve Corkery, found ed the Midget Ocean Racing Club (MORC) and drew up the rating rules, safety re quirements, design and han dicap formula. Shaw is no novice on the racing course. He has com peted successfully numerous times in all of the major ocean races, and this past season, his Pearson 33 placed second by a very small mar gin in the Narragansett Bay Yachting Association stand ings. George H. Page, president and a director of Marmac Products, Inc., Cleveland, manufacturer of marine ca bles and controls, has been elected a director of the Na tional Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers. Page has been chairman of the Board of Governors of the Accessory Division of the N.A.E.B.M. and has served as a member of the Govern ment Relations and Member shit Committees.

1406-> 4‐Nation Geneva Group Guides the Negotiations
GENEVA, Sept. 11—Repre sentatives of four of the five countries most vitally con cerned in the crisis over plane hijacking—Switzerland, Britain, the United States and West Germany—are meeting in Berne to direct the negotiations for the release of hostages. The Berne group, with Pierre Graber, the Swiss Foreign Min ister, presiding, confers at least, once a day to appraise latest) reports. Mr. Graber then sends instructions in the name of all to the Geneva headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross, an all‐Swiss group, which is acting as inter mediary between the four coun tries and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which seized the aircraft. The instructions are for warded by a special Red Cross radio circuit to Andre Rochat, the Red Cross negotiator, in Amman. Reports from Mr. Rochat, with the Berne group's comments and recommenda tions, are sent to London, Washington and Bonn. Since the International com mittee is acting only as an in termediary, Mr. Rochat, who is its leading expert on Arab af fairs, has no power to nego tiate. His official function is to pass on to the Liberation Front representative in Amman what ever the four countries tell him to say, and vice versa. Most of his reports are reach ing Berne via Geneva, but the radio channel is so crowded that some are transmitted to London by the British Embassy in Amman. The Berne group, which Swiss spokesman has labeled the “international crisis general staff,” was established Monday as soon as Mr. Graber realized that the demands by the Libera tion Front were not confined to the three Arab guerrillas held in Switzerland. The terms in clude the release of three guerrillas imprisoned in West Ger many and a woman held in Britain. Switzerland invited the Unit ed States to join the group as an interested country though the Liberation Front has not addressed any official demands to Washington. One of the three hijacked planes belongs to Trans World Airlines, an Amer ican line, and passengers on it and the others—one Swissair and the other British Over seas Airways Corporation—are American. Israel is a conspicuous ab sentee from the group. Other diplomats have found that ab sende all the more noticeable because the Israelis have par ticipated from the outset in the strategy talks taking place in Washington. According to Swiss Foreign Ministry sources, Israel was not invited when the group was formed. Authoritative sources in the international committee have made it clear that her interests are being protected, in that the release of all the passengers, regard less of nationality, is being demanded. Sources In the State Depart ment indicated yesterday that it had succeeded in persuad ing the Israelis to join the Berne group and a spokesman in Geneva said that Israel had asked the international com mittee to represent her in the negotiations. Reliable sources said, however, that Arye Le vavi, the Israeli Ambassador, had been invited only to the first meeting. The members of the Berne group are: for the United States, Richard D. Vine, dep uty chief of mission at the embassy; for Britain, David T. West, deputy chief of mission at the embassy, and for West Germany, Rupprecht von Kel ler, deputy legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry, and Gunther Schlegelberger, Min ister‐counselor at the embassy.

1407-> But in Elmira, 21,000 of 25,000 Rate CATV a Necessity
ELMIRA, N.Y.—Cable tele vision is as familiar to this city as the clang of church bells on Sunday. Of a pos sible 25,000 household cus tomers, 21,000 pay $4.50 month to be “on the cable.” Subscribers to cable tele vision, which came here in 1955, have a choice of 12 channels. During the foot ball season they can daily among four professional games. On Saturdays they can dip into as many as 20 movies. But without cable television in this hill‐sur rounded city, TV is limiteu to a couple of snow‐flecked, ghost‐congested pictures. The result is that the fin ger‐wide cable has become the common cultural denom inator. It binds rickety homes of the East Side with grandi ose mansions of Strathmont Park. It stretches among telephone poles in posh sub urbia and squalid areas marked for urban renewal. “I'm sure,” says Thelma King, director of the central library, “that cable television, by bringing in so many television stations, has en larged the horizons of many of us here. I know, for in stance, that any time some old movie based on a novel is shown, we get requests for the book for perhaps the first time in years. Still, when my grandchildren be gan singing commercials in stead of reciting poetry, I found it painful.” One of the major argu ments in favor of cable tele vision has been that its mul tiplicity of channels stimu lates original programming on local issues and on edu cational matters that are noncommercial. How has this worked in Elmira, where the cable tele vision company, Elmira Video, has a profitable operation? So far Elmira Video, owned by Teleprompter, which has a franchise in New York City, has limited its pro gramming to giving the time, weather and stack market reports and an occasional blurb for important charity drives. The manager of the company, Donald D. Schil ling, says it will probably be originating programs in the fall, when it plans to move to new quarters. Indirectly, however, the cable has made television more community ‐ conscious. The size of the local audi ence led to the establishment of WENY‐TV, an American Broadcasting Company affili ate, one of whose programs —from 11:30 P.M. to mid night on Sundays—has at tracted considerable atten tion. Known as FOCUS (For Our Christian Understand ing), it is put on by the Rev. Francis W. Park 3d of the First Presbyterian Church and the Rev. Robert Lester of the Park Congregational Church. With invited guests, and an audience throwing ques tions by phone, the program has dealt with such subjects as abortion, narcotics, the news media, pollution, the Vietnam war and racial ten sions. It is unsponsored. The result has been that WSYE, the National Broad casting Company outlet, which was here first, has in creased its own community coverage. Recently it did a show on pollution of the Che mung River, which runs through this city. Another important televi sion by‐product of the cable has been the video programs beamed into the classrooms by the city's Audio Visual TV. Ironically the director of these programs, J. Gerald Loughlin, a former junior high school principal here, who gives courses in tele vision at Elmira College, is a bit miffed at Elmira Video. “It bothers us,” he say: “that cable television keeps using us as an example of what they are doing for the community. We do the work. And what's more, the city pays Elmira Video $5,000 a year for equipment that is far from the best,” Dr. Charles E. Davis. Su perintendent of Schools here, says: “There is no question that these programs are a terrific aid to instruction, if the teacher is properly moti vated and ties them in with the teaching.” In a classroom at the Edge worth public school, 23 sec ond‐graders were being pre pared one morning for one of these television programs, called “Animals That Fly.” Their teacher, Margaret Bourke, asked them to recall the birds they had seen and talked about in a previous session. The children were eager and attentive as they spilled out information about sparrows, pigeons, humming birds, bluebirds, robins, eagles. Then, during the 20‐min ute television program— available to homes, too— they were quite as they lis tened to a teacher on the screen and looked at models of birds and films of birds migrating. Later, in the school's in formation center—it has variety of audio‐visual aids as well as books—a few doz en older children chatted to ward the end of lunch hour. A cluster of half a dozen sixth‐grade boys was asked about the school television program on books. None had read the books discussed on television, and only one said he ever read for pleasure. All agreed they enjoyed the lessons on television. One said: “It's better than read ing books.” The average Elmira view er can see more than video addicts in New York City do. He gets programs of the ma jor networks; offerings of the local outlets for N.B.C. and A.B.C.; the three independ ent stations in New York City—WPIX, WOR‐TV and WNEW‐TV. H also gets the educational programs of the nonprofit stations. WNYC in Syracuse and WSKG in Binghamton. “We probably have more tuner problems in this city than anything else,” says Tom Kelly, manager of one of the two Chemung elec tronics stores here. “The cable killed our antenna business. Once they get ‐on the cable, seems they just can't stop turning the knob.” What will happen to this dial‐turning city when Elmira Video starts originating pro grams in the fall? What will it be able to do without spon sors? Will it be able to get sponsors? Will sponsors pay enough to support original programming? When Elmira Video originates shows, will it force the outlets of N.B.C. and A.B.C. to step up their own local coverage? None of these questions can be answered yet. But meanwhile the fundamental significance of the success of cable television in this city may have been expressed most accurately by Irving Kahn, head of Teleprompter. He said: “Elmira is proof that cable television is the next best thing to a legal narcotic. Once you get on the cable, you never get off.”

1408-> LIVERPOOL UPSET BY WATFORD, 1‐0
LONDON, Feb. 21 (Reuters) — Second ‐ Division Watford broke the First Division's mo nopoly of the last four places in the English Football Asso ciation Cup race today when it beat Liverpool, 1‐0, in the ma jor upset of the sixth‐round quarterfinals. A goal at 63 minutes by Barry Endean before a record Watford crowd of 34,000 shat tered Liverpool's hopes. Wat ford has been near the bottom of the Second Division. The three other quarterfinals went as expected with Leeds United and Chelsea emerging as the strongest contenders for the trophy. Leeds, the reigning English champion, won 2‐0, at Swindon as Allan Clarke scored both goals within two minutes during the first half. Peter Osgood, a star Chelsea forward, netted three goals in a 4‐2 victory, over Second Divi sion Queens Park Rangers. Man chester United, a former Euro pean Cup champion, could man age only a 1‐1 tie at Middles brough. The game will be re played Wednesday. Glasgow Celtic won the big cup battle in Scotland against the Glasgow Rangers in a game marred by brawls among Cath olic and Protestant fans and fistfights among the players. Celtic, the Catholic‐backed team, won 3‐1. The rivals have won the Scottish Cup 39 times between them, but Celtic has had the edge in recent clashes and de feated the Rangers in last sea son's final. Liverpool's hopes of beating Watford dwindled before the kickoff when injuries kept Tommy Smith and Peter Thompson out of the game. ??

1410-> Aquanauts Ready to Start 7‐Month Undersea Study
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, V. I., April 2 — Frigate birds and brown pelicans circled watch fully over Beehive Cove, a se cluded inlet. The water was warm, tranquil and turquoise, with an occasional ripple of navy blue—ideal for the mis sion at hand. At the stern of the Sea Flug, a small pontoon barge of work aday proportions, a ghostly white object on the inlet floor could be seen shimmering through the clear waters. Occasionally, a diver with oxygen tanks strapped to his back would ease himself into the water and guide a cable drawn metal container down to the white object 50 feet below the surface. The divers were making the final deliveries of food and sup plies today to the sea floor laboratory and living quarters of Project Tektite 2. Tomorrow aquanauts are scheduled to begin seven months of oceanographic re search using the laboratory as an underwater base. Four marine scientists and an engineer are set to swim down to the “habitat” to begin the first mission, which is to last 12 days. Sixteen other missions are scheduled to follow—nine at 50 feet and seven at 100‐feet depths in a smaller two‐man vessel called the “minitat.” In all, 62 scientist‐aquanauts, engineers and doctors will par ticipate in the $2‐million proj ect. Five women scientists will form one team in July and a few foreign scientists are also scheduled for diving assign ments. The project's primary goals are observation of marine life in a relatively undisturbed en vironment, collection of data on sea floor ecology, the behav ioral study of men living in confinement under stress and the exposure of a representa tive segment of the marine sci ence community to the advan tages of oceanfloor habitation. “If you wanted to study a forest,” Dr. James W. Miller, the project manager, said in an interview, “you wouldn't want only to fly over it and drop down for 30 minutes a day. You would want to live there, that's the difference be tween Tektite and previous scientific diving experiments.” The site of operations is a cove in the Great Lameshur Bay on the southside of Saint john Island, one of those in The Virgin Islands group. It is the same spot where, last spring, four tektite 1 scien tists spent a record‐breaking two months living and working on the sea floor. Their experiment demon trated the feasibility in scien tific research of saturation div ing. This technique relies on the fact that once the body tis sues become saturated with gases breathed under pressure, the time to remove them during decompression remains the same no matter how much longer the person stays at that pressure. In the habitat, the aqua nauts will breath an at mosphere that is 92 per cent nitrogen and 8 per cent oxy gen. They will be able to work outside the vessel several times a day, using tanks of breathing gases as they swim out several hundred feet laterally to perform experi ments. If they were to swim toward the surface, however, the ni trogen in their blood would expand rapidly and could kill them. When they are ready to end the mission, a decompression chamber will be lowered to them. They will remain in it for nearly a day after it is raised to the surface, waiting as the pressure inside the chamber is gradually reduced to sea level. The first crew members are: William L. High and Alan J. Beardsley of the Interior De partment's Bureau of Commer cial Fisheries; Richard W. Cur ry and Roger J. Dexter, gradu ate students at the University of Miami's Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, and Edward F. Batutis, an engineer with the General Electric Com pany. Their habitat, only slightly modified since Tektite 1, con sists of two 18‐foot‐high steel cylinders, each 12½ feet in diameter. One cylinder houses the crew quarters on the lower deck and the control room above. The other cylinder, which can be reached by a 4½‐foot‐wide tun nel, contains the engine room above and the entrance area below. The habitat is moored on the sandy cove bottom in an area teeming with marine life. Of the 240 identified species of fish there, the most common are blue chromis, parrot fish, angel fish, morasses and barra cuda. While the aquanauts are under water, they will be moni tored constantly by a team of, engineers, doctors, psycholo gists and trained divers. A telephone and television link will be maintained between the habitat and the command post on the land overlooking the cove.

1411-> Europe Awaits Approval Of Lagos on Aid to Biafra
LONDON, Jan. 12 — Govern ments and relief agencies in Europe formulated plans today for aid to Biafran refugees but found themselves unable to move pending word from the Nigerian Government. Appeals were made by Pope Paul VI, President Pompidou and others for the end of blood shed and guarantees for the Ibos, the dominant tribe in de feated Biafra. The Pope sent an emissary to Lagos bearing a personal message for Maj. Gen. Yakubu Gowon, the Nigerian leader. President Pompidou, in a tele gram to U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations, asked all possible steps to “pre serve the existence and future of the lbo population.” Relief agencies, with tons of food and medical supplies at their disposal, were waiting some signal from the Govern ment in Lagos. They are as suming that the Nigerian Red Cross will play the main co ordinating role in relief. The Joint Church Aid Or ganization, representing relief committees of religious denomi nations in 21 countries, said in Stockholm that it had 16 or 17 planes waiting on the Portu guese island of São Tomé for clearance from Nigeria. Pending approval, it said, some of its pilots will try to fly food and other supplies into what remains of Biafra. It re ported that two planes reached Uli last night after two other aircraft turned back because the runway of what had been the main Biafran airstrip was full of holes. The frustration of some relief efforts was illustrated by a British transport plane loaded with medical supplies and still on the ground. Prime Minister Wilson, appearing on television tonight, said it could not take off without Nigerian clearance. Asked why Britain must wait for clearance when the lives of many were in danger, he said the Nigerian Government was busy with the war and “maybe the request for clear ance hasn't got high enough yet.” “We can't hit out blindly,” he added. “We don't want everyone all over the world sending in material in an un coordinated way.” Officials of relief agencies and the British Government ex pressed confidence that the problems of providing aid would be cleared up soon. There are up to 14,000 tons of supplies in Nigeria now, they, said, but the problem of getting it to the starving and the wounded remains. With the Uli airstrip dam aged, the relief organizations said that new routes must be opened up, by the Lagos Gov ernment. Britain is prepared to send army engineers to rebuild roads and bridges if such help is requested. Msgr. Bruce Kent of Caritas, the Roman Catholic organiza tion in Joint Church Aid, said that it was essential for the Nigerians to allow in outside teams. “Frankly I doubt the confidence or capacity of the Nigerian Red Cross to handle the situation on their own,” he added. Marcel Naville, president of the international committee of he Red Cross said in Geneva that thousands of refugees had gone into the bush and that their situation was critical. He advocated “a fre drop” of sup plies at Uli. Officials here believed that Nigeria would wait until the military situation cleared before calling for relief from outside. Even though Biafra has sur rendered, there are serious dan gers to relief workers because of the number of armed men on both sides. Pime Minister Wilson said he was sending Lord Hunt, who led the British conquest of Mount Everest, to Nigeria to study re lief needs. If General Gowon agrees, Lord Hunt said, he will fly to Nigeria on Wednesday. By ALFRED FRIENDLY Jr. Special to The New York Times ROME, Jan. 12—Pope Paul VI acknowledged today that the Nigerian authorities had prom ised to respect the human rights of their apparently defeated Biafran adversaries but he warned, as he did yesterday, against further bloodshed. He also sent a message to the Ni gerian chief of state, General Gowon. While the Pontiff was ex pressing his hopes and fears to a reception for the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, the Nigerian Ambassador to Italy, John M. Garba, said at a news conference that his Gov ernment had no intention of carrying out “reprisals or geno cide” against secessionist Ibo civilians. The Pope had reported that many feared “a sort of genocide” in the wake of the Nigerian victory. Mr. Garba said his statement was “partly an answer to the Holy Father” and generally an effort to quiet all fears on the subject. He added that the “most urgent problem now is how to get relief on an urgent basis to needy civilians” in the war zone. Nigeria “would welcome help from all her friends in the task of rehabilitation and reconstruct tion,” he said. The Pope said the Vatican was ready to put all the means at its disposal to work for re lief of civilian suffering. It was announced that Msgr. Jean Rodhain, president of Caritas International, the re lief agency active in supplying food and medicine to Biafra, would visit the Vatican tomor row en route from Paris to Lagos. In his remarks the Pope ap pealed “to all men of good faith to attempt the impossible in order to avoid having the Ni gerian conflict, which seems to be moving toward its end, be come a frightful tragedy finish ing with an epilogue even more cruel than the horror that every war brings.” He took note of Nigeria's promises to respect Ibo rights and lives and of Nigeria's bring ing in international observers to watch the conduct of her troops. “This represents a good omen and a happy promise,” Pope Paul said. “Let history tomor row bear witness to the mag nanimity of all those who have taken part in these, decisive events.” Dispatch of The Times, London COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Jan. 12—Two Joint Church Aid aircraft flew 20 tons of sup plies into Uli late yesterday, some hours after three other flights had been forced to re turn to São Tomé with their cargo. Pastor Diggo Mollerup, who is secretary general of the Danish church organization that is directing the interdenomina tional Joint Church Aid airlift, said here that another attempt to fly to Uli would be made despite reports that the air strip was in the hands of Gov ernment forces. The crews of the two aircraft reported that the airstrip was badly damaged by shelling and that the landing has been ex tremely difficult. Other routes are being studied, but the Uli strip still appeared to be the most suitable. Joint Church Aid said that the two aircraft that landed yesterday carried 20 tons of medicine and hospital equip ment. According to reports from São Tomé all the people sent to Biafra by the World Council of Churches were evacuated Saturday with almost all Red Cross staff and about 24 from Caritas. Officials from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are to meet here tomorrow to examine possibilities for a com bined Nordic aid project. GENEVA, Jan. 12 (Reuters)— President Nixon's special co ordinator on Nigerian relief said tonight that continued fighting in Nigeria would considerably endanger international relief. C. Clyde Ferguson Jr., who held talks here yesterday and today with the Red Cross and other relief organizations spoke at a news conference. Lagos Ousts British Officer For Article on War Plans LAGOS, Nigeria, Jan. 12 (Reuters) —Col. Robert Scott, defense adviser to the British High Commission in Lagos, has been expelled from Nigeria, the Nigerian radio said tonight. A statement over the state controlled radio network said the colonel had been given 24 hours to leave the country. The Nigerian move came within 48 hours of publication in The Sunday Telegraph of London of a confidential report on the Nigerian civil war said to have been written by Colonel Scott. According to The Sunday Telegraph the report contained secret battle orders for Nigerian troops in their offensive against Biafra. Liberian Urges O.A.U.to Help MONROVIA, Liberia, Jan. 12 (Agence France‐Presse) —Presi dent William V. S. Tubman of Liberia today proposed that members of the Organization of African Unity help the Lagos Government in its tasks of re settling victims of the Nigerian civil war.

1413-> Hello Rise Wins Juvenile Stakes
The 94th running of the Juvenile yesterday showed two 4‐to‐5 favorites on the betting board in quick succession, but neither was able to make his way to the winner's circle. Just before the 5½‐furlong sprint for 2‐year‐olds was scheduled to start the October House Farm's Executioner, bet into 4‐to‐5 favoritism by the 22,104 customers, threw his rider, Jacinto Vasquez, and ran so fast and so far that he had to be scratched. With the revision of the fig ures on the tote board, C. V. Whitney's Lone Cowboy was moved into the favorite's spot among the five contestants that remained. This son of Tudor Minstrel had the riding serv ices of Eddie Belmonte, a factor that is generally on the plus side. In this instance, Belmonte had trouble controlling his mount and crossed the finish line in second place, trailing Helio Rise by a neck. The lat ter, ridden by Chuck Baltazar, was timed in 1:05 2–5 and paid $7.60 for $2. Helio Rise, a Kentucky ‐ bred son of Hill Prince, earned $23,667 of the gross purse of $35,950. Lone Cowboy was not per mitted to retain the runner‐up spot, for Rudy Turcotte, the rider of the third‐place Three Martinis, claimed interference on the turn and the stewards agreed with him, placing the Whitney color‐bearer third. This turn of affairs could have an influence on the Bel mont Stakes on Saturday, as Belmonte is scheduled to ride Mrs. Ethel D. Jacobs's Person ality, the favorite as an entry with High Echelon, in the Test of the Champion. The stewards will re‐examine the moving pictures this morn ing and make their decision forthwith, as to whether Bel monte will be permitted to ride in the Belmont. John Jacobs vanned Person ality and High Echelon to Bel mont Park from Aqueduct in the morning. “I decided to van them for a couple of reasons,” said Jacobs. “One was the traf fic problem on Belmont day. I just didn't want to worry about that. And then, too, it could be very warm on Saturday and I didn't want the horses to be restless on the day of the race.” Jacobs said that both horses were in “perfect shape” and that he would have them do nothing more than gallop be fore the 1½‐mile Belmont Stakes. The long‐range odds on the race rate Raymond Curtis's My Dad George the second choice. His trainer, Frank (Buddy) McManus, sent My Dad George through a mile workout on the main Belmont track in the morning in 1:37 4–5. Nine are expected to com pete in the Belmont Stakes, with the outside chance that the list will go to 11. The other reasonably certain starters are the Dansar Stable's Delaware Chief, El Peco Ranch's Aggres sively, Thomas Fleming's Needles N. Pens, the Bookmeade Stable's Climber, the Briardale Farm's Stop Time and Law rence Boyce's Hark the Lark. Possible additions are Naskra of the Her‐Jac Stable and W. P. Rosso's Son Excellence. The names of the participants will go into the entry box tomor row.

1414-> Rams Triumph, 83‐67
The chant of “Digger, Digger, Digger” rang out in Columbia's University gymnasium last night, a tribute to Dick (Digger) Phelps, who has brought new life to Fordham basketball. The Fordham students had another evening of good cheer as the Rams swept to their fifth straight victory of the season, this one a convincing 83‐67 triumph over Columbia. A pressing defense through out most of the game was the key to Fordham's victory, a tactic that forced the Lions into numerous mistakes in the first half. The Lions, upset by the tight, play of the Rams, showed their inexperience as they turned they ball over 15 times. Even the Rams, usually so sure‐handed, lost the ball 11 times in their haste to blunt Columbia's at tack. Rams Lead at Half Fordham led, 43‐35, at the half. But Columbia steadied in its ball‐handling while the Rams suddenly lost their shooting ability. The Lions closed to within 3 points twice in less than five minutes. Fordham went a little more than four minutes without scoring during the Lions’ rally. That was Columbia's closest thrust. Ken Charles and his teammates went to work then, ripped off 9 successive points near the midmark and another string of 8 to run, their margin to 22 points. Charles, a tremendous Jump shooter from the side, led Fordham's charge with 21 points, 15 of them over the final 20 minutes. Charlie Yel verton hit for 10 in the first half to keep Fordham comfort ably in front and finished with 18 points. The Rams, though shorter, won the board battle, collecting 33 rebounds to Columbia's 25. Columbia got a 20‐point ef fort from Foley Jones, the sophomore center, and a 15 point effort from another soph omore forward, Bob Evans. The victory was the 27th for Fordham against 22 losses in a city rivalry that began in the 1907‐08 season. Hunter Stays Unbeaten Unbeaten Hunter College cruised to an 82‐64 victory over visiting Kings Point in a Knick erbocker Conferecne game last night for its sixth straight.

1417-> Paris: A Study in State‐Controlled Art
PARIS—Question: What do a porcelain ostrich, a foam rubber chair and an abstract tapestry have in common? Answer: All three were not only made in France but also made by France. They are products of the Ma nufacture Nationale des Gobe lins, the Mobilier National and the Manu facture Nationale de Sevres, per haps the oldest state‐owned ar tistic enterprises in the world. No two media could be further apart than wool and china, yet their identical official origin lends them similarities that pro vide illuminating insights in to the virtues and drawbacks of state control over art. One towering virtue is at once apparent: Neither Gobe lins nor Sevres would exist without state protection. In the age of computers, handi crafts such as weaving and ceramics are hopelessly un competitive. Moreover, because of the high standard of quality they set for themselves—around the globe, Gobelins has come to mean tapestry and Sevres to stand for porcelain—they are even more uncompetitive than their rivals in this limited field. A weaver at the Gobelins for instance, weaves an average of one to two‐and‐a‐half square yards a year; as a result, a “Gobe lins” may easily cost $2,000 a square yard. At Sevres, a plate with a simple flower motif requires 10 hours of decoration work: It will cost $80 or more. Actually, the question of productivity is purely aca demic, for the law forbids Gobelins to sell its creations. They remain state property and are used to adorn the buildings. Sevres may sell—and does. Of the 4,000 plates, 2,000 biscuits (white porcelain sculptures) manufactured yearly, one fourth are sold to the public. The vogue of biscuits, once enormous ‐around 1900, every well to‐do girl would receive a copy of a coy “Psyche” as a wedding gift—has declined, but there still remains a de mand for their sentimental poses or rhetorical posturing —especially in Italy. On the other hand, the legendary blue and gold Sevres plate continues to function, from Tulsa to Teheran, as a sta tus symbol as magic as the mink coat. • SEVRES thus could easily sell all its chinaware. However, it may not, for its chief function is to equip the tables of French ministries and embassies. It is also the prime source of gifts to offi cial visitors from abroad. Queen Victoria, for instance, was presented with a life size porcelain reproduction of a Ruysdael landscape. However, official taste around the world has im proved of late, and the com pany no longer finds it easy to give away its surplus of pseudo‐Etruscan vases and groups of piping shepherds: Today politicians and poten tates want bleu de Sevres chinaware—the one item the company could sell easily. Unsuspecting chiefs of state often express the desire to be presented with Gobelins tap estries. Rather than disap pointing their important iosts, French authorities have been known to purchase specimens from antiques dealers, at prohibitive prices. Gobelins and Sevres, which were founded respectively by Louis XIV (in 1667) and Ma dame de Pompadour (about 1750) have been in the red ever since they began—so much so that Louis XIV, to lure skilled weavers to his factory, had to grant them the license to brew and to sell beer on the side. Pomp and luxury are natural props of monarchic majesty. What is more surprising is that in stead of closing down the royal companies, the repub lic kept them going—as if to demonstrate that deficit spending was not the prerog ative of kings and emperors, a modest deficit, to be sure, since the budget of Sèvres, with its staff of 200, amounts to 3 per cent of that of the currently much‐debated Paris éra. More important is the fas cination exerted by stable in stitutions on passing regimes. States love symbols of con servatism, and there could be no more striking one than the Gobelins or Sevres. The best tapestries were woven, the best porcelains baked in the early years of these compa nies Successive generations of weavers and ceramists sought merely to preserve the level of perfection attained at the outset. The tech niques of tapestry‐making have not changed in three centuries. They are still weaving 18th‐century models at Gobelins, just as they con tinue to produce 18th‐century vases and figurines at Sevres. The Golden Age of the com panies lies in the past: little wonder that the state has al ways preferred to patronize them than more revolution minded forms of art, such as painting and sculpture. The trouble lies precisely here. Tapestry and porce lain are both the product of a collaboration between artisan and artist. The former's skills remain constant, the latter's inspiration varies with the ages. As long as real artists were called upon to work at the factories, tap estry and porcelain re mained alive. And this sit uation prevailed until the 19th century. • AT that time, a seemingly fatal decline began. The cause? Art, with Courbet and Manet, had split into two sec tors: “official” and “avant garde.” The state had to choose between them for its commissions. It did not hesi tate: Until after World War II, major artists practically never passed the gates of the companies. The committees that doled out commissions were as nat urally attracted to medioc rity as metal to a magnet. Only the craftsmen of the companies loved the new state of affairs: They had been turned into fonction naires; and they soon dis played the vices inherent in tenure; self‐complacency and somnolence. In their eyes, it was their own technical vir tuosity that “made” a work by Gobelins or Sèvres. Pag aninis feel better when there Mozarts around. To revive the companies the thing most needed was to lead living artists back to them. This has been happen ing since the late 1950's. Miró, Vieira da Silva, Vasa rely, Riopelle—a score of others have been woven at Gobelins. By opening itself again to the Impact of mod ern art. Gobelins has broken out of the cultural ghetto in which it had been imprisoned for 150 years. Sevres is like wise undergoing a thorough blood transfusion. It has, in recent years, created vases by the late Jean Arp and Hajdu, chinaware by Polia koff, Mathieu, Sonia Delau nay. It has even dared to introduce an elephant into the porcelain shop—or rather an ostrich (housing a por table bar in its belly), con ceived by the husband‐and wife team of Lalanne. This renaissance, signifi cantly, was made possible by a return to personal power, for the prestige of Andre Malraux, the former Minister of Culture, amounted in the eyes of the Gaullist bureau crats to a kind of divine right. Perhaps the most sur prising of the renovations and innovations that oc curred under his reign was the mutation at the Mobilier National. The Mobilier Na tional's function since its in ception, which took place at the same time as that of Gobelins, has been to pro vide furniture for France's public buildings. Three or four years ago, the company's director de cided that it was time to put the skills of his cabinetmak ers at the disposal of other styles than Louis XV, Louis XVI or Empire. It was ridicu lous to fill the modern build ings erected to house the new prefectures and embas sies with pseudo‐antique fur niture. He therefore took four young craftsmen and placed them at the disposal of young designers from the outside. • T first, the designers were reluctant to collaborate: “official” is a bad word in French art circles. Now the most talented French design ers, Olivier Mourgue, Roger Tallon, Pierre Guariche, Pierre Paulin (whose chairs were exhibited not long ago at the Museum of Modern Art in New Xork), are working for the Atelier de Creation at the Mobilier National. Said the director: “We gave them what industry could not pro vide, total freedom, time and materials to play with, and expert craftsmanship to back them up!” The result is paradoxical: A new furniture style has at last emerged in France within the precincts of its most con servative institution, thanks to the protection of the state. It has made the workshop known and given it greater ambitions. It now plans to design schools, hospitals, apartment buildings as well as all their contents and to prove that beauty need not be opposed to mass produc tion and low prices. Some of the nation's rep resentatives, however, may not agree. They do not feel they are in power unless they are sitting behind an Empire desk. There is no telling what would have hap pened to the fragile infant workshop had not President Georges Pompidou, an art lover of distinctly avant garde bent, recently visited it and publicly declared: “I find the idea excellent. There is no reason to leave the monop oly of research and crea tion to others. I shall ap peal to your services to fur nish the Elysée.” The moral of the story is perhaps not so unedifying after all: Whether on the level of creation or on that of consumption, art is a mat ter of individuals, not insti tutions.

1418-> GOLDBERG TO SEEK THE GOVERNORSHIP
Arthur J. Goldberg an nounced yesterday that he was a candidate for Governor. The former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court and representative at the United Nations said the “para mount and urgent importance” of state issues had forced him to seek the nomination for the governorship. Mr. Goldberg—who had said several times in the last three months that he would not run for public office—has been meeting with Democratic party leaders, who argued that he would be the party's most at tractive candidate and could win the Democratic state com mittee's endorsement before the June 23 primary election. He has also decided to seek the Liberal party's nomination, although Alex Rose, that party's dominant figure, canceled meeting with Mr. Goldberg on Wednesday night. Mr. Rose later told friends that he did not want the meeting to be interpreted as a sign that he was “a sponsor of Goldberg.” The Democratic state commit tee will meet April 1 and 2 to nominate statewide candidates. Those nominated will automat ically appear on the party's primary ballot, along with any candidates who win 25 per cent of any ballot at the committee meeting. Mr. Goldberg became a candi date as he lunched at the Unit ed Nations with a friend, inter rupting the meal three times to take telephone calls from po litical leaders who had advised him to run. Two of the calls were from Stephen E. Smith, an in‐law of the Kennedy family, and Meade H. Esposito, Brooklyn Demo cratic leader. At the same time, the Erie County Democratic chairman, Joseph F. Crangle, telephoned Paul Buiar and Associates, public‐relations agency, and asked them to release a state ment to the press anouncing Mr. Goldberg's candidacy. The presence of Mr. Smith, Mr. Crangle and other regular Democrats around Mr. Goldberg in recent weeks prompted the New Democratic Coalition, the party's largest liberal group, to attack the announcement as “a carefully orchestrated effort by discredited party bosses.” The new candidate refused to speak to reporters after the statement was issued, but scheduled a news conference for today. Last December, Mr. Goldberg issued a statement saying: “I have decided against being a candidate for Governor or Sen ator ... This decision is final and not subject to change.” Since then he has several times repeated that he would not seek office. The four other Democratic candidates for Governor reacted to the Goldberg announcement by asserting that they “were in the race to stay.” But supporters of Mr. Gold berg advised him that he would probably have to face only two men in the primary— Howard J. Samuels and Nassau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson. Estimates circulated by Mr. Smith and others indicate Mr. Goldberg winning at least 50 per cent of the state committee votes on April 1 to about 25 per cent for Mr. Nickerson, 20 per cent for Mr. Samuels and the rest for Queens District At torney Thomas J. Mackell and William vanden Heuvel, with most going to Mr. Mackell. Those estimates—they give Mr. Goldberg a substantial ma jority of the committee votes from New York City and Buf falo—are not seriously dis puted by anti‐Goldberg politi cians. They would also seem to make academic his state ment yesterday that he would run in the primary “if a ma jority of the delegates at the state Democratic committee chooses to designate me as a candidate.” Under the state's new pri mary law, each party's offi cially designated candidate will appear on the ballot along with any candidate who gets 25 per cent of the committee vote. Other candidates may get on the ballot by collecting the signatures of 10,000 enrolled party members, with at least 50 signatures from 47 of the state's 62 counties. Mr. Goldberg has also told friends that he wants and ex pects the Liberal party nomina tion on April 4. Mr. Goldberg, a former coun sel to the United Steelworkers of America, and Mr. Rose, pres ident of the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers Union, have been friends for 30 years, but recent political events have created friction be tween them. Mr. Rose has told other Lib eral leaders that he is “very disturbed” by Mr. Goldberg's relationship with Mr. Crangle, Mr. Esposito, Assembly Minor ity Leader Stanley Steingut and other regular Democrats. According to informed sources, Mr. Rose canceled the meeting that had been sched uled for Wednesday because he did not want to appear to be a co‐sponsor of the Goldberg candidacy and felt he was “be ing used.” Mr. Goldberg has told friends he probably offended the Lib erals by not consulting Mr. Rose, but is said to have added: “I have known Alex for a long time and he has to come along eventually.” The candidate, who is 61 years old, has been mentioned repeatedly as a candidate for state office since he resigned his post at the United Nations in 1968. Speculation grew last October when his supporters commissioned a poll that indi cated he was the most for midable Democratic candidate against either Governor Rocke feller or Senator Charles E. Goodell. Last December, after being criticized by a few liberal Demo crats for his association with President Johnson's policy on Vietnam, Mr. Goldberg an nounced his withdrawal as candidate. But some party leaders, particularly Mr. Crangle, continued to urge him to run and he was soon meet ing with potential supporters. But until yesterday, when he was asked about the implica tions of his private political activity, he always replied by repeating his “final” decision of Dec. 9. The new announcement com pletely changes the picture for the Democratic primary elec tion, in the opinion of most Democratic politicians. They expect the period until the party committee meets to be filled with speculation about Mr. Goldberg's choice of run ning mates for Lieutenant Gov ernor and Attorney General— positions that some leaders would like to see taken by some of the current governorship candidates, particularly Mr. Nickerson for Lieutenant Gov ernor. In light of speculation con cerning my position relative to becoming a candidate for Governor of New York, I wish to make the following state ment: My personal inclination has been not to run for any elective office after almost 10 years of arduous public service. But I have become increasingly convinced, how ever, that the issues at stake in the New York State elec tion this year are of para mount and urgent importance both for the state and the nation, and that I should not in good conscience stand aside from dealing with them in the most effective way. In the last several weeks, I have been urged by an in creasing number of citizens both within and outside the Democratic party, sharing this concern, to reconsider my position with regard to the gubernatorial race. In light of these considera tions, if a majority of the delegates at the State Demo cratic Committee choose to designate me as a candidate I am ready to make the race and leave to the voters in both the primary and general elections the decision as to which candidate can best unify the Democratic and progressive forces essential to mount a successful cam paign and to govern the state effectively.

1419-> Letters to the Editor of The Times
Support for Judiciary To the Editor: In their memorandum re ported in The Times of March 3 the members of the Black Panthers indicted for conspiracy to dynamite police stations and department stores and now awaiting trial before Justice John M. Murtagh assert various constitutional claims. These in chide the right to lower bail and a grand jury differently constituted. They also express a revolutionary defiance of the judicial system and its authority to determine their guilt or inno cence The only answer of the whole community to this rejection of judicial authority must be com plete support for that authority. It may not be enough for the courts to understand that they have the silent support of the overwhelming majority on this issue. Constitutional law experts have already expressed approv al of Justice Murtagh's decision not to proceed with the trial until orderly conduct in the courtroom by the defendants is assured. Civic associations generally, and, bar associations in partic ular, without in any way pass ing on the constitutional claims on the guilt or innocence of the accused, should make it clear to the defendants and the pub lic generally that public order requires support and vindica tion of judicial authority. In our democratic system the courts are relied upon to defend and to protect individual con stitutional rights against the exercise of excessive govern mental authority. The whole system of protection of individ ual rights depends upon an independent judiciary. The time has come to express support for it. EDWARD J. ENNIS New York, March 3, 1970 The writer is a lawyer special izing in civil liberty cases. Action on Degree To the Editor: In June 1964, I received with no small pride an honorary degree from the University of California, one of the great uni versities in the United States. It is an honor I should have been happy to have shared with Mayor John Lindsay. As of the last week, however, the unprecedented refusal of the University Regents to grant such a degree to Mayor Lind say, the April 2 Charter Day speaker, has made future hon orary degrees contingent upon a kind of political imprimatur. Those who feel the University is threatened by violence must in fairness concede that it Is also endangered by partisan ship. ARJAY MILLER Dean, Stanford University Graduate School of Business Stanford, Calif., Feb. 25, 1970 Basis for Chau Arrest To the Editor: Your March 1 editorial con cerning the Chau affair states that “the Saigon Government has taken a tardy first step to ward reversing a dangerously arbitrary action with its deci sion to order a new trial for a neutralist legislator....” You state that “it remains highly doutbful whether the opposition leader Tran Ngog Chau should ever have been brought to trial in the first place.” You also assert that the Thieu regime “engineered” the Houst petition on the basis of which Mr. Chau's legislative immunity was taken away. You refer to some unidentified “others” who hold “that the Constitution re quires an actual vote in the House to lift the immunity of members from prosecution.” There is nothing in the Con stitution, or for that matter in the debates in the Constituent Assembly which led to drafting of the pertinent articles of the Constitution, to support this view expressed by “others.” The Constitution contains the usual guarantees of parliamen tary immunities. According to Article 37, Section (1), “Repre sentatives or Senators cannot be prosecuted, pursued, arrested or judged for any statement or vote in the National Assembly.” It must be noted, however, that Mr. Chau was not arrested for anything which he said in the National Assembly. You question the “legitimacy” of the House petition which led to the removal of Mr. Chau. Per haps it would be appropriate to quote the pertinent provisions of the Constitution. Article 38 reads as follows: “(1) In cases of treason or other serious crimes, Repre sentatives or Senators may be removed from office by the house concerned. “(2) Removal from office must be proposed by two‐thirds of the total number of Repre sentatives or Senators. “(3) The resolution to remove a member from office must be approved by three‐quarters of the total number of Representa tives or Senators. “(4) The Representative or Senator concerned has the right to defend himself in debate during all phases of the removal procedure.” GISBERT H. FLANZ New York, March 2, 1970 The writer served as Senior Consultant to the Minister of Justice of Vietnam in 1967. To Aid Public Schools To the Editor: In response to the Feb. 26 letter from Daniel U. Hanrahan on the repeal of the “Blaine Amendment” and his question — “If [the parochial schools have to close], what will be the financial Impact on our public schools?” I suggest their finan cial condition will improve. When education budgets are being debated in Albany, those with children in private schools lack the motive to act for the betterment of public schools. Indeed, their own self‐interest would demand that they oppose higher school budgets. With this politically powerful class of citizens absenting itself from the debate (if indeed not actually opposing decent school budgets), no wonder that edu cators find Albany's actions questionable. I would encourage Mr. Han rahan to join his fellow citizens by placing his children in pub lic schools and fighting for de cent school budgets. It is as simple as that. Finally, the parents of pa rochial school children may feel that “they have subsidized the public school system for a long time,” but they never have. Arn I subsidizing the prison system because I do not avail myself of its facilities? If every citizen concerns him: self with School problems, we can get not only adequate budgets but better curricula, teachers, programs, etc. as well as some movement towards a solution of the drug problem. [Editorial Feb. 12.] GEORGE F. NOLAN St. Albans, N. Y., Feb. 26, 1970 Control on Money Flow To the Editor: Your hasty indictment or international business and worldwide communications as the natural parents of crime and immorality (editorial Feb, 25) must not stand unan, swered. To bankers (a group unsur passed for honesty in the presence of temptation) the controls you endorse are just as abhorrent as are the recent Federal demands that your rep porters surrender their note books for the sake of law enforcement.

At the conclusion of his great es say on “Poetry and Abstract Thought,” the French poet Paul Valéry summons the reader to con sider the extraordinary labor that must be invested in the making of a single poem: “Think of everything that must go on inside a man who utters the smallest intelligible sen tence,” Valéry writes, “and then cal culate all that is needed for a poem by Keats or Baudelaire to be formed on an empty page in front of the poet.” There are many ways of arriving at such a calculation, of course, and the great edifices of es thetic theory, linguistic analysis, critical discourse, and literary history all testify—often eloquently—to the prodigious effort man has made to understand the nature of his own sublime utterances. Yet it is remarkable how little of this effort has been closely con cerned with what, in a purely physi cal sense, “must go on inside a man” who writes a poem—or indeed, with what goes on inside the man who reads it. In assigning poetry a high place in the hierarchy of culture— the cultures of the past, anyway, if not our own—and in ascribing the loftiest of spiritual motives to the po etic function, we have tended to overlook the role of poetry, and of all artistic enterprise, as a coeffi cient of man's physiological destiny. The importance of Stanley Burn shaw's “The Seamless Web” lies pre cisely in its attempt to establish what the author, himself a poet and anthologist of some distinction, calls a “creature definition” of poetry and its function—in effect, to answer Valéry's appeal by writing a natural history of the poetic process. The re sult is an ambitious and provocative book that brings together an amaz ing quantity of both scientific and literary intelligence in order to illu minate the exact nature of “the language‐thinking of poetry . . . a unique phenomenon issuing from a unique physiology which seems to function no differently from that of other animals—in a life‐sustaining activity based on continuous inter change between organism and envi ronments.” For Mr. Burnshaw, then, “Poetry begins with the body and ends with the body.” Like language itself, po etry is a natural function of the human species, but it differs from other modes of “language ‐ thinking” insofar as it requires “the fullness of the mind's capacities” to realize it self. Mr. Burnshaw is very far from wishing to establish any facile sepa ration between the workings of the poetic mind and its scientific coun terpart. In fact, some of his most engrossing pages are devoted to the feat of imagination — the ability of the mind to enjoy “the freedom of all its processes”—which true scientific discovery demands of its practition ers. Yet, though Mr. Burnshaw hesi tates to underscore the point, there is a difference, if not in the imagi native workings of the scientific and the poetic mind, then most certainly in the results which they achieve. For whereas the results of scien tific discovery belong, ineluctably, to the realm of culture, poetry — and this is Mr. Burnshaw's most provoca tive point — belongs to the revolt against culture. Although “poetry is unthinkable apart from the culture” which spawns it, “The very life breath of a culture hangs on its pow er to restrain, whereas art bursts forth with opposing power to express all that men know‐and‐feel with ‘the fervent emotions of the mind.’” Mr. Burnshaw is both adamant and persuasive in rejecting the notion that “poetry and culture are at one; which is to say that poetry issues from capacities which are the prod uct of social evolution exclusively.” He locates the poetic function instead among “certain outcomes of the clash between natural selection and social evolution” — a clash that has pre served “man's innermost tendencies to fight whatever threatens to stifle his spontaneous responses.” The poetic impulse is indeed, in Mr. Burnshaw's view, a form of ex alted and compensatory “regression.” “To flee, to escape—this is the in herent direction of the creative imag ination; all other considerations are secondary: the specific world it breaks from or the specific newfound land it chooses. Forest primeval — even air‐conditioned pleasure ‐ dome, if its winds are not winds that sti fle . . . Whatever the terms of the battlecry, [poets] celebrate acts of defense. They proclaim what poetry must oppose, what it saves itself from.” But what is it that the poet aspires to in this revolt against the fetters of culture? In Mr. Burnshaw's view, it is nothing less than the “drive to regain ... his primary organic unity with the rest of creation: his ‘seam lessness’” “For the poem as a whole and in its units is, above all, an act of uniting,” Mr. Burnshaw writes. “And to respond by experiencing its act of uniting is to relive, for the duration and with the whole of one's being, an indefinable sense of organ ic creature unity such as pervaded our creature‐existence when it ‘knew’ itself part of the seamless web of creation.” This is an audacious thesis, and Mr. Burnshaw argues it with a won derfully painstaking attention not only to the inner workings of the poet's mind but to the most work aday details of the craft of poetry. Everything that goes into the mak ing of a poem, from the most spon taneous intuitions to the rigors of conscious artistry, is illuminated as a function of the maker's physiologi cal destiny. The nature of metaphor, the significance of metrical form, the meaning of “obscurity,” even the re lation of criticism to the proper apprehension of a poet's words — these and many other aspects of the poetic enterprise are accorded their rightful place in the imaginative proc ess. For this is very much a poet's book, very much at home with the greatest achievements of the poetic mind, yet written by a poet for whom “words are also biology.” It is also a very optimistic book— possibly too optimistic. In affirming the primacy of the poetic instinct in man, Mr. Burnshaw does for poetry what Herbert Marcuse attempted to do for the sexual instinct in “Eros and Civilization.” Though completely unpolitical, “The Seamless Web” cer tainly belongs to the growing body of literature that seeks to uphold the rights of instinct over the exigencies of our technological culture. But Mr. Burnshaw himself shies away from considering what, if any, price — what physiological price—the poetic vocation exacts under the pressures of modern culture. Madness, violence, early death— the whole scenario of the is, if not exactly an entirely modern phenomenon, certainly a well‐established feature of modern life. It was no Iess a poet than Baudelaire who left us a record of dour observations on the adverse effect of poetry on the uninhibited exercise of the sexual instinct. Is the toll of mental and physical wreck age which the poetic vocation has so often left in its wake not to be weighed in a final accounting of poetry as a mode of biological action? Is there, perhaps, a point in the development of a culture where the function of poetry itself is sub verted to serve precisely the “power to restrain”? But these are questions with which Mr. Burnshaw does not concern himself here. Still, he has written a book of far reaching importance — a defense of poetry that removes it from the realm of man's spiritual luxuries and places it pre‐eminently among his instru ments of survival. ■

1421-> LUGGAGE SEARCHES SET FOR 33 AIRPORTS
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 (AP) —Customs agents will begin within the week to search all hand luggage carried by pas sengers boarding international flights at the nation's 33 “gate way” airports, the Treasury De partment said today. The program, designed to thwart potential hijackers has already begun at John F. Ken nedy International Airport in New York, Dulles International Airport near Washington and New Orleans International Air port, the department said. About 10 airports will be added Saturday, with the oth ers to follow next week, a Treasury official said. He would not specify which airports will begin the program on what days

1422-> Barnard Mourns a Heroin Victim
Two weeks ago, a bright, pretty Barnard freshman named Antoinette Dishman joined other black militants in a de monstration to force St. Luke'S Hospital to open a progra n for teen‐aged heroin addicts. Saturday morning, in a smai apartment in a rundown ares of the Bronx, Antoinette Dish man died after inhaling an over dose of heroin. She was 17 years old. Yesterday, Barnard mournec the loss of a model student. Or the seventh floor of Hewitt Hall, where Miss Dishman lived with 27 other black freshmen, her friends were shocked. As far as anyone knew, Miss Dishman had had no involve ment with drugs—not even marijuana smoking—up to the time of her death. “It's terrifying,” said one classmate. “She didn't deserve that. Because we're black, we all know about heroin and its dangers and just because of this knowledge I always thought we were protected from it. It's not as if we're some white girl sniffing for the first time out of ignorance.” Dr. Martha E. Peterson, the president of the women's col lege at 116th Street and Broad way, said: “The entire Barnard community is saddened by Toni Dishman's tragic death. “She was esteemed by all who had come to know her during her one semester at the college. The needless waste of a young life concerns us all, both youth and adults. It should lead us to a redoubling of our efforts to understand the dangers of drugs and the need to control their use.” “Other girls,” a classmate said yesterday, “used to say they wanted to try this or try that, but Toni never did. I hon estly don't think she was that interested at all in drugs.” “She was a very lovely young lady, a superb student,” said Theodore H. Lewis, the principal of Harlan High School in Chicago, from which Miss Dishman graduated last June ranked second in a class of more than 500. “If you told me that she was involved with drugs I'd say you had to be out of your mind.” At the high school on the South Side, she was known as a bright, articulate girl with happy family background, member of the student council, the band, the honor society, the newspaper. “She had everything going for her—brains, attractiveness, leadership,” Mr. Lewis said. “She was A‐1 material. If she were a boy, you'd have to say that in 10 years she was going to be at the very top.” At Barnard, she fit quickly into its black militant society and BOSS—the Black Organi zation of Soul Sisters. “All the parties we go to are black parties,” said one of Miss Dishman's close friends. “Our lives are black. Some people call us militant; we call our selves nationalist. All the guys we date are black. Me, I've never had any social contact with whites. To me, Harlem is like home.” “She used to know how to handle people,” a friend said of Miss Dishman's relations with whites. “She never misplaced her hostility. She was rather friendly with some white peo ple, but she preferred to be with blacks as we all do.” The girl and her friends lived outside the white world of Bar nard and neighbdring Columbia. “This school is one of the last bastions of everything that's proper,” said a classmate. “But I don't think we black students are as threatened by the Barnard‐Columbia thing as the white kids. To us it's just an extension of the Establish ment, and we've been fighting that all our lives.” Miss Dishman took courses in chemistry, English, Russian, calculus and biology, and was doing well in them. Friends said that when she came to Barnard she tended toward the tomboy, playing basketball and talking about sports. Under the teasing of her companions on the seventh floor through the fall and win ter, she became, in the words of one, “an elegant, chic young woman.” Her hair was cut in the Afro style and she wore bell‐bottom slacks and mod clothes. “She was really happy be cause she was becoming sexy and she was becoming a part of our floor,” a friend said. “Her world was getting bigger.” Miss Dishman, who turned 17 last fall, was the youngest girl on her floor and one of the youngest at the college. Her companions, in the words of one, considered her “our baby.” While going nut with her new friends and dating fre quently, she also kept close touch with home. She received food packages from her mother and talked often about her brothers and sisters. About 11 P.M. Friday, Miss Dishman and a group of friends went to a party near the cam pus. Those who attended re fused to discuss it yesterday after consulting a lawyer. But one girl who heard about it said, “It was so crowded and there were so many drugs around they were afraid there would he a bust.” Students yesterday said it, was rare for anyone at Bar nard or Columbia to become in volved with heroin, although the use of marijuana was com mon. “I know there's marnuana and hash [hashish, a marijuana derivative all around,” said girl on Miss Dishman's floor, “but the hardest thing I ever heard of people taking is coke [cocaine]. Nobody takes heroin, even at offcampus parties.” The only recorded case of heroin use at Barnard or Co lumbia in recent years occurred in June, 1968, when two Co lumbia freshmen were suspend ed after being charged with using the drug. Last March, Fairleigh S. Dickinson 3d died in a Columbia dormitory after taking a combination of opium and LSD. Miss Dishman and her friends returned from the party about 3 A.M. She left again soon afterward to go to the Bronx apartment of some youths she had met that evening. One of Miss Dishman's friends told the police later that three couples made up the party at 1205 College Avenue, near 167th Street in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. The apart ment, occupied by two college students, is in an area some where between slum and mid dle‐class. The friend said the couples danced and talked until 5:30, when they decided to “turn on.” The participants then went to sleep. When they tried to awake Miss Dishman at about 10 A.M., she was dead. The girl showed the common effects of a heroin overdose — froth at the nose and mouth, congestion of the internal or gans, edema of the lungs. “Her lungs were almost like you see in drowning cases,” said Dr. Mil ton Helpern, the Chief Medical Examiner. Miss Dishman's friend called the police when she found she could not awaken the girl. In the apartment, the police found 3 ounces of heroin, en velopes of marijuana and ma terials for diluting heroin in preparation for its sale. They also found a revolver, two rifles and two shotguns. The police arrested the apartment's two occupants— Wayne Brewington, 19, a stu dent at City College, and Reggie Blackwell, 22, a student at Bronx Community College. They were being held in $7,500 bail yesterday. An assistant district attorney said their apartment appeared to be “a regular factory” for drug prep aration. At the building yesterday, teen‐aged girl said the two youths held frequent parties. “I know that Reggie,” the girl said. “He's like, you know, real cool.” The Medical Examiner's of fice said early today that no member of the family had yet appeared to identify the body. Miss Dishrnan's body was taken to the morgue, and her name—as case No. 483—was placed in the register along with the three other people, all under 30, who died of heroin overdoses in the city this week end and the seven who died From causes related to drug use since Friday.

1423-> City's Economy Worsens In 2d Day of Postal Strike
New York's business, industrial and financial commu nities suffered major disruptions yesterday under the in creasingly severe impact of the postal strike. Banks, brokerage houses, big corpo rations and the garment in dustry appeared to be the hardest hit by the walkout. The situation appeared to be deteriorating so rapidly on Wall Street that there were fears that the entire securities industry might have to shut down on Monday if the strike continued. Checks, stock certificates, bonds and other financial paper that, in the mails, represent cash in motion were unavail able to the banks and broker age houses that needed them to complete transactions and clear records for the orderly continu lotion of business. Some brokerage houses, in a move to prevent more serious problems, instructed salesmen to accept only business that they could handle in person. A number of big brokerage houses were shipping securities and vital correspondence by air and truck to branch offices out side the city. Banks, which collect bills for thousands of companies, at tempted to cope with the poten tially dangerous delay of about $300‐million a day in checks sent to them through Post Of fice boxes, although efforts were being made by the Post Office supervisory personnel to process resgistered mail that had been deposited before they strike began. The garment industry faced catastrophic problems as hun dreds of companies—big and small—were threatened with the immediate loss of Easter business because rush orders for merchandise lay buried in the Post Office. A number of concerns that send out mail for other com panies were filling up so many sacks with mail they were run ning short of sacks and were unable to obtain additional ones from the Post Office. Some mail houses were piling up mail in dozens of little stacks on the floor. Other companies, however, found that the strike had af forded them a business bonan za. Traffic at air freight for warders rose sharply, Western Union was swamped with busi ness, but the New York Tele phone Company reported only “above normal” traffic. Em ployment agencies were busy supplying extra help—particu larly runners and messengers —to thousands of companies delivering mail within the city and elsewhere. And to complicate the situ ation, the Commerce and In dustry Association, situated in the Dun & Bradstreet Building at 99 Church Street here, had to evacuate its offices twice yesterday because of bomb threats. Many companies used their ingenuity to make the best of a bad situation. Universal Publishing and Dis tributing Corporation, publish er of Golf and Ski magazines, shipped urgent material by air express to plants in Ohio and Illinois. Mutual of Omaha, the insur ance company, also used air express to ship benefit checks from its headquarters in Ne braska to policyholders in New York, for personal delivery by its local office force here. Burnham & Co., the broker age house, sent couriers in lim ousines to a branch in Phila delphia, carrying orders, stock certificates and other urgent mail. The New York Stock Ex change, moving to head off rumors of a shutdown, said that “after a careful review” it had “no present plan to alter es tablished market hours.” The board of governors, which held its normal Thurs day meeting said that the ex change was “following the sit uation closely and will decide as developments occur whether any changes are required.” Thus, the exchange left open the possibility that it might close down at a later date. The American Stock Ex change said after its regular Thursday board meeting that “no decision” had been taken about closing on Monday, but that the exchange would “watch the situation as it goes along.” In Washington, the National Association of Securities Deal ers, the self‐regulatory agency of the over‐the‐counter market, said that it also had made no decision to close down, but that “anything was possible.” An official said the situation would be reviewed again on Monday. The Chase Manhattan Bank turned to truckers and air freight forwarders to deliver mail to undisclosed cities out side New York. It acted in secrecy partly to protect valu able cargo. Some banks also began phon ing select lists of customers that they could go on writing checks with the assurance that they would be honored—even though funds were short. These were generally cases where em ployers normally mail payroll checks directly to workers' bank accounts. Some of the tied‐up mail is retrievable, in the sense that companies may not in the long run suffer severe financial losses. But the possibility that the temporary loss of business might become permanent losse looms large for some concerns Thomas Peacock, a partner in the law firm of Kramer, Lowen stein Nesson & Kamin, said the, strike “has practically brought, my business to a standstill.” A leading millinery chain, Ogus Rabinovich & Ogus, Inc., New York, said it “lived by the mails” and with Easter coming up it was trying to get orders placed from its 300 leased departments throughout the country. And, like many companies that pay workers from central offices, Ogus said “a lot of our people won't get paid this week because checks go out from New York.” The New York Department of Insurance ruled that to safe guard the rights of millions of policyholders in New York de lays in paying premiums could not be used by insurers as grounds to cancel policies. The Institute of Life Insurance is sued a similar statement. A spokesman for the Insti tute of Life Insurance said there was no fiscal emergency for the insurance companies them selves because of unreceived checks in the mail. “They [the insurance companies] know they're going to get paid even tually,” he said. To reassure bank depositors, the American Bankers Associa tion said that any penalties for late payments would be dealt with on an individual basis. The strike also resulted yes terday in the preparation of bill to be introduced in the Legislature to declare a “public holiday on business obligations dependent on the mails, unless alternate means are arranged between both parties.” The bill will he introduced by Assemblyman Peter A. A. Berle, son of Adolph A. Berle, assist ant Secretary of State under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Assemblyman Stephen J. So larz, political science teacher at Brooklyn College.

1424-> Mrs. Luis A. Ferre, Wife Of Puerto Rico's Governor
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, March 5—Mrs. Luis A. Ferre, wife of the Governor of Puerto Rico, died this afternoon of a heart condition, which had kept her largely bed‐ridden for the last decade. She was 64 years old. Mrs. Ferre, the former Loren cita Ramirez de Arellano, was the first of 10 children of a prominent family here. After graduating from the University of Puerto Rico, she was mar ried to Mr. Feud in 1931 when he returned from studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began to work in his father's iron foundry. After Mr. Ferre became Gov ernor in January, 1959, his wife was only partially able to ful fill the duties as Puerto Rico's First Lady due to her illness. A son, Antonio Luis, also sur vives.

1425-> CONFEREES EASE INTEGRATION CURB
WASHINGTON, March 19— Senate‐House conferees agreed tonight on a $23‐billion educa tion bill after watering down an amendment on national school desegregation policy added to it by Senator John C. Stennis, Democrat of Missis sippi. The measure extends major educational programs, includ ing the Elementary and Sec ondary Education Act, for three years, to 1973. It goes far beyond President Nixon's recommendations. The compromise $23‐billion version compares with a $35‐ billion, four‐year bill passed last month by the Senate and a $12.7‐billion, two‐year bill cleared by the House in April last year. The biggest fight in the con ference involved the Stennis amendment, which seeks to re quire the Federal Government to move as vigorously against segregated schools in the North as it has in the South. The conferees adopted the main provision of the amend ment, which states that Federal school desegregation policies shall be applied uniformly in all sections of the nation regard less of whether the segregation is de jure (imposed by law) or de facto (caused by residential patterns). However, the conferees added two provisos that had the ef fect of weakening the thrust desired by the amendments of Southern sponsors. One of these provisos said that uniformity meant one policy applied to de jure segre gation wherever it was found and “such other policy” as may be provided by law dealing with de facto segregation. The‐second proviso said that nothing in the amendment should diminish the obligation of officials to enforce Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which requires cutting off Fed eral funds to areas where segre gation is practiced. Civil rights advocates on the conference committee were pleased with the outcome. They said it had clearly been the hope of the Southerners that the Stennis amendment would slow down the push to fiend school segregation in the South and divert some of the Federal effort to de facto segregation in the North. The provisos added in the conference make it clear that there should be no slowdown, they declared. Senator Clairborne Pell, Dem ocrat of Rhode Island, head of the Senate conferees, said he was sure that Senator Stennis would fight the compromise bill in the Senate “because he made it clear to me he would oppose any change in his amendment.” Senator Pell said he hoped Senator Stennis would feel that the essence of his proposal had been retained. Senator Pell said that “over all. I think we have an excellent bill on which we have worked very hard, and I am hopeful the Senate will agree.” Representative Carl D. Per kins, Kentucky Democrat, head of the House delegation, said his body “certainly will approve this bill.” “This is one of the most im portant education bills in the history of the United States,” he declared. “It will give great stability and force to the Ele mentary and Secondary Educa tion Act.”

1426-> LIMIT IN DRAFT CALL EXPECTED TO BE 215
WASHINGTON, March 5, (AP)—The lottery to determine the order for men to be drafted in 1971 is expected, to be held early in July. Selective Service headquarters notified the draft boards today. At the same time, the boards were told it did not appear that they would have to dip any deeper than. No. 215 into the prime draft pool this year. The boards were directed to arrange for phyiscal and train ability tests for men classified 1‐A and conscientious objectors classified 1‐AO and 1‐0, in order of their call‐up numbers from 1 through 215. In addition, examinations are to be given those with num bers 1 through 215 who are expected to lose their defer ments in the next six months, such as college students who will graduate in June. A selec tive Service offical said ex amination would probably be arrapged on weeeltrids for those in college so as not to interfere with classes.

1428-> 200 STUDENTS SIT IN AT WASHINGTON HIGH
For the fourth straight, day, classes were disrupted at George Washington High School yesterday as nearly 200, students held a sit‐in in the school lobby in behalf of set ting up a parent‐manned griev ance table in the school. The parents who would man the table in the Washington Heights school planned to hear student complaints. On Wednesday, before the school was shut for the day because of disruptions, the act ing principal, Louis Simon, an nounced over the school loud speaker system that a plan for a parent ‐ manned grievance table had been approved. The table had been sched uled td be set up yesterday. But a number of parents charged that on Wednesday afternoon Mr. Simon attached conditions to allowing the table. One such condition, they said, was that the teachers be allowed to choose the parents who would sit at the table. The parents apparently de cided to ignore this condition, and yesterday morning they arrived at the school, ready to set up their table. They found the school ringed by police men; with other policemen on apartment roofs across from the school and still others patroling to school corridors. All adults but school staff members were banned from entering the school. Many of the school's 4,000 students did go to class yester day, but they spent much of the time hanging out of the windows watching the police and demonstrating students, who were chanting and sing ing songs in the front yard.

1429-> A Crusader Aiding Addicts
Dr. Judianne Densen‐Gerber, a feisty, 35‐year old crusader, has been dealing with drug addicts long enough to be confident about her answers. As executive‐director of Odys sey Houses, the private drug care centers that never turn a child away, she spends her days and nights caring for ad dicts and raising money to house and feed them. Q. What leads a child to drugs? A. Adult models he doesn't respect. Q. What leads a child away from drugs? A. Adult models he does re spect. “We've had fads such as the Beatles and Sinatra and short skirts,” she said. Unfor tunately, drugs are a life threatening fad, and the fad has to be turned around. “We have to turn ourselves around as well. The children are reaping our sins as adults —our cynicism, apathy and lack of concern for our broth ers. Our sin is the tribal feel ing that the only people we care about are from Bushwick or East Harlem, or blacks or whites, or gentiles or Jews. “The drug problem is ev erywhere. It's in Harlem, it's in Jersey, it's in Florida, it's in Colorado, It's in families with six‐figure incomes, it's in families where the parents are on welfare, it's in fam ilies where the parents are lawyers and doctors, it's in families where both parents are addicts.” 100,000 by Summer “I'm against the attitude that if you ignore a problem it'll go away,” she went on. “It won't. It'll get worse. By this summer, at the present rate, there will be 100,000 children in New York City on heroin.” “The narcotics problem will never be solved if we insist on putting it in the hands of lawyers only;” said Dr. Densen‐Gerber, who is both lawyer and psychiatrist. “What lawyers know is an adversary system, and what they can deal with is crime. The problem, however, is ill ness, and it needs the atten tion of doctors. They accept the fact that their enemy is nature, that their adversary is death. “Lawyers have a different concept of urgency than doc tors. The lawyers would call me from Albany to assure me that the Legislature was dis cussing measures to help ad dicts, and that the laws would be passed in six months. But the addicts may, be dead in six months. “You can't feed people retroactively. You can't cure people retroactively. Try res urrecting a child who dies from sniffing heroin. Let the legislator explain to par ents burying their child that he was discussing a solu tion. Since I first approached legislators in Albany on Aug. 16 we've had over 300 deaths.” At a press conference at Odyssey House headquar ters, 311 East Sixth Street, this week, she turned to a group of six Odyssey House adolescents, chosen at ran dom, and asked “How many of you sold drugs?” Every child raised his hand. “These are the push ers,” she said—to suggest that the problem should not be dealt with by sending sick, bewildered youngsters to jail. “I have no problem as a mother looking at these chil dren and considering that if these were my children ‘ would consider it an illness, not a crime,” she said. “We don't have to fight the chil dren, we have to work with them. The family can do a great deal before the children get involved in drug use— exploring attitudes, actions, and goals.” Softness for Children “My Achilles heel is chil dren,” she said in an inter view. “If a patient wants to get around me all he has to do is talk about children. The pictures of the starving children in Biafra hit me like a ton of bricks. Immediately I was out to charter a plane to bring food to them. couldn't understand that we would have wheat stored and for political reasons couldn't send it to Biafra. Neither could my children. “There's no reason for our children to be dying. There's no enemy except ourselves.” Assertive dedication comes naturally to Dr. Densen‐Ger ber. Her mother, Beatrice Densen, believes so firmly in women's rights that she has kept her maiden name; Mr. Gerber introduces his wife as “Miss Densen.” When a daughter was born, both pa rents were given their due, and she was registered as Judianne Densen‐Gerber. Mr. Gerber, a chemical en gineer, became a lawyer in his forties, and almost start ed studying medicine in his sixties. Miss Densen is a law yer. “We haVen't been ‘Yeshiva buchers’ [Talmud scholars, eternally studying],” their daughter said. “We've put out education to use.” Miss Densen and Mr. Ger ber persuaded their daughter to study law before support ing her through medical school. She went to Colum bia University Law School, married a doctor, and missed her first bar exam because her first child was born on exam day. She then attended New York University Medical School, and every time there was a national boards exam she was pregnant again. After psychiatric residency at Bellevue and Metropolitan hospitals, she lectured at a number of universities on both medicine and law. Dr. Densen‐Gerber (whose husband, Dr. Michael Baden, is the city's associate medi cal examiner) became inter ested in medicine because she had been seriously ill in childhood and wanted to help others to live. ‘During her sixth preg nancy (she has children of 10, 6, and 4; a retarded child died, and she has had two miscarriages), she routinely asked for another leave of absence from Metropolitan Hospital, and the director suggested instead that she work an hour or two a day with addicts. “From the very beginning I enjoyed them as people,” she said. “They were verbal —they communicated. It isn't often in life that one can help people to live, anti these people are walking dead. “If I hadn't bedia ill, I wouldn't have studied medi cine and been so anxious to pack two or three lives into one. If I hadn't studied medi cine I would have gotten in terested in addicts. If I hadn't gotten interested in addicts. I wouldn't be as disheartened or frightened for the city and the nation. “I think our leaders are men of small faith. I can't believe it's just stupidity its malevolence; They think di vide and conquer. But whom are they dividing? Its their own people.” She was recently called abrasive. “Abrasive but hon est,” she insisted. Her abra siveness is usually directed at politicians — who have made her life and work dif ficult since the beginning. Politicians Assailed “Politics is a problem be cause governments — city, state and federal—are more concerned with being right than with being useful,” she maintained. “Once they seize an idea they'll stick to it no matter how wrong it is, and no matter how much harm it does. The result is that they have overwhelming commit ments to failure. “I don't know how our politicians can live with them selves or respect themselves. At the end of a day I like myself because I've done the best I know how. Do you think our politicians Elie themselves? How can they live with themselves when they're not responsible to other people. “The people should begin to insist that politicians be responsible. The people should refuse to let the parties pick candidates who have no prin ciples. Politicians should mow their communities and walk among their people. I've asked Lindsay to walk among my children, and I'm still waiting for him. ‘It's not enough to talk the talk; you have to walk the walk.” Stretching as it does from one difficult moment to the next, the road can be pain ful Dr. Densen‐Gerber's principal problem is fund raising. In 1966 her initial Odyssey capital was $3.82. Now, with 135 youngsters under 17 to care for, and 150 more over that age (the average age is 21), the yearly budget is $1.4‐million — of which half is donations. “There have been times when we've eaten a lot ol rice and spaghetti,” she said, “but we've always eaten.” Some Parents Pay Parents of children at an Odyssey House may contrib ute to the cost, but—to avoid favoritism—Odyssey does not tell its staff which children are „ beg supported. “No child should have to pay for his parents’ indifference or poverty,” said Dr. Densen Gerber. Odyssey began with ad dicts who wanted to cure themselves of addiction with out using other drugs to do so. Before Dr. Densen Gerber found a home for them, they slept in 11 tem porary shelters—whence the name “Odyssey.” Today Odyssey has seven perma nent centers and requests for help from groups in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Utah, Virginia, Arizona and Michigan wanting to set up local Odysseys. “The patients benefit from seeing the concern and dedi cation and exhaustion of those who are trying to help them,” said Dr. Denser Gerber. “It's directed con cern, not jive do‐gooding. “My rewards come front the patients, not froM deal ing with nonpatients.

1430-> The Radicalizing of a Guest Teacher at Berkeley
ISPENT last winter at the University of California at Berkeley. I'd been invited by the English Department to teach some writing courses during the winter quarter to group of students almost all of whom were work ing for teacher's credentials. I lived in the faculty club on campus and was therefore very close to, though not very actively involved in, the student strike and the uprisings and riots that followed it. Very soon after the strike—it was really a boycott, but since students everywhere call this kind of operation a strike, I will use that word—my students and I decided to move our classes off campus, not so much because we strongly or actively supported the strike but because we did rot want to appear to be opposing it or flaunting it. Also, some of my students were very strongly in sup port of the strike and to continue to meet on campus would have made it impossible for them to go on attending the class, which they very much wanted to do. When the strike began, I was more irritated than sympathetic. One day the black students announced a set of “final demands”; a day or two later they announced the beginning of the strike. I was walking toward Wheeler Hall, where the department office was, and first saw pickets—not many of them—in front of some of the doors. Instantly I felt myself put in a difficult position and resented it. I have long since lost any feeling I might have had about the sanctity of picket lines. Still, it seemed to me that I was being asked either to join the picket lines or consider myself an ally of the university, Governor Reagan, and all they stood for. I found myself thinking angrily that, ordinarily, before a union calls a strike it gives its membership a chance to hear, discuss, and vote on the issues. I had been given no such chance; indeed, I found out after a while that the strike leaders had deliberately decided not to present a referendum on their demands to the university community, sure that it would have been decisively outvoted. At that time, this made me angry. It does not any more. Immediately my students, themselves holding many different views, asked me what I thought about the strike, and in our discussion of these matters I got a good deal of education myself. I began by saying that there was much in the demands of the Third World students that I sympathized with; that I thought some of their demands had consequences which they had not really considered; that I resented being told that I must actively support a strike when I had nothing to say either about calling it or about the terms under which it was called. I also felt that, by the way in which they called the strike and by the violence—not very extensive, but real enough—which the strikers used against people and property in the early days of the strike, they were hurting their cause. It had seemed to me that the strikers were using or trying to use me and other members of the university community as hostages, perhaps as some kind of collective battering ram against the university administration, and I resented this. I found myself thinking wryly that it was easy from a distance to feel sympathetic to the rebels at Columbia who had seized buildings. But when I was compelled—against my will and at a time when I felt that I had other things to think about—to make hard decisions about whose side I was on. I did not like it much, and felt it an imposition and injustice. THIS was my position in late January when the strike began. By the middle of March, when my classes came to an end, and everyone agreed to cool the strike until the end of exams and the beginning of the spring term, my opinions on all of these matters had changed. I found myself agreeing very strongly with virtually everything that the Third World group was demanding, and, what is more important, feeling not only that their tactics had been wise and effective, but that virtually no other options had been open to them. It seemed unarguably clear that only by taking action as they did could they have persuaded not only the university administration but the faculty and the student body at large to take their problems seriously and put them in the center of their consciousness — where indeed they rightly belong. It seemed to me clear, from the way in which the univer sity spoke and acted during the crisis, that it had not dealt in the past and would not in rthe future deal seriously or honestly with the Third World students, unless compelled to by the kind of action they took. In short, it seems to me that when universities say to students, “It is wrong and foolish of you to try to get us to discuss these issues and make what you think are necessary changes by making trouble; the thing to do is sit down and discuss this quietly and rationally,” they are either deceiving themselves or lying outright. I may be wrong about this, but I don't think I am. I don't mean to argue the point here. What seems to me significant is that the events themselves that took place on the cam pus during the seven or eight weeks‐in question changed my mind, and the minds of a con siderable number of other faculty members and a large part of the student body. In short, it is the way in which the university dealt with the strike, far more than anything that the strikers said or did, that convinced large numbers of people who had initially been unsympathetic that the strikers were right or, per haps, that the university was wrong. TACTICALLY, the university made serious mistakes. It brought police on the campus before it needed to. It brought in police over whose actions it had no control, when it might have hired private agents or perhaps even de putized order‐keepers from among its own people. It brought in too many police and kept them around when there was no longer any need for them. It allowed police to use the campus and, far worse, the administration building itself, as a base of operations. It repeated these errors over and over again. Instead of at any moment calling for enough police to deal with whatever situation might be at hand, and then sending them home when the particular situation had been taken care of, it acted as if it felt that the presence of many police on campus would pre vent incidents from occurring. Of course, it did quite the op posite. Moreover, it soon created a situation in which the police and their politically ambitious leaders realized that the campus was a kind of battlefield where they could wage, for private or political reasons, the kind of war against young people which they were glad to wage on any pretext. The university talked as stupidly as it acted. I think that Hayakawa of San Fran cisco State is a bad, ambi tious, and dangerous man, but there was at least some thing refreshing in the honest and sometimes hysterical an ger with which he faced and shouted down his opponents. They must at least have had the feeling that they were talking to a live human being, bad as he might be. The Uni versity of California's pro nouncements on the strike were always written or spoken in a kind of bureaucratese which made one feel that what they were saying must be lies, because if they were telling the truth they wouldn't need or want to talk that way. I think in fact that the university administration was probably more sympathetic to the Third World demands than many of their own fac ulty or than the regents, the Governor, or the people of California. But even when they were telling the truth, they sounded as if they were lying, and as time went on they grew less and less truth ful. It is not just as an Eng lish teacher, a writer, or a lover of the English language that I say that if you want to talk seriously to people who are angry and distrustful, you must speak in the plainest and most direct English pos sible. Academics are so ac customed to use language as a kind of display, lice the tail feathers on a peacock or the stripes on a naval officer's sleeve, that it will be hard for them to learn this lesson. SOMETHING on the order of 90 or 95 per cent of the violence that took place on campus was initiated by the police. We have learned by now, as a result of uncount able experiences in the past few years, that when police stand for long in the presence of people whom they dislike and fear, they cannot be trusted to remain orderly. In deed, it is only rarely, and with the greatest difficulty, that they can be compelled to do so. One of the things a policeman learns very quickly is whom he may safely hit on the head with his stick and whom he may not. Police now recognize that in every part of the country young people, students, hippies, and radicals are the safest targets they have. Any university president who calls police onto his cam pus knows that they will use far more violence against stu dents than the situation de mands, that they will indeed use the situation as a pretext for expressing their own rage, and that their superiors, far from trying to control them in such instances, will encourage them as a way of gaining further political support and power within the community. The way in which these large gatherings became vio lent was usually the same. There would be large num bers of students gathered in the plaza in front of Sproul Hall, the administration build ing. Facing them would be squads of police with blue motorcycle helmets and plas tic visors. At some point the police would begin to make what is usually called “a sweep,” that is, they would move toward and into a large group of people and, at first prodding and pushing with their clubs, try to clear a path. The path might not be needed, they might not in fact be opening the way to any thing; the point was that they were simply getting people out of the way. As long as the crowd was not too thick and there was plenty of room to move in front of them, the crowd would often disperse and re form behind the police. But the police know that large numbers of people do not move very quickly, so even tually they were sure of find ing some people who could not get out of their way fast enough. When this happened, they had the excuse they needed to begin clubbing. No body who saw them on the campus doubted that their in tent was to provoke violence. A rumor, probably well found ed and certainly widely be lieved, was that the number of police on campus grew larger and larger because po licemen were volunteering for this duty. On many occasions the po lice did not even need a pre text to start clubbing people. My office was on the fourth floor of Wheeler Hall and overlooked Sproul Plaza. One day a fellow faculty member and friend was looking down at the scene when he saw, in many parts of the large crowd gathered below, plainclothes policemen suddenly take out blackjacks and begin striking, people standing in front of them. ONE day, one of my stu dents, a very pretty girl from a rich California suburb, said, obviously in a good deal of agitation, that she wanted to speak to me. I said something about office hours on Wednes day and Friday, but she was in a greater hurry than that, so we arranged to meet at lunch. The following day she appeared, still agitated, trem bling uncontrollably, scarcely coherent. She told me in bits and pieces the following story. The papers had for a day or or two been full of reports of the brutal beating by the police of a Los Angeles re porter named Vaughs. While standing, equipped with the proper press credentials, in front of the administration building, he had been sudden ly set upon by four policemen, who clubbed him to the ground and beat him with their clubs as he lay there. Many people—hundreds—saw this. A student was standing not far away. Unable to tole rate any longer what he was seeing, he rushed at the police and tried to push or drag them away from the fallen Vaughs. Suddenly four police men—Pm not sure whether they were the same or differ ent ones—knocked him to the ground and began beating him. One knocked all his front teeth out with a club. After a while they dragged him— blood pouring from his mouth, screaming in mingled pain and terror—into the adminis tration building itself. What I learned from my student was that the student who had been beaten, a friend of hers, was himself not polit ical, and was not involved in the strike, and was not even a supporter of it. I'm not sure why he was there; in any case, he had a right to be. When he was being beaten, she herself was not very far away. She was quite naturally too ter rified to try to help him—bow could she have helped?—and she watched, helpless, as her good friend was dragged away and out of sight into the building. She was shaking as she told me all this. She kept saying, and in the context the words sound ludicrously inadequate, that she felt so frustrated, so frustrated. We are so accus tomed to hearing the word used in trivial contexts that it is easy to forget how accur ately it describes how she must have felt. This was clearly a situation in which something had to be done, yet there was nothing to do. Her friend was down on the ground, being beaten, with every possibility of being very seriously injured, and to whom could she call for help? Where was law and order? Where, in this emer gency, were all the people whom she had grown up be she could depend on? She told me that that night, still in terrible agitation, still looking for help and support and sympathy, she had called up her family. Her father's response to her tale was that if her friend had been minding his own business, nothing would have happened to him. I found myself thinking of Kitty Genovese, murdered— over a period of about half an hour—outside her apart ment in Long Island, while 30 or 40 neighbors, seeing and hearing everything, did noth ing. What torrents of moral indignation have since then been poured over that scene! IN one of my classes an other girl, the daughter of a rich family in a big West Coast city, told me of what might be called her Unsenti mental Education. She had gone, a few years before, to watch a big demonstration at the induction center in Oak land. She did not go as a participant or active support er. She was by no means then convinced of the rightness of the demonstrators' cause or the wisdom of their actions. Why did she go? The question is important. Many of her friends were there; some were quite closely involved; she wanted to see what happened to them; more important, since such demonstrations are a vital part of today's history, she wanted, like any curious and intelligent person, to be present while this particular episode in the drama of his tory was being written. Who, given the opportunity to travel back in time and watch it, would pass up the Boston Tea Party? She was standing in the crowd, not carrying a placard, not obstructing the door, not doing anything. There was confused and violent action, police rushed from all direc tions, and as she put it, the next thing she knew, she was being dragged by her feet down the steps into the base ment of the police station. To day, only a couple of years later, and still in her very early 20's, she is a radical—tough minded, unsentimental, un trusting, unforgiving, utter ly determined to shake to the foundations the existing order of things. THE universities seem gen uinely surprised and puzzled that bringing police on the campus should, as it always does, enormously increase the size and touchiness of student demonstrations, instead of do ing away with them. They ask, like the perplexed father of my student in his comfort able suburb, “Why, when these students know that the police are standing around there just waiting to hit them on the head, do they persist in going where the police are? Why don't they go about their own business quietly, go to classes, do the assignments, take the tests? When being bad brings such swift and hard punishment, why don't they be good?” It is a real question, a seri ous one. When I first came to Berkeley I was not sure myself why the presence of police on campus attracted crowds of students like honey collecting flies. I came to un derstand only gradually. Perhaps I've already sug gested the reasons. The stu dents gather where the police are, first, because their friends are there, because they feel a solidarity with them, be cause they want to see what happens to them and share in it. They have a sense that history is being written at such places, and every whole man wants to be a part of the history of his own times. Also, they go as witnesses. They know that the police can be counted on to lie—and, in general, authority supports their lies—about what hap at these occasions. Thus the University of Cali fornia, after a very consider able amount of police violence, could issue a statement from the Chancellor's office— heaven only knows who writes these statements—that the reports of police violence had not been supported by its own observers, two or three of them, and would in any case be taken‐up and dealt with in the usual way by competent authorities. In other words, if a policeman hits you on the head with his club, report him to police headquarters and they will conduct an official and im partial investigation as a re sult of which the true facts will be made known. This is really what the university said, though not so simply or directly. So the students know that the only way to be sure about what happens on these occasions is to be there. There is more to it than that. I avoided the center of the campus at times of the day when there was likely to be violence. My reason or ex cuse was that I had not really come to the university to take part in such things, that this was not my first interest, that I was not a permanent mem ber of the university com munity, and therefore not committed or involved, and that my first responsibility at least during this quarter was to the students who had signed up for my class. This excuse seemed good enough at the time. At any rate, was able to skirt round the center of the campus when there was trouble, although as it overflowed into the ad joining Berkeley streets it grew harder to get away from it, and on a couple of occa sions I had my first good whiff of the latest model tear gas, which is quite remark able stuff. But as time went on, as the violence mounted, I grew more and more uneasy about staying out of the center of things It was fortunate for me that I was only there for a quarter and that, as the crisis reached its peak, final exams for the quarter came along and everyone agreed to cool things for a while. Had I been there for another month, and had the violence continued to mount, I would have felt more and more strongly that my staying out of it was simply an act of cowardice, that what primar ily moved me was a desire to stay out of trouble, that I was abandoning and betray ing the strikers with whom I was feeling deeper and deep er sympathy. I've often been moved by the old hymn, “Once to every man and na tion/comes the moment to decide/in the strife 'twixt truth and falsehood/for the good or evil side.” Feeling as I did about the crisis, I could find less and less ex cuse for staying away from the action, and I really doubt whether my conscience would have allowed me to take the easy way out much longer. This would have been even more true as more and more of my students got directly involved. To all this, the crackpot realists (as C. Wright Mills called them) will snort that it is always possible to raise the price of public opposition high enough so that people will stop opposing. If the gov ernment, like the Government of Mexico, brings troops with machine guns onto campuses, and orders them to fire at crowds of students that do not disperse, there will be no crowds. It is just a question of raising the ante high enough to make your oppo nent drop out of the game. The argument has a cer tain internal logic. I once read about a general—true, fic tional?—who in an argument said angrily that it was a lot of nonsense that you couldn't kill an idea, all you had to do was to find everybody who believed in that idea and shoot him. It sounds workable, and it is hard to see the flaw in it. It would seem that if you have very much more force at your disposal than your opponent you can eventually raise the ante high enough to make him do your bidding. But this depends on a number of things being true. There's no use saying to someone, “Do what I tell you or I will kill you,” if he would rather be dead than do what you tell him. Nor is there any use if he thinks that, having by the use of this threat made him yield once, you will sim ply use it again and again with no limit. He then feels that since he must resist and die sometime, better to do it sooner than later. What our romantic lovers of violence—General LeMay, Hayakawa, the Pentagon, many university administra tors, some students, and who knows how large a percent age of the American people —forget is that the aim of vio lence, even of war, is recon ciliation, peace, accord. You fight your opponent in order to persuade him to stop fight ing, to win him over to your way of looking at things, to persuade him that whatever state of affairs you have in mind for him is better than the state of affairs he will be in if he resists you. You must, therefore, hold out a tolerable alternative. But this is what our univer sities and our society, in their struggle with the young, quite simply cannot do. They can not say, “Go along with us, do what we say, and we will give you a world to live in which—even if it is not per fect, even if it is not in accord with your hopes and dreams —is at least something.” We cannot say that. We have no alternatives. We offer nothing at all. My sister once wisely said of one of her sons, “He may not know what he wants, but he knows what he can't stand.” To our students and young, who cannot tolerate our society as it is, we only offer more and more of what they can't stand. Bigger, nois ier, dirtier cities, more war, more exploitation, more cor ruption, more cruelty, more ugliness, more depersonaliza tion, and at the end of it, the virtual certainty that if the world is not destroyed by war it will be made uninhabitable by the waste products of an ever larger gross national product. BY making the penalties ever higher, we may be able to prevent certain kinds of opposition and rebellion. But this is folly. What makes us think that we will like better what comes next? We scream in pain and indignation about the students breaking the rules. But really they are sticking quite closely to the rules. When they seize uni versity buildings or march around campuses talking about demands, they are not really imposing ultimata, they are still accepting the idea of the university as a com munity in which problems can be discussed and worked out, with the important dif ference that they want to be in on the discussions and de cisions. It's absolute nonsense to claim that the students are out to destroy the university. Indeed, they love the univer sity—at least in a kind of ideal form which exists most ly in their imaginations and in its own propaganda—in way that the university scarcely loves itself. I met this winter, during my stay in Berkeley, Mario Savio and Michael Rossman, two of the leaders of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley several years ago. What astonished me more than anything else was the degree to which they are frustrated academics. There is nothing that these two young men would really rather be than professors in a university that they could trust and feel proud of. If we convince students, as we may if we send enough of them to jail for long enough, that the university cannot really be dealt with or re formed, that there is no chance of ever getting it to take students seriously, to say nothing of the problems of mankind, then they may seriously think about how to destroy it, and when they do its days are numbered. The fatal flaw in the argu ments of the crackpot realists is that our society is terribly vulnerable to internal attack and disruption. It is a dread ful mistake to take the angry rhetoric of our black power leaders and student radicals for reality. They really have not given up on society; they really are thinking of ways to make it human, decent, vi able—none of which it is right now. Whatever they may say, they are not serious ly thinking about how to bring it down in ruins. This would not be a hard thing to do. I have occasionally played the game of thinking myself into the mind of an angry guerrilla, and the things I can think of in only a short space of time scare me enough so that I don't want to tell any one else about them. If a hundred thousand people—or perhaps even thousand, or a thousand — with determination, knowl edge, and a certain macabre sense of humor were to give their serious attention to making our highly compli cated and vulnerable society grind to a halt, they could urobably do it quite easily. But they would have to be serious—that is to say, they would really have to have given up the hope of making it into a good society. The young people have not given up. If we want them to, all we have to do is raise the stakes high enough. NOT long after arriving at Berkeley, I was invited by a new friend on the faculty to go with him to a noon per formance in the university music theater of Purcell's “Dido and Aeneas.” This was produced, played, sung, and danced entirely by the stu ents. It was a beautiful pro duction, up to the highest professional standards, imagi natively, wittily, and convinc ingly done. I left the hall with my heart swelling and my feet scarcely touching the ground. I looked about the campus, which, particularly in that section, is very beauti ful, with rolling grass and lovely trees, and I had a vision of what that university might be. Seeing the vision, like my friends from the Free Speech Movement, I fell in love with it, and at the same time realized how very far from its promise and potential the university had fallen. I looked about the buildings and the campus and thought what an extraordinary gather ing there was here of human knowledge, skill, and talent. How much the university might be, how close it was even now to being a kind of distillation of everything we mean by civilization in its best sense, a collection of so much of the finest things that men have thought and done. I thought what a lovely thing it would be if we could have, here and in many places, such a gathering of man's finest works, and people who knew them and under stood them and loved them and could use them, a pool of wealth for anyone and every one to dip into as they needed or wanted. How lovely it was too to walk in broad spaces between buildings which if not always handsome were at least not covered by neon signs and constant appeals to people's greed, envy, and fear. I thought of the streets of downtown Berkeley itself, of the people who lived there—and I often thought of this when the police were on campus — and reflected how seldom if ever in their lives they must have had the opportunity even of walking in so spacious and so gra cious a place. Why shouldn't a university be like a park, but a park of the mind and hands and spirit as well as a park in space? Why not a place to stretch and re fresh the soul as well as the legs? And with this thought I became painfully aware, then and for the rest of my stay, of the signs sprinkled all over the campus—“THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF THE REGENTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA” ‐ something full of talk about trespassers be ing prosecuted and so forth. I thought to myself, why should an institution support ed by public funds not be open to the public? By what right is it run like a private club? And I was very painfully reminded, then and later, of the mean‐spirited and bureau cratic way in which the uni versity deals with its own stu dents. Just to read the notices dictated by the university and pinned on its bulletin boards is enough to make the heart sink. Not a speck of grace, wit, or courtesy. Nothing real ly different from what one would expect to find in a large corporation or even the Army itself. I thought of the classes, the assignments, the tests, the threats, the grading, the in vidious comparisons, the set ting of student against stu dent, the treating of knowl edge and skill ‐ like some salable commodity, and for the rest of my visit 1 was hor rified and saddened by the distance between the promise of what the university and all universities might be and what they had become and were. EVEN the minority of adults—and I fear It is a fair ly small one—that does not deeply hate and fear the young, that feels at least somewhat sympathetic and benevolent, finds it hard to understand what they are so angry about. Or, why they are so angry about what they are angry about. Their anger seems disproportionate. Not long ago I thought it was my self. I would like to suggest an experiment, which I do not expect any academician or ad ministrator of any importance to try, but which I urge none theless. Let your hair, if you have that much hair, grow long, or get a reasonably good wig. Put on enough make‐up or disguise or whatever is needed to hide your age and make you look young. Dress in authentic hippie clothes. Get a little scruffy and dirty —it would do no harm to sleep out in the park or some open space the night before attempting this experiment. Then simply walk about, for an hour or so, in the streets of whatever city you live in. Peo ple will look at you. Look at them. What you will see in the faces of a good many of them is the thought, deeply felt and very clearly com municated, “If I could, I would kill you.” This is by no means all of the story. But when you have seen enough of these faces you will realize why it is im possible any longer to say to young people that this is a benevolent or trustworthy or even in any reasonable degree sane society. It really is not reasonable to hate somebody, to the point of quite seriously wanting to see him dead, be cause his hair is long or his clothes are funny. Far from doing anything about it, we adults do not even think about it, or even acknowledge it. We talk, at least to the students, as if this society had nothing much wrong with it, and as if its institutions, used in the pre scribed ways, were perfectly capable of correcting what is wrong. But the students do not find out from S.D.S. alone in what desperate shape our society and civilization find them selves, and how little idea anyone in the older genera tion has of how they may be saved. They find this out in our TV, newspapers, and mass media. Nobody seriously believes that we are likely to solve or are even moving to ward a solution of any of the most urgent problems of our times—war, the proliferation of atomic, chemical, and bac teriological weapons, over population, poverty, the de struction of the earth's nat ural resources, the degrada tion of man's physical and biological environment, the fossilization and depersonal ization of his political and economic institutions, his in creasing alienation, boredom, anger. We do not think any more that we can really make the world a fit and happy and beautiful place for people to live; we scarcely think that we can keep it a place where people can live at all. Only when we talk to students do we talk as if these problems were not real or serious or urgent. Only to the young do we keep saying that daddy knows best. But it is no good; they hear us talking to each other. NOTHING worth saving, or worth having, In the univer sity is seriously threatened by the demands of even the most radical students. Indeed, in their efforts to get agree ment from the university, the Third World people at Berke ley very quickly watered down their original demands to the point where I, for one, felt they were nowhere near radical enough. One of the student demands that most terrified the univer sity, and at first most puzzled and startled me, was the de mand for open admissions. During the strike I thought about this a great deal, and it is worth saying again that it was the fact of the strike, and only that, that made me think about it. In deed, I felt the strike as a kind of pressure on my mind, often an unwanted pressure. I often wished angrily that they would get the thing set tled and over with so I could again think about what I wanted to think about. It was not really until the strike end ed, and even after I left Berkeley altogether that I be gan to realize that what the strikers wanted me to think about were indeed the things that I ought to be thinking about. There is no more crucial question in our society than this question of relationships between the old and the young, between educational institutions and their stu dents, between the people who hold effective power in our society in and out of uni versities and the young peo ple who increasingly demand to be given more and more of it. The revolt of the young, or the battle between young and old (look at it how you will) is the most important question of our time, and on the way we resolve it or fail to resolve it will probably de pend, more than on any other one thing, our society's pros pects for survival. But I was puzzled by the proposal for open admissions. I found myself thinking, if anybody could get into the university, why wouldn't ten thousand, twenty thousand, a hundred thousand people come here, and if they did, what would the university do with them? And I began think ing freshly about a question that people have been asking me many times in my lectur ing on education. Hundreds of teachers and parents have said to me, “If children are educated the way you want, if they can learn whatever they like in the way it seems best to them, how are the col legcs going to solve their ad missions problem?” My answer was usually that I did not consider the solving of the college admissions problem a high‐priority ques tion, for me or even for the elementary or secondary schools of this country. I usually followed this by suggesting one or more ways in which colleges might, by my lights, improve their admis sions procedures so as to make places available to stu dents of a much wider variety of talents and backgrounds. But i accepted almost without realizing it the assumption on the part of my hearers that a college must make decisions about who can come in and who cannot. After all, their facilities are limited, aren't they? They can't take in everyone, can they? Then one day I found my self thinking of the Boston Public Library, which I go to quite often, more to borrow classical records than books. Here is what must certainly be called an educational insti tution. Yet it does not make decisions and judgments about who can come in and who cannot, and—what is more important — who is good enough to come in and who is not. It simply says like libraries everywhere, “Here are some facilities — books, records, films, exhibits. If you want, come in and use them, as much as you want, as long as you want.” I thought of many other educational institutions that serve society, none of which exclude anybody, and it sud denly occurred to me that the admissions problem of our universities is not a real prob lem but a manufactured one —that is, it exists because the universities want it to exist, not because it has to. Why shouldn't a school, college, or university be like a museum, a library, a concert hall, a lecture hall, a sports facility? Why shouldn't it, like them, say to the public, “Here is what we have to offer you; here are the possibilities. If they appeal to you, come in and use them, for as little or as long as you like”? If more people want to get in than there is room far, let them handle this situation the way a concert hall or theater han dles it. Why not hang out a sign saying “Sold Out—next performance tomorrow after noon, next week, next month, next year”? If a student wanted to take a course with Professor So and‐So and there were hun dreds of other students want ing to take the same course, why not let him make the kind of choice that someone makes who wants to see a very popular play? Let him either, in effect, wait until there is an opportunity to get in the course, or, if that seems like too long a wait, think about getting the same sort of information or help some where else. If I want to see a doctor, and someone says that he has so many patients that I won't be able to see him for four months, the sensible thing to do is find some other doctor, maybe not quite as good but with fewer patients. Let the student worry about overcrowding. The university can say, we can provide uni versity housing for so many thousand students; after that, people will have to find their awn. Large numbers of stu dents at Berkeley and other state universities do in fact live off campus. This often makes housing both scarce and expensive, and this may in turn make a student decide that a particular university is or is not a good place to go. But let this be his worry, not the university's. If the hous ing, facilities, and courses at one university are terribly crowded so that desirable courses are hard or impossible to get into—as indeed they are now in many cases at places like Berkeley—the stu dent can decide either to try to wait it out or to go some where else. Nor is there any necessary reason why universities should worry so about qualifications. This will seem startling at first. But after all, when I borrow a book or record from the Boston Public Library, no body gives me a quiz to be sure I will understand it. It's up to me to decide how I want to spend my time and to run the risk of wasting it, Similar ly, if I go to the Boston Sym phony to hear a piece of diffi cult modern music, nobody examines me in the hall to make sure I'm educated enough to appreciate it. I pay my money and I take my choice. If I go home later feel ing angrily that it was a waste of an evening, all right, that's my tough luck. But why should anyone else make this decision for me? IT is perfectly true that uni versities of this kind would be in important ways different from the ones we know to day. The universities as they exist have come to think of themselves as private clubs. They are in a race with each other for prestige, which is quickly translated into money and power — the professor from a prestigious university has more chance of getting a big foundation or government grant than a professor from some less prestigious one. Therefore, they have an inter est in convincing the world that their club is harder to get into than anybody else's. At the same time, they try to convince the oncoming gen erations of students that mem bership in this club will in the long run prove more valuable —again in terms of power and money—than membership in any other. That is what cre ates the admissions problem. I make a great many people think that my club is the one to be in, and then I stand at the door and tell large num bers of them that they aren't good enough to get in. On the other hand, since the Boston Public Library isn't trying to convince people that because it is harder to get in it is a “better” library than the New York Public Library, it doesn't have to urge large numbers of people to come to it because it is the best and then put somebody at the door turning most of these people away because they aren't good enough to get in. The universities that con sider themselves superior have an enormous investment, fi nancial and psychological, in the notion of their own supe riority, and I don't expect them to give it up quickly or lightly. Given its present con cerns, which do not for the most part have much to do with education, I can under stand why the University of California should feel threat ened by the demand of the Third World students that they open their doors to any Third World people who want to come in, and I can under stand their wanting to resist this demand as much as they can. As long as universities are interested in prestige and power, they will want to go on saying to the world that people are coming to them because they are so good, and that they are turning away most of their applicants or supplicants because they in turn are not good enough. But a university truly dedicated to education, to the spreading of knowledge, skill, and— most important — wisdom to all who wanted or needed it, would think in other terms. People ask, what about the granting of degrees? If any body who wants can come to a university and there study as much or as little as he wants, how will the univer sity issue its credentials? I don't think the university ought to be in the credentials granting business. Why should our universities be hiring halls for business and government? It does not seem to me to be a vital or necessary or even acceptable part of the process of education. In any case, people even now take courses in the extension divisions of universities and, depending on the length of the course, get a certain number of credits for work done. There's no reason at all why people could not over a num ber of years take courses in an assortment of universities, depending on where they lived and who they wanted to study with, and simply have some kind of certificate listing the total number of credits they had collected. In any case, there is plenty of evi dence that educational institu tions do not and cannot teach competence. Since they don't and can't, why go on any longer with the pretense that an academic degree is a cer tificate of competence? All it shows or can show is that such‐and‐such a person has taken so many courses and played the school game for a certain length of time; it says nothing about what he will or will not be able to do in his later working life. The prestige universities have worked hard, for reasons already given, to convince employers and the public at large that their degrees are indeed certificates of excep tional competence and worth. They have to do this to create among the students a demand for these degrees and among employers a demand for hold ers of them. But it is a con, and there is really nothing in it. If the universities grew interested in education they could give up this fiction along with others. TO the dissatisfied, the uni versities like to say, in one way or another, “If you don't like our rules, you don't have to play our game.” This seems the height of reasonableness. It is nothing of the kind. The universities, which in other circumstances like to think of themselves sometimes as ex clusive clubs, sometimes as temples of the higher truth and learning, are comparing themselves here to any kind of store. You go to the super market, pay some money, walk out the door with a little food. If you don't like their food or their prices, you don't go to that supermarket; you go to some other. In the same way, the universities say, we offer certain kinds of learn ing, skill, and money‐attract ing credentials, in return for a good deal of the students' money and time. The trouble with this—and it should be obvious to anyone who takes half a minute to think about it—is that the stores we trade at do not ex ercise the kind of influence and pressure on our lives that the universities, singly and collectively, exercise on the lives of their students. The supermarkets do not post people at the door deciding whether or not I am good enough to get in. Nor do they stamp on my forehead in indelible ink for the world to see whether or not I was good enough. They do not grade me like the meat they sell. The universities, on the other hand, do exactly this. They have arrived at a situa tion, and to a considerable extent contrived it, in which their opinion of a young per son determines to a very large degree what that person can or cannot do, will or will not become during the rest of his life. There is probably no other single institution in so ciety, even the armed forces, which has as much to say about our lives. (The armed forces, it is true, can put a man in a position where he may be killed or injured, but once he gets out of their hands, so to speak, they don't cast much of a shadow over his future.) Our young people start liv ing under the shadow of uni versities almost as soon as they're born. What the univer sities want, what they think is good, bad, valuable, value less, certainly determines and creates the kinds of pressures that our young people live under beginning as early as age 3 or 4. Our young people spend a very large part of their time, even before they go on to college, doing what the schools think the univer sities want; they go on doing what they want while they're at the universities, which may be anything from four to heaven‐knows‐how‐many years; and, as I said before, they carry on them for the rest of their lives whatever sort of brand the university has chosen to put on them. Their demand — that since universities exercise this enor mous control over the lives of their students, students should have something to say about them and the way they are run—seems to me to be alto gether right and just. If universities want to say to our young people in effect, “We are just a gathering of scholars doing our thing; please stop bothering us and interfering with us, and let us do our own thing the way we want,” then they have got to get their feet off the collective necks of the young and give up the extraordinary and unjustifiable power that they have acquired over their lives. ■

1431-> NIXON URGES ACTION ON CONSUMER BILL
WASHINGTON, March 12 (UPI)—President Nixon appealed today for fast bipartisan Con gressional support and passage of his consumer protection package. “There will only be discredit on all of us if we don't get this done,” he said. The President and his top con sumer advisers met at the White House with 11 key Senate‐ and House members. His consumer proposals are bogged down in a House Government Opera tions subcommittee. The measure, which Mr. Nix on described as “tough enough to protect the consumer but avoids the pitfall of destroying good business,” would create Permanent office of consumer affairs in the White House, es tablish a consumer protection division in the Justice Depart ment and authorize that depart ment to join consumers in “class action” suits against manufacturers. Among those attending the two‐hour meeting was Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Demo crat of Washington, chairman of the Senate Commerce Commit tee, who put the blame on the Administration for much of the delay. Mr. Magnuson told the Pres ident that the Administration should have proposed a broad amendment to one of the many consumer protection measures already before the House and Senate Commerce Committees instead of submitting a “so called new bill.”

1432-> An Indian Expatriate Rediscovers India
NEW DELHI. IN June Delhi is hot and dusty. A searing wind walks down to it from the desert plains to the north, kicking up ocher sand around the tombs and forts that stud the landscape of the city. In the Gymkhana Club, where the smart socialites drink, there were tall mirrors, cold beer, salted nuts, bearers in snowy uniforms. There were not, however, many smart so cialites: most of them had fled to Kashmir and the snows. Those who remained talked desultorily about the dullness of Delhi in summer. In the roadway outside, the beg gars snored sepulchrally in the shade. They would awake at dusk with itchy palms. The rich adolescents of the city drove after dusk to the Cellar, Delhi's first discotheque, to sip Cokes and, tiredly, dance the Watusi. Afterward, they came out, wiping their faces, to their cars parked in the hot, still, vermilion twilight. The hippies drifted out of their ramshackle hotels in the old city, to loll like pallid, misshapen lotuses on the crowded pavements, their shaggy heads raised, hoping for a breath of wind. None came. All this made a pattern of life, I supposed, but not one I could read ily understand. I was born in India, but I had left it 15 years back to live in England, and it was 10 years now since my last visit. Much had happened in those 10 years, to India and to the friends and relatives I had left there. Much had happened to me. I had come back as a foreign writer commissioned to do a book about the country: inquisitive for information, speaking no word of any Indian lan guage, armed with tape recorder and typewriter. But after six months of hard travel, mostly in the Himalayas, I still hadn't written a word of the book. I was tired, of course, and June in Delhi didn't help that at all: the inescapable sun, the dust that filled one's clothes and shoes, the parched and and nights. “Get yourself a flat,” John Hinch ingbrooke said. “Then you can settle down to write the book.” It was per haps symbolic of my return as a stranger that my closest friends in India were John and his wife Caro line, a young, lively and very English couple who were spending a few months in India, looking around. They had a flat: a lovely flat, small and compact, with a rustling and leafy garden, infested by squirrels and small decorative parrots. If I could find another such flat, I thought, I could certainly write the book here. “The agent who found us this flat isn't bad,” John said. “Caro line will introduce you.” NEXT day Caroline drove me to the agency. It was off a teem ing street lined with stalls whose owners cooked unidentifiable food stuffs in huge iron bowls full of oil over charcoal fires. Dogs and chil dren squabbled noisily over the scraps that fell from the caldrons. The agency consisted of one room, spat tered with betel and furnished with wooden benches, on one of which the agent, naked except for striped underpants, lay plumply and peace fully asleep. Caroline tapped his fat brown shoulder, and he awoke and beamed at us. is an Indian‐born, Brit ish‐educated poet and author who lives in London. “Excuse me, please,” he said. “Now I am putting my clothes.” His shirt and trousers hung, neatly folded, on the back of the only chair in the room. He assumed them with an un affected smile. “Now how I am help ing you, please?” I said I wanted a flat. “Yes,” he said, “yes. Flats of many kinds I am having. Please to accompany me. You have transport?” We climbed back into the car and drove for considerable distance. The neat, white housing colonies spread out before us in the sun, proliferating over areas which only a few years before had been a wilderness. Even tually we pulled up by a barren tract, occupied only by two large piles of bricks. The agent scrambled out of the car and scrutinized the bricks carefully. “Ah,” he said. “I have made slight mistake. This is very fine flat, only they have not yet built it. You will not mind to wait for little while?” I said I would mind. He clicked his tongue in sorrow, returned to the car, and directed us to other flats. We could not enter some of these, since neither the agent nor anyone else seemed to possess keys to them. Others turned out to be occupied, the agent having forgotten that he had already let them. The few to which we did gain access were hor ribly alike: square bleak rooms, newly whitewashed—the whitewash splattered over the stone floors and the windowpanes like the droppings of innumerable enormous birds. They were all on the same model: “one sitting,” the agent said, “two bed ding, two bath, one kitchen, one servant's quarter. Ideal flat for soli tary gent.” I said to Caroline, “I couldn't possibly work in of these places.” She shook her head and rolled her lovely eyes. THE agent returned to me every day for the next few days, taking me to a series of flats indistinguish able from one another. At last, how ever, he took me to a flat quite close to John and Caroline's. It was on two floors, the upper one a ter race, from which one looked across a square lined with parched and listless trees, to a series of domes, some covered in blue mosaic, others of red sandstone—the tombs of the Mogul emperor Humayun and his relatives, four centuries old: From the other side of the terrace, there were other tombs to be seen, the tombs of the Lodi rulers, older even than Humayun's. Physically, the flat was little dif ferent from any of the others, but the view decided me. “I'll take it,” I said. “What's the rent?” Six hun dred rupees monthly, the agent said, about $75. “O.K.,” I said, “I'll pay a month in advance.” But the agent shook his head, sighing and smiling. “No, no,” he said. “The owner of this flat is very worthy Punjabi lady, but she is widow lady. No gentle man is caring for her. This flat only is her source of income. She re quires three months' rent in advance, plus 1,000 rupees as a deposit.” I argued. John and Caroline ar gued. The agent smiled on, adamant. I grew tired of argument and paid. “Now you'll have to furnish it,” John said gloomily. Next day, when I returned to the flat, an elderly and tattered Sikh was squatting by the gate. “You take flat, Sahib,” he said. “You need bed to sleep, chair to sit, table to eat. I damn fine carpenter. I make.” I asked him how he knew I had taken the flat. “I hear,” he said with a mysterious smile. He scribbled cal culations on a sheet of paper. He would make me, he said, a bed, six chairs and a table for 600 rupees. I agreed. The Sikh went off on a rickety bicycle. Presently he pedaled back, followed by two young men pulling a cart full of planks. “My sons,” the carpenter said. “They help.” His sons and he settled them selves, with the wood, on the terrace. THE day after this, a small, wrinkled man appeared at the door. He said he was a tailor. “You want curtains, Sahib, you want cushion covers. You buy cloth, I make.” His charges, he informed me, were the equivalent of $1 a day. Obediently I went out and bought the cloth. The tailor brought an ancient sew ing machine and settled himself at the opposite end of the terrace from the carpenters. The flat filled with a noise of sawing and hammering, interspersed with the plaintive whirl of the sewing machine. “You'll need a servant,” said Caro line briskly. “How do I find one?” “You don't,” John said, looking up from his book. “They'll find you.” He was perfectly correct; streams of people started to arrive at the flat. They carried their references care fully wrapped in oilskin packets: This one was an excellent cook, that one a splendid butler. Some asked for as little as the equivalent of $4 a month, with board and lodging thrown in. Others asked for as much as $15, these being people who had worked for foreigners before. I wav ered between them, helpless. “I have no money, Sahib,” a thin man said. “For six months I have not had work. Every day I visit my friends; they tell me if their friends have told them where a sahib has taken a flat. Then I walk there, six, seven miles sometimes; I cannot af ford bus fare. But nobody will em ploy me because I have arthritis in my hands. Sahib, pay me as little as you like, but employ me.” In the midst of all this, John's and Caroline's servant appeared on the doorstep. With him was a diminu tive, very dark young man, with a small mustache and large, impassive eyes. “This my cousin, sir,” the serv ant said. “His name Mani. He can sweep, he can cook, he can wash clothes. You pay him 130 rupees (about $16) and food. He very satis factory man.” Mani lowered his eyes modestly. I was tired of the search for a servant. “Right,” I said. “I'll employ him.” THE curtains were up. The furni ture was ready. The carpenter, smil ing calmly, presented me with a bill that was exactly double his original estimate. “How,” I asked, “does it come to so much?” He continued to smile. “Additional expenses, Sahib,” he said. “Mattress for the bed Labor.” It couldn't, I told him, possibly add up to all this; but if he ex plained how he thought it did, I would pay him. His smile became little fixed. Then his English ap peared to fail him. He explained, lengthily, in Hindu, which I didn't understand. His fixed smile irritated me, but I could not penetrate it. Eventually, weakly, I submitted, and paid. A few days later, I mentioned the episode to an Indian friend. It was at a Delhi party; bearers in plumed, yellow turbans stalked round a dusty lawn, handing out iced drinks to society people. The faces of the bearers were masks so immobile as to seem inhuman. My friend flew in to a curious, inexplicable fury when he heard my tale. “Look at these bearers,” he said. “They are apes; they are animals. All poor people in India are like that. They are ready to fleece any foreigner they came across, and they consider you a foreigner. They would not try it with us because they know what would happen. If your carpenter had dared to try that trick with me—but he'd never have dared, I'd have slapped him—I'd have had him thrown out of my house. I'd have refused to pay him a penny. They are animals, and that's the treatment they under stand. But you foreigners, you try and be polite to them, and they think you're soft. If your servant gives you trouble, beat him. He'll understand that. For God's sake, don't be soft.” The outburst surprised me, for I had thought him an intelligent, even a sensitive man. I had moved into the flat now, and I watched Mani at his work with an absorbed sort of interest. Neat in his white uni form, he cooked and swept and dusted, washed and ironed my clothes, fetched me drinks. But while he did all this, his face was a mask, as the faces of the bearers at the party had been. He kept his eyes, whenever he was near me, lowered and averted. He did not speak unless he was spoken to. Rather to my horror, he addressed me as Master. He treated me rather as though I was part of the furniture, an ob ject, to be kept clean and ministered to. He seemed to have no recogni tion of me whatever as a human en tity. This, it struck me, was the terrible part of being an employer in India. Your servant did not recog nize you as a person simply because respect demanded it: If he did think of you as a person, it equated you with him, which was a breach of respect. There was an inhuman qual ity in such a relationship. MANI remained impassive, but I didn't. The monsoon was about to break, and the heat was kilnlike in its intensity. The ceiling fans, at this point, failed. If one opened the win dows, they admitted hordes of small, black, malevolent flies; if one didn't, the sweat ran in rivers; one's whole body became an ache and blur of heat. The electrician I telephoned about the fans promised to come immediately, but never came at all. The booster pump which provided the water for the flat broke down, and I telephoned another electrician. Exactly the same thing happened with him. Then the furniture started to fall apart. The backs of the chairs warped. A leg came off the bed. I replaced it, and it promptly came off once more, together with a sec ond leg. I started to feel slightly hysterical about life, and couldn't work. John and Caroline observed all this with a grave, a courteous, an English sympathy. One day John said conversationally, “We're going home soon. Why don't you take over our flat? You might find it more com fortable than yours to work in.” It was sad to hear that they were leaving, but nice to hear that I could have their flat. THE week after I moved in to the Hinchingbrookes' flat, the monsoon broke. Rain scattered and splashed across the dry turf of the lawn out side the flat, over the denuded trees. The trees burst suddenly into leaf and flower. The dust of the summer was laid; the air was damp and cool and smelt of wet earth. Mani came to me, looking curiously sullen. “Master, now mud is coming, very hard to keep house clean. I am bring ing one boy to help me. Also I am caste Hindu, I cannot clean toilet. I am bringing one woman to help me.” He brought them, a slender and calm‐faced Untouchable woman who was 25 and looked 40, and her 7‐year‐old son. The child was to wash the floors, the mother the lav atories. The mother, I later discov ered, had also been told by Mani that she must wash my shirts. They came daily, and for their services I paid them 15 rupees, or $2 a month. The days fell into a regular pattern. I was awakened at about 7 by Mani, scurrying into the bedroom like a clockwork mouse, head down, feet pattering, eyes impassive and averted, with a cup of tea and the newspapers. When I had dealt with these, I got up and had a bath. I would emerge from, it to find Mani laying out the clothes he considered I should wear that day. I would dress slowly and go into the patio. The rain would be falling with a slow lisping sound, dripping off the garden shrubs under a dull and peaceful sky. The Untouchable mother and child squatted into a corner of the patio; when I appeared they rose, making the Indian obeisance with folded hands. Then the mother disappeared into the bathroom, and the child, with a bucket and cloth, started to scrub the floor around me, while Mani brought coffee and breakfast. I felt very guilty about the child. I could not speak his language, and did not try to talk, but from time to time smiled at him. He stared back at me with a look of terror. It was clearly not my role to smile at him. One day, alleviating my guilt in rather a crude fashion, I handed the boy a packet of chocolate. He obvi ously didn't know what it was, so I opened the packet and showed him. For the first time since I had first set eyes on him, his face broke into an open, purely childish smile. He ceased to be a servant, and became a little boy. When he left with his mother, he smiled at me once more. I settled to my typewriter. Then I heard irate shouts from Mani, and wails from the child. A moment later Mani came in, holding the boy firmly by the ear, the packet of chocolate held triumphantly aloft in his free hand. “Master, this very bad boy. He stealing your choco late.” “Leave him be,” I said, in as firm a tone as I could contrive. “I gave to him.” Mani stared at me Incredulously. giving present to he said at last, as though he had only that moment managed to accommo date the idea. “To He re leased the boy's ear with reluctance. Then his face stiffened once more into its usual impassive, mask and he turned away. But the boy never smiled at me again. THE incident, In a way, brought me a realization of what a servant in India was all about. Mani had been genuinely indignant at the idea that I was being robbed. He, in this mo ment, became my representative, pro tecting my interests. It gave him a sense of power and certainty, which I had proceeded to shake by pointing out that I had not been robbed at all. It was almost as though I had been disloyal to him. Daily, venders on bicycles passed by the house, with basketfuls of vege tables, iceboxes full of fish, cartons of meat. Mani would call them in to the lawn. Then, directly in front of my study, where I could see and hear him, he would browbeat them fierce ly, bristling like a small terrier, fight ing to bring down their prices with an intensity that almost alarmed me. He brought down their prices, cer tainly, but I discovered that he him self was making a good deal of money on the weekly bills. When complained of this to an Indian ac quaintance, he shrugged his shoul ders. “It is his right. He will see to it that nobody swindles you, but he feels he has the right to swindle you himself.” The logic of this escaped me. It shocked me somewhat, too, when I went up to Mani's room one after noon (it was a small, neat room above the flat) and discovered six strangers asleep in it. “Who,” I asked Mani, “are they?” He looked rather sheep ish. “They my friends, master,” he said. “They live in my room, and they paying me rent. Also they help me in kitchen.” The role of bloodsucking landlord seemed to me unsuit able to Mani, but I did not say so. After this, however, the six ten ants, who had previously kept out of my way, appeared frequently, when ever I passed the kitchen. They would he peeling vegetables, cook ing, washing dishes, while Mani, seated on a cane stool with a ciga rette, supervised their activities. Mani would smile proudly; his six vassals would touch their forelocks to me, and proceed with their tasks. THE flat, in fact, always seemed to be full of people I did not know. The sweeper, one day, appeared with her husband, who wanted me to find him work. Mani was full of hints that I should find work for his six friends. Utter strangers wan dered in off the street, made the formal obeisance, and asked me to give them money, since they had none. Unused as I was to Indian life, it puzzled me, at first, as to why I should be considered a cross between an employment bureau and a charity fund, but the answer was simple: A poor person considered it his right to expect help from any one richer (apparently) than him self. I could understand this, but my 15 years in England had developed a Western need for privacy in me. What I couldn't understand was why anybody who felt the need could wander into my flat at will. One of these wanderers arrived at dusk, a skinny and furtive man, and ap proached me on tiptoe from the veranda. “Sir, I am begging your pardon. But I have nice offer for you.” I eyed him warily. He said, “Sir, you are cultured gent. You come from England. You do not mind to break the Indian law, eh?” At this I eyed him still more warily. He shook his head. “Do not mistake me, sir. I am honorable fellow. I know English gents are liking beefsteak. Sir,” he said, with the complacent air of the genie of the lamp, “I will bring you a beefsteak. Ten rupees only.” Delhi is one of the parts of India where cow slaughter is forbidden. Hence it is illegal to buy or sell beef. The steaks one is served in hotels are buffalo, stringy and rather dry. After several months of ab stinence, I had a passionate desire for beef. I agreed enthusiastically to my visitor's terms. He nodded, put a finger to his lips, and said, “Sir, am coming quietly‐quietly. After dark tomorrow. No policeman will see me. I will bring a fine beef steak.” I saw no need for these melo dramatics, but they were his privi lege, after all, and next night he turned up as promised, bearing in a large canvas satchel a solitary but veritable steak. I gave it to Mani, and said, “For dinner.” He looked at it and replied, “Master, this beef.” I agreed, proudly. “Master,” Mani said apolo getically, “I caste man, I no can cook beef.” So I cooked the steak myself, rather grumpily, over the gas ring in the kitchen. It turned out, of course, to be utterly inedible. THE monsoon ended as abruptly as it had started. The evenings were cool now, smelling of wood smoke and cattle, and I took to going for long walks amid the tombs that surrounded the flat. In the tomb of Humayun, after dusk, little knots of white‐clad people sat together, chanting what were apparently Mos lem prayers in a low monotone. When I passed them in the dusk, I felt a curious prickle of recognition down my spine, as if all the blood in me suddenly, and after years, re membered it had come from India. It was nearly time for me to leave, and perhaps this recognition had come to me too late. I had been tied to my typewriter now for months. My whole life had been inside the flat, and I felt the need to live it up a little. But in Delhi there was nowhere to do this. The wealthy people in Delhi are mostly diplomats or politicians, who turn up every evening at each other's parties. But though I was in vited to some of these parties, I soon started to refuse invitations, for the parties were dauntingly alike. Not only did one always meet the same people and talk about the same things, but one tended to talk about the same things in the same way. I was more bored with myself at Delhi parties than I ever was when alone. Nor could I decide who were the more boring of the wealthy Delhi people, the men or the women. The women were at least often very pleasant to look at, with golden skins and delicate features. They were like butterflies cocooned in the six yards of colorful silk that make an evening sari. When they opened their mouths, however, the horror happened. Often their voices were edged and strident, like the cries of mutilated birds, and all they spoke of was their bridge parties, their coffee parties, their children and their servants. The men were usually very unattractive indeed, and con versationally were limited to the more obvious political events and the amassment of money. I TOOK to entertaining at home, in a very small way, since I had met only two or three people I could stand. One of them, Hari Ahlu walia, became a close friend of mine. He was my age, but had been far less sedentary than I in youth. His passion was mountains, and he had climbed a number of Himalayan peaks before he was chosen for the Indian expedition to Everest in 1965. In May of that year he achieved his life's ambition, and stood on the summit of Everest. That fall, the Indo‐Pakistani war broke out. Hari, a major in the Indian Army, was leading a patrol in Kashmir, when he was hit in the spine by a sniper's bullet. He was paralyzed from the waist down and is now confined to a wheelchair. He has a long, rather beautiful face, with haunted eyes un der his Sikh turban, and a low, hesi tant voice. This voice hypnotized me, sitting on the lawn with him at dusk, sipping beer. It was an Indian voice, and like the singers in the tomb, it recalled to me the India I had for gotten was part of me. One evening I attempted to crys tallize my feelings about my life in Delhi. I hadn't lived in India for 15 years, I told Hari. Living in Delhi now, I had hoped to recapture some sense of identity with the country. In a way I'd wanted to do this through Mani, to recognize him as a person, and be recognized, outside the relationship of employer and servant. But I had failed, and I felt that it was some quality in Indian society that had caused my failure. Hari chuckled softly in the darkness. “But that is not true,” he said. “He may not tell you this, but he is fond of you. He may not tell you this because it is not the Indian way.” He said: “You will return to Eng land and you will not know what happened to you in India. You will not know what impact you have made on anyone. Nobody will tell you the truth about it, particularly not someone like Mani, because he would think it was disrespect. But you've treated him like a man, not like a servant, and because of that I think he is your friend.” He put his beer down on the, table. We sat on in the dusk in a com panionable silence. Mani clattered dishes in the kitchen. Someone passed in the street, singing very softly. A bird cried out once, sharply, in the branches of the big lime tree beside us, and then again was still. ■

1433-> Road Progress Stop and Go
BANGKOK, Thailand—The development of road trans port in Asia, an absolute es sential for economic progress over the vast expanse of the continent, is proceeding in a slow tempo of patchwork and paradox. The Asian Highway, a breathtaking 35,000‐mile road network that eventually will link Bali and Singapore to the highway systems of Western Europe, is continuing to take shape as gaps in the highway are closed. But thousands of Asian farming villages still have nothing better than barely adequate footpaths over which to carry their produce to markets. Although new ribbons of smooth multilaned national roads were opened last year in most of the countries in the region, geometrically in creasing traffic congestion threatened to strangle a growing number of big Asian cities. Despite the steadily rising number of private auto mobiles as well as new fleets of buses and trucks, millions of Asians continued to rely on bicycles, horses, water buffalo and their own legs for transporting themselves and their wares. At the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Council for Asia and the Far East here, the shortage of ad equate road transport is re garded as a national and re gional problem. Historically, road patterns in Asian nations ran from in terior producing areas to seacoast ports, while arteries connecting national borders were rare. The persistence of this pattern, according to M. Besar, head of the council's road‐traffic department, is hindrance to regional coopera tion, which is considered vital requisite for meaningful economic development. Within many of the coun tries of the U.N. council, the shortage of good roads and vehicles is a serious impedi ment to the flow of farm products to the cities and industrial goods to rural areas, to the efficient imple mentation of development projects, to the spread of so cial services and to cohesion among countries still in the process of nation building. Mr. Besar noted that in these countries, which cover an area of 4.5 million square miles and have a population of over 1 billion, are only 15 per cent of the world's roads. There are over 2 million miles of roads in the area but 52 per cent of these are in three countries, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. These three countries also account for over 80 per cent of all new road construction. The same Is true of ve hicles. Although the number of cars, buses and trucks has more than doubled to 17 mil lion in the last seven years, 80 per cent of them are to be found in these same three countries. The poorer countries also suffer from poor traffic man agement, inadequate main tenance and aging vehicles. Meanwhile, urban transportation has become a great and growing problem. Throughout Asia, the rural population has been shifting into the towns, adding to the high growth rate of the cities. Urban areas have grown in sprawling fashion, creating an exploding demand for transport. But the cities are largely unplanned, with narrow streets and crazy‐quilt traffic patterns. Moreover, the cities of Asia are almost all too poor to undertake the essary drastic street rebuild ing programs. On top of this, the growing number of cars, trucks and buses continued to be chal lenged by local means—Ja karta's betjak or pedicabs, Manila's Jeepney's, the color ful minibuses made out of converted Jeeps, Hong Kong's rickshaws, or the horses and buggies still found in almost all urban areas. Added to this is a sea of bicycles, motor bikes, motorcycles and hand carts. The result has been monu mental traffic congestion in most urban areas leading not only to accidents and frayed nerves but also to real social and economic losses. Mr. Besar noted that road transport by itself could not meet all economic needs in Asia, particularly for long haul freight traffic, where rail and water traffic is cheaper and more efficient. But for developing coun tries road traffic is still most important because of its rel ative inexpensiveness and flexibility.

1435-> New Left Students Strike L.I.U.'s Brooklyn Center
About 150 adherents of the New Left among the 7,339 stu dents of the Brooklyn Center of Long Island University called a strike yesterday. Approximately 1,000 of the 3,000 students on campus at tended a strike rally, and few classes were cancelled for a lack of students. New Left spokesmen, who asked that their names not be used, because they feared re prisal, contended that the rally voted to continue the strike today. Strike opponents charged that those in charge at the rally did not give the op position a chance to vote when they saw that they had only minority support in the audi ence. The principal issue advanced as the cause of the strike was the failure of the administra tion of the Brooklyn Center's president, Alexander Aldrich, to renew the contracts of eight untenured teachers.

1436-> Georgia and Florida Ordered to Open Up Public Universities
WASHINGTON, March 12 (AP) — With. new notices to Georgia and Florida, the Gov ernment has increased to 10 the number of states accused of racial discrimination in their college and university systems. In letters dated Feb. 26 and disclosed today, the Depart ment of Health, Education anc Welfare requested plans With. in 60 days from Georgia and within 120 days from Florid for complete desegregation of their public higher educatior institutions. The notices potentially jeopardize approximately $25. million a year in Federal sup port to seven Florida univer sities and approximately $26. million to 26 Georgia colleges and universities. In the last year, the depart ment's Office for. Civil Rights has requested higher education desegregation from the follow ing states: Oklahoma, Louisi ana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Vir ginia, North Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania. All have been told that they operate racially identifi able colleges in violation of the Federal antidiscrimination laws. For example, the depart ment told Florida that one of its state institutions — Florida A. & M. — was almost 100 per cent Negro while the other six public universities had stu dent bodies nearly 100 per cent white. “Educational institutions which have been legally segre gated have an affirmative duty to adopt measures necessary to overcome the effects of past segregation,” the notice to Florida said. Arkansas and Pennsylvania have submitted desegregation plans that are under review. The Government rejected Mary land's plan and requested im provements. Louisiana and Mississippi have not submitted any blueprint for action. But, because sporadic talks are continuing, no enforcement ac tion has been started. The original deadlines are not yet up for the rest of the states, which were put on notice more recently.

1437-> Underground ‘Exciting’ to Gold.
TWO WeeKS Define ins body was found in the rubble of a dynamite‐blasted townhouse on West 11th Street, Theodore Gold, a 23‐year‐old Weatherman revolutionary, told an old leze friend: “I've been doing a lot of ex citing underground things, and I know now I'm not afraid to die.” The friend had known Mr. Gold for years. He had seen him become vice chairman of the Columbia chapter of Stu dents for a Democratic Society in 1967 and a year later he saw the intense sociology major take a leadership role in the strike that immobilized the Morning side campus. After their class was gradu ated in June of 1968, the friend saw Mr. Gold only intermit tently. He learned that his class mate was teaching at a school for disabled children and that he was organizing a group called Teachers for a Demo cratic Society. He knew that Mr. Gold was in close contact with Mark Rudd and perhaps a dozen others who had evolved revolutionary roles in the turbulence of that Columbia spring. But then three weeks ago, the friend, who asked that his name not be used, was sitting in a snack bar at Columbia when Mr. Gold approach and talked freely about his life as a Weatherman. Headed Chicago Commune He said he was the head of a Chicago commune and that the group was now in the pro cess of breaking out of their large collectives in which 30 or 40 persons lived together and that for security reasons they were banding together in fours and fives. He remembers Mr. Gold say ing “the communes were an ef fective experience, they robbed us of such bourgeois hang‐ups like privacy and monogamy.” At one point in the conversa tion, the friend remarked on hovi happy and content Mr. Gold appeared. The Weather man smiled and responded: “We don't think in terms of being happy. We think in terms of being strong people.” Mr. Gold asked his friend if he knew of any apartments that could be used for Weather man meetings in New York and he asked if his classmate could land him any money to help him get to Chicago. The friend said all he could spare at the moment was a dollar. At the time, Mr. Gold was presumably living in the $275, 000 Wilkerson home at l8 West 11th Street. His classmate asked him how he survived and how the Weatherman sup. ported themselves. “We steal,” was the response. The conversation also touched on Mr. Gold's longstanding mania for sports. At Columbia he used to revere the baseball Giants and would read box scores every morning. Did he still do that? the friend asked. Mr. Gold laughed and an swered: “Sometimes I think I'll have to wait for Willie Mays to retire before I become a good Communist.” The conversation sketched out what Mr. Gold had been doing in the years after the Columbia trouble. Conversa tions with others who knew him provided a bit more in formation. A group of younger Columbia radicals tried a few days after his death to lower the campus flag to half staff; Before they were dispersed by campus guards they succeeded in writ ing a crayon inscription on the base of the flagpole. It said: “In Memory of Ted Gold. Fight like him.” Some of those who took part in that action said that Mr. Gold had been at the Wilkerson House writing a history of the S.D.S. with Cathlyn P. Wilker son. They understood that a number of publishers were in terested in the work as a text book covering the group from its birth with the Port Huron Statement to last summer's Weatherman Manifesto. The only other literary effort of Mr. Gold's that they knew about was a series of lyrics set to popular songs and issued sometime back as the Weather man Songbook. There was one called, “I'm Dreaming of White Riot,” and another to rock tune that began, “We need a red party so. that we can learn to struggle.” The three young people who talked of Mr. Gold were all members of a now defunct rad ical group called the Mad Dogs, I which had some tactical differ ences with the Weatherman faction. “We had our differences with Ted,” said one young girl, “but we loved him and we knew he was dedicated to the struggle.” What puzzled the three peo ple was how there had come to be an explosion. They insisted that Mr. Gold was an important enough Weatherman to assume that he was being watched and that it is a dictum of the move ment that “you keep your un derground and overground work separate.” One of the youths offered the conjecture that the dynamite had been planted in the build ing by provacateurs. From other sources, who again asked not to be identified, it was learned that in late August or early September Mr. Gold traveled to some foreign country for a meeting with rep resentatives of the National Liberation Front. On that trip he was reported ly accompanied by Kathy Boudin, 26 years old, who is believed to have been in the house when the explosion oc curred and is thought to have escaped with Miss Wilkerson. Robert Siegel is now a stu dent at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. He had known Mr. Gold since both of them were juniors at Stuyvesant High School. They met in a group called Friends of the Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee, which Mr. Gold had helped to organ ize. On weekends, back in 1963, they would go off to solicit food for shipment to black communities in Mississippi. Called Hard Worker Mr. Siegel, who accompanied Mr. Gold to Columbia, regarded his friend as a hard working student In his first years at college he talked of going to law school. “He was serious, and committed,” Mr. Siegel said. “He had a leftist orienta tion but it was then within the framework of acceptable stu dent activism.” During the summers of his sophomore and junior years Mr. Gold worked as a counselor for groups of slum children tak ing part in Project Double Dis covey, a live‐in tutorial pro gram on the Columbia campus. His superior in the program, Roger Lahecka, now an assist ant dean at the college, remem bers Mr. Gold as one of the most dedicated counselors in the program. “He was tough on the kids but they respected him for it.” In his first two years on campus, Mr. Siegel recalled, Mr. Gold had been active in Columbia Congress of Racial Equality, which was the pre cursor of the S.D.S. Chapter. A year after the chapter was formed he was chosen its vice chairman, while his roommate, Ted Kapchuk, was chosen chairman.

1438-> Economic Ties to U.S. Arouse Canadian Fears
mounting Canadian debate on economic relations with the United States. Imperial Oil, Ltd., a subsid iary of the Standard Oil Corn pany of New Jersey, announced on Thursday that it had struck oil near the mouth of the Mackenzie River. That same day, Canadian newspapers played up promi nently Washington reports that President Nixon was being ad vised to link bigger American purchases of Canadian oil to a broad agreement with Canada on all forms of energy and even to shipping rights through the Northwest Passage. In Ottawa, George W. Ball, the No. 2 man in the State De partment under President John son, recommended that Canada and the United States view North America as a single econ omy and forge closer links on the style of the European Com mon Market. Replying to Canadian fears, voiced increasingly often of late, Mr. Ball argued before a Parliamentary committee that such arrangements need not compromise Canada's political independence. A first step toward a Com mon Market might be a joint energy policy governing oil, natural gas, coal and power. However, many Canadians are wary of a more intimate relationship because the United States already controls more than half of Canadian manufacturing, oil refining and mining. Anxiety about Canadian sovereignty and resources was summed by up an Opposition question Thursday in the House of Commons. Prime Minister Trudeau was asked to promise that any deal to sell more Canadian oils south of the border “will not include the handing over of any degree of control of any of Canada's water resources to the United States or the lessening in any way of this country's sovereignty over our Arctic waters.” “I think I can give you that assurance,” Mr. Trudeau re plied. The Prime Minister, who is not wont to offer such sweeping assurances in response to Op position prodding, evidently recognized that Canadians get especially emotional as sug gestions that the United States seeks “our water.” “There is no Canadian water for sale,” added J. J. Greene, the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, who has dis cussed a possible “continental energy policy” with Walter J. Hickel, the Secretary of the In terior. “There have been no requests to buy Canadian water from the United States or from any where else,” said Mr. Greene. Toronto's three newspapers all expressed similar editorial views on the resources‐sov eignty issue. “Canada's policy conies first,” said The Tele graph. “Please! No Blind Give away,” said The Globe and Mail. The Toronto Daily Star counseled that “Canada holds the whip hand where resources are concerned, not the United States,” and should avoid any “pool arrangement.” The essence of The Star's argument was that the United States needs Canadian oil more than Canada needs to sell it. Surging Western Canadian shipments, especially to the newly opened Chicago indus trial market, appeared to give independent confirmation that Alberta crude is eagerly wanted. The shipments have been exceeding the agreed quo tas, evidently with the tacit consent of Washington, and may amount to a major loop hole in Washington's oil‐import quotas. Although many Canadian business and political leaders find much logic in a continental approach (“What can we do with the oil if we don't sell it?” asked one rhetorically) and do not share the anti‐American sentiments of the economic nationalists, the present cli mate may cause Ottawa to pro ceed with great caution.

1439-> 5 CHARGED IN PLOT TO BILK $887,000
2 Bank Aides Among Those Accused of Check Kiting Two bank officers and three brothers were arrested yester day on a 50‐count indictment charging them with using check‐kiting scheme to embez zle $887,000 from the Bankers Trust Company and the Na tional Bank of North America. The embezzlement was ac complished over a 27‐month period starting in January, 1967, according to the indict ment. The conspiracy came to light late last March, when a bank messenger neglected to deliver on a Friday a bundle of checks approved for cash de posit to the main offices of Bankers Trust. On the follow ing Monday a shortage of $440,000 was discovered at the Bank of North America When the previously forgot ten checks were presented for payment at Bankers Trust they were marked “insufficient funds” because of the shortage. A subsequent audit and suits by the banks against each other for refusing to make good on the checks uncovered the scheme, the indictment said. Assistant United States Dis trict Attorney Bruce W. Solow said the ringleader was Salva tore Giordano, owner of the Baywood Harness Racing Sta bles and Bay Auto Sales of Brooklyn. He is 45 years old and lives at 97‐08 82d Street, Ozone Park, Queens. Bank Officer Named His 42‐year‐old brother, An thony, who lives at 158‐18 96th Street, Howard Beach Queens, is a partner in Bay Auto Sales, a used‐car business. The other brother, John Giordano, lives at 344 Sheppard Avenue, Brook lyn. The indictment also named Matthey J. Kelly, 42, of 2166 Willoughby Avenue, Brooklyn, an assistant vice president of National Bank of North Amer ica and former manager of its Baisley Park branch at Rocka way, Queens. The fifth defendant was Mar tin Thomas Shaughnessy, 60, of 143 Garfield. Street, Freeport, L. I., former assistant manager of the Van Wyck branch of Bankers Trust. He was dis missed from his job last April. The indictment charged that the two bank officials had in structed their employes to treat Salvatore Giordano's checks like cash deposits—the indict ment did not say. why—thus permitting funds to be with drawn immediately. This en abled them to circumvent the usual two to three‐day waiting period for writing checks against deposits. When the $440,000 in checks were not honored, Mr. Giordano persuaded Mr. Shaughnessy to certify four checks totaling that amount to be deposited. But Bankers Trust refused to honor the certified checks. This led, to the lawsuit. State Supreme Court Justice John J. Leahy held Anthony and Salvatore Giordano in bail of $15,000 each for a hearing April 1. The three other sus pects were released in personal bond of $10,000 each by Fed eral Judge Anthony J. Travia and a hearing was scheduled for next Thursday.

1440-> TECHNOLOGY'S USE IN CLASS IS URGED
WASHINGTON, March 12 A six‐point, $565‐million pro gram to bring the use of tech nology and educational research for the nation's classrooms out of the “Model T” era was urged in a report to Congress today by a study group that spent two years examining the subject. ine nine‐member Commis sion on Instructional Technolo gy proposed national institutes to coordinate research and ex perience in the use in educa tion of such tools as television and films. In his March 3 message to Congress on education Presi dent Nixon also suggested a national institute of education, but on a smaller, less immedi ate scale. When “fully devel oped,” he said, he envisioned an institute that would be $250‐million a year Federal ex penditure. Today, the chairman of the study group, Dr. Sterling M. McMurrin, a former United States Commissioner of Educa tion, told the House Select Sub committee on Education: “Examining the impact of technology on American educa tion in 1969 is like examining the impact of the automobile on American life when the Model T Ford first came on the market. “The further ahead one looks the more benefits technology seems to hold out for edu cation.” Shortdmings Admitted However, under questioning by subcommittee members, Dr. McMurrin, dean of the Univer sity of Utah's graduate school, admitted that experiences with classroom technological aids have often produced failure. And Sidney G. Tickton, execu tive vice president of the Academy for Educational De velopment, told the committee that in “most of the cases” students “showed no signifi cant” advance when technolo logical aids were used. However, he pointed out that most experts agreed that ther were no accurate tools for test ing degree of education. And both men insisted that past failures of technology in the classroom could be ex plained by the fact that most teachers were untrained in the field and little was generally known about how best to use such aids. Thus, the commission reason ed, with the vast advances in modern communications and the wide range of equipment, from computers to closed circuit television, available today, there must be ways to apply these advances to education. The answer lies, they suggest, in the establishment of a national cen ter of instructional technology to find these ways. The proposals include a library under the technology irt stitute; demonstration projects in selected communities, “with the emphasis on pockets of poverty or minority group dep rivation”; training and retrain ing of educators on the use of technology, and bringing edu cation and industry “together in a close working relationship to advance the effectiveness of instruction through technol dogy.” In response to a question from Representative Orval Han sen, Republican of Idaho, Dr. McMurrin said the “natural conservatism” and “rugged. in dividualism” of most school teachers and the “enormous cost” of some equipment a the primary barriers to success ful use of technology in schools. Representative John Brade mas, Democrat of Indiana, who introduced a bill to spend $200‐million a year for five years to improve the use of technology in schools, said that he had observed on a recent trip to Israel that “the Israelis make more use of educational research conducted in the United States than we do.” The members of the commis sion, in addition to Dr. Mc murrin, are Dr. David E. Bell of the Ford Foundation; Dr. Roald F. Campbell, the University of Chicago; Dr. C. Ray Carpenter, University of Georgia; Dr. Nell P. Eurich, former dean at Vas sar; Dr. Harold B. Gores, presi dent of Educational Facilities Laboratories, Inc.; Federal Dis trict Judge A. Leon Higgin bothan Jr.; Dr. Kermit C. Mor rissey, president of the Com munity College of Allegheny County, and Dr. Kenneth E. Oberholtzer, former superin tendent of Denver schools.

1441-> PICKUP AWAITED IN STEEL ORDERS
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 28—Steel mills are searching hard for an order improvement. In late December and early January, orders fell below lev els needed to meet shipping targets for the first quarter and the full year. In one recent week, orders were a full 25 per cent under the shipping rates projected for February and March. Mill officials said orders have been depressed by holi days, price changes, and ex treme winter weather. Officials said a pickup can be expected when customers begin placing orders for March. It was. By and large, however, the steel market has a bearish tone. A leading analyst shrugged “off the pessimistic comments. ‘Orders are about what you'd expect with a moderate correc tion coming in the slow months of the year,” he said. He was confident the March improve ment would materialize. Iron Age magazine warned that this view is not unani mous. Some steel men fear that March will see further cuts by automobile companies, Iron Age said. The magazine noted that cutbacks are spreading to sup pliers of the auto industry.

1443-> Marine Is Acquitted in Vietnam Killing
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Jan. 19—An American Marine captain was acquitted tonight by a general court‐martial of the premeditated murder of a North Vietnamese prisoner of war. The trial in Danang was one of two courts‐martial convened in South Vietnam today in which United States officers were accused of having shot wounded prisoners. Neither case is related to the alleged massacre of Vietnamese civil ians by American troops at the village of Mylai in 1968. In the second case, which opened this morning in the cen tral coastal city of Nhatrang, an American Army lieutenant has been charged with premed itated murder as a result of an action for which he was origi nally recommended for the Sil ver Star for gallantry. The Army later withdrew the recommendation when an investigation into the incident produced allegations that the lieutenant had shot a Vietcong prisoner after the battle. Granting a request from the defense counsel, the judge postponed argument of the case until March 2 to enable several witnesses, including the father of the defendant, to come to Vietnam. No plea was entered today, but the defendant's at torney said the accused, First Lieut. Frank B. Bonvillian 2d, of La Porte, Tex., would plead not guilty. In the case heard at Danang, a jury of six officers took 90 minutes to reach a decision after listening to eight hours of testimony. They cleared Capt. Robert W. Poolaw aged 31. of Anadarko, Okla., of all charge: arising from the death of an un identified prisoner last Aug. 11 At the time, Captain Poolaw was a company commander in the Second Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment of The First Marine Division, operating the Queson Mountains in north. ern Quangnam Province. On the last day of a search. and‐destroy mission, the court was told, the company cap. tured two wounded North Viet namese soldiers in a cave. One prisoner was evacuated on a stretcher, but the other, who was wounded in the buttocks and apparently suffering from malaria, was lying face down vhen Captain Poolaw allegedly ordered his men away. A prosecution witness, Edgar Hendrix, a civilian of Jefferson City, Mo., who was a lance corporal at the time of the in cident, told the court that he had heard the sound of a pistol being cocked and had turned coward the wounded prisoner. “I saw the back portion of the captain and his arm was extended toward the head of the prisoner, who was appar ently kneeling,” Mr. Hendrix said. “I could just see the top por tion of the prisoner's head,” he asserted. “I heard a shot, and the prisoner raised up and fell back.” Mr. Hendrix said that when the company passed by the area a bit later he saw the prisoner “lying like a rag doll on its side,” with wounds in the head. The defense argued that the evidence against Captain Poolaw was circumstantial since Mr. Hendrix's view of the incident had been obscured. Several former commanders under whom Captain Poolaw had served also testified on his behalf, arguing that he was good officer who had had clean record as a marine since his enlistment as a private in 1956. The charges against Lieuten ant Bonvillian, the defendant in the second case, accuse him of “the premeditated murder of an Oriental male human being whose name is unknown by shooting him with a rifle” at Thanhson hamlet, in Binhdinh Province, on Aug. 7, 1969. The hamlet is about 300 miles north of Saigon. Lieutenant Bonvillian was a platoon leader with the 173d Airborne Brigade at the time. The Army did not describe the incident during today's in itial hearing, but outside the court the defendant's counsel, Capt. Elliott H. Vernon, gave this account: “The lieutenant was on a patrol with other members of his platoon when he ran into an unknown size force of enemy soldiers, and engaged them. Lieutenant Bonvillian and his men pursued them into a free‐fire zone.” A free‐fire zone is the army's term for an area in which American troops are empow ered to fire at will without prior authorization because of the hostile nature of the region. “He himself jumped into a ravine and engaged a number of them in a line of bushes,” the attorney said. “He killed a number of them. “The question before the court,” the defense counsel said, “will be whether one of the individuals was killed aft erward or in the actual combat situation. The prosecutor declined to discuss the details of the case, but he is expected to allege that Lieutenant Bonvillian shot one enemy soldier after the soldier had been wounded and taken prisoner. If the lieuten ant is convicted, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison.

1444-> Hong Kong Woes Grow With Profits
HONG KONG—Last year was a boom year for Hong Kong that brought big prof its to the colony's basic manufacturing industries and an increased interest from abroad in its investment po tential. But fears were ex pressed that the boom was generating side effects that could dampen future invest ment in this British Crown Colony. Lana vaiues ana rents have soared as a result of the boom, and land auctions brought record prices for sites that nobody wanted two or three years ago. This rise in rents and land prices imposed heavy bur dens on small businesses working on marginal profits and caused some larger com panies to reconsider expan sion plans. The tight property situation and a sudden short age of apartments forced a number of foreign companies to abandon plans to estab lish offices or factories here. The president of the Chi nese Manufacturers Associa tion, C. W. Chuang, called on the Government to freeze all rental's pending an inves tigation. He said that spiral ing rentals for domestic and industrial sites could have “extremely grave social and economic consequences.” Another deterrent to for eign investment is a growing shortage of skilled labor. This is due partly to the fact that half the population is under 15 years of age and partly to the demands of the ex panding economy. The Far Eastern Economic Review said that in the last few years Hong Kong's manu facturing industries had re quired 40,000 new workers annually. It estimated em ployment needs in 1969 at 60,000 and said that “a clear labor shortage exists.” “An overseas industrialist wishing to set up a plant in Hong Kong would find it hard to recruit personnel and could hope to establish his factory only by drawing labor from other concerns,” the maga zine said. “In contrast, he would in Singapore find a labor reser voir of 15,000 to 20,000 in the most preferred category of light industry employes —young women—who can be trained to staff an electronics plant or similar manufactur ing enterprise,” the publica tion said. The land and labor prob lems aside, Hong Kong's busi ness leaders view the new year confidently. The director of commeice and industry, T. D. Sorby, said the out look for trade seemed good “at least for the first six months” of 1970. In 1969 Hong Kong's ex ports increased by 27 per cent to reach a new record of $1.7‐billion. This followed an increase of about 25 per cent in 1968 over the previ ous year. In November, the value of exports exceeded $180‐million for the first time in any month, an in crease of 42.8 per cent over November, 1968. In three years Hong Kong's exports have doubled in value. Business was buoyant not only for Hong Kong's ex porters in 1969 but also for the colony's commercial en terprises that depend on the purchases of the local popu lation and tourists. An in crease of 19 per cent in im ports was stimulated by the demands of local commerce and also by a revival of in terest in the building industry. More people shared in the growing prosperity by way of higher wages. Their im proved standard of living was reflected in rising retail sales of food, clothing and luxury items and in the upward movement of the basic wage index. As a result of an active investment climate, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange scored new records in daily turn over. In December a second market, the Far East Stock Exchange was established. Last year about 750,000 tourists came to Hong Kong. This represented an increase of 24 per cent over 1968. Hong Kong maintained its lead over Japan and was second only to Hawaii in the Pacific as the major stop over point for travelers. Steps taken by the United States to ease its embargo on trade with Communist China were expected to make a significant contribution to Hong Kong's economy by leading to an increase in the re‐export of Chinese goods and increased purchases by American tourists of articles imported from China. The United States contin ued to be Hong Kong's major market and some concern was expressed during 1969 over American moves to per suade Hong Kong to agree to a voluntary reduction in textile shipments. Local com mentators noted that Com merce Secretary Maurice Stans had spoken of a need for action against the “tidal wave of textiles from Japan,” and they said they expected renewed pressure on Hong Kong, which in 1968 replaced Japan as the main foreign supplier of clothing to the United States. Clothing sales to the United States increased in 1969, but Hong Kong manufacturers said that United States de mands for a reduction were unwarranted because the col ony's clothing products had secured only 1 per cent of the United States market.

1446-> Congress Ready for Test Today As Senate Opens Priority Fight
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19—The 91st Congress began an elec tion‐year session on a conten tious note today as Senate Democrats squared off with the Administration for a “battle of national priorities.” Shortly after Congress con vened at noon for its second session, the Senate Democratic leadership called up a $19.7‐ billion appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare that President Nixon has vowed to veto. The bill provides $1.1‐billion. more than requested by the Administration and includes a $1.26‐billion increase for Fed eral aid to education and health care and research. To the Administration, the increase is ?? ?? Senate Democrats it is an at tempt, as the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield, put it after a Democratic caucus, to “reorder national priorities to pay more attention to domestic needs.” The Senate Is expected to meet the Presidential challenge by passing the bill tomorrow, thus provoking Mr. Nixon's first veto of legislation passed by the Democratic controlled Congress. It was regarded as highly doubtful that the House would override the veto, but even if the President is sustained the partisan tone will be set for an election‐year session in which Republicans will be ma neuvering to capture control of the Senate in November. At least on debater points, the opening round in the bat tle went to the Democrats, as embarrassed Republican offi cials privately admitted. It was a case of the Republicans' be ing caught off balance by the unanticipated thrust of the ar gument from the Democrats. The Republicans had been prepared for an argument over priorities. With White House assistance, they had prepared a case contending that if the Congress was interested in re ordering national priorities it should put additional money into such programs as the Teacher Corps, educational re search and dropout prevention —all of which were cut in the appropriations bill. In words almost Identical to those used in a “fact sheet” circulated among Republican Senators by the health depart ment, Senator Charles H. Per cy, Republican of Illinois, made that argument in one of the few speeches of the day from the Republican side of the aisle. He protested that the Demo crats were contributing to in flation by proposing to spend additional money in “outworn programs,” such as education aid to federally impacted schools that should be phased out. But instead of basing their case directly on national pri orities, the Democrats took to the floor with a budgetary ar gument. Throughout the after noon, in accordance with a strategy worked out in a morn ing caucus, Democrats ham mered away at the theme that Congress had cut the over‐all appropriations request of the Administration by $5.6‐billion. For the Democrats, this em phasis upon the appropriations cut served a twofold purpose in the debate. It served to show that the Democrats were just as interested as a Republican Administration in cutting the gudget in the battle against in flation. Secondly, it permitted the Democrats to argue that some of the budgetary savings made by Congress should be reallocated to domestic needs. Senator Mansfield noted aft er the Democratic caucus that the $1.26‐billion increase for education and health was just about offset by the $1.1‐billion Congressional cut in the foreign aid appropriations requested by the Administration and was far outweighed by the total cut in appropriations. On the Senate floor, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massa chusetts, the Democratic whip, observed that while the Ad ministration might “talk about feeding the fires of inflation with a $1‐billion increase,” the Democrats could counter, “We, are still below you, Mr. Presi dent, by $5.6‐billion.” With their emphasis upon the apppropriations budget, the Democrats were blurring the distinction, not always clearly understood in Congress, be tween the appropriations side and spending side of the budge tary ledger. Congress votes only on ap propriations, which provide spending authority. From an in flationary standpoint, however, the Administration is interested in the spending budget, which reflects past and present ap propriations and legislative pro grams adopted by Congress, such as increases in veterans or Social Security benefits. Too late for a concerted counterattack today, the White House rushed up data to Re publicans on Capitol Hill seek ing to demonstrate how Con gress, while cutting appropria tions, had increased the spend ing budget through its other actions and inactions, such as increasing Social Security and veterans benefits and failing to act on proposed postal rate in creases. According to the Administra tion's figures, Congress in creased the spending budget by slightly more than $3.5‐bil lion. But this estimate was based on the premise that the Administration, not Congress, deserved credit for a $3‐billion cut in defense spending or dered in August. If Congress, on the basis of its redliction in military ap propriations, is given credit for forcing the defense spending cutback, then, with the Labor H.E.W. appropriations bill in cluded, it will have added only $500‐million to the spending budget in the current fiscal year. As Democrats sought to pin antieducation and antihealth labels on the opposition, it was apparent that some Republicans were suffering from political discomfort over the prospect of a Presidential veto. Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, said that the President was “badly ad vised” and “should cut more deeply into the military budget before he vetoes a bill contain ing $1.3‐billion more for edu cation and health.” Senator George D. Aiken of Vermont, dean of the Senate Republicans, emerged from a Republican conference with the observation: “It seems to me he could have found a better bill to veto.” “Strong sentiment,” accord ing to the Senate Republican leader, Hugh Scott, also de veloped in the Republican cau cus that despite Presidential ob jections Congress should vote extra money for the politically popular program of Federal ed ucation aid to “impacted areas” where there are high concen trations of families living or working on Federal property. The idea was advanced by a dozen Republican Senators that, if the bill was vetoed, Congress should still provide at least $521‐million and perhaps $600‐million in Federal impact school aid. But this is one of the provi sions in the appropriations bill that the Administration finds most inflationary and objec tionable, on the ground that much of the money is going to wealthy school districts that do not need the Federal money. The Administration had re quested $202‐million for impact aid, and Congress in the appro priations bill increased the amount to $600‐million. The House was marking time until after the President deliv ered his State of the Union Message to Congress on Thurs day at 12:30 P.M.

1448-> Summer Offensive Expected
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18—An increasing number of senior American military planners are coming to believe that enemy commanders in Vietnam are building toward a major coun trywide offensive this summer, rather than next month as previously thought. They believe the assaults could be the first major mili tary test of the Vietnamization strategy — which involves turn ing over the burden of the war to the South Vietnameseforces on which the Nixon Administra tion is basing its hopes for a solution to the war. If the enemy attacked at the time of the Tet holidays, the Lunar New Year, Feb. 6–8, he would still encounter roughly 450,000 American troops. But if he waits until summer, 50, 000 to 100,000 more American soldiers probably will have de parted, weakening allied defen sive positions in several places. If the enemy is willing to take heavy losses similar to the 43,000 estimated to have been killed in the massive assaults of February, 1968, he may be able to win some temporary victories in the summer, the planners note. The effect of such actions could rekindle popular dissatisfaction with Vietnam policy in the United States just prior to the con gressional and gubernatorial elections here. According to the new analy sis, if the enemy waits longer, he will run the risk of under mining the morale of his own soldiers and of facing stiffening resistance from South Viet namese peasants, who are re ported to have become increas ingly impressed with Saigon's ability to provide relative peace and prosperity over the last year or so. “If the enemy were planning a really big push around the time of Tet,” one ranking plan ner said, “they should be rush ing in large reinforcements right now.” But after a sudden spurt in November, when about 20,000 troops are estimated to have reached the war zone, infiltra tion has slowed to a relative trickle of roughly 3,000 to 5,000 a month. Enemy supply shipments con tinue to be heavy, however. The emplacement not only of more antiaircraft artillery along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos but also of the surface‐to‐air mis siles in the area convinces most analysts that Hanoi is de termined to expand weapons and ammunition traffic. There was one recent report that the North Vietnamese had urgently asked their agents in Cambodia to buy more than 200 cases of penicillin. This and similar fragmentary informa tion persuades some planners that there may still be some expanded military action at Tet. But the expectation is that this will be limited to increased rocket and mortar attacks, with only scattered ground assaults. In Saigon, United States mili tary analysts said last week that they did not expect the enemy to mount a major of fensive during Tet but that they did expect an upsurge in shell ings and sabotage. In the view of one of the analysts there, the enemy “can not afford” the type of fighting he did in 1968. “This year he'll be after a psychological victory, both to let the people know he's still around and to con vince the American people that Vietnamization won't work,” the analyst said.

1449-> Congress Learns Inflation Ranks As the Voters' Chief Concern
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 — Congress came back to the Capitol today with the state of the nation's economy as its chief concern. Senators and Representa tives, returning after nearly a month in their home states, re ported with consistency that the issues most arousing their constituents were high prices, high taxes and high interest rates. A spot check of several dozen members from both par ties indicated that economic dissatisfaction had replaced the war in Vietnam as the princi pal complaint of the voters, foreshadowing a 1970 Congres sional election keyed to infla tion and recession. “The economy,” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, “that's going to be the whole thing this year.” The Massachusetts Democrat observed that President Nixon seemed to be enjoying some success in pinning the respon sibility for inflation on Con gress and the level of Federal spending it is authorizing, but he said that this could shift by fall. “Historically, an Administra tion that can't control inflation gets blamed by the voters,” Mr. Kennedy said. Senator Marlow W. Cook, Republican of Kentucky, re ported that both business and labor leaders at home were dis cussing the prospect of wage and price controls, on the the ory that voluntary restraints were unavailing “when Gov ernment spending is running loose.” “I found very strong pressure for budget‐balancing,” Mr. Cook said. “The people understand a good deal more about inflation than the Government is giving them credit for.” Democrats were in basic if grudging agreement that Presi dent Nixon had succeeded in easing public concern over Viet nam during his first year in office. “There's less discussion now,” Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota said. “The av erage person thinks the Presi dent has us on the way out, that it's just a matter of time now. There's not the uneasiness there was a year ago.” In New Jersey, another Democrat, Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., found a similar situation. He said “people be lieve the President and his with drawal policy, and as a result there's a good deal less con versation about the war.” Two Middle Western Sena tors, Charles H. Percy of Illinois and Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, reported separately that they had found improve ment in the environment to be the issue arousing the most public interest. “It's the overwhelming is sue in our area,” Mr. Percy said. “There is concern, of course, about crime and high prices, but that comes when you raise the question. The issue of air and water pollution is self‐initiating; the people bring it up themselves.” Mr. Nelson said that infla tion was “a negative issue that gets people annoyed” while proposals to combat pollution produced a positive surge of interest. A few minutes later, he made just such a proposal on the Senate floor. Concern over economic prob lems did not appear to extend to unemployment, except in a few areas where the slowdown in the economy is already taking hold. Representative Martha Grif fiths, Democrat of Michi gan, said that some of her constituents were apprehensive over layoffs in the automobile industry, Senator Henry M. Jackson, also a Democrat, re ported that unemployment was a factor in Washington, where the aircraft and timber indus tries have suffered. Crime was listed as a major issue at home by Sena tor Thomas F. Eagleton, Democrat of Missouri, who pre dicted increased pressure for Federal legislation. He said that the public “does not make so phisticated distinctions” be tween the responsibilities of Congress and local law‐enforce ment officers when there is an outbreak of crime. “I've talked to people in all parts of the state,” said Sena tor William B. Saxbe, Republi can of Ohio, “and I'm con vinced that crime or fear of crime is the major domestic problem today.” But throughout the opening day interviews, pocketbook is sues predominated. Senator Harold E. Hughes, Democrat of Iowa, said that high prices and interest rates were “so far and above that nothing seems to stand beside them” as issues. Representative Nick Galifian akis, Democrat of North Caro lina, reported that complaints about food prices and high in terest rates “came through loud and clear” from his constituents during the Christmas recess.

1450-> NEW MINERAL PLAN ANNOUNCED IN PERU
LIMA, Peru, April 16 (Reu ters) — The Peruvian Govern anent decreed today that would take over the sale and refining of copper and all oth er minerals in the country in 18 months. However, the decree provid ed that rights to refine copper now in existence would be re tained, which indicated that the Oroya refinery of the Cerro de Pasco Corporation and the To quepala foundry of the South ern Peru Copper Corporation would continue to be operated by their current owners. Cerro de Pasco is a branch of the Cerro Corporation and Southern Peru is a subsidiary of the American Smelting and Refining Company, both United States‐owned. Robert P. Koenig, president of (the Cerro Corporation, a ma jor United States copper con cern with Peruvian holdings, said here yesterday that “on the basis of preliminary analysis, the law has no effect on exist ing mining, smelting and refin ing operations of our sub sidiary.” “However,” he said, “market ing and pricing of metals, par ticularly copper, is projected to come under the control of a Peruvian Government corpora tion.”

MINNEAPOLIS, April 15— The week‐long strike of most Minneapolis teachers continued today, with negotiations broken off between the school board and the city's Federation of Teachers. The board indicated that it was willing to negotiate, but the federation expressed disap pointment with the lack of progress and asked for the serv ices of a professional mediator. More than 2,000 of the city's public school teachers left their jobs a week ago in defiance of a state law that imposes auto matic dismissal and other sanc tions against public employes who go on strike. The teachers are asking for salary improve ments, class size reduction and other benefits.

1453-> PRESIDENT URGES SENATE TO ALTER TRADE MEASURE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 Speaking out today after a long silence, President Nixon sharply criticized the pending trade bill, which includes import quotas and restrictions that he opposes. The President said the changes proposed in the law “could have not only harmful short‐term consequences with ht our country, but also, in the long‐term, they could trigger international trade: practices destructive of the economy of the entire free world.” Mr: Nikon gave his views in a letter to Senator Hugh Scott, Republican of Pennsylvania, the Senate minority floor lead er. It was Senator Scott, not the White House, who made it public. The President did not urge, defeat of trade legislation, which has passed the House, but rather asked that the Sen ate “put this legislation into acceptable form” and pass it at this session of Congress. The President did not spe cifically say he would veto the bill if it were passed in its present form, though that was the implication. The problem may be that the trade bill could come to him attached to welfare and Social Security legislation that he wants. Nixon Avoids Veto Stand Later, at his news confer ence, the President declined to say whether he would veto the bill in its present form. But he said that, apart from textile quotas that he favors, the other import‐limiting provisions of the bill “will lose us more jobs than they will save” because they could lead to foreign re taliation against United States exports. [Question 20, Page 32.] Other White House sources recently explained that they did not wish to repeat the threat of a veto as long as they still had a chance to influence the writing of the bill. They said they figured uncertainty over veto might persuade Congress men to shape a bill to the President's liking. The President also said there was “some progress” in talks with Japan for a voluntary agreement to limit textile im ports. Although Mr. Nixon said he was still not satisfied, he added, “It is not as hopeless today as it was yesterday.” The changes in the pending legislation proposed by the President in his letter to Sen ator Scott are so sweeping that the Senate would hardly have time to amend the bill as he wants, pass it, reconcile differences with the House bill and still adjourn by Dec. 19 as is the present intention. The bill will not come up for floor consideration until next Tues day. The President made the fol lowing specific criticisms’ of the bill as it emerged from the Senate Finance Committee: flit includes import quotas on shoes, in addition to textile quotas, which Mr. Nixon again supported today. “It would invite import re strictions on numerous addi tional products because the escape clause in the present law has been loosened exces sively.” The escape clause is the mechanism by which indus tries damaged by imports can obtain relief in the form of higher tariffs or quotas. ”It would place import re strictions on several additional specific products.” Though the President did not name them, they are mink furs and glycine. The bill does not include authority for • repeal of the “American selling price” sys em of customs valuation, which leads to very high tariffs for some chemicals. It does not include an Ad ministration‐backed new sys tem of tax incentives for exports. Mr. Nixon said the bill “has portentous implications for the health of our economy and the vitality of trade among na tions.” He said he “vigorously” reaffirmed his support of ‘the far less sweeping original Ad ministration trade bill.

1454-> Plane's Backers Fight On; Place Hope in Conferees
Proponents of the supersonic transport, stunned by the Sen ate vote to halt funds for the plane, began working last night to keep the program alive. They hoped to push at least part of the proposed appropri ation through a Senate‐House conference. They were cau tiously optimistic but warned that a reduced appropriation would delay the inaugUration of commercial flights. They said it would also mean higher costs, and layoffs in areas already hard hit by aerospace cutbacks. William M. Magruder, the former test pilot who directs the Department of Transporta tion's SST program, got the bad news at his Washington home, where he has been try ing, not too successfully, to limit his work after a hospital check‐up. He immediately got on the phone to talk with leaders of the Senate's pro‐SST bloc and other supporters. Then his staff arrived for a strategy session. In a telephone interview, he said: “This was a vote for fiscal irresponsibility.” Mr. Magruder argued that revenues from worldwide sales of the airliner were vital to pay for social reforms Senators were constantly advocating, and he deplored Senate speeches saying “the SST is at odds with the priorities of the nation.” “I personally consider this the most monumental hypocrisy in the history of the. Senate,” he said. The mood among Govern ment and industry officials close to the program was a combination of shock, bitter ness and gloom—all leavened by a strain of hope that the program was not dead, just badly hurt. They took some hope from a statement in the Senate by Jacob K. Javits. The New York Republican said: “I for one would be willing to support a reduced appropri ation based on a renegotiated position for the Federal Govern ment with an expenditure . . . of an estimated $100‐million for the coming year—a sum which bears some relationship any how to the estimated termina tion costs if the existing con tract is canceled.” The figure is far below the $290‐million asked for by the Administration and approved previously, by a narrow margin, in the House. The Boeing Company, the air frame maker declined to spec ulate on how big an appropri ation would be needed if it was to press on with the project rather than end its own outlays and pull out. It said it could not comment until Congress had taken its final vote and “the situation is clarified.” The company state ment noted that “the options range from the full $290‐million to none at all”—an indication that it was prepared to stay the course at some compromise figure. Boeing has been building two prototypes on a schedule call ing for the first test flight in November, 1972. The engines are being built by the General Electric Company. In talking of “termination costs,” Senator Javits was re ferring to contract provisions that would require the Govern ment to reimburse contractors for dollar outlays on SST work. This would be necessary be cause cancellation now would be at the convenience of the Government, rather than be cause of any fault — such as failure to meet target dates or basic cost estimates — on the part of manufacturers. The Government has already put up more than $700‐million of its planned $1.3‐billion out lay for building two prototypes and running 100 hours of test flights. Cancellation would mean this money would go down the drain whereas, if the plane is successful, the Gov ernment is supposed to recover its outlays, plus interest, from royalties on sales. News of the vote was espe cially painful for Seattle, Boe ing's headquarters, because that city has already gone into an economic decline following sharp cutbacks in the aerospace and defense industries. Since even optimists did not forsee any chance of a complete reversal of the Senate vote, Seattle was virtually assured of sizable new layoffs. How would a partial appro priation affect work at the plant? Government officials work ing on the program suggested that the reduced funds would go for research on noise reduc tion and on questions raised by SST opponents who have warned of great harm that fleets of the supersonic airliners might inflict on the environ ment. They also said the money would probably go for “long lead time” items — plane parts, such as landing gears, wing spars and bulkheads, that take longer to manufacture than other items. The Senate vote precipitated new debate on what might now be the fate of the French British Concorde, a supersonic transport that has flown at its top speed of 1,400 miles an hour. (The United States plane is designed for a top speed of almost 1,800 miles an hour.) Some observers who think the world has no great need for a supersonic airliner just yet, and who are aware of the shortcomings of the European plane and its economic burden on the two Governments, thought any slowdown or can cellation of the American plane would increase chances that the Concorde will be abandoned. But others thought the Euro peans would now see the chance to capture the world's airliner market and redouble efforts with the Concorde pro gram. From Paris, Reuters reported that the French aircraft indus try viewed the Senate action as a boon to the Concorde.

1455-> BIG SOVIET CRUISER SAILS INTO ATLANTIC
NAPLES, Italy, Jan. 19 (AP) —The Soviet missile‐helicopter cruiser Moskva has left the Mediterranean and is sailing in the Atlantic for the first time, a United States Sixth Fleet spokesman said today. The 18,500‐ton ship, consid ered the soviet Navy's main antisubmarine‐warfare unit, was last spotted heading in a northwesterly direction 400 miles west of France, the spokesman said. The Norwegian defense staff in Oslo reported that a Soviet force of six or seven submarines, two supply ships and two other surface ships was sailing southwest in the Nor wegian Sea after passing North Cape over the weekend. The spokesman for the Sixth Fleet, which is based here, said the Moskva, with two small destroyer‐type ships passed through the Strait of Gibraltar before dawn Saturday. The Moskva entered the Med iterranean recently from the Turkish Straits for her fourth visit in 18 months and her first in winter. Essentially a defen sive vessel, she carries air de fense missiles fore and a heli copter platform aft. She also has torpedoes.

1456-> 3 Drug Companies Win Appeal Of '67 U.S. Antitrust Suit Here
The 1967 antitrust conviction of three drug companies on charges of controlling the pro duction and distribution of $1.7‐ million worth of antibiotics was reversed yesterday in a 2‐1 de cision by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals here. The majority ordered the case sent back to the Federal District Court for a new trial, principally because of errors it found in Judge Marvin E. Fran kel's instructions to the jury in 1967. Legal authorities said that the decision would not necessarily have any effect on more than a score of pending damage suits against the three companies, Chas. Pfizer & Co., Bristol Myers Company and the Amer ican Cyanamid Company. And John J. Powers Jr., chair man and president of Pfizer, said: “We intend to proceed with the settlement offers we have made. These settlement of fers were made irrespective of the outcome of this appeal.” The three companies and two others have offered a package of $105‐million to settle dam age claims by 43 states, hun dreds of cities and thousands of individual consumers. It includes a $5.6‐million offer to New York City. Mr. Powers's statement con tinued, “We are engaged in no settlement discussions beyond those announced, and we have no plans to engage in other such discussions.” Seven states and about 30 private plaintiffs are waiting to take their dam age suits to trial in Federal Court. Judge Inzer B. Wyatt has been hearing arguments on the proposed settlements and is also overseeing the damage suits, but has made no ruling yet. The Circuit Court's decision, written by Judge Leonard P. Moore, with Judge Paul R. Hays dissenting, said: “The Govern ment's case rests almost en tirely upon oral and written statements from the defendants themselves. Because of this cir cumstance, the facts may be said to be virtually undis puted.” But statements by Pfizer and by Bristol‐Myers said that the companies were innocent of the charges made by the Govern ment and that they had never violated the antitrust laws. In the 1961 indictment, a Federal grand jury alleged a conspiracy in the making and marketing of tetracycline, a so called “broad‐spectrum” anti biotic, which is made from aureomycin, on which Ameri can Cyanamid had a patent. The Government alleged that in meetings in November, 1953, Pfizer and American Cyanamid formed a conspiracy to fix prices on tetracycline, and that at another meeting, in Decem ber, 1955, Bristol‐Myers joined the conspiracy. The case went to trial in 1967, and the jury returned a guilty verdict, but the appel late court's majority yesterday found reversible error in the judge's charge, his instructions to the jury on the law. “Three‐quarters of the charge did not relate to the key issue, namely, the formation of the conspiracy,” the decision said. The majority opinion con tinued: “The jury thus entered upon its deliberations with its attention diverted from the real issues to patent fraud and unreasonably high prices — both inflammatory issues. Quite apart from their relevance, these [issues] could well have so prejudiced the jury that it either failed to resolve the pri mary issue or subordinated it to the issues stressed.” Because of the charges, and of rulings by Judge Frankel during the trial, Judges Moore and Henry J. Friendly decided, the defendants were entitled to a new trial. Judge Hays, dissenting, wrote that the jury had not been misled; noted that tetra cycline did not change price between 1953 and 1960, even though the cost of manufactur ing it went down; and con cluded, “I would affirm the judgment.” Judge Frankel had fined each of the companies $150,000 after the guilty verdict, but the pay ment was stayed pending the appeal.

1457-> DRAFT OF CRITICS OF WAR IS CURBED
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 — The Supreme Court ruled to day that the Selective Service System lacks the legal power to accelerate the induction of young men who turn in their draft cards to protest the Viet nam war. In an opinion written by Jus tice William 0. Douglas, the Court declared that the system of “delinquency” regulations, used by the Selective Service System to enforce its rules since World War I, was not author ized by the Selective Service Law. Antiwar protesters have been the most controversial targets of these delinquency rules. However, today's decision also stripped draft boards of the authority to speed the induc tion of men who fail to comply with such mundane obligations as keeping the draft board ad vised of their addresses and marital status. “There is no suggestion in the current draft law,” Justice Douglas said, that “the Selec tive Service has free‐wheeling authority to ride herd on the registrants, using immediate in duction as a disciplinary or vin dictive measure.” He added that unless “a vast rewriting” of the law by Con gress specifically gave the Se lective Service System the pow er to enforce its rules by speed ing up inductions, the Govern ment's only sanction would be to bring criminal charges for vi olation of Selective Service ob ligations. The opinion stressed that Congress had not laid down standards for the acceleration of induction and that the asserted discretion of draft boards to do so constitute a “broad, roving authority, a type of administrative abso lutism not congenial to our lawmaking traditions.” Sources within the Justice Department and the Selective Service System said that the handling of routine delinquency cases would probably not change greatly as a result of to day's ruling. In most instances the threat of early induction has been enough to bring errant regis trants into compliance. The threat of prosecution Is expect ed to serve the same purpose. The decision undercuts the letter written on Oct. 26,1967, by the Selective Service direc tor, Lieut. Gen. Lewis B. Her shey, which encouraged the reclassification of registrants who were turning in their draft cards in the wave of antiwar protests that were be ing held across the country. Today's decision concerned David Earl Gutknecht, wh?? threw his draft credentials at the foot of a United State marshal at the Federal Build ing in Minneapolis during a protest demonstration on Oct 16, 1967. Mr. Gutknecht had already been classified 1‐A and was appealing his draft board's re fusal to classify him as a con scientious objector. He was de clared delinquent and was or dered to report for induction in five days. When he refused to be inducted he was convict ed of refusing to perform a duty required of him by the Selective Service laws and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. In overturning his convic tion, the Court did not specifi cally rule on the draft boards' power to take away defer ments of those who turn in their draft cards and to re classify them 1‐A, although the broad language of Justice Douglas's opinion cast great doubt upon all such delin quency regulations. The opinion was joined by Justices Hugo L. Black, Wil liam J. Brennan Jr., John M. Harlan, Thurgood Marshall and Byron R. White. Justice White restricted his approval to the delinquency rule at issue in this case. Justice Harlan said that the delinquen cy rules could be legally en forced if registrants' rights to bring themselves into compli ance and avoid early induction were carefully protected. Chief Justice Warren E. Bur ger joined a concurring opin ion by Justice Potter Stewart, which took no position on the legality of the delinquency rules. They said that Mr. Gut knecht's rights had been vio lated when he was denied the usual appeal for registrants found to be delinquent. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the Selective Service System declined to comment officially on the rul ing today. A Justice Depart ment source said that about 7,500 men now in uniform had been inducted on a speeded‐up basis for delinquency. These men are not expected to be affected by the ruling, but law yers in the Government point ed out that the opinion did not say whether it would be ap plied retroactively to men who had turned in their draft cards and had been prosecuted for refusing induction. MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 19 (UPI) —Mr. Gutknecht today called the decision “a limited vitcory for the draft resistance move ment.” “It was argued in late No vember, and took quite a while, really,” he said. “Oh, yeah, it's a big load off my mind.” “This is a limited victory for the draft resistance movement. So was the change to a lottery system, although the military wanted it, too. So was getting rid of Hershey.” “I know this was an impor tant case,” he said. “There are at least five cases here in Min nesota —John Foster Jr., Dan Holland, John Seamon Jr.—and several around the country being held up until there was a decision.

1459-> N.A.A.C.P.Official Says Nixon Did Little for Negroes Last Year
The Nixon Administration's first year was “a mixed bag” with “more negative than posi tive aspects” for black Amer icans, the assistant executive director of the National Associ ation for the Advancement of Colored People said yesterday. The official, Dr. John A. Mor sell, accused the Administration of making a gesture of helping Negroes “when it won't cost them anything and when the Southern strategy is not af fected.” Speaking, at a news confer ence at the Park Sheraton Hotel after the N.A.A.C.P.'s 61st annual hoard meeting, Dr. Mor sell said: “I don't think this Administration feels the Negro voter is as vital to its success as white voters.” He added: “I think this is a mistake.” The recently announced Phil adelphia Plan, a Federal pro gram that would set hiring goals for black workers and apprentices in the construction industry, was a positive effort, Dr. Morsell said. But other Administration moves, Dr. Morsell said, were not in the best interests of Negroes. These, he said, in cluded: ¶The nomination of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. to the Supreme Court. ¶“Scuttling of the 1965 Vot ing Rights Act that should have been extended for five years.” ¶Relaxation of some school desegregation guidelines. ¶Approval of “textile indus try contracts with firms whose records of job discrimination were as long as the distance from the White Ilouse to the Capitol.” Dr. Morsell, who took the place of an ailing Roy Wilkins, N.A.A.C.P. executive director, at the news conference, said the Nixon proposal to provide a $1,600 a year minimum to poor families was on the one hand a “good principle, estab lishing a floor.” However, he said, the funds are not acle7 quate for many poor families. minimum of $5,500 a year for a family of four was rec ommended by the recent Con jerence on Hunger, in Wash ington, Dr. Morsell said. Dr. Morsell said he had mixed feelings about the Black Panthers party. He said that while the Panthers often “ter rified whites” and thereby “eroded some progress” in race relations, they also “produced pride in race which many die ments of the Negro community needed.” He recalled instances in which the Panthers and the N.A.A.C.P. had worked in co alitions in several cities and said that the Chicago Panthers leader, Fred Hampton, who was shot to death by policemen re cently, had been the leader of the N.A.A.C.P. youth organiza tion in Maywood, Ill. The official doubted, how ever, that the Panthers would become a threat to the 461,957‐ member N.A.A.C.P. in compet ing for the loyalties of black Americans. “The Panthers will not be guide for Negroes in the future unless a lot of unfortunate things happen that I do not be lieve will happen here,” Dr. Morsel, said. Dr. Morsell reported an in crease of 10,000 in the N.A.A.C.P. membership and told 70 asso ciation leaders that the organi zation raised $3,635,500 during 1969. He said the N.A.A.C.P. had been active during 1969 in variety of court cases, Con gressional actions, employment, housing and educational pro grams in all 50 states. The N.A.A.C.P. executive di rector, Mr. Wilkins, 68 years old, underwent abdominal sur gery at University Hospital in lower Manhattan yesterday and was later reported to be in “satisfactory condition.” Officials of the organization said that an X‐ray last week had disclosed “a spot” on his abdomen. No turther details could be obtained from either the N.A.A.C.P. or the hospital.

1461-> NixonSaysU.S.Will Bomb North if Foe Steps Up War
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 President Nixon declared to night that if North Vietnamese Forces “increase the level of fighting in South Vietnam,” as American forces are withdrawn, he would retaliate by ordering the bombing of military targets in North Vietnam.ed States and North Vietnam in 1968 during the Administra tion of Lyndon B. Johnson. At a nationally televised news conference, the President also Transcript of Nixon's news conference is on Page 32. said that he would continue to order the bombing of missile and military complexes in North Vietnam if United States reconnaissance planes were fired upon over North Vietnam. [Question 1, Page 32.] The President thus seemed to broaden his interpretation of the understanding that he said was reached between the Unit As part of that understand ing, as previously defined here, the United States agreed to suspend the bombing of North Vietnam. In return the Hanoi Government reportedly agreed to cease infiltration through the demilitarized zone, to stop the shelling of cities in South Vietnam and to enter into “productive” discussions in Paris, which required the seat ing of South Vietnam at the negotiating table. In discussing foreign‐policy matters, the President also made these points: (life considers that any ex tended, unilateral cease‐fire over the holiday season would be dangerous but the United . . . . States is prepared to enter into a “limited” cease‐fire with the Communist side. [Question 1.] He can forsee no circum stances under which the United States‐ would use • ground troops .in .Cambodia. [Question 9and 19.] He has not ‘abandoned hope in the Paris peace negatia dons, but North Vietnam's re jection of a prisoner exchange offer, made in Paris today, will “pinpoint” Hanoi as “an inter national outlaw.” [Question 6.] He said there were no plans to change the Administration's policy of opposing admission of Communist .China to • the United Nations, although the United States would continue to try to open “channels of commuica tions” with Peking. [Question 24.] . He did not believe United States security was threatened by. Soviet naval activity in the Caribbean. [Question 17.] He foresaw continuing diffi culties in relations with the Soviet Union but saw some areas for negotiation. [Question 22.1 Seems to Broaden Ban In giving his interpretation of the understanding governing bombing in North Vietnam, the President seemed to broaden the prohibition against North Vietnamese :infiltration across the demilitarized zone .to in clude any general increase in North Vietnamese miilitary activities and capacity in South Vietnam. Emphasizing that he wanted to be “very sure that the understanding is clear,” Mr. Nixon said that as American forces are withdrawn from South Vietnam, it becomes “vitally important” to take steps to protect the remaining troops. “If, as a result of my conclu sion that the North Vietnamese by their infiltration threaten our remaining forces; if they thereby develop a capacity and proceed possibly to use that capacity to increase the level of fighting in South Vietnam. then I Will order the bombing of military sites in North Vietnam, the passes that lead from North Vietnam into South Vietnam, the military complexes and the military supply lines,” he said. Stresses Reconnaissance To avoid any “misunder standing” on the part of North Vietnam, the President also em phasized that the United States reserved the right to conduct reconnaissance flights over North Vietnam without any in terference. “I must ‘insist that there be continued reconnaissance over North Vietnam,” he said, “be cause as we are withdrawing our forces, I have to see whether or not there's any chance of a strike against those forces that remain, and we have to watch for the build‐Up. “If’ our planes are fired upon, I will not only order that they return the fire, but I will order that the missile sites be de stroyed and that the military complex around that site which supports it also be destroyed by bombing.” In the past, the President's warnings of retaliation against North Vietnam were vague, but both he and other ranking offi cials have made them increas ingly specific. Following are the principal policy declarations:. April 20, 1970 — President Nixon: “If I conclude that in creased enemy action jeopar dizes our remaining forces in Vietnam, I shall not hestitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation.” May 2, 1970—Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird: “Now if that [understanding] is vio lated in a substantial way— major infiltration—I would rep ommend , the . use of air power in the North.”. ‐ Nov. 21, 1970—Mr. Laird: “As part of our, publicly. an nounced policy and determined effort to protect American lives, we are conducting limited dura tion protective ‐ reaction air strikes against missiles and antiaircraft ‐ gun sites and re lated facilities in ‘North. Viet nam south of the 19th Parallel. These protective’ reaction mis sions are designed to protect the lives of U. S. pilots’ flying unarmed ‐reconnaissance mis sions over North Vietnam and pilots flYing missions associated with interdiction of North Vietnamese . military supplies throughout southern Laos.’ Nov. 24,. 1970—Mr. Laird: “I would recommend calling off that. cessation’ of bombing should there be major . viola tions. of, these understandings. I have always said that if a major force, a force comes across the demilitarized zone, I would be strong in my recom mendation.” While • threatening action against North Vietnam today, the President was emphatic in ruling out a future American military role in, Cambodia. Asked whether he could ‘fore see any circumstances in which American .ground forces would be used in Cambodia, the Piesi dent tersely. replied: “None whatever.” • Then he was asked’ how he could preVent an Ame'riCan military aid • program from escalating. into. “a guarantee for the survival” of the .Cam bodian Government.. The Pres ident described the proposed aid program ‘now before Con gress for approval ‘as ‘the best interest in • foreign assistance that the United States‐ has made in my political lifetime.” Noting that the Cambodian forces were “tying down” some 40;000 North Vietnamese regu lar troops that otherWiSe would be in South Vietnam “killing Arnericans,’ the president said, “The dollars we send to Cam bedia save American lives and permit us to, Americans home.” ‘ The President thus reinforced Secretary of State William P. Rogers, who earlier ‘in the day on Capitol Hill emphasized that the Cambodian aid program was essential to the Vietnam ization program and did not represent a commitment to the Pnompenh Government of Pre mier Lon Nol. In his appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Com mittee, Mr. Rogers also stressed that the Nixon. Administra tion had “ no intention of introducing ground troops into Cambodia, if only ,because the Administration was restricted by domestic “political impera tives” from becoming involved in a ground war in that coun try. “The political imperatives are such that this Administra tion can't get involved because we wouldn't have popular sup port, because we wouldn't get Congressional support,” he said. In his first public appearance before the committee in nearly 18 months, Mr. Rogers testified for more than three hours in support of the Administration's request for $1‐billion supple mentary military aid, including $255‐million for Cambodia.

This total, released yester day by the fund's board chair man, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, president and publisher of The New York Times, compares with $987,063.95 received from 17,238 contributors in the pre vious year. The appeal, which began Dec. 7 and ended on Feb. 28, was the 58th annual search for funds to relieve the suffering of the destitute and unfortu nate in the metropolitan area. Of the total received, $900, 276.60 came directly to The Times from 13,768 contribu tors, while $52,952, from 1,810 contributors went directly to the eight agencies participating in the appeal. All costs of ad ministering the appeal were, as in the past, borne by the New York Times Company. In making his announcement to members of the board, Mr. Sulzberger noted that, begin ning with the 1970–71 cam paign, The Times would no longer publish lists of donors as part of its promotion for the fund and that, instead, a contribution would be made to the fund. “The cost of preparing and publishing the listing of thous ands of names of donors is considerable and growing,” he said. “We think this money is better spent on the needy, es pecially these days when the philanthropies are hard pressed and must squeeze every penny they can out of every dollar they get.” The following table shows the distribution of the funds received during the campaign, with undesignated gifts allo cated to the eight agencies ac cording to prearranged per centages: ?? ??

1466-> Humphrey Urges Democrats to Avoid Divisive Prirmaries in 1972
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 _ Hubert H. Humphrey believes that Democratic leaders should unite behind the party's most promising Presidential candi date within the next year, avoiding any divisive primary competition and saving the party's financial resources for the battle against President Nixon. “In December of 1971 if one man is ahead, Democrats ought to join ranks and get him nomi nated,” the former Vice President said. “The Democratic, party cannot go through what it did in 1968.” Questioned by reporters at breakfast meeting, Mr. Hum phrey, now Senator‐elect from Minnesota, denied that this ar rangement would undercut cur rent party efforts to inject more popular participation into the choice of candidates and platform. “Our Democratic friends had better learn this lesson,” he de clared sternly. “We are not so rich in votes, talent or money that we can afford to squander any of it on fratricidal con flict.” The Humphrey strategy, taken at face value, would ap pear to enhance the national prospects of Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine. He is the acknowledged front‐runner at this point, and most Democrats agree he can only be diverted if one of the other competitors beats him in the primaries. For himself, Mr. Humphrey said he was not seeking the 1972 Presidential nomination and did not intend to but that he might “re‐evaluate” this decision if no obvious front‐run ner emerged from Democratic competition and party leaders expressed interest in his run ning. “I'm not opening any office,” he said. “I'm going to stay free and loose. I'm not going to manage anybody's campaign.” Mr. Humphrey went to some lengths to indicate he did not expect to lead party opposition to President Nixon when he re turns to the Senate next month. But then he added some fairly harsh criticism of both the achievements and the spirit of the Administration. “I'm not going to be a haran ger,” Mr. Humphrey declared. “I'm not going to be a profes sional Presidential critic or Nixon‐hater. I'm not going to do that sort of thing.” Finds ‘No Artistry’ At various other times, how ever he accused the President of “just sort of wobbling around” on the economy and contributing to “a crisis of gov ernment in. the United States” by failure to move in the area of urban affairs. He also charged the Administration with “a lack of social sensi tivity.” “This Administration knows how to play the piano, but It's not a musician,” Mr. Humphrey, said. “There is no artistry, sen sitivity or sense of liveliness and life to it Without specifying What political role he foresaw for himself, the Minnesota Demo crat said he was prepared “to do a little moving and shak ing in the country,” traveling and speaking on both party and governmental matters. “The Democratic party is going to hear from me,’ he said. “I intend to offer some thing to the party. “I'm a little firmer than I used to be, and intend to insure that the Demo cratic party doesn't go ber serk.” He explained the last com ment by saying he would op pose any attempt by “crypto isolationists” to dominate the party on national security mat ters. “I want to make sure we don't out,” Mr. Humphrey cop said. “I don't think we can with draw from the world. We have tremendous responsibilities.”

1467-> Letter Purportedly by Hughes Backs Tool Company in Dispute
LAS VEGAS, Nev., Dec. 10— A longhand letter purportedly from Howard R. Hughes turned up here today. In it, he chides two of his executives for not solving “the problem of Ma heu,” and complains that “this bad publicity seems to con tinue.” It was said also that a finger print described as one of Mr. Hughes was attached to the let ter, and that it was being, checked against fingerprints known to be his. Hughes Tool Company executives said dur ing the afternoon that the letter Indeed was a copy of one they had received. The letter was obtained by Don Digilio, editor of The Las Vegas Review‐Journal. Mr. Digilio would not say where it had come from except that his source was someone close to the power struggle., Mr. Hughes's Nevada holdings in clude airports, ranches, casi nos, hotels, residential pro perties, and mining claims. The letter was addressed to “Dear Chester and Bill,” who are Chester C. Davis, chief counsel, and Frank William Gay, senior vice president, both, of the Hughes Tool Company.’ They have been here since last Friday night in an attempt to remove Robert A. Maheu from his post as director of Mr. Hughes's Nevada operations. They have also given a dismis sal notice to Jack H. Hooper as director of security. Mr. Maheu had refused to go until directly notified by Mr. Hughes, who he says hired him four years ago. In court and out for this week, much of the secrecy has been stripped away from Mr. Hughes's life style, and from his business operations. “I do not support Maheu or Hooper,” the letter said. At an other point, Mr. Hughes com plained that his call last Mon day morning to Gov. Paul Laxalt and District Attorney George E. Franklin Jr. failed to put an end to the controversy. The letter was signed “My sincere regards, Howard R. Hughes.” The photographically reproduced copy made avail able to The New York Times showed scratched out words and a scrawling style of pen manship. While the fight on control continued in District Court, in siders predicted privately that an out‐of‐court settlement was imminent. In addition to Mr. Gay and Mr. Davis, C. J. Collier Jr., vice president and treasurer of Hughes Tool, is opposing Mr. Maheu and Mr. Hooper. The dispute in court is over a motion to dissolve a tempor ary restraining order obtained by Mr. Maheu last Saturday that forbids officers of the tool company from interfering with casino operations. The hearing was broken off dramatically yesterday to per mit a meeting last night in which Mr. Maheu and Mr. Davis came together in Gover nor Laxalt's suite at a motel. The meeting ended without agreement and the trial re sumed again this morning. TEXT OF THE LETTER I do not understand why the problem of Maheu is not yet fully settled and why this bad publicity seems to con tinue. It could hurt our com pany's valuable properties in Nevada and also the entire state. I believe my company is one of the biggest employers if not the biggest in the state, and surely what damages an entity employing this many Nevadans is bad for the state itself. You told me that, if I called Governor Laxalt and District Attorney George Franklin, It would put an end to this problem. I made these calls, and do not understand why this very damaging publicity should continue merely be cause the properly consti tuted board of directors of Hughes Tool Company de cided, for reasons they con sider just, to terminate all relationship with Maheu and Hooper. I ask you to take whatever action is necessary to accom plish the objective briefly outlined above. I ask you now please to inform the members of the board of Hughes Tool Com pany of my desires and feel ings in respect to this matter. It is not my wish to try to tell the board what action should be taken. That is their job but it seems there has been some uncertainty as to where I stand, and I want this cleared up at once. I do not support Maheu or Hooper in their defiance of the Hughes Tool Company board of directors, and deeply desire all concerned to be fully aware of this immediately. I ask you to do everything in your power to put an end to these problems, and further I ask you to obtain immediate a full report ac counting of any and all funds and/or property to which Mr. Maheu may have had access. As I have said; this matter has caused me the very gravest concern and is dam aging my company‐ and all the loyal men and women associated with me in the very deepest and far reaching way.

1469-> 2 Highly Placed, but Little Known, Capitol Figures
WASHINGTON,‐ Jan. 12— Nathan M. Voloshen is a man known to many on Capitol Hill, but what they know—or acknowledge they know—about the man who was indicted in New York today is meager. It is clear, however, that from his youth in Baltimore, the son of immigrant parents, he rose to a position of standing: He was the man to see it you needed help in dealing with a wide assortment of Federal departments or agencies. Mr. Voloshen cut a neat, well‐dressed figure in the Capitol lobbies, through which he strode at a pace that belied his years. He was not a backslapper, according to those who saw him move through the House corridors; but he was not reserved. “I never heard him use a vulgarism,” recalled John Monahan, Speaker John W. McCormack's secretary. “I never saw soup on his tie. I never heard him tell a smutty story.” Mr. Voloshen was often in the House dining room for breakfast, sitting with the Massachusetts delegation or at the Texas table or maybe with the Congressmen from Oklahoma. “He hung his hat in the House restaurant and was always passing out a pocket ful of fancy cigars,” one Congerssman said. Often he was seen using the telephones in the suite of offices supervised by Dr. Martin Sweig for Speaker McCormack. If yoU ask his friends how Mr. Voloshen was known on the Hill, they'll tell you “as a New York lawyer.” That is not quite accurate, even as a title. Mr. Voloshen is a member of the Maryland bar, to which he was admitted on Dec. 28, 1918. But he has never been admitted to the New York bar. Mr. Voloshen, who has con sistently refused to talk with reporters, even about his per sonal background, was born on Aug. 14, 1899, in Balti more, the son of Benjamin and Sarah Voloshen, who were born in Russia. He attended Baltimore City College, dropping out in his junior year. He went on to the University of Mary land, where he studied law, but during his final year he apparently switched to Johns Hopkins and took the Stu dents Army Training Corps course, a World War I tem porary replacement for the Reserve Officers Training Corps. In 1918, he received his law degree. Althoughthe Maryland law school file on Nathan Volo shen's attendance is miss ing, the Maryland yearbook, “Terra Mariae,” for 1918 had this to say about him: “Immediately upon the mention of Nathan's name, we think of a staunch and kindly friend and witty, agreeable companion. His friendship is the kind you prize, for it is untainted by selfish motives. “In him you can place complete confidence know ing that it will not be abused or used to unjust ends. . . Well, Nathan, here's our best wishes. We have no fears of your success.” The young Voloshen en tered the Navy on Oct. 4, 1918, as an apprentice sea man in the Navy section of the Johns Hopkins. University Student Army Training Corps. He was relieved from active duty two months later, hav ing been admitted to the bar. Nathan Voloshen went into partnership with his brother Jacob in a law firm, Voloshen and Voloshen, in Baltimore. Jacob died in 1928, and the firm was dis solved. It must have been shortly after this that Nathan moved to New York City, where he apparently became associated with several credit agencies. In the nineteen‐forties and fifties he worked in the New York law firm of Hartman, Sheridan & Tekulsky. The firm no longer exists. How ever, one of the lawyers who knew Mr. Voloshen at the firm described him as “a very personable fellow [who was] pretty well connected in Washington.” “He could at least get a door open for you,” the law yer said. “He was a trouble shooter—if somebody had some problems with an ad ministrative department in Washington and you wanted to expedite things, you'd go to Nat.” In September, 1962, Mr. Voloshen acquired — for an unknown price‐72 per cent of the stock of the General Armature and Manufacturing Company of Lock Haven, Pa. Three months later, he sold the firm—which was reportedly deeply in debt—to the Maremont Corporation of Chicago. The Sperry Gyroscope. Di vision of Sperry Rand—a de fense contractor—has said it signed a retainer contract with Mr. Voloshen “for le gal services” in November, 1964. The agreement ex pired in October, 1966. Mr. Voloshen remarried after the death of his first wife, Stella. He and his pres ent wife, Elaine, live at the 10 Park Avenue Hotel. He has a daughter by his first marriage, Mrs. Marjorie Aronstein, and a grand daughter, Mrs. Susan Cantor, both of Manhattan. Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON, Jan. 12— Martin Sweig has been known for years in political circles here and in Boston as “the mysterious Dr. Sweig” — in jocular tribute to his Ph.D. degree in history, his vaguely foreign accent, and his in scrutable appearance. It was not, however, until he vanished months ago— suspended after 24 years from the service of House Speaker John W. McCormack —that people reflected seri ously on just how mysterious he was, and how many paradoxical impressions he had left behind. By close acquaintances, Dr. Sweig is now described as humorless and “funnier than a Shelley Berman record,” as tight‐fisted and compulsively generous, as a ruthless prac titioner of legislative pres sure politics and as an only modestly effective errand boy for Speaker McCormack. Within the Speaker's of fice, there are those who revere Dr. Sweig and those who dislike him intensely. Staff members in other house offices had a saying that, “when John McCormack clutches for his heart, a thou sand hands will clutch for Martin's throat.” Yet even among those who loved Dr. Sweig least, there was apparently no sus picion of corruption or the grand‐scale dealings with which he was charged today. In appearance, the 48‐year‐ old bachelor suggested to some a Peter Sellers playing the part of a shy clerk. Now, many see him as a personifi cation of the power that ac rues over long years to the shrewd, typically anonymous, staff members in the power ful offices of the Capitol. Martin Sweig was the Speaker's senior and (at $36, 000 a year) highest paid as sistant. He was also a close friend who usually accompa nied the 77‐year‐old Speaker on his Washington rounds. Yet there was no large scope to Dr. Sweig's profes sional duties. As the adminis trative assistant in the “dis trict office” that dealt with Mr. McCormack's Boston con stituents, Dr. Sweig worked in effect for Representative McCormack, not Speaker Mc Cormack. Well removed from the draftsmanship and lobbying of national legislation, Dr. Sweig was a man whose stock ‐ in ‐ trade was that staple of old Boston poli tics, the favor—helping wid ows find apartments in the city's public housing, promot ing candidates to the military academies, obtaining Federal grants for Boston's city gov ernment, or loosening aid funds for the local univer sities. In the office of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, it was a point of irritation that favor‐seekers from Boston would sometimes remark that if Senator Kennedy couldn't satisfy them, “the Speaker's office”—which meant Dr. Sweig—would solve their problems in no time. Dr. Sweig, who was known more widely as “the Doc tor” than as “Marty,” lived only a few blocks from the Capitol and arrived early every morning for breakfast with Speaker McCormack and the rest of the Massa chusetts delegation in the House dining room. He nor mally spent as many as 12 hours a day, including Satur; days in the Speaker's back office, juggling dozens of phone calls hour after hour. “He was the sort of guy,” said a fellow McCormack aide, “who, if you asked him for a match while he was working, would bark, ‘No.’ After work he'd buy you a pack of cigarettes.” Some who have dealt with Dr. Sweig say that the real core of his technique was to relate every call to Speaker McCormack personally. On trifling items of which the Speaker might not have been aware, his opening line was, “The Speaker wants . . . or “The Speaker insists. . . .” Dr. Sweig was born to German Jewish immigrants on Jan. 9, 1922, in Winthrop, Mass., a working‐clas town on Boston Harbor, where his brother Philip still runs the family's kosher meat market. Yiddish was his first lan guage and many close friends here took his lingering “accent” as a sign that he had grown up abroad. After public schools in Winthrop, he went to Georgetown University in Washington. It was on an in formal tour of the Congress that he first met John McCormack, then the Major ity Leader, and was hired as a clerical assistant at the salary of $1,000 a year. After he graduated to full time assistant, he continued as a part‐time student, and took his doctoral degree in 1953 with a dissertation on the Boer War. His conversation and his bookshelves (including “The Goebbels Diaries” and 15 volumes of “Documents on German Foreign Policy”) attest a special fascination with Germany, and the Third Reich in particular.

1470-> South Africa Constructing Uranium Enrichment Plant
CAPETOWN, July 25 (Reu ters)—Prime Minister John Vorster has announced that construction is under way in South Africa on a uranium en richment plant to compete with existing plants in the west. The South African, Atomic Energy Board is building a pilot plant on the basis of a new process developed by South Af rican nuclear scientists, Mr. Vorster said. Speaking in the House of Assembly, he said: I must em phasize that our sole objective in the further development and application of the process is to promote the peaceful ap plication of nuclear, energy.

1471-> TEEN‐AGERS PLAN FIGHT ON DRUGS
Teen‐agers working In the city's Youth Service Agency announced last week that more than 35,000 of their contempo raries here had signed pledgds to fight drug use as a fashion able thing for young people. In a program called We Can, summer Youth Corps and Ur ban Corps workers have or ganized the volunteers to sponsor speaker programs, antinarcotics rallies, and film presentatioris on drugs. Their goals were discussed at a news conference last week in which the youths spoke as a tape recorder played rock music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones that implicitly praised drug use, a phenom enon the group is fighting. “We're not necessarily tell ing kids what to do or what not to do,” said 18‐year‐old Bill McCrimmon, one of We Can's directors. “That kind of approach has never worked. We want to present kids with the facts and they'll make up their own minds you can be sure.” At a neighborhood Youth Center in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn for example half a dozen representatives of We Can showed two films last week to 50 teen‐agers. After ward, 17‐year‐old Willie Car ter, another director, talked about the general problem. “If you meet another cat on the street you call him your brother or sister,” Mr. Carter told the group. “Now what would you do if your real brother or sister got strung out on dope? Would you help him? You've got to treat every black brother and sister that way. Because that stuff is de stroying us. We've got to fight it.” The place where Mr. Carter was speaking is one of 35 Youth Service. Centers that, along with dozens more at city schools, make up the network for the Youth Service Agency. The agency's programs are financed largely by the Federal Government to provide recrea tion and jobs for the city's youth, but the We Can program is strictly voluntary. Its 40 steering committee directors, representing different districts around New York, meet once a week downtown to compare notes on local activities. As with all their activities, the youngsters are handling plans for a possible anti‐drug rally later this summer by themselves, with only minimal supervision from the Youth Service Agency's officials. “They have to do it on their own,” said Marta Valle, the agency's commissioner. “The only way we can aid is to help them open up their minds, to take a look at things. But they must reach their own conclu sions. That's what youth is tell ing us today.” With this attitude, the teen agers have mailed letters to different organizations to solic it support. They have already broadcast their message on some radio stations that make time available for public serv ice announcements. The Youth Service Agency — an arm of the city's Human Resources Administration — attempts to help dropouts and other troubled youngsters. The Neighborhood Youth Corps is a summer program providing jobs for eight weeks for 35,000 young people 14 to 21 years old. They earn $1.50 an hour and are required to use part of each week for study. The Urban Corps is a four‐ year‐old city, program that en ables more than 3,000 students from 150 colleges and univer sities to work as “internes” in local government agendas. “Let's face it,” said Mr. Carter last week. “Everthing the adults have tried has failed. If I can go in to these communities to talk about drugs, people might listen. I'm black and I have the same frustrations they have, but I know I can't afford to be hooked on dope. If I say that, maybe people will listen.

1472-> DROP REGISTERED BY WORLD SUGAR
World sugar futures prices dropped yesterday as a result of a decision by the executive committee of the International Sugar Organization, meeting in London, not to release more sugar to the world free‐market at this time. A rush of sell orders caused a six‐minute trading suspension on the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange here so that traders could check their or ders. At the close of the ses sion, losses ranged from 10 to 12 points (hundredth of a cent a pound.) London world sugar futures prices ended down 2 to 3 points but brokers in this country ex pressed the belief that the full impact of the news in London came too late. They also felt that the com mittee's action indicated that present supplies were ample to keep prices in check. In addi tion, it was pointed out, that the Sugar Council has set im port quotas for 1971 at 95 per cent of basic tonnages in the sugar pact. The 1970 export quotas are at 90 per cent. Trading in the world sugar contract here established one‐day high of 3,498 sales of 50 long tons each compared with the previous record of 2,804 on Nov. 20 of this year. Cocoa futures prices contin ued their upward trek — the third day in a row—in moder ate trading. The nearby March option, the busiest, with 273 sales, rose to 29.02 cents from 28.78 cents a pound the day before. The nearby May con tract, with 132 sales, increased to 29.42 from 29.16 cents pound on Tuesday.

1473-> Nixon Seeks to Keep Staff From ‘Politics’
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3— President Nixon reportedly plans to reorganize Republican political operations so as to divorce day‐by‐day politics from the Presidential staff. A separation of functions would enable the President to assert that he had “taken the White House out of politics,” even if, as expected, he and some of his aides retained con trol over party affairs. It would fit with Mr. Nixon's privately expressed intention to seek re‐election, like most past Presidents, as a “states man” and not a political partisan. In its present form, sources close to the White House said, the reorganization plan calls for Bryce N. Harlow, a coun selor to the President, to take over as chairman of the Re publican National Committee. The present chairmap, Repre sentative Rogers C. B. Morton of Maryland, will be nominated soon as Secretary of the In terior. The sources also said that Mr. Nixon's two principal po litical liaison men, Harry S. Dent and Murray Chotiner, would accompany Mr. Harlow to the National Committee. Whether the plan will be put into effect will depend in part on whether the President is able to persuade Mr. Harlow, an old friend from the Eisen hower era, to make the switch. Mr. Harlow, who is 54 years old, has expressed some reluctance. Friends of the White House aide said that he wanted to re turn as soon as possible to his lucrative job as chief Washing ton lobbyist for the Procter & Gamble Company. They ques tioned whether the company would be willing to continue his leave of absence if he in volved himself overtly in political management. The sources also said that Mr. Dent and Mr. Chotiner were reluctant to leave the White House for the National Commit tee. The hesitancy by all three was said to be one indication that actual political power would continue to be wielded within the White House regard less of who took over the party chairmanship. Asked about reports linking him with the chairmanship, Mr. Harlow replied: “I can categorically confirm that there are such rumors and they are all‐pervasive. You can write that Harlow's com ment was obfuscating.” Most White House and Na tional Committee officials be lieve that Mr. Nixon will suc ceed in persuading Mr. Harlow to take the new job. If the President does not — either because he decides not to “lean” very hard or be cause Mr. Harlow is adamant — the situation could become confused, with no clear alter nate candidate. Donald Rumsfeld, the direc tor of the Office of Economic Opportunity, who had been prominently mentioned for the job, has reportedly persuaded the President or his advisers that he was not the man for the job. Representative George Bush of Texas; another early possibility, had not been ap proached as of yesterday. Suggestions by Tower Many leading Republicans have said, publicly in some cases and privately in others, that they would not want the job because the National Com mittee has not had and will not have real power. Senator John G. Tower of Texas, chairman of the Repub lican Senatorial Campaign Com mittee, said today that the new chairman should be someone the White House trusts and that the committee should be given more authority for setting political strategy. “I think it is proper to say,” Senator Tower remarked at a news conference, “that there is some sentiment for placing more of the Administration's political operations with the National Committee and Na tional Chairman.” Of the 1970 campaign, he said, “Morton and I worked very well together, but very often we were not aware of what the White House was doing.” Much the same view has been expressed privately by the professional staff at the com mittee in recent days. Sources there said they would not be surprised to see Mr. Harlow and Mr. Dent moved over from the White House, although one official said he did not expect Mr. Chotiner to be involved. Mr. Nixon's projected reor ganization would give at least the appearance of substantiv‐3 duties for the national com mittee. But few Republicans doubt that. Attorney General John N. Mitchell will organize and oper ate Mr. Nixon's 1972 campaign, probably from an office sepa rate from the committee. Both Mr. Rumsfeld and Robert H. Finch, another Pres idential counselor, are expezted to continue to provide polities’ counsel to Mr. Nixon from with‐I in the White House. According to a well‐placed Re publican Senator, an informal selection committee has been set up at the White House to handle the reorganization. The Senator said its members were Mr. Nixon, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Finch and Mr. Harlow, with the President obviously holding veto power.

1474-> EFFICIENCY CHANGES PROPOSED IN SENATE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 — Two freshman Senators pro posed today a series of rela tively minor changes in Senate customs and procedures that, they said, would enable the chamber to operate much more effectively. Senator. Alan Cranston, Dem ocrat of California, and Sena tor William B. Saxbe, Republi can of Ohio, said their pro posals had been well received by the policy committees of both parties and were now under consideration by the Democratic and Republican leaders. Most of the changes can be implemented without nor mally changing Senate rules, which would require a vote. One proposal would have the Senate reces on the final Wednesday of each month and not reconvene until the follow ing Monday. Another proposal would limit the last 15 minutes of each de bate to summations of the posi tions on both sides of an issue. Another of the Senators’ sug gestions would have the Ap propriations Committee con sider money legislation before passage by the House.

1475-> INQUIRY CHARGES PAYOFFS TO POLICE ON THE EAST SIDE
The commission investigating allegations of police corruption here reported yesterday that large numbers of East Side busi nesses systematically bribed the police and that there was reason to believe that some supervising sergeants were either taking payoffs them selves or covering them uo. In a second development, At torney General John N. Mitch ell announced in Washington that the Justice Department would give the commission $215,037 grant to continue its investigation for an extra six months, until June 30, 1971. The statement indicating widespread corruption in one part of the city was the first general comment about the ex tent of the problem made by the commission since it was formed last May. The accusation was contained in an affidavit filed in State Supreme Court by Michael F. Armstrong, the commission's counsel, in response to a move by six sergeants and two cap tains to block the efforts of the commission to question them about their work and their per sonal finances. Mr. Armstrong said the com mission had been conducting field investigations in various parts of the city, including the 19th Precinct, an area running from 59th to 85th Street and from the East River to Fifth Avenue. “As a result of this investi gation,” Mr. Armstrong said, “the commission has uncovered information which indicates that a large number of business establishments located in the 19th Precinct have been making systematic payments of sums of money to various police officers assigned to that precinct in order to influence those officers in the perform ance of their official duties. “Moreover, the commission, through its investigation, has direct observations which indi cate a pattern of conduct among the sergeants in the 19th Precinct highly suspicious and susceptible without explanation of the conclusion that these petitioners [the sergeants] have knowledge of, and may have participated in the acceptance of these systematic payments or have knowledge of them and failed to report such activities to the appropriate authorities.” The men who have been called to testify in closed ses sion before the commission are six of the 20 sergeants as signed to the 19th Precinct. the commanding officer of the precinct, Capt. Walter I. Rick ard, and Capt. Walter M. Schmucker, who was the tem porary commander of the pre cinct on the evening the ser geants were subpoenaed. In addition to being ordered to testify, each of the men was ordered to produce all docu ments relating to his police work and “'all personal and nonpersonal copies of Federal and New York State tax re burns for 1967, 1968 and 1969; ail bank statements, bankbooks, receipts, deposit slips for 1967, 1968 and 1969, and all records of brokerage accounts, deposit slips and statements for 1967, 1968 1969.” The men were further asked to fill in a detailed seven‐page financial questionaire, covering the last three years, which in cluded one question on how much each had spent on cos metics, laundry and tailoring. Jay Gold, Robert J. Mc Guire and former Deputy Po lice Commissioner Sylvester J. Garamella. lawyers for the six sergeants and two captains, all argued in their motions to quash the commission's sub poenas that their clients were faced with the unconstitutional choice of complying with the orders and subjecting them selves to possible job forfeiture or waiving their constitutional The policemen were support ed in their argument by briefs filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union and lawyers for the Patrolmen's Benevolent As sociation, Philips, Nizer, Benja min, Krim & Ballon. Mr. Armstrong and Corpora tion Counsel J. Lee Rankin sub mitted briefs opposing the mo tions to quash the subpoenas. Mr. Armstrong argued that the contention that the commis sion was forcing the policemen to either waive their privilege against self‐incrimination or lose their jobs was “without’ substance” because the com mission had no power to disci pline them. Because the lawyers for the, eight policemen wanted to file, additional arguments in re sponse to Mr. Armstrong's brief, oral argument, the case was rescheduled for Dec. 15. The six sergeants subpoened by the commission were Rich and Bowes, Joseph Caravello, Frank Direnzo, Charles Lun quanti, Edward Fahy and Frank E. Glynn. In announcing the Federal grant to the commission, head ed by Whitman Knapp, a Wall Street lawyer, Attorney Gen eral Mitchell said the funds would be used to investigate “the nature and extent of the relationship between organized crime and police corruption, the effects of police corruption on the community and commu nity attitudes toward the po lice and will create a public awareness of the corruption Though the commission now has the money needed to fi nance its investigation for an additional six months, it will have to seek an extension of its subpoena powers, which ex pire on Dec. 31. Though neither City Council President Sanford D. Garelik nor Democratic Majority lead er Thomas J. Cuite would com ment, City Council sources in dicated that if Mayor Lindsay requested an extension of the commission's power, it prob ably would be granted by the Council.

1476-> BRAZIL AIDE SAYS TORTURE IS USED
RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 3 (AP)—A Cabinet minister has acknowledged the use of tor ture in Brazilian jails. It was the first such admission by a member of the Government. Education Minister Jarbas Passarinho, speaking on a no Paulo television program Tues day night, said that to deny that torture had been used in Brazilian jails would be untrue. He added, however, that it was not true to say there was a systematic policy of torture. There have been recurrent reports of torture in Brazilian jails over the last two years, but high‐ranking officials had denied the charges. In a military‐court session yesterday, a university student charged with terrorist activities testified that he had been tor tured. The student, Ottoni Gui marāes Fernandes Jr., who is 24 years old, said: “I was tied with a rope. They applied elec tric shocks to my mouth, ears, nostrils, face and even my eyes. I was tortured for 36 hours and had two ribs broken.” He is charged with belong ing to the outlawed National Liberating Action, an urban guerrilla group, and with partic ipating in a bank holdup in which a security guard was killed. The prosecution is ask ing for the death penalty. The National Liberating Ac tion was one of two groups involved in the kidnapping last June of the West German Am bassador to Brazil, Ehrenfried von Holleben. He was later freed by the kidnappers. Mr. Fernandes said he was arrested Aug. 23 and was taken to a house on the outskirts of Rio, where he was beaten. Later, he said, he was tortured in a room in the Navy Ministry and in a military police station, both in Rio. “I was tied and hung upside down,” he said. “Water was poured into my nose, almost killing me. They laughed at me and asked if I was hungry or thirsty.” He described a torture called “the hangman's Russian rou lette.” “They put a rope on my neck,” he said. “The end of the rope was thrown over beam. They made me climb on a stool. They kicked the stool, and when I was almost dying they released me.”

1477-> NIXON CRITICIZED ON MINE SAFETY
WASHINGTON, July 25—The Nixon Administration was charged today with “calculated Indifference” to the “unneces sary and avoidable” hazards of life in the nation's coal mines. The Administration's han dling of the four‐month‐old Federal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 was described as “atrocious” and “despicable” in a 690‐page report prepared over an 18‐month period and released here today by a team of graduate student researchers. The researchers were spon sored in part and guided by Ralph Nader, the consumer and safety advocate, who endorsed their report. J. Devitt McAteer, a 26‐year‐ old graduate of the University of West Virginia Law School who headed the seven‐man re search team, stood next to Mr. Nader at a news conference this morning at the Mayflower Hotel. Mr. McAteer said that after all the furor over mine safety that followed the last major mine digester in November of 1968, “the question is whether or not the miners chances of survival have been appreciably improved, and we think that they have not.” Coal mine accidents have taken more than 100 lives so far this year. The report, which one Gov ernment mine safety official called probably the most ex haustive research document ever assembled on the subject, parceled out the blame widely for the “incomprehensible, in excusable” working conditions in the coal industry. The masses of charts and tables and more than 1,000 in terviews with miners, mine operators, Government officials and union leaders focused on West Virginia, the leading coal producing state. But Mr. McAteer contended that his team's findings were indicative of coal mining nationally. He noted that West Virginia mines had the highest accident rate. The report charged timidity, confusion and “sham” in much of the Federal and state safety enforcement activity in the mines. It also criticized Con gressional and state legislatures for setting work standards that it said were designed to reduce the added costs of safety pro visions for the mine owners. The report reserved its largest criticism, however, for the 110, 000 member United Mine Workers of America for its al leged failure to adopt an “ad versary posture” in demanding the enforcement of mine safety regulations. Mr. McAteer assailed indus try leaders for “an attitude that production and profit must be maximized at the expense of safety.” The report said that 14 of West Virginia's largest coal producing counties, in which 44 per cent of the land is owned by coal interests, were assessing coal lands for tax purposes at $44 an acre al though the coal alone might be worth up to $32,000 an acre. The report called for the resignation of Lewis Evans, director of the United Mine Workers' two‐man safety divi sion. The three U.M.W. districts in West Virginia, the report said, had reported total expenditures of $14 in 1968 for safety “edu cation and publicity” among the rank and file. Partly because of “a lack of union leadership,” the research ers said, “the majority of min ers have shown minimal in terest in working for improved safety and health conditions.” “They have remained apath etic and silent in the face of the failures of the companies, their union, the state and Fed eral legislators, the research ers said. Mr. McAteer said that he might have revised this lan guage had he known that thous ands of miners in Ohio, Penn sylvania, West Virginia, Vir ginia and Kentucky would stage a series of disruptive wildcat strikes this summer to protest the lack of militant safety enforcement in the mines and to express grievances against their union. Mr. McCateer's report also urged the following: ¶A liberalization of work men's compensation awards to the disabled and to widows that would “make accidents more expensive than the cost of safety” and thus motivate re forms. ¶An end to the $53‐million‐a year Federally financed research program to promote coal pro duction and sales and using the money to develop safety tech nology. ¶A sweeping reassessment of undertaxed coal lands and a 50‐cent‐a‐ton extraction tax on coal. Mr. McCateer's research group was not formally abong “Nader's Raiders,” based in Washington under Mr. Nader's direction. But the two groups cooperated closely.

1478-> MISTRIAL CALLED IN TACOMA CASE
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 10— United States District Judge George H. Boldt declared mistrial today on the ground that six of the seven defendants in a conspiracy trial had prejudiced the jury against themselves by misbehavior. He acted after the six had refused to enter the courtroom when asked to do so by their attorneys and the bailiff. They said that they were resisting appearing. because they wanted more spectators to be allowed into the courtroom. The judge then went to the defendants’ conference room and ordered the six to appear. The noisy disturbance that fol lowed as the defendants re turned to the courtroom was cited by the judge when he de clared the mistrial. The judge termed the inci dent “one of the most degrad ing and outrageous examples of contempt of court that I have ever heard of or read about.” He dismissed the jury and recessed court until 9:30 A.M. Monday, when show‐cause hearings on the contempts charges are expected to be heard. Defendants’ Room Locked At 9:45 A.M. today the judge instructed the bailiff to order the defendants to appear imme diately. The bailiff returned and said that the defendants’ room was locked. Judge Boldt stood up and said, “I shall go. Everyone but defense attorneys remain in this courtroom. Defense attor neys, attend with me. The judge, followed by the attorneys, strode from the courtroom. One defendant, Charles C. Marshall, began addressing the spectators and the jury. He said that the delay had been ‘caused by concern that more spectators had not been allowed inside the building. Then the judge entered, or dered Mr. Marshall to be silent and dismissed the jury. He then spoke for five minutes. “In my considered judgment, each of the defendants will be cited for contempt,” he said. “A hearing will be held at the earliest possible time.” Then at 10 A.M., the judge declared a mistrial, stating that a “substantial part of the hall ‐ way disturbance must have been noted by the jury.” He added: “I have grave doubts that the trial can continue with the jury unprejudiced . . . In the interest of justice, I delcare mistrial.”

BURGOS, Spain, Dec. 10 (AP) —Violence broke out in Madrid and Granada today as a court martial deliberated behind closed doors in Burgos on the fate of 15 Basques accused of murder, terrorism or rebellion. In Madrid about 300 demon srtators battled with the police, smashed shop windows and halted traffic. A patrol car was overturned and a policeman was reported seriously injured before the demonstrators dis persed. Demonstrators in Granada smashed the windows of a bank and threw a gasoline bomb that did not explode. Clandestine pamphlets were circulated call ing for strikes and demonstra tions. Burgos was quiet, with a heavy army guard on the town, but no trouble was expected.’ The place where Generalissimo Francisco Franco was pro claimed El Caudillo, the leader, it is considered a pro‐Govern ment town.

The demands included an end to R.O.T.C. and was research on campus, the dis missal of three administration officials, equal faculty‐student power on departmental com mittees, recruitment of blacks until they constitute 23 per cent of all students and “the repeal of all university rules which have a ‘chilling’ effect on free speech.”

1482-> TRIAL OF BASQUES STARTS IN BURGOS
BURGOS, Spain, Dec. 3—The ornate, heavily guarded trial room of the Sixth Military Dis trict here was the quiet center of a political storm today as Spain began the court‐martial of 15 Basques. The Basques are accused in the murder of a provincial head of the Political Police, and their case has become a symbol of the continuing struggle be tween the Basque ethnic group and the central Government in Madrid. There have been wide spread protests and petitions against the trial, in particular against the use of a military tribunal, from whose sentence there is no appeal. The northern provinces of Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya were jammed with police reinforce ments that rolled in throughout the night. Perhaps 100,000 workers in Bilbao, San Sebas tián and a dozen smaller towns were on strike to protest the court‐martial. A number of clashes, none especially serious, took place during the day. Tonight there were reports of a large dem onstration in the industrial sec tion of San Sebastián and of smaller demonstrations in Bar celona, Valencia and Seville. As the trial opened the Gov ernment continued its search for the honorary consul of West Germany in San Sebastián, Eugen Beihl, who was kid napped Tuesday. It is believed that the men who seized the 69‐year‐old businessman at his home are part of an activist movement seeking independ ence for the Basques. The West German consul in Bordeaux, Christian Sell, has met with Basque exile groups in, St.‐Jean‐de‐Luz, just across the French border, notably with Telesforo de Monzon, an exile leader who has reportedly been suggested as an intermediary. The leaders of E.T.A., a guer rilla group that has been the target of a long government campaign, have shown signs of strongly disapproving the kid napping. According to Basques who have been in touch with the leaders, some of whom are in France, they take the view that it may increase the chances that death sentences will be imposed on the six de fendants who are accused of direct involvement in the kill ing. How strong a line the Gov ernment of Generalissimo Fran cesco Franco would take was not clear. The press has been allowed to give full coverage to both the kidnapping and the court‐martial, and some ob servers viewed that as evidence that the public was being pre pared for strong measures. A Cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow, and there was speculation that it might decide to impose a state of emergency. A proclamation by the Civil Governor of GuipUzcoa today strongly hinted at such a course if the ferment continued. Meanwhile, in Burgos, a cold. austere Castilan city that was General Franco's headquarters during the Civil war and is second to no other city in Spain in its loyalty to the Caudillo and its abhorrence of Basques, liberals and other troublemakers, strong security measures were taken. The 120 members of the pub lic and the 30 or so journalists allowed in the courtroom were searched. During recesses they were kept in a courtyard guard ed by soldiers with submachine guns. The 16 prisoners—it has been recommended that one of them, Maria Aranzazu, be set free and there is no charge against her —sat handcuffed in pairs fac ing the military judges. Twenty‐six gray‐helemeted po licemen stood behind them. The defendants are accused of being active members or ad herents of E.T.A. — the initials stand for the Basque words “Basque nation and liberty” — and of carrying out a number, of bombings, bank robberies and the distribution of clan destine propaganda. Of the six accused of planning the kill ing of the police inspector, Me liton Manzanas, two and a half years ago, one, Francisco Izco, is charged with the actual shooting. The defense lawyers asked the presiding judge, Col. Man uel Ordovas, a cavalry officer and former member of an Olym pic riding team, to have the, handcuffs removed. The colon el, a gray‐haired man with a thin mustache, asked the lieu tenant of the court guard if he could guarantee security if the prisoners’ hands were free. He replied in the negative, but they were loosened. The first day was taken up with the reading of the first part of a 30,000‐word sum mary of an investigating offi cer's report. The choice of Burgos to try an organization that is an ex treme but not totally unrepre sentative manifestation of Bas que nationalism was appropri ate in a way. From the Basque point of view, at least, Castille and the authoritarian Castilan spirit have been trying them and finding them guilty for years. The Basques, who live in the green hills and smoky towns quite differently from other Spaniards, are independent, passionately democratic and de voted to choir singing, strenu ous exercise, the sea and their peculiar and difficult language.

1484-> Solzhenitsyn Hailed Despite Absence At Presentation of 1970 Nobel. Awards
STOCKHOLM, Dec. 10—The Nobel Prizes for 1970 were for mally presented today, and along with the royalty and the rows of ,stiff shirts there was drama. It was the drama of the ab sent figure: Aleksandr I. Sol zhenitsyn, the Soviet writer who won the prize .for litera ture. He stayed away from the ceremony because he feared that if he left the Soviet Union he would not be allowed to return. Seven other 1970 laureates were in the Stockholm Concert Hall this afternoon, in white tie like the audience. Each heard a Swedish academician praise his work; then each re ceived his gold medal and di ploma from King Gustav VI Adolf. But when it came time for the literature award, there was only the speech in praise of the winner. It was by Dr. Karl Ragnar Gierow, Permanent Sec retary of the Swedish Academy. Speaker Quotes From Pravda “Solzhenitsyn is of the in comparable Russian tradition,” Dr. Gierow said “The same background underlies the gi gantic predecessors who have derived from Russia's suffering the compelling strength and in extinguishable love that perme ates their work.” With irony, Dr. Gierow drew on Pravda for his one quotation from critical appraisal of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's work. The quote was from a Pravda review of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's first novel, “A Day in the Life of Ivan Densiovich,” published in 1962, when Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was leading the Soviet Union through a period of de‐Stalinization. Mr. Khru shchev is said to have inter vened to have assured publica tion of the novel, which tells of life in a prison camp during the Stalin period. “Why is it that our heart contracts with pain as we read this remarkable story at the same time as we feel our spirit soar?” the Pravda review said. “The explanation lies in its pro found humanity, in the quality of mankind even in the hour of degradation.” Since then, a ban on publi cations criticizing Stalin's rule of terror has brought Mr. Sol zhenitsyn under severe attack. Neither of his last two novels, “Cancer Ward” and “The First Circle,” has been published in the Soviet Union. But copies were spirited out of the coun try and published to critical praise abroad. Typewritten manuscripts of the novels have circulated widely in the Soviet Union in what is called the samizdat, or hand‐to‐hand press. Last year the author. was ex pelled from the Soviet writers’ union, and at the award of the Nobel Prize this October he was savaged in the Soviet press. At first Mr. Solzhenitsyn said he would go to Stockholm to accept the prize in person. But then, two weeks ago, he wrote to the Swedish Academy saying that he would be un able to appear. He said: “The hostile attitude toward my prize, as expressed in the press of my country and the fact that my books are still suppressed—for reading them, people are dismissed from work or expelled from school—com pel me to assume that my trip to Stockholm will be used to cut me off from my native land, simply to prevent me from returning home.” A Coda in English Dr. Gierow, at the end of his prepared address in Swed ish, delivered an unscheduled I coda in English. “The Swedish Academy re grets the reason why Alek sandr Solzhenitsyn has deemed it impossible to be with us to day.” He said “in accordance with his own wish, the prize will be awarded at a place and a time to be agreed upon.” Led by , the King, the audience then stood and loudly applauded the man who was not there. • In any event, the authorities could not have arranged a more dramatic demonstration of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's hold • on the creative imagination of the world than by discouraging him from going to the cere mony. This point was made in the closing speech by Prof. Arne Tiselius, the Nobel lau reate in chemistry for 1948, who addressed the Nobel ban quet in the City Hall. “We • sincerely regret that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn could not be with us tonight,” Pro fessor Tiselius said at the end of his speech. “We appreciate, however, the motives which have prompted him not to at tend. The homage just ren dered is, if anything, reinforced by his absence.” Anniversary of Nobel Death The Nobel formalities, with the presentations in the after noon followed by the dinner, always take place on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel in 1896. The Swedish munitions inventor and manufacturer left a fund for prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, litera ture and peace. The peace prize, which is awarded separately in Oslo by a five‐member Nobel Commit tee appointed by the Norwegian Parliament, went this year to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug of the United States, for his research ‘ on improved grains. The other prize winners are chosen by the Swedish Academy, along with a Nobel Prize in Economics established in 1968 by the Cen tral Bank of Sweden to honor Nobel. Each prize carries an award equivalent to $78,000. Those who were honored here today were as follows: In physics, Prof. Louis Neel of the University of Grenoble and Prof. Hannes Alfven, Swedish physicist now at the University, of California in San Diego. • In chemistry, Prof. Luis Le loir, a French‐born Argentine citizen who teaches at the In stitute for Biochemical Re search in Buenos Aires. In medicine, three Men shared the prize for research on nerve transmission: Dr. Julius Axelrod of the National Institute of Mental ‘Health in Bethesda, Md.; Prof. Ulf von Euler, of the Royal Caroline Institute in Stockholm, and Sir Bernard Katz, a German‐born biophysi cist who is a professor at Uni versity College, London. In economics, Prof. Paul A. Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pro fessor Samuelson was praised for doing more than any other contemporary economist “to raise the level of scientific an alysis in economic theory.” At the dinner, Professor Gierow read a message that he said had been received from Mr. Solzhenitsyn. The writer said that he knew his “involuntary absence” would not “darken the fullness of today's ceremony.” He added that today was. Human Rights Day and urged everyone par ticipating in the ceremony to “see in this a symbol.” , . Population’ Control Urged OSLO, Norway, Dec. 10 (AP) —Accepting the • Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Borlaug said that only population control could win the battle of hunger in the world. “It is true that the tide of battle against bunger has changed for the better during the past three years,” he told King Olav and other members of the audience. “But tides have a way of flowing and then ebbing again,” he said. “We may be at high tide now, but ebb tide could soon set in if we become com placent and relax our efforts. For we are dealing with two opposing forces, the scientific power of food production and the biological power of human reproduction.” Dr. Borlaug noted that science, technology and inven tion had provided methods for increasing food supplies “sub stantially and sometimes spec tacularly.” “Man also has acquired the means to reduce the rate of human production effectively and humanely,” he added. “He is using his powers for in creasing the rate and ‘amount of food production.” But Dr. Borlaug said that the rate of population growth still exceeded the increase of food production in some areas. “There can be no permanent progress in the battle against hunger until the agencies that fight for increased food pro duction and those that fight for population control unite in a common effort,” he declared.

1486-> F.L. DUPONT SETS A MAJOR MERGER
Francis I. duPont & Co., one of the nation's largest broker age firms, disclosed plans yes terday to merge with Glore Forgan Staats, Inc., a major in vestment banking house, in one of the largest consolidations in Wall Street history. After the merger takes effect July 1, the general brokerage business of the combined firms will operate under the name F. I. duPont, Glore Forgan & Co., which will be the largest partnership on Wall Street. In vestment banking activities will be conducted through a wholly owned corporate subsidiary, DuPont Glore Forgan, Inc. The duPont firm has been one of the securities industry's most troubled major houses. It ran a deficit of $7.7‐million, be fore tax recoveries, in 1969 and is understood to have remained in the red this year. “This is not a distress merg er,” said Archie E. Albright, president of Glore Forgan. “It's just a reflection of the eco nomic facts of 1970.” Mr. Albright, who will be come chairman of the executive committee of the new firm, noted that the entire industry had “overbuilt capacity” prior to the recent 18‐month bear market and one result was sub stantially higher fixed costs. “There's just so much you can do in the way of firing help to close the overcapacity and expense gaps,” he said. “We are taking two major rev enue structures and putting them on top of one operational and administrative structure.” DuPont recently had capital funds of $62.5‐million, while Glore Forgan's capital was about $19‐million. The duPont distribution network has 95 branch offices around the coun try. Glore Forgan has 20 branches, many of them in Cal ifornia. Eleven of its branches are in cities where duPont also has branches. A high‐level source involved in the merger said some of these offices no doubt would be consolidated, but no decisions had been made on in dividual closings. Mr. Albright said the merger “ought to result in a very prof itable franchise.” Other Wall Street sources outside the two firms described the consolida tion as a “natural,” inasmuch as Glore Forgan is a leading underwriter with a slim distri bution system, whereas duPont has one of the largest retail networks in the industry but is not big in investment banking. Only Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and Bache & Co. are larger In terms of branch‐office structure. They will still be larger after the merger, both in terms of capital and branches. The new management struc ture of the merged firm will be dominated by men from duPont, but Mr. Albright's position will be one of the two most im portant. The executive commit tee, of which he will be chair man, will take the place of the office of the managing partner set‐up by duPont. Wallace C. Latour, formerly senior managing partner of du Pont, will become managing di rector of the new partnership. A board of directing partners will be headed by Edmund du Pont, chairman, and J. Russell Forgan, honorary cnairman. Mr. Albright also will remain president of the Investment banking subsidiary and will take on administrative duties in the areas of finance, opera tions and controls at the parent firm level. Mr. Latour will run the sales and market ing operation. In addition to Mr. Albright, the executive committee will be made up of Mr. Latour, Samuel A. Gay, Edwin B. Peterson and Thomas W. Thompson, all of du Pont, and James H. Lynch of Glore For gan. Mr. duPont will head the finance committee, whose other members will be Mr. Albright and Mr. Latour, as well as John W. Allyn, Milton A. Speicher and Gough W. Thomp son Jr. of duPont and Charles J. Hodge, who has been chair man of Glare Forgan's executive committee. “This merger is a natural and exciting development,” said Mr. duPont, “because it creates a brand new force in our business by combining the un excelled distributive capacities of the duPont branch system with the outstanding investment banking capabilities of Glare Forgan. This is what I would call a true case of synergism in which the resulting entity should add up to a lot more than the sum of the parts.”

1487-> NICKLAUS, HINSON TIE FOR 2D PLACE
HARRISON, N. Y., Aug. 2—A driver he was using disintegrated as he swung at the fourth hole today but Bruce Crampton's golf game remained solid and intact and he won the Westchester Classic by stroke with a 72‐hole aggregate of 273. A final round of 67, fiveunder‐par, in an exciting finish over the Westchester Country Club's 6,700‐yard West Course as 20,000 spectators roamed over the hilly terrain, enabled the 34‐year‐old Australian to win the $50,000 first prize. The last minute in this $250,000 event was replete with thrills as Jack Nicklaus, the British Open champion, and Larry Hinson, a slim 25‐year‐old player from Douglas, Ga., continued spectacular bids. Each holed an eagle putt at the last green for a secondplace tie at 274. Hospitals Receive $300,000 It was a big day for golf, for charity and for Crampton. The officials announced that $300,000 was going to the six Westchester hospitals that are the beneficiaries of the touraments proceeds. Crampton's check was the biggest of any he has earned In competing over American courses for the last 13 years. It advanced him, for the third, year, over the the $100,000’ class at $107,775 and made him the second foreigner to win over $500,000 in this country during his career. The curly haired native of Sydney, who had begun the round today in a tie for the lead with Nicklaus and Hinson, has won $538,862 here. Gary Player of South Africa exceeds him with approximately $681, 989. It was Crampton's ninth success in tournaments on the circuit, his most recent before today being in the 1969 Hawaiian open. There was also a tie for fourth place between Ray Floyd, the Professional Golfers’ Association champion, and Jerry Heard of Visalia, Calif., at 277. Each received $11,000, more than Heard made in 1969, his first full year on the tour. Another stroke back in a group of seven was Frank Beard, the tourney winner last year. The others were Tom Weiskopf, who turned in the day's low score with a 65, Arnold Palmer, Phil Rodgers, Tommy Aaron. Dave Hill and John Schroeder. Crampton had broken away from Nicklaus and Hinson, who each had a 68 for the round, by the time they had completed nine holes. The Australian enjoyed a twostroke edge over Hinson and 4 shots over Nicklaus at the 63‐hole mark. Nicklaus had begun with bogeys at the first two holes and needed 37 strokes going out. Hinson, whose left arm is undersized because of polio, took 35 strokes and Crampton 33. There were several reports of what happened to Crampton, who was parred with Dave Hill, on the tee at the 430‐yard fourth hole. The shaft of his driver apparently broke near his hands as he swung and the pieces barely missed Hill. Broken Driver Not Needed But Crampton demonstrated he didn't need that driver after all, so well did he maneuver the ball to the greens and around the putting surfaces. A downhill, 20‐foot putt dropped at the 10th and Crampton was now 14 under par. Back of him, in the final pair were Hinson and Nicklaus. Hinson, surprising the followers by walloping the ball in pace with Nicklaus, added to the excitement by chipping in for an eagle 3 from the edge of the 12th green, a par‐5 hole of 500 yards. That put him 13 under par and partly offset a bogey at the previous hole. Then after a string of five pars, he capped his bid with a 10foot putt for another eagle 3 at the 538‐yard 18th, which put the crowd in an uproar. Nicklaus, who won here in 1967, rallied on the back nine with a 31 that included three birdies in a row beginning at the 10th hole. He was 13 under, also, after getting a birdie at the uphill 12th where his putt for an eagle was short by less than six inches. Bunkered for a bogey at the 16th, Nicklaus, recouped by running in his 20foot eagle‐putt for a 3 at the home hole. Crampton's edge came with birdies on the 16th and 17th after carding his only bogey in two rounds at the 15th hole. He chipped in for a deuce at the 16th from 18 feet from the apron of the green. He followed this by putting in from off the edge of the putting surface for a birdie at the 17th from 20 feet. Crampton, with his red shirt and red checkered slacks had been mopping his brow with towel during strokes as he trudged over the course on this hot, humid afternoon. But he seemed cool and relaxed as he embraced his wife and 2‐year‐old son, Joy,

1488-> JURY‐TRIAL RULE LIMITED BY STATE
ALBANY, July 2 — The State Court of Appeals ruled today that a recent United States Supreme Court decision guaranteeing the right to a jury trial to persons accused of crimes punishable by more than six months in prison does not apply to trials begun before the decision was handed down on June 22. At the same time, the state's highest court rejected a bid by District Attorney Frank S. Hogan of Manhattan for a rul ing that would, in effect, de prive the Criminal Court of the right to send a man to jail for more than six months. Such ruling would have enabled the court to continue its practice of nonjury trials in all cases. Today's decision stemmed from the Supreme Court ruling last month in the case of Bald win v. New York. In written argument in the state court against retroactive application of the Baldwin de cision, Mr. Hogan warned, “Drastic disruption of the ad ministration of justice would flow from applying the new ruling to cases already tried.” He said that thousands of cases involving defendants already tried but not sentenced might have to be thrown out. Jury Facilities Lacking The Criminal Court has never held jury trials, even though its jurisdiction includes all defend ants facing up to a year in jail, and the court has no facili ties for juries. As. a temporary solution until the Legislature acts to deal with the problem, possibly by de creasing the maximum jail term for misdeameanors, the Court of Appeals authorized the use of six‐man juries from jury lists of the State Supreme Court. Chief Justice Stanley H. Fuld was the only dissenter from the six‐member majority opinion that held that the jury‐trial provisions of the Baldwin case did not apply prior to June 22. He said the ruling should be retroactive. Since the Baldwin decision, the Criminal Court has been adjourning all cases in which the defendant requested a jury trial. Continuation of this pro cedure threatens defendants’ right to a speedy trial, some court officials feel. In New York today, Presiding Justice Harold A. Stevens of the First Department of the Appel late Division of State Supreme Court said he would confer on Monday with Presiding Justice Marcus G. Christ of the Second Department on new rules to cope with the situation. He said the new rules would probably be announced on Monday or Tuesday.

1489-> HONOR AMERICA DAY COST NATION $68,770
WASHINGTON, July 10 (UPI) —The big pro‐America rally here July 4 cost taxpayers $68,710, about $14,000 less than November's antiwar demonstration, the National Park Service said today. Figures show that $37,000 of the total July 4 cost went to pay for police for the rally, which drew an estimated 350,000 persons at the Washington Monument By comparison, the service said it cost $83,450 to handle an estimated 250,000 persons during, the November demonstration. Of that, $50,800 was for Police. Floyd Hough, a Park Service auditor, said that since about $46,000 is covered in the budget for the annual July 4 fireworks display here—several public agencies share the cost of the fireworks—the National Park Service had to dip into its contingency reserves for the other $22,000.

1490-> Letter About Army Costs a Recruiter His Air Force Post
MERIDEN, Conn., June 4 (AP)—An Air Force recruiting sergeant who described the Air Force as “virtually noncombat ant” and called Army draftees cannon fodder has been re lieved of his duties here. “Did you know that the vast majority of the U. S. forces killed in Southeast Asia have been draftees?” Tech Sgt. Rob ert W. Knapp wrote in a re cruiting letter. “Wouldn't you rather take advantage of the opportunity to join the branch of service that has lost the least amount of men in Southeast Asia as op posed to being drafted into the branch of service that has lost the most?” the letter continued. “Are you willing to take this gamble with your life or would you rather go into a branch of service that will train you to be a better citizen, a service that is virtually noncombat ant?” His letter, which was re ceived by 14 young men in the Meriden area, concluded: “If you don't like what I have to say, then you can still take the draft. But at least it won't both er me so bad if I read about you in the obituary column.” The letter was made public by The Meriden Morning Rec ord, which quoted an Air Force information officer, Col. John Keeler, as saying, “The letter was all Knapp's own doing.” “Such letters are not Air Force policy and it certainly is not and will not he condoned by the Air Force,” Colonel Keeler said. The Morning Record also said that Brig. Gen. William Mc Laughlin, chief of recruiting for the Air Force, has sent a letter of apology to his counterpart in the Army. Sergeant Knapp said today that the letter was his own idea. He declined to comment on the wording of the letter but generally compared recruiting among branches of the armed forces to that of “big corpora tions.” “They all want to attract people, but they have different ways of doing it,” he said.
